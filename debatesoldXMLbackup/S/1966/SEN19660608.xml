      <P>It is proposed to take No. 1 on the Order Paper.  I should like to inform the House that it is anticipated that the Electricity (Special Provisions) Bill, 1966, will be received from the Dáil at about 4.30 p.m.  It is proposed that on receipt of the Bill an Order be made to enable the Seanad to consider it forthwith and that a Motion to bring the proceedings to a conclusion by 9.30 p.m. will also be moved.  On the passage of the Bill an Earlier Signature Motion will be put to the House for approval.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 9, to delete lines 49 to 54 inclusive.</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes to delete the waiting period of three days in respect of payment of injury benefit. The Minister in speaking on the Second Stage had a good deal to say about the International Labour Office Conventions and the desirability of our being in conformity with them.  He, indeed, chided the majority of the commission for having made recommendations as regards the amount of benefit which were not in accord with the International Labour Office view in this matter, and he certainly had a point there which he was entitled to make.  The view of the International Labour Office on this matter is as follows, quoted in paragraph 167 of the Majority Report of the Commission:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea of a waiting period seems to be in contradiction with the principle of occupational risk, which requires that compensation should begin from the moment when the loss occurs, that is, the loss of earnings owing to incapacity.  A large number of schemes contain this provision with a view to discouraging malingerers by making them bear the loss of earnings due to slight accidents.  The <Col N="734" /> provision is also designed to reduce the burden that employers would otherwise have to bear on account of the many small accidents that do not really cause serious loss.  There is room for considerable doubt as to whether the waiting period is really effective in preventing abuses.</P>
    <P>It must be said that the Majority Report did not, despite that view, recommend that the waiting period be abolished, but social thought evolves as time goes on, and for the reasons which the Minister tried to explain away we have had a number of delays since these recommendations were made.  It is now over four years since the report was presented to the Minister, and it seems to me that this matter could now be further considered. Though the Majority Report did not at that time consider that the waiting period should go, despite the International Labour Office view, it is something which the House should consider now with the general evolution of social thought in regard to this and other matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the amendment.  The Labour Party have always held that this three days waiting period is wrong and causes great hardship to those affected by it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. K. Boland) Kevin Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. K. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained in the Dáil the idea behind this is to discourage trivial claims and to prevent the limited amount of money available being frittered away on trivial claims. Unlike other social welfare schemes, it is proposed in the case of occupapational injury where the effect of the injury lasts for a period of two weeks or more to pay for these three first days.  Since this is becoming part of the Social Welfare system, I think that this can be considered, from the point of view of the workers, quite an advance on the present system.  It is true that the official view of the International Labour Office is as quoted by Senator FitzGerald, and the majority of the countries would be in favour of not having this waiting days provision, but it is not contrary to the Convention to have it.  It is provided that where a <Col N="735" /> waiting days provision is in operation it may be retained without contravening the Convention.</P>
      <P>This is purely a question of the amount of money that is involved. Three days out of work, when it does not extend to any considerable period, is not a considerable hardship on anybody to have to undergo.  We are providing here that if the period in which the worker is affected by this industrial injury becomes extended we go back and pay for the first three days.  As I say, that is a considerable advance.  It is the only one of the social insurance services in which that is done.  I suggested in the Dáil, it would be better tactics to accept this advance in this respect of social insurance and aim to bring the other social services up to that standard first before we consider the question of paying for the first days of incapacity or unemployment, as the case may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that this is an advance on the arrangement in regard to other social benefits at the moment but I was horrified to hear him say that he did not regard the three days waiting period as a great hardship.  The people involved in those benefits are largely manual workers.  The ordinary salaried worker in clerical employment is not subject to this sort of risk.  The majority of people involved in this would be manual workers, people working on machines and that sort of thing.  The loss of half a week's pay or three fifths of a week's pay is surely a terrible hardship on those people.  They are existing on £12, £14 or £15 a week.  When they lose three-fifths of that amount it is a very great hardship to themselves and their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These people have to spend every penny they get to feed their families and maintain a reasonable standard of living.  Surely it is a great hardship when, because of an accident, through no fault at all of their own, which arises out of their employment, they lose three days pay.  The Minister says they will have to wait.  They will not get benefit for the first three days. They have to sacrifice half a week's <Col N="736" /> pay.  This is certainly a very great hardship on those people.</P>
    <P>As I said, there is some advance in this matter but really the Minister could go the whole hog and do away with this three day waiting period.  We are dealing with occupational injuries that arise from something completely outside the control of the worker. There cannot be any question that the worker is simply not feeling well.  He is injured at work and he is out of work because of that.  I do not know about the cost involved.  If the cost is great it means in effect that the workers are losing a lot of money because of this three day waiting period.  I hope the Minister will think again and accept this amendment.  It might be a slip of his tongue to think there is not any great hardship involved. We all make those slips but I hope the Minister will appreciate that there is a great hardship involved here.  I hope there is a possibility of this new piece of legislation doing away with this three day waiting period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Murphy on that.  It is disturbing to hear somebody make such an unrealistic statement as that there is no great hardship involved in losing three days pay.  It might be true of the Minister; it might be true of me or anybody else in this House but there are many workers of whom it is not true.  I do not agree with Senator Murphy that this is an advance.  We are merely taking what is already there.  There are so many ways in this Bill in which we are going backwards that I suppose we should breathe a sigh of relief that things are not getting any worse but there is certainly no progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are certainly not going any further in this matter.  This is another way in which the Minister makes reference to the fact that he is not making any extension here because he has to keep in line with our social welfare code.  Our existing social welfare code is completely out of date. Again and again the Minister has told us he cannot do this, that and the other because it would introduce a <Col N="737" /> precedent in relation to the social welfare code.  This is going backwards because our social welfare code has not gone forward throughout the years. It is a fundamental mistake to hear the Minister saying simply that to bring this into the social welfare code would create a precedent.  He should decide what is the best scheme of workmen's compensation and he should then decide to bring it into the social welfare code.  Instead of that he adopts this attitude.  He is, in fact, going backwards with regard to this matter.  He is certainly not going forward.</P>
    <P>This is certainly an example again of where our social welfare code is completely out of date and unsatisfactory in so many respects.  Had we reformed our social welfare code first, then it might have been worth bringing this into it.  This is a fundamental thing which involves the worker who is injured during his employment.  We are certainly going backwards in bringing this into a social welfare code which is itself out of date.  This is once again an example of this mistake.  This is once again an example of the doctrinaire attitude of the Minister.  He has made his mind up and he will certainly not change it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In subsection (3) (a), page 10, lines 11 and 12, to delete all words after &ldquo;dependant&mdash;&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;for any period during which the beneficiary is between the ages of 17 and 18&mdash;£5 1s. 3d.; and for any period during which the beneficiary is under the age of 17&mdash;£3 17s. 6d., and&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intention in all those amendments is very clear.  We ask for parity with the Northern Ireland scheme.  It is a pity, in a long-term scheme of this kind, that we should start one step behind the Northern Ireland and British benefits. At some stage we must stop pulling <Col N="738" /> up; we must get these benefits more in line with those in the other part of the country.  This would be a great step not only towards helping those concerned with the benefits but it would have a great effect on those looking to unity in this country.  The Minister might easily begin here to bring these benefits into line with those being paid in the northern part of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of these amendments in regard to cost is estimated at £100,000 and this, in conjunction with the other amendments proposed by Senators Miss Davidson and Murphy, would total an estimated £750,000 a year.  There are no proposals in the amendments to increase the contributions and, therefore, there are no proposals to finance these extra rates of payment.  Accordingly, the only source from which the extra cost would come would be the Exchequer. It would, in fact, cost approximately 6d. extra on the stamp if they were to be financed by way of increased contributions.</P>
      <P>I wish to point out that, while it is a fact that the rates of benefit in Britain are higher than here, it is also a fact that wages here are generally lower than in Britain.  In fact, a higher proportion of the average wages is being provided under this Bill than is being done in Britain.  In addition, the workman himself will make no contribution towards the scheme here while in Britain he has to pay five-twelfths of the cost.  Taking account of our circumstances, the rates of benefit proposed in the Bill are as much as it is feasible to provide at present.  They represent the rates recommended by the minority of the Commission, adjusted for increases in the cost of living that have taken place since then.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a long series of amendments.  I attempted, not necessarily successfully, to bring the principle involved right through the Bill.  The amendments are designed to introduce the principle of wage relationship of which I spoke on the Second Stage when I gave reasons in favour of maintaining this principle which exists in present legislation but which has become atrophied because the maximum compensation payable has been £4 10s. 0d&mdash;so low that no adult worker has had a wage of such a low level that this has taken effect. All wages have been above the limit in respect of which the £4 10s. 0d compensation is effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, this principle is in the existing legislation and has ceased to operate only because of the neglect of the Government in the past ten years to make any upward change in compensation during a period in which wages and industrial earnings generally have almost doubled.  The principle is there and it is one which <Col N="740" /> we should maintain because it is quite evidently and obviously undesirable that a man who is insured and loses his employment should during any period have his income cut back to a small fraction of its original level and that no attempt should be made to give him compensation at some decent proportion of his earnings.</P>
    <P>We can understand the desire to bring into the existing code the principle of dependency allowances. This seems to me to be reasonable.  It is a start and it is a complicated matter.  However, there is no reason whatever for not combining with the introduction of these dependency allowances the principle of wage relationship.  I see no reason why the position of workers over any period should be allowed to deteriorate.  The maximum benefit now is £4 10s. 0d. That figure, if it were to be brought upward in proportion to the change in industrial earnings since 1956, would need to be almost doubled.  The Minister proposes to provide for a single man maximum injury benefit of £5 15s. 0d a week.  I realise the Bill contains other provisions in relation to permanent incapacity and there are other provisions, many of them desirable, which we welcome and which should have been introduced long ago. I am concerned now with one particular point which the Minister has evaded so far in the examples he has given of ways in which this Bill improves the present system.  Undoubtedly, in respect of individuals the benefits under this Bill are better than the recommendation of the Majority Report in regard to certain individuals.  However, we must look at both sides of the case, particularly in relation to injury benefits where the most a single workman can get is £5 15s. 0d per week regardless of his earnings.</P>
    <P>That figure represents an increase compared with what the workman now gets.  However, it represents only an increase of £1 5s. 0d or barely 25 per cent in a period in which earnings have risen by almost 100 per cent.  I do not think this is defensible.  I agree that the introduction of dependency allowances is a good thing but I am <Col N="741" /> not 100 per cent satisfied with the method or the detail.  However, the Minister has made an honest effort to ensure the protection particularly of families who may be adversely affected by injury to the breadwinner, but the introduction of that principle is no reason for dropping the wage-relationship element in existing legislation.  The Minister has endeavoured to excuse his abolition of this desirable principle, running completely contrary to the practice of almost all countries in the world in this respect, on grounds which, to say the least, are inadequate. During the Second Stage, at volume 61, column 335 of the Official Report, he is reported as saying that the wage relationship is desirable.  He went on to say that it is not by any means impossible to have it but that there is a certain amount of difficulty attached to it.  Then he goes back to the same old refrain: &ldquo;I should prefer to consider this in the context of the whole of our social welfare code rather than in one isolated instance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Anybody reading that would think somebody was proposing to introduce a new principle of wage relationship into the social welfare code, whereas the Minister in this Bill is proposing to abolish the wage relationship system in relation to something which is not now part of the code, only because workmen's compensation must be made to fit into the existing social welfare code, no matter who gets hurt, just because a doctrinaire principle must be maintained at all costs.  He goes on to say:</P>
    <P>... I do not preclude the possibility of wage relation being introduced some future time when it appears to be feasible, working with the amount of money which I decided it would be reasonable to ask the economy to provide...</P>
    <P>These references to difficulty and lack of feasibility are unconvincing.  I think I have shown, by these amendments, that this change away from wage relationship is not a necessary element in this Bill.  There are no insuperable difficulties in maintaining the principle of wage relationship and although it has taken about ten different <Col N="742" /> amendments to maintain this principle in the Bill and although it is quite possible I may have overlooked something or that some of the amendments could be imperfectly drafted&mdash; I admit that&mdash;I think by introducing these amendments I have shown that this principle can be maintained if the Minister is prepared to consider it.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in all he said on this subject in reply to the Second Stage, emphasised all the time that his Bill was much better than what the Majority Report recommended, and that the Majority Report recommendations were in all kinds of ways inadequate. Anybody listening to the debate would have thought, from what he said, that he was giving more all across the board and that the Majority Report recommendations involved very much less.  He kept on referring to the £7 a week, which was the maximum proposed by the Majority Report when they considered the matter in 1960 and which they incorporated in their report in 1962.  As a member of that Commission I was most conscious of the fact that even since the matter was considered several years had passed. I was also conscious of the fact that with any inflation in the economy &mdash;and wages are rising with or without inflation&mdash;£7 a week was something which could become very quickly out of date.  It was for that reason that in the Addendum I wrote to the Majority Report I specifically mentioned this matter and made my acceptance of this £7 a week conditional on its being&mdash;I quote my exact words here:</P>
    <P>... regularly modified subsequently in the light of wage changes in the years after 1960 (when this figure was decided upon by the Commission)...</P>
    <P>Those are the words I used because I was conscious of the fact that the Commission's report, as it stood, was one which related to a point in time. The Commission's report did not advert to the need to keep the scheme up to date.  I was very much afraid that the Government might just simply accept the £7 a week and leave it for another ten years, like the £4 10s.&mdash;<Col N="743" /> repeating the Government's performance in respect of the £4 10s. limit.  I think I was right in my apprehensions and in specifying that the acceptance of the £7 a week could be favoured only on the basis of its being modified subsequently in the light of increases in wages thereafter &mdash;not in the cost of living and not even wages from 1962 onwards, but I specifically said in the light of increases in wages from 1960 onwards.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his reply to the Second Reading, kept on trying to pin me down on this saying that I recommended a maximum of £7 a week.  I pointed out repeatedly, at the risk of being ruled out of order for interrupting, that I recommended this on the basis of the year 1960 and its being kept up to date thereafter.  Between the year 1960 and the present time, wages in industry have risen by 57½ per cent.  Consequently the implementation of my recommendation in the report would involve now a maximum payment of £11 0s. 6d. per week.  I shall omit the sixpence hereafter and say £11 a week; that is in respect of legislation being introduced at this point of time.  The Minister, in suggesting that I was in favour, at this point of time, or that I visualised myself in 1962 as being in favour of £7 a week, was being, as he knew, less than honest because I had specifically covered this point.  The application of the principle which I had inserted in that Addendum would involve now a figure of £11 a week.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to accept that the Minister's scheme, which is different in character because of the introduction of the dependency allowances, is better in some respects.  He has pointed out that, in extreme cases, an injured man could get £15 or £17 a week in certain circumstances.  In that respect this scheme is certainly better but the great bulk of the cases are not cases that require constant attention&mdash;of, say, a man with seven children who is permanently incapacitated.  In fact, I would be interested to know if there is any such case at the moment anywhere which has this peculiar <Col N="744" /> combination of features which the Minister had to think up in order to arrive at that conclusion.  The vast majority of people are simply people getting injury benefit for a certain period.  In the minority of cases there is a greater permanent incapacity, which may or may not require constant attention and who may or may not have one or two children, or however many it may be.  We are legislating here for all possible cases but that the Minister should confine himself to certain extreme cases is not to treat the House seriously.</P>
    <P>The single man getting injury benefit &mdash;and injury benefit is what is paid to most people, because most people are not permanently incapacitated &mdash; the single man in that position, and in this country unfortunately there are a lot of single men, gets £5 15s. 0d. under the Minister's scheme as against £11 if the recommendation I made in the Majority Report were implemented. This is on the assumption, of course, that the man is earning a high wage. Naturally enough, if a man is earning only £10 a week, the recommendation I made would not give him anything like that.  I am talking here of the higher paid, skilled workers.  At present wage levels, the semi-skilled workers would earn something like £14 10s. 0d. a week and the skilled worker around £19.  The Minister is going to cut those people back to £5 15s. 0d. a week.  Under what I propose they would be cut back to £11 per week&mdash;twice that figure.  The Minister had what I can only call the nerve to throw in my face the ILO recommendation that the compensation should be two-thirds of the wages, when he is providing a sum which might, in many cases, not be one-third, never mind two-thirds.  If the Minister were implementing the ILO Convention he would have my full backing and that of this side of the House but what he is proposing is something far below any ILO recommendation in this respect.  He is proposing £5 15s. 0d. injury benefit for a single man.  I have done a calculation in respect of the skilled worker and how many children he would have to have to get the <Col N="745" /> Minister's benefit.  My arithmetical calculation tells me the poor man would have to have 7 children before he would get £11 a week out of the Minister&mdash;what the skilled worker on £18 10s. 0d. or £19 a week would get under the proposal in the Majority Report is modified by the Addendum I put on to it in the Commission.</P>
    <P>I do not think we can justify, by any standards, cutting back a skilled worker from £19 a week to £5 15s. 0d., which is what the Minister proposes.  I do not think we can justify this by talking about other benefits in the Bill.  There are other excellent things in the Bill, I admit, but there is no good in having good features in the Bill, such as constant attendance allowances, if at the same time you move backwards from the position you are in at the moment where, until the Government allowed the whole position to lapse, there was a wage relationship principle involving a certain percentage of wages very much higher than what the Minister now proposes for a case like this.</P>
    <P>There is a very powerful case in favour of these amendments and nothing the Minister has said has convinced me that this case is not a good one.  I should like to ask the Minister, when he replies to the amendment, if he has any difficulty in accepting it and, as far as I can make out from the Second Reading speech the reason he is likely to have difficulty in accepting it is because of the cost involved, I should like the Minister to tell us what that cost would be.</P>
    <P>The amendments I have put down are designed specifically to implement the recommendation in my addendum. I have chosen the figure of £18 10s. because that is the figure which, if the 60 per cent principle that was referred to in the Majority Report were applied, would give £11 per week at maximum, which is what the effect of the recommendation would be at this time.  That is the basis of the amendments.</P>
    <P>In his reply on Second Reading the Minister suggested that the various proposals in the Majority Report, and in what I proposed, would offer such poor benefits that they would not be <Col N="746" /> worth considering.  If that is the case they cannot cost much.  If, in fact, the cost is so high that the Minister cannot pay it, at least it is clear that the Minister by failing to accept the recommendation of the Majority Report, as modified by the addendum, is cutting back substantially on the benefits which were proposed.  The Minister cannot have it both ways.  Either what is proposed in the report and in the addendum is something which does or does not cost very much, and if it does not, as the Minister has accepted that it is desirable, and as the difficulties of implementation have been largely overcome in the series of amendments drafted, the Minister should forthwith accept the fact that these amendments are desirable, and accept them.</P>
    <P>The principle of wage relationship is accepted widely everywhere else in the world.  The Minister told us on Second Reading that he would like to introduce it but that the cost would be far too great.  In that case the Minister might have the grace to withdraw his remarks about the inadequacy of what was recommended by the Majority Report and in the addendum. The Minister by refusing to accept this recommendation is depriving the workers of substantial benefits. If it does not cost very much the Minister, having accepted that these amendments are desirable&mdash;and the amendments having been drafted to get over the difficulties&mdash;should accept them.  He must face that dilemma.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister can get away on Committee Stage with what he tried to get away with on Second Reading&mdash;a series of statements about the enormous benefits given in obscure and unlikely cases, ignoring the fact that the great bulk of people on injury benefit are now earning a typical wage of £14 10s. a week and in the case of skilled workers £19 a week.  For these people, unless they happen to have very large families, the Minister's proposals are designed to have the effect of reducing them to a very low standard of living if the breadwinner is injured, something which, throughout the world, countries have tried to avoid and something which we in our <Col N="747" /> legislation have always tried to avoid. We have failed to avoid it only because the Minister and the Government allowed this legislation to lapse and refused to modify the £4 10s. limit on the totally spurious grounds that they had to await the report of the Commission.  There was no reason whatsoever for not adjusting the £4 10s. limit in line with wages pending the report of the Commission.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why that was not done.  Normally speaking, any Government are anxious to maintain the level of social welfare benefits in line with wages, and let it be said that this Government have at least minimally done that throughout their period of office.  In the Budget of 1965 they did a bit more because they had to face certain pressures in the general election before the Budget.  Before those pressures the Government, with a certain lack of imagination, at least kept benefits moving upwards with wages.</P>
    <P>I do not understand on what grounds the Government should have allowed the workmen's compensation benefits to stand still for ten years. That is completely contrary to normal Government policy and their excuses were totally spurious.  One almost wonders in retrospect whether this was all part of an idea to eliminate wage relationship probably by letting it fall into disuse by failing to modify the £4 10s. limit.  Then the Minister could tell us: &ldquo;There is no such principle in operation now.&rdquo;  He would not tell us that that was because of Government neglect.</P>
    <P>I do not understand on what grounds the Minister purports to abolish this principle which has existed for so long in our legislation and which is universally in operation elsewhere.  In his two readings of the Report the Minister must surely have come to the table on page 304 in which there are two long columns of the countries in which benefits for non-fatal injuries in workmen's compensation are related to wages.  He must also have seen the shorter column in which benefits are related to wages, with additional allowances for dependants, a desirable <Col N="748" /> feature which the Minister has introduced into this Bill showing that the combination of the two principles together is quite feasible, as I have shown in the amendments.</P>
    <P>The countries which have this desirable combination include Australia, Austria, Finland, Italy, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Spain and some American states.  Most of the other countries simply have wage relationship without dependency allowances. That is the normal practice but these countries and a couple of others have wage relationship with allowances for dependants.  What the Minister's attention became riveted upon was the list of countries in which there is flat rate payment related to need, without any regard to wages.  When he saw that was a feature in Great Britain and Northern Ireland he could not look any further afield.  Those two countries are listed separately for some obscure reason. The fact that those two countries are listed with four States of the United States and with Iceland, may have reinforced his resolution, but it is pretty evident that in this, as in so many other fields, the Minister is not prepared to look further afield than Britain and Northern Ireland and that his highest ambition&mdash;if his ambition is even as high as that&mdash;is to keep in line with the most backward countries in the world in the field of social welfare. These countries are regarded as behind the rest of the world in the field of social welfare, except for the health services.</P>
    <P>That the Minister should be so determined on this is to me quite inexplicable.  The amendments I have put down would modify the benefits payable, and the system would be easily workable by the civil servants concerned.  I do not see that it would give rise to serious difficulties, or why it could not be operated.  It seems to be the one fundamental reason for failing to introduce wage relationship that it is not done in Britain and Northern Ireland.  That is conclusive for the Minister.  I am mystified by this.  It is very puzzling indeed that a Government in Ireland should consider what is done in Britain and Northern Ireland the be-all and the end-all in <Col N="749" /> any sphere of life.  That is the attitude of mind which bedevils a great deal of our legislation, which very often is copied word for word from British legislation.  We had that recently in the case of the Merchant Shipping Bill.  There is not much point in our setting up our own system for dealing with Bills if the Government just point to what someone else has done and simply implement it in a convenient and automatic way.</P>
    <P>It would be silly of us to do for ourselves everything that they are doing, but when we are in an area of social or economic legislation where the requirements of this country are clearly different from those of Britain and Northern Ireland, or where it is known to everybody that Britain and Northern Ireland are defective in their legislation and behind other countries, that any Government here should be unprepared to look further afield and consider that the only thing that requires to be done is to bring it into line with Britain and Northern Ireland &mdash;this is inexplicable to me.  I do not see how a Minister of an Irish Government can justify this attitude, and it seems to me that the Minister's Party have moved a long way from certain principles they held here 30 years ago when this is their idea of legislation. That they should do this at a time when they are telling everybody that we are moving closer to Europe and they are seeking to bring legislation into line with Europe and abolish the differences, when even Britain is moving away from the flat rate system, shows an extreme lack of imagination or interest in this subject or a lack of social conscience.  That it should be suggested that a skilled worker injured in his job should have his standard of living cut by over two-thirds to not more than a quarter of his ordinary level to bring us into line with Britain when it is open to us to maintain the wage relationship principle is something which the Minister has failed so far to justify.</P>
    <P>I do not think I need say any more about it.  I think the case is fully made. The amendments are there, and the Minister, if he is prepared to accept <Col N="750" /> them, will have the backing of this side of the House in justifying the additional expenditure involved.  Possibly it might have been better if the Minister had in the first instance worked out a proper scheme of wage relation benefits and flat rate benefits which would have added up to something similar to what is involved in this.  It might have been better in not introducing a sudden increase in the burden on the economy, but I do not think that the extra cost involved in adding this wage relation benefit to the flat rate scheme is going to break this country or break the employers.  It is certainly going to be an additional burden, and there will be some groans, but it is not going to have a fundamental effect.  We must wait to hear what the Minister tells us about the cost of this proposal.  I hope that he will not tell us that his Department is incapable of calculating the cost or that we could not have a scheme because the Department could not work out what it cost, but that is unlikely. He can tell us what it will cost and whether he thinks that it can be afforded or not.  If he thinks it can be afforded, as I think, even if it goes beyond what is proposed hitherto, he will have the support of Fine Gael and, I am sure, of the Labour Party in justifying this additional burden on employers on the grounds of social justice.</P>
    <P>I do not think he need fear that he will be attacked on any platform for making such a change.  He will have the support of all if he does so.  Now he has been shown how this can be done by the introduction of these amendments I hope that he will agree to accept this principle which is so universally adopted throughout the world, has been in operation so long, is so important to social justice and can be so easily maintained, and which we in this legislative assembly seek in accordance with the public interest.</P>

      <P>I would support all that Senator FitzGerald has said on these amendments but I would be mainly interested in amendment No. 30.  Under the British scheme contained in the new National Insurance <Col N="751" /> Act this year the new graduated benefits will come into operation on 1st October.  Amendment No. 30 visualises a very modest addition by way of a wage related supplement bringing in parity with the new British scheme. I expect that the Minister knows how it is calculated but it is not an awfully expensive thing.  It would remove a great deal of hardship from people in the lower income scale, who would under this wage related supplement earning between £9 and £13 get an addition of about £1 and on wages above that an addition of about £2 per week.  I would ask the Minister to give deep consideration to these wage related supplements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have made it clear that I am in favour of wage relationship as a principle provided there is also an adequate basic amount.  In other words, I am in favour of a certain degree of wage relationship generally in regard to social welfare services and would hope at some time in the future to achieve that.  Senator FitzGerald has not been completely factual in some of the statements he has made.  He has been referring to the injury benefit available for a single man, but there has been no reference to the fact that this is a short term benefit, and if the disablement turns out to be of a long term nature and is such as to prevent the man from continuing to earn his living this will be supplemented either by disability benefit if the person qualifies for it or else by unemployability supplement, so that in the case of a single man who is not able to return to work the weekly amount of benefit would not be £5 15s. 0d. but £8 7s. 6d.  Of course, that is only a single man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that the recommendation that Senator FitzGerald made to me as a member of the Commission on Workmen's Compensation did provide for a certain amount of wage relationship. He recommended that there should be wage relationship to the extent of 80 per cent in the case of those people whose earnings were under £4 a week, whoever they are, 75 per cent for <Col N="752" /> people earning up to £6 a week, and 60 per cent for those earning from £6 a week up to a maximum of £7, so that Senator FitzGerald's recommendation as a member of the Commission was wage relationship to the extent of 60 per cent up to a wage of £11 13s. 4d.  This recommendation was made to me in 1962.  There was no suggestion of taking account of need as decided by family commitments in the recommendations put up to me at that time, and in the proposals I am putting before the House we have in addition to the benefits for single men which, as I said, if he is unable to work as a result of his accident amount to £8 7s. 6d.&mdash;in addition to that there are additions in respect of adult and child dependants, which make this considerably more attractive for the lower paid worker in particular than the proposals that were put forward by the majority of the Commission.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that those increases for dependants are there this means that the amounts proposed by Senator FitzGerald would normally have effect in the case of a higher paid man only and higher paid workers who had not got dependants so that the proposals in this amendment would, in my opinion, give an unbalanced system of benefits.  The proposals I put before the House, while they do not introduce an element of wage relationship, are, in fact, better proposals.  They are more favourable generally in that they take account of the needs of the person concerned. At the risk of offending Senator FitzGerald again, I think I would be entitled to point out that the workers' representatives on the Commission considered this question of need as decided by family commitments to be even more important than wage relationship.</P>
    <P>It is a very sweeping statement for Senator FitzGerald to make that the British and Northern Ireland system is the most backward system in the world. I do not think that is so.  There are features in it which could be improved but it would not be a very easy thing to show that their schemes are the most backward in the world and that the schemes in operation in other countries <Col N="753" /> are ahead of Great Britain in every aspect.  It is true that most of them have got wage relationship but there are other features which they have not got.  One feature is that they are nearly all a lot more expensive on the worker. The contributions are greater.</P>
    <P>There is no question of looking on the British scheme as being the be-all and the end-all of our aspirations. There are a number of instances in this particular Bill in which our provisions are, in fact, ahead of what is available in Great Britain.  They may be comparatively minor things but we have not slavishly followed the British scheme.  It is a fact that we have most contact with Great Britain and that it happens to be with them that there is the greatest need for reciprocity in this matter.  In that respect it is an advantage to have a certain degree of similarity between the two schemes. The manner in which it is proposed in those amendments to effect a certain unbalanced system of wage relationship is not acceptable to me and as I say the benefits provided in this Bill are as much as it is reasonable to expect the economy of the country to provide at present.  I prefer to consider the question of wage relationship in relation to social insurance benefits generally rather than do it in one particular aspect of occupational injuries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Minister has not added very much to our understanding of why he is opposed to this proposal.  He says he is in favour of the principle in general and that some time in the future it could be introduced.  If that is so why is he not in favour of accepting this proposal now?  This is an amending Bill to amend the existing system.  The Minister is asking this House to abolish something which he says is desirable in principle and which it is feasible technically to introduce in this new legislation.  The only reason he gives for this extraordinary practice is that we have close contact with Britain and it is desirable to have reciprocity with Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Miss Davidson pointed out <Col N="754" /> that Britain are abolishing this flat rate system and introducing the other system.  Why are we not doing so when even the British are changing?  Why are we bringing ourselves in alignment with Iceland?  All other countries, except two American States, have adopted the system we propose in this amendment.  Why should we follow Iceland in this regard?  If we want to achieve reciprocity with Britain, which is busily abolishing the system the Minister is now adopting, why do we not adopt the system they intend adopting? I never heard a more topsy-turvy argument put forward in this House. Would the Minister inform me if wage relationship is being introduced in Britain, why he is not having reciprocity with them in this regard?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator FitzGerald knows that is not what I said.  In dealing with these amendments he alleged I said that our whole field of social welfare was based on the British system and that the British system was the be-all and end-all of our ambition in this regard.  I first of all said that was not so but that in so far as there was a similarity between our social insurance schemes and the British schemes that it was a fact that there was this close contact between the two countries.  I was not referring particularly to occupational injuries but to the whole social welfare system to which Senator FitzGerald was also referring.</P>

      <P>This wage relationship, as Senator FitzGerald knows, was purely theoretical.  Even in the recommendation he made to me he proposed wage relationship only up to a maximum wage of £11 13s. 4d.  He <Col N="755" /> proposed that the maximum compensation payable should be 60 per cent of the wages up to a maximum of £7, in other words, 60 per cent of £11 13s. 4d.  On the other hand he recommended to me that there should be no advertence to need, no advertence to family commitments.  I opted for a scheme which would take account of family commitments which was something Senator FitzGerald did not want me to do.  I did that instead of wage relationship.  That was considered by the workers' representatives on the Commission to be a more desirable thing to do than to have this wage relationship irrespective of family commitments.  Senator FitzGerald, now that he is acting as a Fine Gael Senator rather than as a member of the Commission, proposes to have both but does not propose to finance them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's last statement is extraordinary.  I offered him the full support of the Fine Gael Party on the question of the cost.  I persistently adverted to this and said I would give him every support. The Minister now says that wage relationship was only nominal.  If that is so, the only reason for it is that his Party, during ten years, refused against continued pressure to increase the £4 10s. 0d. which, because every male adult worker in the country had such a wage during that period, he would get automatically anyway.</P>
      <P>The Majority Report, as I pointed out in my addendum in 1960, considered the matter in terms of 1960. In 1960, the typical, the commonest male wage was around £8 10s. 0d.  It has risen in the meantime by 57 per cent and at present is £13 10s. 0d. which will go up to £14 10s. 0d. when the £1 per week goes through.  Those figures are open to correction&mdash;they have been hastily calculated, but they are about right.  Therefore, a wage related scheme which gave a figure of £11 13s. 4d. in 1960 gave a reasonably full measure of wage relationship. There was nothing nominal about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all very well for the Minister to refer derisively to a wage of £11 13s. 4d. per week.  We are talking <Col N="756" /> about a period six years ago.  The figure might not have been as good as it should have been but it was a fully operative wage relationship.  The Minister says he opted for flat rate benefits. Who asked him to opt?  We have a list of 11 countries which did not opt.  No one is asking the Minister to drop the flat rate system.  Had I been appointed to the Commission earlier, I would have pressed for the inclusion of that element in the system to some degree.  Nevertheless, the Commission scheme gave such a measure of wage relationship that it went a long way towards meeting this problem.  It was not as imperfect a scheme as the Minister's which proposes to terminate wage relationship and bring a skilled worker down to a standard of living no more than a quarter or one-third of his ordinary standard of living.</P>
    <P>The Minister said I made no effort to point out that the duration of injuries benefit is only short-term.  Of course, the duration of injuries benefit is short-term and, therefore, is the most common.  It is something in respect of which most people receive benefit and it is, therefore, something towards which we must direct a large part, though not all, of our attention.  During the Second Stage and again today, the Minister tried to ignore this completely and to give the extreme example of a person with seven children who is permanently injured.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>He also said that my proposal would operate only for higher paid workers and that for single men his scheme would be preferable.  This is not the case.  Take a married man with one child on a wage of £14 10s. a week, which is what the typical wage will be in the near future.  I proposed that man would have £8 14s. per week.  The Minister, with his dependency allowances, would give that man up to £8 8s. per week. Therefore, I suggest to the Minister that he stops this talk about the unmarried skilled worker.  The Minister said my proposal was for the benefit of the higher paid worker.  Here we are <Col N="757" /> not talking about higher paid workers in the Civil Service or in administrative posts.  The typical worker with the commonest wage of £14 10s. 0d. married and with one child, would get from my proposal more than the Minister proposes to give, and the Minister's statement to the contrary is flatly untrue.</P>
      <P>The Minister made his pious references to the workers' representatives and what they thought.  We know after yesterday's debate the interest the Minister has in the workers' representatives and their recommendations.  When it suits him he quotes them and when it suits him he misquotes them.  I do not think we should take too seriously the Minister's pious references to the workers and their representatives.</P>
      <P>I take it that Senator Miss Davidson is speaking for the trade unions.  That being so, we can take it that the trade unions, the workers' representatives, are now seeking&mdash;amendments have been put down to this effect here&mdash;to keep in line with the evolving and improving system in Britain.  It is no good the Minister telling us what the workers' representatives said on the Commission.  He should be concerned with what they are saying now.  It is that the British system having evolved and improved, we should try to keep up with it.  That is what they are looking for.  That is what the Minister is rejecting.  He is refusing parity with Britain and is going backwards to what Britain is evolving from.</P>
      <P>There is no question of opting.  The Minister said in his last sentence that I made no proposal to finance the system.  Far from that being the case, I am prepared to go out, I am prepared to stand on a platform with the Minister and support him on this question. I do not think the House should hear any more about this from the Minister to whom I have offered my specific support.  If the Minister should think that he might get into hot water in his effort to become a little more socially progressive he certainly would have my support.</P>

      <P>In subsection (4), page 10, line 15, to add the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;except where the beneficiary was working a five-day week prior to the accident, in which event the amount payable for any day of incapacity shall be one-fifth of the appropriate weekly rate.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This simply arises out of the five-day week.  The provision in the Bill now simply assumes that people work a six-day week and that they get one-sixth of the benefit, therefore, for a lost day.  It seems obvious that where people work a five-day week they should get one-fifth for every day lost. This is a non-contentious amendment which I suggest the Minister may accept.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator FitzGerald does not quite see what this amendment would do.  One effect at any rate of this&mdash;and I think the main effect&mdash;would be in the cases of these short-term absences when the first three days would not be paid for. Under the present system the loss would be half a week's benefit; that is three-sixths of a week's benefit but if Senator FitzGerald's amendment is accepted, the loss would be three-fifths so that in the case of short absences there would be a loss to the worker of one-tenth of a week's benefit, if this amendment was passed.</P>
      <P>The only relevance in the case of long absences would be where there were odd days in such absences, that is odd days over a full week.  The gain in this case would range from one-sixth, where there were five days, to one-thirtieth where there was one day over a period of a number of full weeks.  Therefore, the gain in long-term cases would be marginal and the majority of cases in which this would have relevance would be short-term cases where it would result, in fact, in a reduction of the amount of benefit obtainable by the workman.</P>

      <P>That seems to be the wrong way round.  I can quite see that it might be desirable to exclude people under 16 years by making a regulation to that effect but automatically to exclude them seems peculiar.  Everybody who works should be in this Bill until somebody decides, for good reason, to exclude them; until the Minister decides, for good reason, to exclude them.

      <P>In subsection (2), page 10, line 38, before &ldquo;be&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This section I am concerned with here is one which provides for disablement benefit and the particular clause with which I am concerned is the one which says:</P>
      <P>Provided that if he is not so incapable on any day, being the fourth or a later day after the relevant accident, before the end of that period, he may claim, and if otherwise entitled, be awarded disablement benefit as from that day, but in that event the fact that he is or may be so incapable on a subsequent day of the period shall be disregarded for the purposes of this subsection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that, in its present <Col N="762" /> form, the wording &ldquo;be awarded&rdquo; is modified by the preceding words &ldquo;may claim&rdquo;.  In other words, is his right to claim optional on the question of getting this if, in fact, he makes a claim? I am not sure that this is intended.  It seems to me the position ought to be that he should have the right to claim; and if he claims, he ought to be awarded this benefit.  He should be entitled to be awarded this benefit.  Perhaps there is some mistake here and the introduction of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; would make clear the person's right.  &ldquo;He may claim, and if he is otherwise entitled shall be awarded,&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;he may claim and if he is otherwise entitled may be awarded&rdquo;, which is the implication as the section is already drafted.  I am not quite sure what the Minister has in mind.  It may be that I am misunderstanding his mind on this matter, and I should be glad to hear any comment he has on this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is no need for the amendment.  Again, this could prove to be disadvantageous to the claimant in certain instances. Under this amendment if a person once became capable of work during the injury benefit period, he would claim for disablement benefit, and if he became incapable of work again during that period it would be mandatory to award him disablement benefit, if he was entitled to it, despite the fact that he had become incapable again.  The disablement benefit awarded in such circumstances as that would almost certainly be less than the maximum, and, therefore, this amendment which would make it mandatory to award disablement benefit rather than injury benefit would quite likely result in smaller payments to him.  Under the existing provision if he again became incapable of work before he was awarded the disablement benefit, he could cancel that claim, and resume his claim for injury benefit which would be at the full rate of £5 15s.</P>

      <P>In subsection (7) (a), page 12, lines 1 and 2, to delete &ldquo;but not in any case exceeding three hundred and eighty pounds&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Bill was amended in the Dáil by the introduction of subsection (9) of section 9 which we are on now. This introduces the right to substitute a pension for a lump sum in respect of disablement of 20 per cent.  The section which I am seeking to amend imposes a limit of £380 on the amount of the lump sum or disablement gratuity, as it is called technically, payable in these under 20 per cent cases.  The Dáil made an amendment to the Bill which introduced a system of pension as an alternative to this disablement gratuity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision for the calculation of this pension, if I read it correctly, is that it can be up to about 22/- a week for life, if in fact it is 19 per cent disablement.  Now the average worker is going to get much more out of 21/6 or 22/- a week than out of £380.  What the Dáil has done is to substitute an unlimited benefit if the worker opts for a pension, but it omitted to remove the £380 limit on the gratuity.  This means that the worker is now in most cases being forced to opt for the pension, which gives him much better value.  As a consequential amendment to what the Dáil did the limit should now be dropped, otherwise you have a distorted picture where a limited gratuity and an unlimited pension force the worker towards the pension because the £380 limit does not apply to the pension mechanism under this new Dáil amendment.  There is no limit to the pension of £380.  The Dáil has, <Col N="766" /> therefore, by removing the limit if he opts for the pension, introduced an imbalance in attempting to widen the worker's choice.  The worker is certainly made better off by giving him a pension.  It was the intention of the Dáil, obviously, that the worker should not be limited in this way because they put no limit on the 22/- a week. This is a very complicated matter.  I have read this a number of times and am still not certain that I understand it properly.  The Minister may be able to put me right, but if my understanding is correct I would suggest that the £380 limit no longer fulfils any useful purpose.  If I have misread it, he will no doubt inform me immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that what the Dáil intended to do was purely and simply to allow an injured worker who suffered a small degree of disablement to opt for a pension if he likes.  The reason why these lump sums were prescribed originally was that it is felt that the rate of pension in these cases would be so small as not to be looked upon as any real compensation at all for an injured workman. In fact, I think that in these particular type of cases the majority of workmen would opt for a lump sum.  The effects of Senator FitzGerald's amendment would be to introduce a completely new idea, that there would be no limit on the amount of the lump sum payable for these small degrees of disablement. I could not accept that.  If the workman calculates what he would receive by way of pension against what he would receive by way of lump sum and decides to gamble on the possibility of receiving the pension for a period long enough to enable him to receive a total amount which will be greater than the lump sum, then I think that we can leave him to do that if he sees fit.  I cannot see that that would justify us in upsetting the amounts of lump sums, which are related to the amount of disablement benefit which would be payable for other degrees of disablement.  Three hundred and eighty pounds is roughly seven years value of what would be the appropriate rate of disablement benefit for that degree of disablement.</P>

      <P>The maximum rate of disablement benefit for 100 per cent disablement is £5 15s.  That is graduated for different degrees of disablement down to 20 per cent.  Three hundred and eighty pounds is roughly seven years value of what the equivalent rate of disablement benefit would be for 19 per cent disablement.  The weekly rate for 20 per cent is 23/-.  For 19 per cent it would be something less than that, and if you divide £380 by seven, that would give you a yearly rate which when further reduced to a weekly rate would be the appropriate rate for 19 per cent, so that if you remove that limit of £380, it would affect all those other rates of disablement benefit.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that this does not follow.  The Dáil introduced an amendment which contemplated cases exceeding seven years. <Col N="768" /> So far from this section being limited to seven years, not alone is it not but the Dáil went on to say that in cases where this exceeds seven years, the following things shall be done.  I cannot see where the seven years limitation comes in.  The Minister has not offered any explanation of it.  I am not sure whether this is an <i>ex post facto</i> rationalisation of £380 or how it was actually arrived at.  Either way the position is unsatisfactory because even if the Dáil has not introduced this amendment, I would have questioned the £380 because I see no reason for it.</P>
      <P>Subsection 7 reads:</P>
      <P>Where the degree of disablement is assessed for the period taken into account as amounting to less than twenty per cent, disablement benefit shall be a gratuity</P>
      <P>(a)  of an amount fixed, in accordance with the length of the said period and the degree of disablement, by a prescribed scale,</P>

      <P>but not in any case exceeding three hundred and eighty pounds.</P>
      <P>We are told that would be seven years of the maximum rate.  It seems to me that a man should get disablement benefit because of the disablement and for the period for which he would be disabled.  Why should we say that if a man is thought to be disabled for 14 years, 21 years or for life, he can only get gratuity for seven years and then having said that in the Bill, we decide he should not get this gratuity but that he can get a pension?

It was pointed out in the Dáil that this lump sum was only equivalent to seven years' pension and that some workmen might deem it more attractive to get a pension, small as it was, for the remainder <Col N="769" /> of their lives.  In response to that argument, we accepted this amendment. I am not sure whether we accepted an amendment or whether I introduced one to give the workman the option of taking the appropriate rate of pension, small as it would be.</P>

      <P>I am afraid we are getting into worse difficulties. We are told the idea is that because the amount involved was so small, it should be a lump sum.  It is only small because it is limited to a lump sum of £380.  It is the Minister who is proposing it should be small.  There does not seem to be rhyme or reason with regard to this matter.  I have no explanation as to why it should be limited to seven years.  If a man is going to be disabled for life, surely the gratuity should be for life?  The Minister in the Dáil introduced this limitation.  Is there any reason for having the seven years limitation? Why should the limitation not be beyond the seven years?  Why should the workman not be able to take a lump sum beyond seven years?  We are told the lump sum is given because the amount involved is so small.</P>

      <P>We are dealing with small degrees of disablement here and with small sums by way of pension. The original thinking was that those sums were so small that they would be unattractive to workmen and therefore this idea of a lump sum was introduced. Members in the Dáil felt that some workmen would prefer to take the appropriate rate of pension, small as it was, rather than a lump sum.  I agreed to give them that option, but as I said, the degree of disablement in those cases would be comparatively small.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Minister is omitting to give an explanation as to why he introduced this limitation of £380, in the first instance. He says that the lump sum is there because it is small but then it is limited to this seven years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of pension is limited and the duration of the pension is limited.  When it was <Col N="770" /> decided to provide lump sums for those small degrees of disablement, some system of relating them to what the rate of pension would be had to be decided on.  Seven years computation of the appropriate rate of pension appeared to be reasonable since it was a lump sum which would not be related to the age of the workman concerned.  Senator FitzGerald seems to suggest that the lump sum should be different for different ages, for different expectancies of life.  I do not think that would be feasible.  In that case you would have to provide one lump sum for a man of 20 years, another for a man of 25 years and so on.</P>
      <P>I agree that to be strictly fair, and possibly logical, that should be done. We should have a different lump sum according to the expectancy of life at different ages but the amounts were so small that it was not considered necessary to do that.  We have given an option now to the person to take the small sum that would be appropriate, if he so desires.  Does Senator FitzGerald say that £380 would be equitable in all cases?  Surely it would be reasonable in some cases but the appropriate amount could be greater in the case of younger men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be extra in most cases because in fact the disablement is a permanent one, which is quite common in most cases.  If a person loses a finger, it will not grow again in seven years.  It is a very severe restriction to put in this limitation of seven years when most workers are under 55 years.  I do not understand why it was introduced, but then, having introduced it, why is there this unlimited pension?  This seems very inconsistent.  The Minister ought to have a look at this again.  This needs some tidying up.  It does not read very sensibly as it stands.  I think the workman should be entitled to a greater lump sum for whatever period is necessary.  If the amount is large, he gets compensation in the form of a pension for the rest of his working life or as long as the disablement lasts.  As the Bill now stands because of the overlooking of this £380 by the <Col N="771" /> Dáil, the man is in the position where if his disablement is likely to be for life, and if he is hard up and wants to get cash into his hands, he is likely to choose to give up his pension rights and accept this lump sum of £380 which is far less than the maximum value.  This seems to be very undesirable. Lump sums have undesirable features in any event, though there are cases where they are a good solution and I am not against them altogether.</P>
      <P>The Minister said earlier that lump sums always have an undesirable feature and I suggest that nothing could be more undesirable than that a man could commute his pension for a lump sum which is only a small part of his pension rights.  If such a man were hard up, he might be doing himself out of good pension rights for the sake of the lump sum.  If we look at the section afresh, we shall find that a man can get a pension and commute it for a gratuity which in no case would have more than the seven-year qualification. If he takes a lump sum, he is cutting short the seven years.</P>
      <P>I suggest the Minister should look at the section anew because, in drafting, it is obviously a bit topsy-turvy. The lump sum has been treated as the main feature, although in fact it is only a way out for a hard-up workman. The section could be redrafted with more logical effect.  I suggest also that the Minister take a look at the £380 limit because whatever justification there has been for the Dáil amendment, it is nothing more than a temptation to a workman to sell out his pension rights for a lump sum which may be only a small proportion of his pension right.  The Bill has been improved by the Dáil but the effect of the amendment on the original proposal in the Bill has not been considered. This confused discussion, for instance, suggests the desirability of the Minister having another look at the section which is not necessarily a very undesirable provision.  The £380 does not fulfil the function it was originally intended to fulfil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator FitzGerald's remarks about the undesirability of <Col N="772" /> the lump sum brings us to a point which he did not carry far enough. The idea of lump sums for injured workmen suggests a very great danger. One of the good things is that a lump sum settlement was done away with originally.  I would be against increasing the lump sum as suggested in the section.  If it were brought to a theoretically more sensible level of 14 years which would bring it up to approximately £750, I think it would be too high.  The attraction of a relatively large sum would encourage people to look for a lump sum where otherwise they would be satisfied with the pension.  There would be a large demand for lump sums going up the scale.</P>
      <P>Originally, this was dealt with on the basis that it was not a very serious matter, that relatively small lump sums should be given to finish the matter once and for all.  Now we have the change to small pensions instead. Having made that change, if the Minister is to consider lump sums, he should do so on the basis of doing away with them altogether rather than increasing them which might bring us back to the situation in which the workman is tempted to take a lump sum rather than a pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree it would have been more consistent to extend the scale in Table I down to one per cent but by the time we got down to one per cent, we would be dealing in quite ludicrous amounts by way of pension.  For that reason, it was decided to depart from the principle of the Bill and provide lump sums for smaller degrees of disablement which would not normally affect the ability of the person concerned to earn his living. Senator FitzGerald should give some attention to the fact that the lump sum will be paid right away and will not be affected by the possibility of the beneficiary dying shortly afterwards.  If a pension were given, it would cease when the person concerned died.  We must keep some balance between the lump sums we are providing for minor degrees of disablement and pensions for higher degrees of disablement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I agree it might be more tidy <Col N="773" /> to amend the Bill by extending Table 1 and having the lump sum provision as an option rather than the other way around, I think the Bill is all right as it is.  The Dáil, in making this amendment, took the view that the normal thing would be that the lump sum, small as it was, could be opted for.  A provision allowing the person to opt for the small rate of disablement benefit appropriate was a concession which would be availed of only in a minority of cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the Minister's reasonable explanation and I am beginning to see a bit of daylight. The principle of cutting off below 20 per cent and turning the pension into a lump sum has been effected here. What is suggested is that you pay the person a pension in all cases except where there is disablement of less than 20 per cent during a period of less than seven years for which there is a lump sum.  Because of the way it was introduced in the Dáil, there was a further possibility left open.  It is the possibility of a man who has a disablement which will last much longer than seven years who under the Bill as it stands is entitled to the choice of a pension or lump sum and who might opt for the lump sum, small though it might be in relation to the value of the pension. Should we not revise this on the basis that we provide that in all cases a pension shall be payable except where there is a combination of the under seven years and under 20 per cent, when a lump sum shall be payable? The option we have got is particularly undesirable because of the temptation to opt for a lump sum of much less than the value of the pension.  Having reintroduced the pension idea for periods of more than seven years, we should limit the other to £380 but applicable to cases of less than seven years.</P>

      <P>I agree that it is undesirable to put the temptation in a worker's way to abandon a pension in favour of a lump sum, but after all, in these cases, we must appreciate that the pension is a very small thing indeed and that the worker who cuts himself off from a pension at the rate we are <Col N="774" /> discussing will not be depriving himself of any great assistance in maintaining his standard of living.</P>

      <P>I really do think it is indeed untidily drafted.  It has got a mixture of principles in it and I think nobody is terribly satisfied with the subsection in its present form.  I wonder if the Minister would look at it between now and Report Stage and if, having thought about it in its present form, it was decided that that was not the best solution, we could have it drafted in some more sensible way. The debate on this has shown that the Dáil has modified this in a way which has unintended effects.  It does not seem to me desirable that a worker should opt for a lump sum very much less than the value of his pension.  I am sure this was an oversight on the part of the Dáil.  I am in favour of eliminating the £380 limit.  If the Minister sees difficulties about that, I still think it might be better to confine the lump sum to cases of under seven years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The cases under subsection (5) of section 9 which says:</P>
      <P>The period to be taken into account by an assessment of the extent of a claimant's disablement shall be the period (beginning not earlier than the end of the injury benefit period, and limited by reference either to the claimant's life or to a definite date) during which the claimant has suffered and may be expected to continue to suffer from the relevant loss of faculty.</P>
      <P>Every period has to be assessed and apparently, for some reason, the figure of seven years has been taken as the crucial turning point in the assessment of this period.  It has never been assessed and, over seven years, the Dáil has provided that, in these circumstances a man may take a pension.  If it is under seven years and the total amount is, therefore, small, then he should be given a lump sum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can quite see that the way we <Col N="775" /> have approached this here and the complexity of it must leave the Minister in some doubt at the moment as to what is perhaps the best solution. I am in doubt myself about it and that is why I suggest that the Minister have a look at it between now and Report Stage.  The £380 is now performing a completely different function from the one originally intended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Dáil did anything they did not intend to do.  It might be possible for people with a smaller degree of disablement to opt for a small pension which could be very small indeed in regard to the really small degrees of disablement, instead of the lump sum which I proposed originally as the only compensation in such cases.  The position as it stands is satisfactory. Possibly it might be drafted in a neater way if the Table had been extended down to one per cent and if the lump sums were provided as an option, rather than the other way round, but I am quite satisfied with the result of what has been done.  A person concerned who has suffered a small degree of disablement can opt to take either a very small rate of benefit or a lump sum, which I think is of a reasonable amount.  I do not see any need to go any further with the matter.</P>

If some other person signed it he may have signed on behalf of Senator Ó Maoláin, or else put his own name down as an Acting Leader of the House.  There is something peculiar here.  The name of Senator Ó Maoláin is on the document. He is sick.  I hope he recovers fast.  This document is in his name and I challenge you, Sir, to say that Senator Ó Maoláin has signed this document.</P>

I do not in any circumstances wish to cross swords with you, Sir, or to dispute your ruling with regard to the Order of Business or the setting up of the Order Paper as we have seen it this morning, but I am sure at the same time that it must be a matter of anxiety to all Senators in this House here to find that a very grave matter of public importance such as this motion and the Bill to which the motion refers can come before this House in spite of Standing Orders and in spite of the fact that it is clearly stated in Standing Orders that the Order of Business must be clearly printed and stated on the day that the Seanad meets.</P>

Now the Government in their anxiety to brush aside the normal rules of procedure, in their anxiety, have sought by every loophole possible in Standing Orders to evade what should be the proper procedure in this House.  I do <Col N="783" /> not suggest for a moment that the Chair co-operated in any way with the Government.  I do not suggest that, but I do suggest that the Government and their advisers show little regard for this House, No. 1, and, secondly, that their failure to adopt the proper procedure with regard to the moving of this motion shows a lack of efficiency on their part something similar to what took place in a recent event elsewhere.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's attitude in introducing this motion reminds me of a defeated army, and we know that when a defeated army are on the retreat they get vicious.  They are prepared to lay the countryside waste.  They are prepared to set up <Col N="784" /> booby traps, to lay mines, to destroy valuable buildings, to tear down, shall we say, the power structures and installations of various sorts, in their anxiety to leave the countryside denuded of anything worth while to those who would take over.  In this particular instance we have the picture of the Government prepared to tear down or uproot the very fabric of society in this State by attempting with this motion to introduce in the speediest possible fashion a type of legislation that will react in a very adverse manner on the country as a whole.</P>
      <P>The Irish people have been known down through the centuries as a people who can be persuaded or led, but not driven, not gulled and not forced to do something against their will.  We have in this motion now an attempt not to give a matter of such importance as is contained in the Bill, which will come before us, time and plenty of time before such a measure is contemplated and passed.  Instead an attempt is being made to hurry it through this House before having proper discussion and before people have time in which to study the particular sections of the Bill itself.</P>
      <P>I have listened time and again to the Taoiseach in the other House and outside it talking about his regard for the workers and about the rights of the individual.  One thing sticks in my mind when I think back to the Taoiseach's own remarks on similar attempted legislation in 1961 when he said: &ldquo;I want to establish a cooling off period.&rdquo; I suggest that what we want in this House at the moment, as far as the Government itself are concerned, is a cooling off period after what has taken place over the past ten days.  It is not the worker who needs to be cooled off. It is the Government who need to be hosed down in order to bring them back to realities and in order to get the venom out of their systems.  We know perfectly well that the industrial worker showed his absolute disapproval of this Government on a very recent occasion, not for the love of the other group.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The industrial worker showed, in what I can only describe as a vote of no confidence, that he wanted this particular Government out.  The Government's reply to this was this speedy attempt to bring the lash down on the back of the industrial worker.  This is the answer that Fianna Fáil and their cohorts are giving to the industrial worker in the city of Dublin and other parts of the country.  I beg the Minister, at this stage, to agree to my suggestion of a cooling off period.  Let this legislation stand as it is for the present.  Let us adjourn this House today without attempting to go any further with the passage of this Bill.  If the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who in many ways is a very reasonable man, agrees to that, he will be doing more good for industrial relations than he has so far had an opportunity of doing since he was appointed Minister.</P>
      <P>I know there may be difficulties as far as some of his colleagues are concerned. I know in the Cabinet we have some of the greatest reactionaries that ever sat in any reactionary Cabinet in Europe.  Mind you, some of them were very reactionary.  We have men in the Fianna Fáil Cabinet at the moment who do not know even how to talk to their workers and who do not even know how to bid the time of day to their own employees.  Those are the men who hide now behind a Cabinet decision and send a decent colleague in here to this House who must take the brunt of the blame for the introduction of this repressive legislation that is coming before the House.  I want to repeat again what the Taoiseach said. He said: &ldquo;I want a cooling off period established.&rdquo;  That was in 1961.  Could we not ask for this cooling off period instead of now attempting to bring in permanent legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1961 when this House met to discuss an almost similar measure, the Taoiseach came into this House and spoke immediately after the then Leader of this House, Senator Carter, introduced this motion.  What does the Taoiseach think of this House today?  He thought it worthwhile in 1961 to explain to the Seanad: &ldquo;This is only a temporary measure. <Col N="786" /> This is only a cooling off measure. I ask you under the circumstances to pass this temporary legislation and we will get it out of our way as soon as I have a tribunal established and as soon as everything is right inside the ESB&rdquo;.  Even though it was only temporary legislation then, he thought it was essential for him to come to this House and explain it.</P>
    <P>What happens now?  Has his regard for this House sunk so low in the meantime that he will not even bother coming in at all?  Although this is permanent legislation we are putting on the books on this occasion he does not even think it worth his while to come to this House.  As far as the head of the Government is concerned he has lost his grip on the Cabinet. He has allowed the hotheads and the arrogant men behind him to bring in this permanent legislation with regard to the industrial workers of this country.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is here, is personally responsible for this particular motion.  I would ask him, even at this late stage, to ask the Chair for an adjournment and having achieved what he knows every Member of this House would agree to, he should then seek the aid of three first-class men in the State who will be asked to set up, at this stage, a tribunal specially to consider this particular issue about which this legislation is coming in.  It is not my function to suggest the names of such people but we have people in this State with the ability, the anxiety and the integrity necessary for this matter.  We have people who will give confidence to all concerned that their recommendation is one that can be abided by.  I ask him to set up a special committee.</P>

The hand of friendship should be held out in time. That is why I urge, indeed, beg the Minister at this stage to ask the Cabinet to consider this idea of mine. The Minister and the Taoiseach have agreed now to set up a Ministry of Labour and all that it entails.  It means the Labour Court will be enlarged, that first class technical advisers and assessors will be made available through this new Ministry.  Seeing that the Government have a practical longterm idea in mind, I urge them at this stage not to bring in repressive legislation as this motion will enable them to do.  If they do this, everything will be spoiled.  On the ground that the Government propose a longterm solution by setting up a Ministry, I appeal to the Government not to bring in this repressive measure which would spoil everything.  I urge that the House be adjourned.</P>

Is the position that all these will be taken at the one time?  Today in the Dáil it was not possible to have the reasonable amendment which was suggested considered or voted on separately.  Can any arrangement be made so that amendments will be taken, say, at 9 o'clock so that votes could be taken on specific amendments?  It is very desirable that should be done.</P>

Would the Acting Leader of the House give some indication of his opinion of the pattern I have suggested&mdash;that the Second Stage concludes at 8 o'clock and that we vote on the amendments at 9 o'clock?</P>

      <P>What I want to ensure is that we will not be asked to enact as permanent legislation a Bill the details of which could reasonably be discussed in an hour.  We ought to be given an hour in which to discuss the detailed provisions of the Bill.  I do not see any reason why there should not be agreement on that.  Otherwise, of course, what will happen is that speeches will go on.  We can all speak most eloquently and at great length upon this Bill and, judging by Senator McQuillan's speech now, the speeches are likely to be very long.  I do appeal to the Labour Members of the House to agree that the Second Stage would be voted upon at 8 o'clock and that we will have Committee Stage from 8 o'clock to 9 o'clock.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared, nor do I think the Labour Party are prepared, to accept the suggestion made by Senator O'Quigley because the Bill is too important for us to call a halt to it at any particular time of the night.  As far as I and my colleagues <Col N="791" /> in the Labour Party are concerned, we all wish to get an opportunity to speak on this Bill because it is one of the most important Bills which has ever come before this House.  The fact that the people it is primarily aimed against are manual workers concerns us quite a lot.  We consider it an anti-trade union Bill and we have very good reason for thinking so.  I am in full agreement with Senator McQuillan that there should be a cooling-off period, such as the Taoiseach asked for in 1961. That cooling-off period could very well last until next week seeing that negotiations are in progress at the moment which may settle the whole matter of the strike; it may be settled before the weekend.  I think, in fair play to the Labour Court and to the people who are trying to bring about a settlement of the strike, there should be a cooling-off period until next Wednesday.</P>
      <P>I am supporting Senator McQuillan in having that cooling-off period and seconding the motion that the House would adjourn.  Furthermore, I do not want any time limit on the debate here.  I happened to be in Dáil Éireann today when the Committee Stage of the Bill came up.  It happened to be a Money Bill when the Committee Stage came up and every single Labour speaker who got up to speak was ruled out of order.  I do not want to see the same thing happening here tonight.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of an amendment to it, so we have this motion before us in the name of Senator Ó Maoláin; this is what we <Col N="792" /> are discussing and not any arrangement between the two conservative Parties here.  I am opposing this motion here and, with respect to Senator Stanford, it is difficult to talk about the motion without having regard to the Bill.  It will, of course, by the mass of people here, be pushed through here tonight no matter what the ranks of the Labour Party&mdash;small as they are &mdash; will say about it.  I accept there is a crisis, a very difficult situation but what I am saying is that this is not the way to solve it.</P>
      <P>Remember we had exactly the same situation in 1961.  Senator McQuillan referred to what happened then.  We were asked to agree to a cooling-off period.  The Taoiseach came along here and made an eloquent speech to Seanad Éireann.  But let us go a little further; let us recall what happened after that.  The strike was settled, of course, without having to avail of the temporary repressive legislation then being enacted but the situation was so serious at that time and we had got such a warning of the seriousness of the situation, that it was thought desirable to appoint a commission of inquiry to look at the whole situation in the ESB.  The Congress of the trade unions cooperated in that commission of inquiry and they reviewed the whole situation in the ESB.  They heard a great deal of evidence; they talked to many people and eventually they came out with recommendations.  One of the principal recommendations of that commission was that the two tribunals which then existed in regard to the ESB for dealing with rates of pay&mdash;one for dealing with rates of pay of the salaried staff, the other for dealing with rates of pay of the operative grades&mdash;should be amalgamated.  They were satisfied&mdash; I do not know whether they used exactly those words or not&mdash;but they were satisfied that there was a feeling within the ESB that there were two worlds, one world and one tribunal for the salaried workers and another world and approach when dealing with matters for the manual workers.  To try to, overcome this division within the ESB, they recommended that the two tribunals be amalgamated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="793" /> That report went to the Minister for Transport and Power, who is the Minister responsible for the ESB, responsible for all the situation and all the difficulties, and he is responsible for this present crisis.  That Minister did nothing at all about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>

Any Senator, as a Member of the Seanad, is entitled to say why he thinks the House should not agree to this procedure. I am saying I do not agree with this procedure and I am saying why I do not agree to it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am arguing against the procedure of rushing through a very important and permanent piece <Col N="794" /> of legislation without the House getting a proper opportunity of considering it; without the people involved in it being consulted.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions have not been consulted about this measure which raises very important issues.  It is doubtful whether or not it is in conflict with the ILO recommendation on strikes.  It is equally doubtful that it is in conflict with their recommendation in regard to forced labour. We will come to that later in relation to the Bill.</P>
      <P>We are asked, as a responsible House of the Oireachtas, to agree that this should be rushed through without any consultation with people who have a knowledge of this, in the background of the ILO recommendation or, without knowing what it will involve for the trade union movement. It is finished and done with then and it is a permanent piece of legislation on our statutes.  Maybe, then, we will have the ridiculous situation that some of us, in our representative capacity in the trade unions, will be appealing to the ILO against some enactment here of the Irish Government.  Do not let us all be so silly.  Do not let us all look so ridiculous because, no matter what the haste about this legislation, it will solve nothing.  It will not deal with the crisis in the ESB.  Therefore, I think the Minister and the Government are being very ill-advised in trying to push this legislation through without proper consideration of it, without giving both Houses of the Oireachtas the opportunity of looking critically at the measure, looking at each section of the Bill, and having advice from the people competent to advise on it so that we can discuss these sections on their merits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said already, what we are dealing with is a permanent piece of legislation and once 9.30 p.m. has passed and once the President has affixed his signature it is on the Statute Books.  It is there as a permanent piece of legislation and a precedent for the future when the Minister for Transport and Power makes a mess of CIE again, or Aer Lingus, or Irish Shipping. We shall have a delightful precedent for attempting to force workers to work <Col N="795" /> against their will if they refuse to do so.  How ridiculous can we be.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I should like your ruling, Sir, as to whether these remarks are on the motion, which is that notwithstanding anything in the Standing Orders the Electricity Bill should be considered forthwith.  Senator Murphy is now considering the merits and the demerits of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair appreciates that but in view of the circumstances, however, I shall allow Senator Murphy to continue and come back again to the debate on the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking&mdash;and I am not too skilled on the finer points&mdash; why this measure should be rushed through the Seanad.  That is intrinsically the point.  What we are dealing with now is the rushing through of an important piece of legislation.  We are not discussing the details of the legislation. We are asked to agree and accept that an important piece of legislation should be rushed through this House without the usual opportunity we have of debating the merits of the Bill on Second Stage, looking at it in detail and consulting the people involved, putting down amendments for Committee Stage and debating them.</P>
      <P>We have been debating the Occupational Injuries Bill here for hours and if Senator FitzGerald continues we shall be debating it for hours again.  It is an important measure but I suggest this Electricity (Special Provisions) Bill, 1966, is equally as important a measure.  We are being asked as a responsible House of the Oireachtas to rush it through and put it on the Statute Book without having had a proper opportunity of discussing it and consulting the people who are involved and who know the details of the trade union movement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am opposing this motion.  I think it is ill-advised.  I think the whole thing has been bungled in the way <Col N="796" /> it has been dealt with here and the way it has been dealt with by the Minister for Transport and Power since 1961.  It is not alone what he did not do but what he is still doing with the ESB and similar bodies.  Now we are asked to pull the chestnuts out of the fire and I suggest that what we will do is make the situation worse. I oppose the passage of this motion and I hope&mdash;I am afraid it is a vain hope&mdash;that maybe there will be some people in this House who will have more regard for the dignity of Parliament and who will agree that it is quite wrong that we be asked to rush through a permanent piece of legislation in four hours.</P>

      <P>We are dealing here with an abnormal situation, and abnormal things will occur in that kind of situation.  There are two ways of protecting the interests of the workers. One is to play around with them, and play politics, and the other is to do <Col N="800" /> something on the basis of the Bill submitted by the Government.  The Labour Party know as well as I do that the numbers on the Government benches are sufficient to push this Bill and this motion through to-night.</P>

      <P>We had better be realistic.  The truth of the matter is that the Government have the manpower, the numbers, to push this measure through tonight.  They pushed it through the Dáil this afternoon.</P>
      <P>What we propose in our amendment to the Bill is to take this legislation which is in the form of permanent legislation and to convert it into temporary legislation to meet an emergency situation. If we allow this motion to go through as it is worded, there is no possibility at all of a proper discussion by the House on the amendment which we propose to the Bill, and the House will not be given an opportunity to make temporary legislation of this permanent legislation which the Government have offered for our consideration.</P>
      <P>It is in the interests of the workers and the trade unions to minimise the effect of this legislation.  It is for that reason, and in order to minimise the adverse effects of this legislation upon all classes of workers and upon the trade union movement, that we have put down this amendment.  It is in the interests of those people that the amendment should be debated and discussed.  We could talk about the Bill, and talk it out, and nothing practical would have been done to help the trade union movement.  If our amendment to limit this Bill is discussed, it may well be that less damage will be done to the trade union movement than will inevitably be done by the passage of the Bill as it is.  It is for that reason that we are suggesting to the House that the Second Stage discussion should be limited to 8 'clock, and the Committee Stage be taken between 8 o'clock and 9 o'clock.  We can then vote upon the amendment.  I think this is in the best interests of the trade union movement and the workers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On the substance of the amendment, I believe the House will be aware of the fact that owing to problems of procedure in the other House it was impossible for a vote to be taken on the amendment.  The purpose of the amendment to this motion which we have put forward is to ensure that the amendment to the Bill, which was talked out in the other House and could not be voted on, will be discussed and voted on in this House. The amendment seeks to limit the duration of the Bill.  It is introduced in an emergency situation and it may not be the best way to handle the situation permanently.  It is our view that <Col N="803" /> while it is necessary for an emergency, it should be limited in operation.  We think this House should have an opportunity to consider what form the permanent legislation should take, and we think that permanent legislation on this matter should not arise out of an emergency.  Because of procedural difficulties in the other House they got no opportunity to consider whether this legislation should be temporary or permanent.</P>
    <P>It is our view that in the interests of the workers and the community, on the one hand this emergency situation should be met, and on the other hand that permanent legislation in a matter of this kind should be more considered and should not be just something arising out of an immediate emergency.</P>

I humbly <Col N="805" /> suggest with all due respect to you, Sir, and to your judgment in this matter, that the proper course to adopt in dealing with this matter is to let every Member of the House see the amendment that we are expected to seriously consider.  I personally find myself in the difficulty that I am expected to come in in a debate in which I am vitally interested and to contribute intelligently to it without having any clear idea of what the amendment really means.  I suggest that you owe a duty to every Member of the House, unless the amendment is available to him, to adjourn the House until such time as copies are circulated to each member.</P>

      <P>An argument was put forward that the Labour Party were preventing the House from discussing in detail the sections of this particular Bill which may come before the House if this motion is passed. I want to be quite clear and blunt on this.  The amendment, in fact, shortens the time still further that the Government made available as far as the Second Reading of this highly important measure is concerned. Instead of the Fine Gael Party asking the Government to extend the time for the Scond Reading they have reversed engines and sought to go back from 9.30 p.m. to 8 o'clock.</P>
      <P>I thought it was bad enough to have Fianna Fáil riding roughshod over the House without having Fine Gael coming in and asking them to shorten still further the time for the Second Reading. That is precisely what is happening. The amendment is an attempt by Fine Gael to have some way of getting out of this, to recover some of their glory of last week and at this stage to say: &ldquo;We are on the side of the workers.&rdquo;</P>

That is what the amendment is.  The only concession is that there might be the addition of a further half hour before the execution takes place. That is what the amendment is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to speak much <Col N="809" /> further on the amendment.  It is an attempt to whitewash the attitude of the Fine Gael Party in this.  It shows here clearly that they are just as conservative and reactionary as the Fianna Fáil Party are in both Houses.  If ever there was proof that there was no difference between them, that it was a case of tweedledum and tweedledee, we have it in this particular amendment.  I have spent my life since first elected pointing out to the public that there was not room in this country for two major conservative Parties.  I have lost personally down along the line by preaching that viewpoint.  I wish to make it clear that as far as I can prevent it I shall not allow Fine Gael to pretend they are on the side of the worker when they are behind the Government.</P>

    <Title>Electricity (Special Provisions) Bill, 1966: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Dr. Hillery) Patrick J. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, as the Seanad knows, deals with the question of the interruption of the supply of electricity arising out of disputes in the ESB.  Its provisions would become effective only on the making of an Order by the Government.  The power to make such an Order bringing the provisions of the Bill into effect would be exercisable by the Government only in circumstances in which there was likely to be a serious disruption in a supply of electricity, due to disputes.  It is not the type of legislation which the Government would want, nor is it the type the Government thought it would ever be obliged to introduce but the community cannot carry on without electricity and the public, I think, will not bear with a situation in which the supply of electricity is seriously disrupted or threatened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are obviously two possible ways in which we can secure continuity of the supply of electricity, in the event of a dispute.  One is voluntary negotiation by the employees with the Board of arrangements by which the employees would give up their right to take such action as would bring about serious disruption of supplies for whatever consideration would be negotiated. <Col N="813" /> We have not got this arrangement and in its absence, the Government, acting on behalf of the community, must have resort to the only alternative, that is, to seek legislative powers.  The Government do not regard this as a desirable procedure, and, as I have said, they did not think that at any time they would have to introduce such legislation.  I regret to have to say that circumstances have arisen which place a clear obligation on the Government to seek such powers as will enable them to act on behalf of the community in the event of a serious disruption, or the likelihood of a serious disruption, in the supply of electricity</P>
    <P>The Seanad will be aware of the history and the facts of the situation in regard to the disruption of supplies.  As I have said before, it is no revelation to say that in our western civilisation conditions of life have become so complex, that technical advances have placed us on a razor's edge, and we are daily becoming more and more dependent on the smooth flow of supplies and services which are themselves caught in a web of interdependence.</P>
    <P>Electricity is no longer a matter of relative importance in our daily lives. The importance of electricity in the lives of the people is now absolute.  An extension of the principle that a man can withdraw his labour to include the right of a trade union to call a major strike in an essential industry I have compared with putting a nuclear warhead in a conventional weapon.  We have to recognise that the use of the strike weapon in certain circumstances no longer simply affects the employer or the boss in his pocket.  It affects the whole community.  The realities of the situation in which we found ourselves recently, and which has not been resolved, transcend any issue such as the traditional right of sections or individuals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>When the lifeline of the nation is in danger, if the nation cannot look to the State for protection, chaos has come.  The Electricity Supply Board is an agency of the State as well as the nerve centre of our everyday lives.  No one in the organisation of the Board is unaware of the havoc that a serious strike can cause.</P>
      <P>As I have said before, it would be naive to suggest that it is necessary to place pickets on ESB installations to demonstrate to the public that there is a dispute in progress.  The fact that disputes are on is brought home to everyone through the various media for the dissemination of news.  Therefore, the effect and object of the placing of pickets is to disrupt the organisation so that it cannot supply people with the electricity which is vitally necessary.  If that is not the purpose of placing pickets on ESB installations, they have little meaning at all.</P>
      <P>One simple basic fact which I have repeated throughout the day in the other House is that we cannot carry on without electricity.  The workers who supply us with electricity are therefore put in a unique position. They know that is the situation and, after recent experiences, every man and woman in this country knows that is the situation.</P>
      <P>If an order is made by the Government in circumstances of a likely disruption of the supply of electricity, it would bring the Act into operation and give legal effect to the rates of remuneration and conditions of service of persons employed in the ESB. This will not prevent rates and conditions being varied as a result of determination by one or other of the statutory ESB tribunals, or by an arbitrator, or on a recommendation of the Labour Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation would make it unlawful for the Board of the ESB to remunerate any of its employees or apply conditions of service otherwise than in accordance with what I have just said.  Strikes and picketing aimed at forcing the issues of remuneration and conditions other than those determined in accordance with the procedure laid down in the Bill&mdash;through an arbitrator, a tribunal or the Labour <Col N="815" /> Court&mdash;would be illegal, if they threaten seriously to disrupt the supply of electricity.</P>
    <P>The Seanad is aware that the normal method of resolving differences is by way of free co-operative bargaining. The Government would prefer to see the parties in the ESB settling their differences in this way through the agreed negotiating precedures.  If the parties fail to settle their differences in this way, and if there is a serious disruption of electricity supplies, or an imminent danger of such disruption, then the provisions in this legislation must be applied.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not attempt to take away the fundamental right of the worker to withdraw his labour.  Its intention is to curtail that right to a narrow front where the exercise of that right would lead to a shut-down of the electricity supplies and to bring the country to a halt.  As I said, I am not talking about anything that is outside the experience of the Seanad. Twice within the past few weeks this danger has appeared.  Someone has remarked that the critical nature of the situation has now become more remote, but people were affected by the insecurity, and different aspects&mdash; work, hospitals, farms&mdash;were affected.</P>
    <P>Everyone is aware of what could happen.  Everyone is aware that it could happen suddenly again.  This legislation is not intended to be operated unless such a situation reappears, and then the Government would have power to make an Order to bring the provisions of this legislation into effect.  Only in the event of a serious threat of a disruption in the supply of electricity would the Government bring the provisions of this legislation into effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill which one supports with considerable unhappiness that we should have reached a stage at which it is necessary. However, there is no alternative because of the damage that could be done to the economy, the hardship that could be caused, and the danger to life such as existed on the previous occasion when electricity supplies <Col N="816" /> dropped.  As such, the Bill must be accepted as an emergency piece of legislation to meet an emergency.</P>
      <P>What we do not accept is that the Bill in its present form is sufficiently well thought-out or adjusted to the needs of the situation to be a permanent part of our Statute Book. That is why we seek to put forward an amendment to limit the operation of this Bill, and that is why we have sought so to organise the procedure of this House as to ensure that what happened in the other House, where this was talked out, will not happen here, and that the amendment to limit the operation of this Bill to a short period to cover the present emergency situation will be considered by this House and, I hope, accepted by it.</P>
      <P>We have to face the fact that this is a situation which should have been dealt with long ago.  There has been no reason to wait until now.  There are many problems in this country, but there are few in respect of which the Government have had such repeated warnings.  We had the 1961 strike situation and the emergency legislation which was attempted at that time, which the Government withdrew when the situation resolved itself.  The Government had there notice of a danger, a situation that should have been dealt with, that should have been considered seriously and brought up for discussion.  Some kind of steps should be taken to deal with the situation so that it could be considered calmly, not in a period of crisis but in a period when the situation was not critical and when calm consideration could be given to whatever changes needed to be made finally in the existing industrial relations procedure to ensure, on the one hand, the rights of the workers affected and on the other, the security of the supply of electricity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had subsequent to that the Commission established by the Government to investigate the ESB arbitration tribunals and the report of that Commission, which is in the hands of the Government and but in respect of which we have heard nothing since, as far as I am aware.  Again, the <Col N="817" /> Government had an opportunity to deal with a matter that called for action and did nothing about it.  A good many of the difficulties we face now derive from the failure of the Government to deal with that Commission's report.  I have some limited experience myself in this sphere as for several years I was Chairman of the Joint Services Arbitration Tribunal of the ESB and from time to time I was aware of the dissatisfaction of the workers of the ESB with the fact that there were two tribunals, that there seemed to be a division between two categories of workers, and that one category felt that they were not being dealt with in the same way and favoured in the same way as another.</P>
    <P>As I shall suggest in a moment, there is a factual basis for this belief. In fact, the clerical workers of the ESB did secure better improvements in their remuneration than the manual workers, and this was in part because there were two tribunals, not because one tribunal was adopting deliberately a more favourable attitude but because they adopted different criteria and looked at the problems of those two groups separately instead of together. That gave rise to a legitimate sense of grievance among the manual workers of the ESB which need not have arisen if the ESB had handled its industrial relations better and if the Government had acted on the report of that Commission several years ago and reorganised the industrial relations procedure in the ESB so as to prevent a continuance of this legitimate sense of dissatisfaction and of grievance.</P>
    <P>I said that there was concrete factual evidence that the manual workers of the ESB were not as well treated as other workers.  I will refer to this briefly, because this needs to be said, that if we are going to take away here the rights of manual workers to prosecute their claims in accordance with the normal custom in this country in regard to industrial relations, we want to be clear about what we are doing. We want to be clear that we are safeguarding their interests, which have not hitherto been looked after as they should have been looked after.  We <Col N="818" /> have no alternative but to pass this legislation, but it is very unsatisfactory that we should have to support this legislation at a time when these workers are in the position of seeking legitimately to improve their position relative to the position of others in the ESB who have been more favoured, and are seeking to do it by means which are legitimate and normal in this State.  It is most unsatisfactory that we should be in the position that because of the extreme gravity of the consequences of effective industrial action, we have to deprive them of their rights in this matter.</P>
    <P>The facts are simple enough.  If we take the period from 1959 until the present day, during this period the clerical workers of the ESB have secured an increase in their remuneration from £895 to £1,385.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Get your facts right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The clerical workers have secured increased remuneration at the maximum scale from £895 to £1,385.  That is an increase of more than 50 per cent, about 55 per cent on the maximum.  In the same period industrial, manual workers have not secured similar increases.  Their increases have been less over this period, and this has, indeed, been reflected throughout the community generally, because the lead given in the matter by the clerical workers of the ESB has been followed elsewhere, so that in the community as a whole we have a similar disproportion between the increases obtained by clerical workers and those of other workers.  In this period the clerical workers have increased their living standards by about a quarter while the manual workers have increased them by about 14 or 15 per cent.  These are facts.  This is the situation in which these workers find themselves. It is more than understandable that they should in these circumstances wish to prosecute their claim for better treatment, and it is understandable that they should have a sense of grievance when this differential <i>vis-a-vis</i> the clerical workers is widening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say that I have the greatest sympathy with them in this claim.  It may well be that the full granting of <Col N="819" /> this claim straight away, because of its consequential effects on other groups, could have a very serious effect on the economy, and that the legitimate grievance they have cannot be fully set right, but only gradually. I do not know enough about the facts to be sure, but that could be the case. We have a right in this House to tell the Minister that if to meet this emergency and to protect the rights of workers we give him the temporary powers which he seeks, we expect him to ensure that these are not used to maintain the adverse situation that has grown up in the widening of the difference between the clerical and the manual workers, but that he will ensure, on the contrary, that the position of the manual workers will be examined to ensure that this gap that has appeared will be narrowed and that their position will be improved relative to the better-off workers, and that this principle of the better-off workers getting better-off and the less well-off not succeeding to the same degree is something which must not continue.  We have a right to insist on the Minister giving us some assurance in this matter if we give him the powers he asks for and which we have no alternative but to grant so as not to risk lives and risk employment.</P>
    <P>It is hard to envisage a less satisfactory industrial relations situation than has been allowed to drift over the past five years.  During that period the manual workers' position has deteriorated steadily but nothing has been done about it.  When they try to take action in regard to it, simply because it happens that in their particular bomb there is a nuclear warhead, through no fault of theirs but because of the fact that they are employed in a vital industry, although they have shown their desire to be moderate in the use of it, that weapon is taken away and, that having been taken away, their bargaining position is seriously weakened, and what I here fear is that once these measures have been passed for only, as we hope, a temporary period, some people all round will breathe a sigh of relief and think that it is all right, the enemy has been disarmed and we can now <Col N="820" /> sit back and let the situation carry on because these people can no longer do any damage.</P>
    <P>If we are going to remove from them their only weapon, I want an assurance that their grievance will be properly looked after and that we are not going to give perpetuity to the situation in which they are permanently behind others.  I would like to hear the Minister on that.  The Minister has spoken about the grave situation.  He has spoken persuasively but he has told us nothing about the merits of the case.  He has not even told us what is the present position of these negotiations, whether they are proceeding still&mdash;I am not up to date on this&mdash;whether they are proceeding or have broken down, what prospects he thinks there are of a settlement, but has just left it to us with the fact that there is danger of some kind, presumably because these negotiations might break down, but with no guidance as to how serious or how imminent this danger is.  Considering the fact that we have been asked to accept a closure motion, we should be given more information of what the immediate and imminent situation is.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that there was evidence that these workers have done their best to exercise their powers in a moderate way.  There is strong evidence of this.  The placing of pickets has been carried out in such a way as, generally speaking, to avoid the complete disruption of supplies.  I have reason to believe that yesterday, in fact, the pickets were removed for a few minutes at 4 o'clock to enable the shift to be changed in the Dublin station and thus avoid a breakdown in supplies.  I do not think that is generally known. Those workers get very little credit for anything they do and we in this House should record the fact that they have done that.  As I say, they took steps to remove the pickets to ensure that supplies would not be interrupted. I did not get that information from any source close to the unions but from the other side but I think it is probably correct.  The fact is that those workers have been very badly treated with regard to their claims over the <Col N="821" /> past five years.  Their strike weapon is just too powerful to be employed. There are some countries which have the death sentence where crimes are such that it cannot be imposed.  Those workers are in the position that their strike weapon is so powerful that it is unusable.</P>
    <P>The measures in this Bill are extremely severe on the trade unions. They are not severe on the workers. The fine which has to be paid has to be paid by the trade unions.  The largest trade union in this country would be bankrupt if the full penalty of £5,000 was levied on each worker who did not turn up for work.  It may be that something of this kind is necessary to secure the immediate safeguarding of supplies but this is something which should not be on the Statute Books other than as a temporary measure.  That is why we are asking the Minister to limit its operation to the period of six months.</P>
    <P>There are a couple of points I would like to ask the Minister, which might be gone into in more detail on Committee Stage.  I want to know whether the Bill will apply to workers who will not pass pickets.  Some workers may not pass pickets on their place of employment.  They may not be involved in the actual cessation of work.  What is the position of those workers?  I seems to me that there is some difficulty in the case of a man not passing a picket.  We do not know the Government's mind on this.  It is one thing to apply this kind of thing to workers who are on strike but if we are going to get into the position that any union can become bankrupt overnight, when their workers will not pass pickets, even though the workers of that union may not have any hand in the stoppage of work, this is something which goes beyond the condition even of an emergency situation.  I would ask the Minister to clarify this and tell us what his mind is with regard to it.  Will it apply only as regards workers who are on strike in support of a claim?</P>
    <P>Those are the points I want to make.  I have spoken briefly and I have spoken even faster than customary <Col N="822" /> because I know there are a number of other people who want to speak.  The time has been reduced by half an hour.  I hope these people who were in favour of that will be brave enough to make their contributions and will make them as short as possible so that as many as possible can contribute to this debate.  I hope that several things will emerge from this such as clarification on the point of pickets and a general assurance from the Minister in regard to this question of pickets and the limitation of the Bill so that it will only operate for an emergency period and not be a permanent measure on our Statute Books.</P>

      <P>I shall try to be brief on the Second Reading as well because as a result of the amendment regarding the closure motion proposed by Fine Gael the time for the Second Reading debate has been curtailed to give about 1½ hours to the debate of an amendment which will be quite ineffective. Fine Gael know as well as everybody here that the Fianna Fáil majority in this House will put the Bill through unamended tonight. There is no point at all in all this hypocrisy about this amendment because the Dáil have now gone and the Government want the Bill tonight. Fine Gael have agreed that the Government should get the Bill tonight. Therefore, let us have no more hypocrisy about this measure.  We in the Labour Party are firmly and definitely against the Bill.  We were against a similar type of measure in 1961.  I must go back to 1961 because we had that frightening experience then and what did we do about it?</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach said then that he did not want compulsory arbitration, that he was against it.  We were dealing with the situation in 1961 which required an emergency measure. That difficulty was overcome and as a result a tribunal was appointed to see if we could avoid those difficulties arising in the future.  Busy people were asked to spend their time on that <Col N="823" /> tribunal.  They considered the problems for some months.  They came forward with recommendations.  One of those recommendations was that the Board of the ESB and the unions should sit down and agree on conditions of service generally.  There are various unions in the ESB and the tribunal recommended that they should all sit down and lay down conditions of service and rates of pay.  That was a very sensible contribution towards solving a very difficult problem.  There are a great number of unions involved. That agreement was worked out and it was signed.  What did the Minister do in relation to the other main proposal of the tribunal, that is that the two tribunals should be merged in one?  It was considered in 1961 that the two tribunals were at the root of the trouble in the ESB but what did the Minister do about this?  He did nothing. Senator FitzGerald has already said that because of the circumstances of their employment the strike weapon of those workers is so powerful, because they are employed in the ESB, that it cannot be used.  I suggest the ESB have behaved deliberately in those circumstances.  They know the power of the strike weapon.  They are not prepared to co-operate with those workers in those circumstances.  We know that there are fitters employed with similar skills in other concerns and it has been agreed, and the employers have agreed, that there should be special additional rates of pay because of the skills involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are inclined to think of a fitter as a man who goes along opening and tightening nuts and bolts, which is ridiculous.  Fitters are highly skilled craftsmen.  Their claim has been in since December, 1964, and the Board, with the Minister behind them, have dilly-dallied and behaved in this reactionary way instead of solving the problem before it came to this head. What are the workers supposed to do? Are they supposed to wait another ten years to talk effectively to the Board? One of the complaints is that they never meet the executive of the Board, only a personnel officer who goes to and fro and comes back with a message <Col N="824" /> from the Board.  This is insulting to the people who are attempting to negotiate a settlement.</P>
    <P>I lay particular stress on the Minister sitting here.  A tribunal was appointed five years ago to look at the problem and the Minister has not acted in the responsible way he should have.  I know what the Minister for Transport and Power has been up to because I have experience of that same gentleman in other semi-State bodies. We in the trade union movement have been very conscious that one of the difficulties in trying to negotiate with employers in recent years has been because the leadership, which was originally reasonably progressive, has got into the hands of reactionary elements among the employers, among them representatives of semi-State undertakings governed by and responsible to the Minister for Transport and Power.</P>
    <P>That same Minister tells us he occasionally meets representatives of the semi-State undertakings, the ESB, CIE and Aer Lingus, and that he talks to them about their problems.  I know, and the Minister here knows, that it goes much further than that&mdash;that that Minister directs the policies of these undertakings, that they cannot do anything without his approval&mdash;yet he will say when questioned in the Dáil about them that he has no function.  That has been happening.  I know the people in the semi-State undertakings are embarrassed by the policies they are forced to adopt by the Minister for Transport and Power.</P>
    <P>I shall give the Minister for Industry and Commerce another instance, of which he may be aware.  The situation in CIE is that the Minister for Transport and Power has ignored completely what the Houses of the Oireachtas have said and decided.  The legislation in relation to CIE lays down that that body, in conducting their affairs, shall have regard to the maintenance of reasonable conditions for their employees. The Oireachtas wrote that into the legislation&mdash;reasonable conditions of service for the employees.  We interpret as reasonable what has applied or should apply in other similar employments. That Minister has come <Col N="825" /> along and said, in spite of what the Labour Court or the internal machinery recommend as reasonable, that the Board of CIE must disregard that and refuse to give the conditions laid down in legislation.</P>
    <P>That is an example of the reactionary attitude of the Minister for Transport and Power&mdash;the way he has been going on outside the Houses of the Oireachtas, utilising the semi-State undertakings for the sake of bringing pressure to bear on the trade unions, provoking strikes in many cases.  This prompts the question: have the workers suddenly changed their habits, have they become different to what they were in previous years?  Why all these strikes? It is because the employers have not been prepared to face up to the problems and they have been assisted and, I think, encouraged in many cases by the Minister for Transport and Power.</P>
    <P>Here we have the situation in which the ESB are in difficulties and because of those difficulties the whole country is in a state of crisis and we are asked to approach the problem and attempt to solve it along certain lines.  The lines are ridiculous.  They are an insult to the House, an insult to the Government, an insult to the State.  We are back again to compulsory arbitration and we are for the first time approaching forced labour.</P>
    <P>According to the Bill, people will be compelled to work for the ESB even if they do not wish to.  Is the Minister serious in suggesting that he can get Irish workers to work against their will, that their trade unions will be fined, that the workers will be fined and imprisoned for non-payment of fines, that they will be compelled to work?  The Minister knows we all have within us that bit of Irish, that we are not inclined to tolerate being pressurised. We will take leadership, we will take guidance, but we have not been getting leadership from the Government. We have not been getting it from the semi-State undertakings, from the Minister for Transport and Power. I am inclined to ask what faith workers have in the Minister for Transport and Power.  I think it is nil.</P>
    <P>Now we are asked to approve this <Col N="826" /> measure which will compel the workers, because of the power they have in the strike weapon, to work against their will, where the Board, encouraged and I am sure directed by the Minister for Transport and Power, act the dog and will not agree to have reasonable negotiations on this problem.  Let me remind the House again that this claim was lodged in December, 1964, and that it has not been disposed of.  I suppose many Senators will assume that because these men are very skilled people working for the ESB who pay such good salaries that the rate of pay is very good.  In fact it starts at £13 10s 1d for a fitter working a 42½ hour week in Dublin.  After five years it goes to £15 0s 2d.  Thereafter, increments start &mdash;I shall not bother the House with details&mdash;and after 20 years there is a further pound, bringing the maximum wage up to £16 0s 2d for a 42½ hour week in Dublin.  Elsewhere, a 45 hour week operates and the rates are slightly better, going up to £15 17s 10d after five years and then, after 20 years, there is a further pound a week.  These are not extraordinary rates of pay.</P>
    <P>Many Senators will agree that they are low rates for very skilled craftsmen working for a concern who can afford to pay workers properly and give reasonable conditions of service.  That is not the whole story, and this is the kernel of the problem.  These workers see a supervisor over them, a skilled fitter also, who has been fortunate enough to have been promoted.  They see him getting £34 a week, paid by the same Board.  He has the same skill but he is a supervisor.  He also comes under the other tribunal.  I do not say £34 is reasonable or unreasonable but in relation to the rates I have been talking about it is significant.</P>
    <P>A supervisor has more than double the skilled craftsman under him&mdash;a fantastic situation.  I could not find it anywhere else.  Is it reasonable to tell those workers: &ldquo;Look, you cannot process this claim; you cannot have your right of taking strike action; after nearly two years you still cannot go any further with this, you will have to leave it alone because your right to strike is so great it could give rise to such hardship it would be disastrous <Col N="827" /> to the whole community.  You will have to suffer.&rdquo;  It is the worker here who is suffering.</P>
    <P>I agree we should not have a situation in which the whole community should suffer.  Equally, I do not agree that because of this situation you must make the workers suffer.  You are seeking compulsory arbitration; they cannot take strike action and they must work.  I am saying that this is a ridiculous situation.  It is a step backward in regard to industrial trade union negotiations here in this country; it will not serve any useful purpose.  What we want now is leadership, a word of encouragement and an appeal to these people to try to settle their differences, together with taking the Minister for Transport and Power off the employers' back.  Let them go ahead and reach a settlement without the man in the background over in Kildare Street keeping his finger on them and preventing them reaching a reasonable settlement of this problem.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate, of course, that we have the wrong Minister here tonight. I know he is a very reasonable, nice gentleman and the man who is really behind this whole mess is not here at all.  I would much prefer to be able to say these things to the Minister responsible but he is not here.  However, I have to say them in relation to this measure because, as I said, we had the same problem previously and we had the Taoiseach here in this House dealing with it.  Then certain action was taken and the Minister responsible has done nothing at all about it.  I know he is making many speeches around the country; I do not think that has helped at all.  It seems to annoy everybody when that Minister makes a speech.  He is unfortunate in that respect; that cannot be helped. What can be helped is that the Government maintain a Minister in that position, who has twice brought this country to the verge of disaster and has done nothing at all about it. What did he do about the pickets? He phoned the President of Congress to ask him to do something about it. Was that when he came back from America?  I am saying we have a <Col N="828" /> ridiculous situation here.  This sort of measure will not solve the difficulties of the ESB.  What we want is to get rid of the Minister for Transport and Power, allow the Board of the ESB to negotiate properly with these people to see that they get justice and remove this grievance where you have a skilled craftsman being paid about £16 and a supervisor over him £34.</P>
    <P>There are other important features of this Bill.  I promise to be brief as I am sure many of my colleagues will wish to speak as well.  They will not have much time.  I am afraid that by the time Fine Gael get in on their futile amendment we will not have much time after that.  I want to suggest that what is being done is in contravention of the ILO Convention; it is also in contravention of the ILO Convention regarding forced labour.  I want to suggest that it is a ridiculous situation that this Government, after abiding by those Conventions, should put through this measure and, perhaps, find this brought before the Bar, the ILO or whatever is the appropriate way of doing these things in regard to the situation where people can be forced to work.  I know the Minister will say: &ldquo;Well look, we will not bring in this measure unless it is necessary&rdquo; but we know, of course, that he is rushing this through in a situation where a strike is already in operation and where negotiations are continuing.  I do not think that a hasty measure like this, ill-conceived and which will give rise to great difficulties in many respects, will help these negotiations or will result in immediate settlement.</P>
    <P>As I said before, we are all Irishmen. Why should we hold the gun up to these people and say:&mdash;&ldquo;You will be fined and imprisoned&rdquo;.  What would help far more is if the Government were to say:&mdash;&ldquo;Look, hold back on this, get ahead with your negotiations&rdquo;&mdash;pulling the Minister for Transport and Power off the back of the Board of the ESB.  I hope that they would, in those circumstances, settle this matter within the next few days.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say, at the outset, that I, and I am sure all the <Col N="829" /> Members of the House, have great sympathy for the manual workers in the ESB, to whom Senator Murphy has referred.  I offer them sympathy in that if there is a claim which has been pending for some time, for a just claim, and this claim does not appear to have been made, then they are being asked to exercise restraint; if that is so.  They are, of course, entitled to proper remuneration in respect of the nature of the work they do.  But, having said that, I must also say that they, and we here, as Members of this Legislature, have our responsibility. Our responsibilities have been conferred on us by Article 40 of the Constitution which says:</P>
      <P>The State guarantees in its laws to respect and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen.</P>
      <P>I repeat:</P>
      <P>... to respect and, as far as practicable, to defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen.</P>
      <P>It was suggested this evening that it is an insult to this House, to the Government and to the State on whom that responsibility has been cast, to ask us to defend and vindicate those personal rights which are so much enshrined in our Constitution and, indeed, which are so dear and so essential to every Irishman and to every free man everywhere because the rights referred to are not just rights of property; they are rights of health and even of life itself.  This matter has been mentioned many times.  I do not need to repeat it now, but I do want to say that this House has that responsibility and if we shrink that responsibility now, we are failing to fulfil our obligation to the people and, I think, we are failing to fulfil our obligation to ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The greater the responsibility any man or any Legislature has to face the greater the restraint they must exercise on many occasions.  I do not for a minute suggest that these 100 fitters in the ESB are not being asked to exercise great restraint but I say that this restraint is a condition of the responsibility which they have.  If we <Col N="830" /> as members of the Legislature or the Government or the President himself, in each office we occupy have responsibility, that responsibility is only proportionate to the restraint that we on many occasions must exercise in the interests of the community as a whole. That is not being preached sufficiently nowadays.  It is not a question of workers needing leadership from anybody. The workers themselves realise, and must be reminded at all times, that they have a common responsibility with everyone else in this matter and I am sure they are more than willing to accept this fact.</P>
    <P>If a situation arises in which the economic well-being&mdash;and that in my view is a very small consideration by comparison with other aspects of the whole country&mdash;may be completely thrown into jeopardy by the actions of a few, we have a right to ask them to exercise that restraint which their position demands of them.  If the very health and life of that community is in danger, we have a right to ask them to exercise that restraint from all sides.  We ask ourselves, we ask them and we ask all people to do this. There has been far too much suggestion of the black on one side, from the union point of view and the white on the other, from the employers' point of view and we see ourselves on opposite sides with opposite interests.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy may find possibly through tedious negotiations that the fault lies exclusively, as he says, in the fact that, to quote him, &ldquo;the employers have not been prepared to face up to the problem.&rdquo;  That may well be. On the other hand, some of the fault may lie with the workers also.  It is about time employers and workers realise that they and the Government and members of all Parties have corresponding responsibility and that that national and public responsibility demands of us that we think in terms of the whole community.  Even to the detriment of ourselves we must do that.  This is what the Government are now asking us to accept.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made it very clear that it is hoped never to use the power which is being sought in this Bill and it is hoped in fact that these people <Col N="831" /> will exercise the restraint to which I have referred but what we must consider is that if for even one moment because of the great power which they have, severe pressure forced them to withdraw their labour and place pickets, if one life were placed in danger because of that, we here are condoning a withdrawal of labour or anything of that sort as a principle which is more valuable than the principle of life itself.</P>
    <P>We all hope the power being sought in this Bill will never be used.  I think the Minister has said this&mdash;the Taoiseach has said it&mdash;and the members of the Labour Party must appreciate this fully&mdash;and I agree with them in this: the first fundamental is voluntary negotiation but we must face the fact that any of us may have to exercise restraint.  That is what we are asking those men to do.  It has been said that this action is coming too late.  Possibly that was not what Senator FitzGerald was implying in respect of this particular action but that much should have been done earlier to avoid this action.  Members of the Labour Party reasonably enough have suggested it is coming too soon and that we should wait to see if the situation will not mend itself.  We all hope that it will and I trust the Government will make every effort to see that it will mend itself but it cannot be too soon if one single picket is placed which interferes with this very necessary supply to the whole nation, with the life, the economy and every other aspect of the nation.</P>
    <P>I am not aware&mdash;I have said this before in the House&mdash;of much that has passed in this House in the way of legislation, nor am I aware of the difficulties that have been experienced in negotiations by the ESB or any other bodies: what I am aware of now is that at this moment we are being asked to accept this responsibility in ease of the health, wealth and life of the nation and if we refuse to accept it, we are hardly worthy of it ourselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>Several other Senators obviously want to speak on this Bill, so I shall confine my speech <Col N="832" /> to two very brief essential points as I see them.  First, let me emphasise that I am in favour of doing everything possible to avoid the appalling consequences of a total breakdown in electric power, provided that no violation of justice is involved.  The results may well be appalling as we know from the papers, in medical circles and, as Senator Kennedy has just said, there may be deaths of infants and adults if there is no electricity to supply incubators and operating theatres.</P>
      <P>All the same, in spite of that, I cannot support this Bill because, in my opinion, section 5 violates a primary right of every adult human being&mdash;the right to refuse to work in what he considers to be unjust conditions and the right to try to persuade his fellow workers to support him in his struggle against what he believes to be injustice. The effect of section 5, as I see it, will be to impose on some of our fellow-citizens a choice between resigning their present work or else accepting specially unfavourable conditions of service.  I cannot, in conscience, support that.  Obviously, as I said, the maintenance of electric power is of supreme importance but I do not think the end justifies the means, and I believe that this kind of legal coercion will only make the workers angrier and more stubborn and I personally would not blame them for it.</P>
      <P>If these ESB workers are of unique importance to the State, why should we penalise them as we are doing in this Bill?  In other spheres of economics, the more important one's work is the more highly one is remunerated. If the ESB workers can be persuaded &mdash;not coerced&mdash;to relinquish their rights for the sake of the common weal or for the sake of financial inducements, well and good, but in my opinion, it would be unjust and tyrannical&mdash;and I use the word with full recognition of all its implications &mdash;to compel them to give up these rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, I do agree that workers should not be put under pressure not to work when they want to work; in other words, picketing, I think, should be restricted and restrained in certain circumstances and <Col N="833" /> I would support proper legislation to that end.  I would also most heartily support legislation to prevent the iniquities of the closed shop and restrictive practices of various kinds but that is another story.  What is essentially at stake this evening is a fundamental civic freedom and so I must oppose this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggested earlier that for the first time we were engaged this evening in this House in a dangerous&mdash;I think I described it as an irregular and certainly an unprecedented&mdash;exercise. When I rise to speak here, to exercise my right as a Member of the House, I find myself in the extraordinary position that if I speak at any length, or if I try to deal adequately with the Bill, I am going to deny my colleagues on the Labour Benches and every other Member of the House the right to speak at all. Surely, that is not good parliamentary procedure?  Surely, we should not be expected to deal with some of the important problems of this State at the moment in this manner and in this atmosphere?</P>
      <P>We have before us a piece of legislation which purports to deal with a situation.  I think that is the term that is used.  If we look at this Bill in any context, we find that it provides no solution whatever to the problem with which it is proposed to deal.  This, in the opinion of any unbiased mind, must be regarded as the most hastily prepared, the most dangerous but the most far-reaching piece of legislation that probably has ever been introduced in this or the other House.</P>
      <P>By virtue of the circumstances I have alluded to, I must of necessity confine my comments on it to three or four of the most important aspects by way of headings rather than by way of arguments or by way of any sort of reasonable discussion.  Let me point out in passing that section 2, for instance, is, in my view, and I think in the view of people who are much better qualified to pass any judgment on it, entirely contrary to the International Convention on Forced Labour, to which this country is, in fact, a subscriber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here, we are expected to pass&mdash;in <Col N="834" /> fact we are now in the position of being obliged, with the connivance of the Fine Gael Party and the Government Party on this measure&mdash;to pass by 10 o'clock tonight this particularly obnoxious piece of legislation.  It has been pointed out that this Bill solves nothing and will solve nothing by its passage through this House tonight. It remedies nothing and to anybody with any regard for the maintenance of fair democratic institutions and fair standards of industrial relations in this country, it would appear that we should not have any part in it or any part in passing it.</P>
    <P>This type of legislation should never be operated.  It should not be allowed to remain for one moment on the Statute Book in any democracy.  Unfortunately, whether we like it or not, this particular Bill is going to pass on to our Statute Book and we on these Labour Benches can do no more than protest.  Protest we will and we will go on protesting against either the consideration or the enactment of this type of legislation whenever it is introduced in this House.</P>
    <P>I have made my contribution and I am sure my colleagues are anxious to make theirs and for that reason I will say no more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrosnahan" hpid="Mr. Brosnahan Mr. Brosnahan">

      <P>This power crisis really has been a blessing in disguise. It is a deplorable situation where the industry and the life of the community generally are in danger of being brought to a standstill by a strike of electricity supply fitters.  But, really, examine it carefully and you will see, and I think you will agree with me, that this is one of the best things that have happened because it is time that this nonsense which has been going on in the country over the past few years was highlighted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the year 1964, there were 87 strikes.  In the year 1965, there were 89 strikes, involving a loss of over half a million man days to industry, to the community and to the prosperity of the nation.  In actual fact, the number of man days lost was 601,859 in two years, not taking into account at all what has happened since 1st January, 1966.  Therefore, I say that it is a great <Col N="835" /> thing that this crisis has developed because it places direct responsibility on those in authority to take action in this matter.</P>
    <P>It is all right to come in here and preach about our responsibility to the community but the State has responsibility to the community also.  It has sat on the fence in this matter.  It has adopted a <i>laissez faire</i> attitude, that things will work themselves out; if workers go on strike, let them off; they will come back.  The majority of them come back on the winning side.  Therefore, the community at large is more or less held up to ransom and industry loses, money is lost to the State, we are losing markets&mdash;all because of this sit-on-the-fence policy.  I agree with the suggestion that we have all got our responsibility to the community but the community also has a responsibility to itself and people in authority, in turn, have a responsibility to the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>There are symptoms and I have referred to them&mdash;87 of them in 1964 and 89 in 1965&mdash;which indicate that our society is ill.  Whilst it is very nice to examine the symptoms of the ailment, we have to do something to get down to the root of the disease.  Strike has followed strike.  A war of attrition has developed between workers and employers.  People have sat back and done nothing about it.  The time has come, and to reiterate what I have said, this is it.  This crisis which has developed has brought us to our senses at last.  We have to do something.</P>
    <P>I hope that when I sit down, I will hot be left in a position where I have not made any constructive suggestion because one thing I do detest is destructive criticism.  In the Dáil last night, half an hour after a very prominent member of the Opposition had concluded his speech the Taoiseach said that be had made no constructive suggestion whatever, that his attitude towards it was entirely destructive and just critical.</P>
    <P>I am an official of an association which is affiliated to the Irish Trade Union Congress for a long number of years and has remained loyal to the Congress although in actual fact, from <Col N="836" /> our point of view as teachers, they had very little materially to give us.  Yet, we felt that we owed a loyalty to organised trade unionism in the country and we have always remained loyal to the Irish Trade Union Congress although at times we have each gone our different ways and have contradicted each other on very many occasions.  But, as an official of a trade union, I would have strongly to oppose this legislation because I cannot logically and in all decency ask my own people to take action on this problem or that problem if I am, at the same time, going to support legislation which will deny the right to take strike action to other people.</P>
    <P>I have a feeling that this whole legislation was brought in here in an atmosphere of panic and that the two Houses have not done credit to themselves by the way this matter has been rushed through.  I think that at the moment the legislation is unnecessary and, in view of the improvement in the situation as between the fitters and the ESB, might have been deferred so that if in actual fact it did become necessary it could be introduced.</P>
    <P>From my experience of dealing with negotiations and so on, I am of opinion that this Bill is provocative, that it will do more harm than good, and I know there are many people on the Government side who have the same feeling, that this will do more harm than good in the long term, especially if it is going to remain as permanent legislation.</P>
    <P>We have to make some effort to come to grips with the situation.  In deference to the other Senators who wish to speak, I will conclude by saying that, in order to achieve a just social order there has to be co-operation and co-responsibility at all levels. If we are to have a cohesive, harmonious society, we have to have harmony and co-operation and I do not think we can achieve it by having tribunals here and tribunals there.  We have two in relation to the ESB.  They were contradictory.  They never came together to see how they would deal with the various classes within the ESB itself.</P>
    <P>This is the suggestion I have to make &mdash;that all those people who have conciliation <Col N="837" /> machinery at the present time should be allowed to maintain it and those who have not got it should have some form of direct negotiation with their employers and managements, and, when matters break down at conciliation level, all disagreements in the matter of claims should be referred to a national council for wages and salaries. This should be a broad council of about 15 people, chosen because of their experience in various fields of activity, taken from all levels of society, from the various disciplines, from agriculture and from industry.  It <Col N="838" /> should be such a broad board because we have a feeling that, where there has been an appointee by the Government, an appointee by employers and an appointee by trade unionists&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To add a further subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>(7)  This Act shall continue in force until the 31st December, 1966, and shall then expire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an amendment to provide that this Act shall expire on 31st December of this year.  In this Bill, we are dealing with an emergency situation.  The best remedy available to the Houses of the Oireachtas at the present time to cope with this situation is what is provided for us by the Government, in the judgment of the Government, and that is the remedy they propose. It seems to me that it is the only remedy, whether it be a very good one <Col N="839" /> or a poor one, available to us in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, things that should have been done and I believe that still can be done in order to avoid the operation of this Bill, when enacted. I do not see any reason why, when the country was faced with so grave an emergency as the cutting-off of all electricity supplies, the Taoiseach, who has time to go to so many meetings, who has time to address so many chambers of commerce, who has time to attend so many dinners and who has time to waste on all that kind of thing, has no time to call in the representatives of labour and management to discuss this problem with them.  When there were votes to be got out of it, the Taoiseach was to be seen by the representatives of labour and management in the formulation of the National Wages Agreement that led to the 12 per cent increase. There were votes for that in the Taoiseach's two by-elections. However, the Taoiseach has not busied himself with this problem, as far as the public are aware.  I would hope that the Taoiseach, with his great skill, considerable powers of persuasion and the authority his office commands, even if he himself does not command authority in modern times&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are these remedies available.  I hope that, before this Bill is operated at all, recourse will be had to them.  Remember that what we are discussing here in this Bill as it is presented to us is a piece of permanent legislation.  I think it is an impudence on the part of the Government to ask Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann, within a confined space of time which it is in their power to limit, to pass into permanent legislation a restrictive measure of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite clear that the Government have allowed this situation to develop.  They wanted it to develop to <Col N="840" /> the stage where they could then come in and, for all time, have a piece of legislation on record which they could apply in order to deal with the situation which was arising in the matter of electricity.  There is no need for this legislation to be permanent in form. The purpose of this amendment is that if this legislation is to be applied, it should operate only for the limited period up to the end of this year.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Minister for Industry and Commerce why it is necessary to have this permanently on the Statute Book.  This legislation was either thought out in a hurry in order to deal with an emergency situation or else it represents the considered view over a long period of the Government. If it was thought out in a hurry and has only been got together in the past few days, then the Government should not ask the Oireachtas to pass this legislation, which has been hastily thought out, into permanent form.  On the other hand, if the Government say that that is not the position and that this Bill represents what they have been thinking over a long period, then I suggest it is rather a disgrace on the part of the Government to bring in a piece of legislation allegedly to deal with the present situation and are now using the guillotine to have it enacted into permanent form.  I do not think this House should agree to that and therefore I think this amendment should be accepted.</P>
    <P>There are many precedents for legislation enacted for short periods.  We have the innocuous legislation in relation to the relief of rates, which is passed every two years.  We have the financial legislation in relation to housing grants which was passed for only two years, and when that piece of legislation expired, a new Bill had to be brought in.  In a case of this kind, I do not see why the House should be asked to pass a measure which was drafted in a hurry, without consultation with labour and management and without giving adequate time to the Houses of the Oireachtas to consider it.  Remember that the Offences Against the State Act was operated against people who picketed outside Dáil Éireann.  It was operated against young girl telephonists from the Post Office who were going to <Col N="841" /> shake the foundations of the State by walking outside Leinster House.  That piece of legislation was enacted in 1939 in circumstances in which a war was pending.  It was enacted in a hurry.  It was a bad piece of legislation and it has been condemned time out of number by every political theorist and politician.</P>

      <P>That piece of legislation was passed in a hurry.  It was bad and repressive legislation.  It abrogates the right of the individual. We on this side of the House want to ensure this evening that this particular Bill will continue in force for only a limited period, in order to deal with an emergency.  I can see no justification for asking for its enactment as permanent legislation to deal with what the Government apparently anticipate will be a recurrent situation.  It has been drafted in a matter of days, hastily and indeed badly in many ways, but certainly hastily drafted, and the time for its discussion has been limited by the various motions passed in the Dáil and in this House.  I hope the Labour Party and other Members of this House will ensure that this piece of legislation will not be enacted within the next few days as permanent legislation.</P>

      <P>This is a very clever piece of politics.  Fine Gael want to show that they are voting for the <Col N="842" /> measure and then they want to turn around and show they are against it in some way.  Senator O'Quigley and Senator Garret FitzGerald know quite well that they have already voted for this legislation to be put through the Seanad tonight.  They know the Dáil is not sitting.  The Government, with the support of Fine Gael, want to get this into operation.  The amendment is quite simple.  It says that the Act shall continue in force until 31st December and shall then expire.  The Labour Party do not favour the Act continuing in force until 31st December, 1966.  The Labour Party do not favour the Act being in operation at all.  Therefore, standing firmly on the principle of being against it all the time, we are opposing the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal with this particular point.  It is perfectly true there is provision for us to deal with orders as they arise; but the point we are making is that we do not believe this Bill is the last word on the subject of how to deal permanently with the problem of industrial action in the ESB.  We feel this matter of the form of the legislation and its provisions should be reconsidered after this emergency and so as to leave ample time for the emergency to be got over and for the Government to deal with it, we are providing a period of six months.  I am surprised that the Labour Party should want to oppose this amendment and make this legislation permanent.  Their attitude in regard to this Bill has been rather peculiar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">

      <P>To endeavour to talk it out and prevent its being <Col N="843" /> discussed earlier on by raising procedural issues did not suggest they were considering their responsibilities seriously.  That they should vote in favour of this legislation being permanent shows an entirely frivolous attitude to the legislation.  Our position on this is clear and consistent.  The Bill is necessary at this stage because of the danger of the present situation.  But it should be limited to the shortest period possible simply to give us time to think this matter out as to how it should best be dealt with.  Therefore, we are pressing the amendment on that basis. Judging by the results of the last vote, if we had the backing of the Labour Party, we would come near to pressing it so far that the Government would have to recall the Dáil.  But in view of the lack of that backing and the attitude of the Labour Party, the possibility of preventing this legislation from remaining in operation permanently, is removed from us.  We are left now in the situation where we will have this legislation on the Statute Book indefinitely.  This is regrettable. It is regrettable that we ever should have it at all.  We have no alternative in that matter because too much is at stake.  For a Party who take their responsibilities seriously to vote against a measure when by so doing we might disrupt the country's economy and endanger life is something we are not prepared to do.  But we are also not prepared to vote on this as a suitable permanent measure for dealing with the problems of the ESB.  We will vote for the amendment, whether or not we get any support from the Party who purports to represent the interests of the workers.</P>

      <P>I take it the effect of the amendment is that the Bill will come into operation immediately and remain in force until 31st December, 1966? That being the case, I am totally opposed to it because under section 1 of the Bill, the Act does not come into operation at all, even if it is passed today &ldquo;save as and when and for so long as is provided by the subsequent subsections of this section&rdquo;.  Under subsection (2) the Act comes into operation <Col N="844" /> when the Government make an order.  The subsection reads:</P>
      <P>Whenever and so often as the Government are satisfied that, in consequence of a trade dispute, there is a serious disruption of electricity supplies or imminent danger of such disruption, the Government may by order declare that they are satisfied as aforesaid and appoint a day on which this Act shall come into operation.</P>
      <P>It cannot possibly come into operation until an order is made.  In turn, the order cannot be made by the Government, unless and until it is passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>Senator FitzGerald has spoken already.  I did not interrupt him and neither did anyone else in this House.  I expect from him a similar courtesy.  I have given him reasons why, in my view, this amendment should not be accepted.  The wording of the amendment is that the Act shall continue in force until 31st December, 1966 and shall then expire.  &ldquo;Continue in force&rdquo; and &ldquo;come into operation&rdquo; are, in my view, one and the same thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree at all with the Senator who has just alleged that the subsection to be added is in substitution for anything already in the Bill.  The continued inclusion of subsection (2) covers the point relative to the Government making the order.  Consequently, the addition of the subsection clearly sets out that it is the intention that the Act shall <Col N="845" /> continue in force until a particular date and shall then expire.  After the expiry of that date, the Government will not have the power to make further orders relative to the enactment of this Bill.  We are particularly strong on this in view of the fact that this was regarded by the Government as being such a hot number that it was not even circulated to the Members of the Oireachtas after it had been drafted.</P>

      <P>While that is true, Sir, the latest interruptions have been most rewarding because they have indicated an addition to the list of mistakes the Government are making. They regret that the mistake made by the Taoiseach on this occasion was that this Bill was not circulated in due time.  Since 1961, the Minister for Transport and Power has sat down on the job and has failed to implement the assurances that were given and to create the conditions that could have averted the necessity for this kind of legislation.</P>
      <P>This is a panic measure introduced in circumstances of such great secrecy that its circulation was confined to Party Leaders up to a certain hour. There was almost as much panic, almost as much secrecy, attached to the circulation of this document as there was on the only other occasions with which I can compare it, when the Oireachtas had to be hurriedly convened in order to recognise the sovereignty of King George VI or the abdication of King Edward VIII.</P>

      <P>To return to this amendment, the advantage of this subsection, if we are to regard the legislation as necessary, as we do regard it in the circumstances of the moment, is that this panic legislation will not remain permanently on the Statute Book. Nothing whatever was done between 1961 and 1966 by way of preparing the public, preparing the parties vitally interested, whether employees or employers, for the situation.  The Press had no opportunity of passing comment one way or another on the contents of this Bill and the electorate, the general public, got no opportunity whatever of advising their elected representatives as to what they would wish them to do.</P>
      <P>Therefore we had to make an <i>ad hoc</i> decision in relation to this panic measure.  It has not been examined properly as the time has not been available.  No opportunity has been provided for amending it in the way that permanent legislation would require. The intention of this amendment, therefore, is to bring the operation of this measure to an end on 31st December of this year.</P>

What the amendment would appear to seek to do would be to decide that in every situation of crisis in regard to electric power there should be emergency legislation, or as Senator FitzGerald said, that this legislation should be replaced by another form of permanent legislation to deal with such a crisis.  The way this Bill is drafted, it will not be active unless, in the presence of a trade dispute in the ESB which is likely to cause a serious disruption in the supply of electricity, the Government make an order.  If there is no serious disruption of electricity supply this Bill never becomes operative.</P>

    <P>Rather than look forward to a possible change in the legislation or rather than depend on a series of emergency <Col N="847" /> measures, I have hopes, and I expressed them today in the Dáil, that we shall get back to the much more desirable voluntary negotiation of an arrangement which would give us security in our supplies of electricity. This is what we must aim at, because, as Senators have pointed out, our community is in a bad way if we can look forward only to fighting one another in these matters.</P>
    <P>I do not think this amendment would add anything to the Bill.  Indeed, by suggesting that we must either come again with permanent legislation or that we must have emergency legislation in times of crisis, the Fine Gael Party are overlooking the possibility of a voluntary arrangement negotiated by the workers and the Board of the ESB.</P>

      <P>If the Minister is hopeful of a voluntary arrangement and if there is any reality in that hope, is it not quite clear that this would be only temporary legislation and that he ought to write it into the Bill?  Does he think for a moment that he is going to show his <i>bona fides</i> to the people who he hopes will make this voluntary arrangement by putting this legislation on the Statute Book, or is it that he does not believe he would be able to get a voluntary arrangement unless he has this big stick to wave over them?</P>

      <P>This Bill, no matter what the Minister says, is intended to be in force in 1967, 1968, 1969 and so on.  If the Minister really believes it is possible, as I think it ought to be, to reach a voluntary arrangement that will ensure the continuity of electricity <Col N="848" /> supplies, it is quite clear that he ought not to hold any big stick over the employees, and that he ought to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>On this amendment Senator Garret FitzGerald suggested that the attitude of the Labour Party was peculiar in dealing with the Bill both in the other House and here. I do not know how he could arrive at that conclusion.  I think even the most neutral observer, having listened to a very able advocate like Senator Garret FitzGerald, can come to only one conclusion. Senator Garret FitzGerald pointed out, in a way that few people are competent to do, that this has been going on since 1961.  The speeches made in 1961 by the Taoiseach in this Chamber and in the Lower House are word for word the speeches made in both Houses today by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and by the Taoiseach in the other House.  They are exactly the same: &ldquo;national interest&rdquo;, &ldquo;danger to public health&rdquo;, &ldquo;the danger of somebody dying because of failure of electricity supply&rdquo;. They used every hare they could. &ldquo;Frighten the general public&rdquo; was the attitude of the Taoiseach and his Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Garret FitzGerald pointed that out, and he also said that five years have elapsed and nothing has been done.  He proceeded in a factual way to point out that the pay of the fitters involved approximates to £16, while that of the supervisors who are in a similar category, except that they are supervisors, is around £35.  He also said, and rightly so, that as a result of the deliberations of the Committee which was set up recently to inquire into the strata and the pay of the clerical grades of the Civil Service, presided over by another expert, it was discovered that the rates of pay, for instance, of clerical officers, particularly in the ESB, has jumped 50 per cent between 1959 and the present day, while that of the manual workers&mdash; and these are the people accused of holding the country up to ransom&mdash;has risen by only 15 or 16 per cent.  He made the case that the fitters were downtrodden, badly treated, and yet <Col N="849" /> were doing special work.  What is his solution to their genuine case?  His solution is to support the Government in putting these workers further down.</P>
    <P>Now, his one claim at this moment, becauses he realises it is a very bad line to take, is that perhaps there is a way out for Fine Gael.  Perhaps, he thinks, we can hoodwink the 40,000 workers who voted against the individual who shall be nameless in the recent Presidential election, the 40,000 who are not Fine Gael and who will never be Fine Gael, but at least he wants to hoodwink them.  I do not know why this is making Fianna Fáil happy.  Between now and 9.30, both Parties will go into the Division Lobby at least five times and vote on this and I do not think they should be fighting with each other at this stage.</P>

      <P>If the Minister accepted this amendment tonight and a similar crisis occurred 12 months from now, then obviously another Bill would have to be introduced which, in effect, means that this amendment is meaningless.  The Fine Gael Party are not unaware of this.  The purpose of the amendment is very obvious.  Fine Gael are anxious that the Labour people who voted for their candidate last week should continue to vote for Fine Gael <Col N="852" /> in the future and any misinterpretation of this action tonight might deceive the Labour voters.  On the other hand, the Labour Party only lent them those votes last week and they want them back.  They would not go into the Division Lobby at any price&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This legislation has given rise to considerable publicity and outside this House it has in many cases created an atmosphere of tension and of expectation and it is not in the interests of the House, or of the workers involved, that we should go through this same situation again should an emergency appear to be imminent and should we have to rush to introduce further legislation.

      <P>I do not agree with the point of view that it is too much of a business getting such legislation through if a crisis should occur again.  I think the oftener this fuss is made the better if there is a crisis, and if there is a crisis, there should be seen to be a crisis and we should have all this fuss all over again, if necessary, every couple of months until the more basic solutions of this difficulty are arrived at.</P>

      <P>One point I should like to make in relation to this amendment is, first of all, we are in a situation where if the Minister gets this Bill through and it becomes effective he will tomorrow, or within the next couple of days, put this Bill into operation?  If he will, our argument that it should terminate on 31st December holds good.  That is why I think our suggestion should be accepted, particularly by the Labour representatives, that is assuming the Minister will put this into effect as soon as he can reasonably do so.  It is all very well to talk about this Bill becoming effective at some unnamed future date, and so on, but why are we here today?  We are here because the Government have decided apparently to put this Bill through and, as has been said, to use it as a big stick on those who intend to take strike action.  Assuming the Bill comes into effect before the end of this week, our amendment that it should continue only until 31st December is certainly a practical suggestion.  It seems then that at least we will have put a time limit on this type of legislation which has proved to be so objectionable not only in this House but outside it.</P>
      <P>As Senator O'Quigley has mentioned, there are other Acts and it is a pity there were not some amendments like this when they were going through.  We would feel happier now if that had been done.</P>

      <P>It would be useless to put this Bill through if this amendment were carried because it would mean you would have to bring in a similar Bill each time any similar crisis arose.  We know that it is only in the event of a crisis that this legislation will be used.</P>

I would be in total agreement with him because when Fianna Fáil were not in office, there certainly was not the same amount of electricity being used because 95,000 people were out of work anyway.  We would not like to stand here and allow a few people for their own personal advantage, irrespective of how strong their case might be, who could succeed by orderly negotiation because they occupy key positions to try to force the pace and deprive thousands of people of their livelihood.</P>

      <P>We just do not seem to have our position clear on this.  We do not feel this should be limited to six months and new legislation brought in when each emergency occurs.  Senator Jessop suggested alternative legislation.  If the Minister succeeds in getting a voluntary solution to this difficulty, then we hope to get permanent legislation and not rush it in 30 hours.  We are not satisfied and I am not satisfied that this is the best solution.  We would like to see that the Government would in six months, if the need for such a Bill arises, reintroduce legislation to which we would give adequate consideration.  If in fact this Bill is retained in its present form, in an emergency what will come into operation is this Bill, whether or not it is the best solution to the emergency.  That is our concern.  I think from the speeches on the other side and from what the Minister has said that there is a genuine <Col N="857" /> misunderstanding of the point we are making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our point is a valid one and a fair one.  I regret we have not the support of the Labour Party and other people <Col N="858" /> in our efforts to shorten the life of the Bill.</P>
