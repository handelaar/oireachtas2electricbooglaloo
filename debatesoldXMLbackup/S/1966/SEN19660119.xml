      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity, Sir, of correcting a statistic which I gave in error last week; the Minister partly corrected me but I want to complete the correction. Unfortunately, my source for the county populations inadvertently gave me the county borough population for Waterford rather than that for the whole county.  The former is 28,000 and the latter is 74,000.  Therefore, there is one bed for every 270 people approximately in Waterford as against one bed per 1,000 population in Mayo.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 2 and 3 as on the Order Paper.  The Seanad will note that there are quite a number of motions on the Order Paper and it is desirable that we should deal with them as expeditiously as possible before Bills, which may impede the possibility of discussion, come in.  In view of the fact that we have been discussing motion No. 3 and that it is desirable to conclude it, I wonder could we get an idea of how many speakers there will be and when Senator Sheehy Skeffington could be allowed to reply.  I have the idea that we should sit tomorrow morning at 10.30 also so that if we conclude No. 3 tonight, we can deal with No. 5.</P>

    <Title>Diseases of Animals Bill, 1965: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a second time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Farmers in this country and elsewhere sustain very considerable losses every year through diseases and pests in their herds and flocks.  In Ireland, these losses are almost certainly not less than £25 million.  This is equivalent to £100 a year for every farmer in the country. In addition, the existence of certain animal diseases can be a barrier to international trade in livestock and livestock products.</P>
      <P>It was in this context that the campaign for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis, which reached a successful conclusion a few months ago, was launched in 1954 and that in 1964 a comprehensive programme for the eradication and control of several further diseases and conditions was set forth as a major objective of veterinary policy in the Brown Book dealing with agriculture in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the main purposes of this Bill is to provide a suitable up-to-date statutory basis for this programme.  The basic <Col N="915" /> enactment governing the control of animal disease in this country became law as long ago as 1894.  Amendments of that Act have, however, become necessary over the years and many of its sections have been repealed, altered, become obsolete or are inapplicable to our circumstances here.  The Act is also in a number of respects rigid and inflexible and, as can be understood, does not give adequate powers for the control and treatment of diseases that were not of public concern when it became law.  The Act applied also to Britain and Northern Ireland, but in both these areas, it has been repealed and replaced by consolidated legislation; in Britain by an Act of 1950 and in Northern Ireland by an Act of 1958.</P>
    <P>There are at present fifteen separate enactments dealing with animal health and disease in this country.  Several of these measures amend preceding legislation and it is becoming increasingly difficult to ascertain readily the precise legal position when the many animal disease problems confronting my Department and the general public come to be considered.  In my opinion, the time has come for this body of legislation to be consolidated in a single Act and this among other things, the Bill at present before the House seeks to do.</P>
    <P>In consolidating the existing legislation, many of the excellent provisions of the earlier enactments have been retained as, indeed, they have also been in the consolidating legislation passed in Britain and Northern Ireland.  All the provisions of the Diseases of Animals (Bovine Tuberculosis) Act, 1957, which is repealed by the present measure, have been incorporated in the Bill which also includes many useful provisions of the consolidated legislation in Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes, however, to go much further than a mere consolidation of existing legislation.  It is designed also to provide not only for the specific diseases and conditions whose control or eradication is indicated in the Brown Book as the immediate <Col N="916" /> objective of veterinary policy, but also, so far as can be foreseen, for future developments in the sphere of the control or eradication of animal disease.</P>
    <P>I do not propose at this stage to go in very great detail into all the new provisions of the Bill, but I should like in particular to refer to the list of animals and diseases to which the Bill applies as indicated in the First Schedule.</P>
    <P>In the Diseases of Animals Acts applicable to this country up to 1957, specific provision for slaughter and compensation in the case of epizootic diseases was made for each particular disease and, in the 1957 Bovine Tuberculosis Act, the treatment of affected animals and the conditions under which they could be taken up under compensation were spelled out in detail in the statute.  The consolidated Acts of 1950 and 1958 in Britain and Northern Ireland, adopted the same practice.  Both of these enactments contain detailed provisions dealing with the different diseases separately.</P>
    <P>A simpler and more straightforward method is adopted in the present Bill. Parts I and II of the First Schedule contain a list of 23 different species of animals and poultry to which the Bill may be applied and Part III is divided into two Classes, one, Class A, indicating 11 epizootic diseases to which compulsory slaughter and compensation provisions may be applied, and the other, Class B, listing four enzootic diseases, for which this method of treatment would not be suitable.  Any other animal or bird or any other disease may be added to the Schedule by Statutory Order and, indeed, any particular disease schedule under Class A may, should the need arise, be removed from that Class and scheduled under Class B and <i>vice versa</i>.  The eradication measures set out in section 19 and the following sections, may, as in the case, for instance, of bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis, be applied to Class B diseases, but this does not mean that these measures will be automatically applied to all diseases scheduled under this class.  The Second Schedule to the Bill contains very wide powers under <Col N="917" /> which Orders may be made applying specific provisions to particular diseases.  The eradication provisions relating to Class B diseases will be applied only if, having regard to the characteristics of the particular disease and other relevant considerations, such a course of action would be advisable. The effect of these provisions is that virtually all diseases and adverse conditions that can at present be foreseen, may be expeditiously dealt with by means of an appropriate Statutory Order.</P>
    <P>Statutory Orders under the Act are required to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as they are made and they may be annulled if either House so wishes.  It will be appreciated that outbreaks of animal and poultry disease may occur without prior warning and, notwithstanding the utmost vigilance, the introduction of diseases and conditions hitherto unknown cannot be guaranteed.  It is, therefore, essential that machinery should be at all times available to provide adequate powers to deal with any such emergency with the least possible delay.  This is the main reason why, throughout the Bill, as indeed in the 1894 Act also, it is proposed to take power to prescribe by Statutory Order for conditions that members of the House might otherwise consider could more appropriately be covered by legislation.</P>
    <P>Members will note also that, in its passage through the Dáil, the Bill was in a few instances, amended to provide for action by Statutory Order, instead of by direction of the Minister as was originally proposed.  It is proposed also that the compensation provisions, both for animals slaughtered and animals taken possession of by the Minister, be covered by Statutory Order and not, as hitherto, by express provision of the statute.  This is necessary because of the wide variety of animals and birds and the numerous separate diseases with which the measure deals.  It will be observed, however, that, whereas under the Acts of 1894 and 1957 the Minister was empowered to withhold compensation either in whole or in part when in his judgment the person concerned was guilty of an offence <Col N="918" /> under the Act, or did not take adequate precautions to prevent the spread of disease, section 58 provides that, while a person may be disentitled to compensation where he is convicted of an offence under the Act and payment of compensation may be deferred if a prosecution is pending, where these circumstances do not obtain the amount of compensation may be settled by agreement between the claimant and the Minister and, in the event of failure to agree, the dispute may be referred to arbitration.</P>
    <P>The Second Schedule to the Bill contains a number of important extensions of the Minister's general powers to make orders for the prevention or checking of animal or poultry disease.  The Schedule repeats the corresponding provisions of section 22 of the 1894 Act and certain powers included in the 1957 Bovine Tuberculosis Act.  When this Bill becomes law, these powers may, as appropriate, be extended to all animals and poultry and to all diseases.  It is proposed also to take additional powers for several other purposes.  It may, for instance, be necessary or advisable in the future to make the use of a particular remedy for a disease compulsory&mdash;the treatment of cattle for warbles comes to mind in this context&mdash;and powers are being sought accordingly; with a view to the possible future introduction of a scheme to control liver fluke, it is proposed that the treatment of land, ponds, streams and watercourses may be compulsorily regulated and, with brucellosis in mind, it is proposed to seek power to control the taking of samples, the making of tests and the application of any treatment and the use of sera and vaccines.  I think it should be made clear at this stage that with the exception of the measures necessary for the operation of a scheme to eradicate brucellosis, no concrete proposals of the kind I have just mentioned have yet been formulated. The powers in question are included in the Bill to meet possible future contingencies.</P>
    <P>Section 30 sets out revised controls on the importation of animals and birds which simplify the procedures laid down in the 1894 Act and clarify <Col N="919" /> the legal position regarding the importation under licence.  Provision is made in section 33 for the appropriate treatment of animals, birds and other things illegally imported and sections 29 and 30 extend the provisions of the 1894 Act in relation to ships and ports, to aircraft and aerodromes.</P>
    <P>An important recent development is the establishment of our own quarantine station at Spike Island which enables us to import high class breeding stock in pursuance of our programme of livestock improvement.  Provision for the exercise of control over the quarantine arrangements is contained in section 31.</P>
    <P>Sections 48 and 49 make a relatively minor alteration in the provisions relating to penalties for offences.  The Act of 1894 provided for a fine of up to £20 which could be increased depending on the number of animals or the quantity of material involved in the offence, and, as an alternative to the fine, imprisonment up to one month or up to two months for certain kinds of offences. The Diseases of Animals Act, 1945, substituted a fine of up to £100 for that appearing in the 1894 Act and repealed the provision regarding imprisonment. It is proposed to retain the provisions of the 1945 Act and to re-enact the provisions of the 1894 Act relating to imprisonment.</P>
    <P>The powers and functions of local authorities as indicated in sections 36 to 41 correspond with the existing provisions of the 1894 Act, except that the powers and functions of these bodies or their officers may be curtailed to such extent as may be specified in the disease control order concerned.</P>
    <P>There are two items in Part IV of the Bill which I regard as of special importance.  The first of these, section 54, deals with the dehorning of cattle and will enable us to bring in controls at the same time as similar controls are imposed in Northern Ireland.  Agreement has been reached with the authorities in Northern Ireland to introduced these controls on 1st February, 1969, and an announcement to that effect appeared in the public press last <Col N="920" /> week-end.  The second item to which I refer, section 55, is intended to enable a distinctive colouring agent to be incorporated in sheep dips.  This should be read in the context of the campaign for the eradication of sheep scab.  The certification of sheep dippings has always been somewhat of a problem and the incorporation of a suitable dye, which is at present being developed by the staff of my Department's Veterinary Research Laboratory, would enable dipped sheep to be easily distinguished from undipped animals.  To proceed with this proposal, it is necessary to remove from the Clean Wool Act, 1947, a provision which prohibits the incorporation of colouring matter in sheep dips.  The experiments being carried out on the development of a dye for inclusion in sheep dips have reached a promising stage, but I can assure members of the House that its inclusion in dips will not be permitted, if there is any danger that the quality or market price of wool might thereby be adversely affected.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the measure before the House is essential to the successful implementation of the important veterinary programme at present in progress in my Department. It will contribute substantially towards our objective of achieving the highest possible standard in the health and well-being of our livestock, with all the immense benefits that will undoubtedly ensue not only to our farmers but also to the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an excellent Bill and the Minister and his Department deserve our congratulations for it.  What is more, it is a happy Bill in a sense which I shall quickly define.  Quite often, in the Bills before the House, there is a severe clash between different interests.  However, in this Bill, the interests of the animals and the interests of human beings in this country seem to be almost entirely at one.  It was not so in the last Bill about animals before this House.  In it, some provisions were deemed to put unnecessary hardship or restrictions on the human beings for the sake of the <Col N="921" /> animals and one or two provisions were lost on that account, which I regretted.</P>
      <P>To return to the present Bill, on the whole, it is a most satisfactory measure.  It will probably best be discussed on Committee Stage but at this point I should like to sound the Minister's opinion on the possibility of one amendment on section 28.  There, we read:</P>
      <P>For the purpose of preventing the spread of disease or of preventing injury or suffering to animals and poultry the Minister may make orders:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  regulating generally the transport of animals and poultry and the conditions under which animals and poultry are to be kept at fairs, markets, marts, lairs, railway stations and other places where animals or poultry are assembled prior to transport, shipment, exhibition or slaughter.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he would consider inserting the words &ldquo;and handled&rdquo; after the phrase &ldquo;are to be kept&rdquo;.  I shall explain the reason why I make that suggestion. Under this Bill, inspectors of the Department will have powers of entry and of enforcing all reasonable requirements&mdash;I quote the Bill.  If injury or suffering was being caused to animals by improper or rough handling, then under this amendment these inspectors could step in.  As I see it, under the Bill as it now stands&mdash;I may be wrong about this and, if so, I would welcome correction&mdash;if the hardship or cruelty is the result only of handling, the inspectors would have no powers.</P>
      <P>Let me give the House two examples of the kind of thing that happens in this matter of handling animals.  In the market, sometimes cattle are beaten unnecessarily and unmercifully.  We also have heard of the use of unnecessarily sharp goads, cruelly handled.  If we had the power, that kind of thing could be checked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even more specifically, may I quote the Ministerial Order of the Department of Agriculture on the Conveyance <Col N="922" /> of Live Poultry (Ireland) 1919. This order says, in section 3, that poultry, &ldquo;while being conveyed by road or exhibited for sale or while in a market or other place where poultry are habitually exposed for sale, shall, in Ireland&rdquo;&mdash;the date is 1919, which explains some of the phraseology&mdash;&ldquo;not unnecessarily be tied by the legs or be allowed to remain so tied for a longer period than is necessary, or unnecessarily be carried head downwards&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In fact, what is happening in some Dublin factories at which broiler fowl are killed for sale and export is this: the birds, on arrival, are frequently thrown very roughly, I am assured, in metal crates from the lorry to the ground and then they are hung up by the legs, head down, on a conveyor belt which takes upwards of five minutes to reach the point where the birds mercifully have their throats cut.  Some people may smile and think that only a mere hen is involved, but even hens are God's creatures and deserve consideration. If the Minister would accept the amendment, then his inspectors would be able to take steps, where necessary, to prevent that type of thing. It may be that the Minister and the Department deem it to be fair treatment: that is for him to decide.  However, I should like to put this point.</P>
    <P>One slightly unhappy aspect of the Bill is that the Veterinary Council, I understand, was not consulted beforehand. I am sure there are administrative reasons, perhaps good administrative reasons, for this but, all the same, I think it is a pity.  In this country, we have not so much expert knowledge that we can afford to neglect any of it where it is available.  I would like to think that, in future, all Departments should consult any expert bodies working on similar lines before a Bill of this kind is drafted.  However, that is not a major point.</P>
    <P>There is just one other thing I should like to say.  I hope the Minister will not rest on this excellent measure.  There is a good deal more to be done in this country for the protection of animals, for the improvement of animal health, and for the lessening of cruelty to <Col N="923" /> animals.  In fact, in some ways, we are still a little behind other countries.  I know the Minister is sympathetic to legislation of this kind.  I am very grateful for the help he gave on the Protection of Animals Bill in this House and for putting it through the Dáil afterwards.  Still, I hope he realises that there remain some grave questions to be considered.  For example, there is still the burning question, in some quarters at any rate, of how pigs are slaughtered in this country.  Some people believe that the method used is neither the most efficient nor the most merciful.  However, I shall not stress that point.  I shall end by congratulating the Minister and his Department on this excellent measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome this Bill, as it certainly tidies up the legislation relating to diseases of animals in this country.  However, there are a few small sections and a few points on which I am not too clear and I look forward to the Minister explaining away, perhaps, a few fears I may have in this regard.  For example, subsection (5) of section 18 empowers the Minister to bury the carcases of animals in any convenient ground.  I suggest that this would arise only in cases where an urban dweller has, shall we say, an extensive pig or poultry unit.</P>
      <P>Subsection (6) (a) reads:</P>
      <P>Where the owner or occupier of any such ground claims to have suffered loss by reason of such user, he may, within one month after such user, apply in writing to the Minister for compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely the Minister should not confine a farmer to a time limit of one month. I can well imagine a situation arising where, shall we say, there is an outbreak of some disease or other and a farmer may have a disease amongst his stock and there is a certain amount of worry involved.  I can easily imagine a month slipping by and a farmer not being able to reach on sitting down and writing to the Minister for compensation, more especially in view of the fact that from the time the Department's <Col N="924" /> inspector inspects a heifer qualifying for the £15 grant, it takes the Department anything from eight to 12 weeks to pay that grant.  In all fairness, the Minister should not limit the farmer to this very short period of a month.</P>
    <P>I should like to impress upon the Minister and the Department of Agriculture&mdash;now that there is such a widespread outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Europs&mdash;the grave necessity of ensuring that every possible precaution is taken to prevent the disease spreading to this country.  The Department should, if necessary, double all the precautionary measures because &mdash;at this time when we have such financial difficulties&mdash;it would be a tremendous blow to the economy if this disease came in here and, as it is so rampant in Europe, there is every possibility of it.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that every possible step will be taken to guard against an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in this country just now.</P>
    <P>Section 16 reads:</P>
    <P>A person owning or having charge of animals, poultry or eggs in an infected place or area may affix, at or near the entrance to a building or enclosure in which the animals, or poultry or eggs are, a notice forbidding persons to enter thereon without the permission mentioned in the notice, and thereupon it shall not be lawful for any person, not having by law a right of entry or way into, on or over that building or enclosure, to enter or go into, on, or over it without that permission.</P>
    <P>Surely it should not be necessary for an outbreak of disease to have taken place before a farmer can preserve his lands.  I believe farmers should have the right to complete ownership of their property in that regard.  There are too many people in this country who feel that the farms of Ireland are just one large common.  Should a situation arise where a farmer's neighbour has some contagious disease amongst his stock, I feel that before that farmer's stock is infected, he should have the right to forbid trespass on his property. <Col N="925" /> The inclusion of this particular section, confines the farmer in the protection of his property.  I think it should be left out altogether and let it be generally understood that farmers have a right to protect their property against all trespass.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) of section 18 reads:</P>
    <P>Where an animal or bird has been slaughtered under this Act at the direction of the Minister, the carcase of the animal or bird shall belong to the Minister and shall be buried or sold or otherwise disposed of at the direction of the Minister, as the condition of the animal or bird or carcase and other circumstances may require or admit.</P>
    <P>That is reasonable enough but subsection (3) reads:</P>
    <P>If the owner of an animal or bird slaughtered under this Act at the direction of the Minister or a local authority, has an insurance on the animal or bird, the amount of compensation awarded to him under this Act or any order made thereunder may be deducted by the insurers from the amount of the money payable under the insurance before they make any payment in respect thereof.</P>
    <P>Surely it is unreasonable that the State should more or less come to the aid of the insurance companies in this way?  The premiums being paid to insurance companies are certainly high enough and they should be sufficient for their purposes without the Exchequer having to step in to compensate them.  I do not suggest that the farmers should draw from both but the State should not be expected to compensate insurance companies whose business it is to take risks on such things.</P>
    <P>Subsection (d) of section 20 reads: securing and regulating the keeping of records in relation to animals or poultry and the production and inspection of the records;</P>
    <P>There is a small point here which the Minister might clarify for me.  I should like to ask what records the Minister has in mind, what exactly this section covers, and if these records are to be <Col N="926" /> maintained by farmers or by mart companies and, if dealt with by marts, how he proposes to meet the situation in regard to public fairs?  The majority of our farmers at least are not great keepers of records; it has not been farm practice heretofore, especially in smaller farms, to devote any great attention to records&mdash;which is perhaps a pity&mdash;but since the introduction of the TB eradication scheme and this year the warble fly scheme, many farmers, especially older people, find it most confusing.</P>
    <P>Might I ask the Minister would he consider having the Department produce a blue card which would incorporate the warble fly certificate, especially next year when I suppose we shall have the brucellosis certificate? It would be a very great help if the Department designed a card, even if it were an inch bigger that the present blue card, that would have the three certificates in one.  Surely they could be stamped at the district offices if space were provided on the card, thereby eliminating a great deal of confusion and bother to farmers, especially the smaller farmers when it comes to market day or selling the cattle.</P>
    <P>Section 35 deals with the prevention of sheep scab.  It sets out orders and regulations that the Minister shall make.  The present position where farmers are obliged to dip their sheep twice is unnecessarily harsh, particularly since many farmers dislike the late dipping.  These people have long experience in sheep husbandry and quite a number of them feel that the late dipping especially is inclined to affect their early lamb crop.  I know that An Foras Talúntais do not hold that view but many farmers who have been in the business for years and have very wide practical experience do hold that view, and I think the Minister is a little unfair in insisting that sheep be dipped twice.</P>
    <P>When the Minister brought in the regulations on sheep dipping last year, he appears to have done so without prior consultation with the local authorities as to the facilities available for sheep dipping.  In many counties <Col N="927" /> the dipping tanks and facilities available were not only out of order but completely unsuitable for the very large numbers of sheep now in the country.  It is also a pity he did not endeavour to delegate these powers to the county committees of agriculture to which he could also give entirely the present functions of the local authorities and thereby have the regulations pertaining to agriculture completely in the hands of the county committees which are composed almost entirely of practical farmers.  That would have been a great asset.</P>
    <P>I should like to know if the Department's policy of giving grants to individual farmers for building and erecting their own sheep dipping units and tanks is to continue and if so, if we can expect that a greater number of inspectors will be appointed in order to facilitate farmers in dipping their sheep.  Under the new regulations a sheep dipping inspector must be present at the operation and since there are very few of them in the country, a farmer is not free to dip his sheep when he likes.  This is something that must be looked into.  The Department should facilitate farmers in every way possible in this matter.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister if the grants for the erection of private baths will continue and if there is any minimum limit as to the number of sheep a farmer may have before qualifying for such a grant.</P>
    <P>If I may refer briefly to Part V of the Bill which deals with offences and legal proceedings, it is extraordinary to see that a farmer may be fined, under sections 47 and 48 and, I think, section 49, up to £100 for an offence against this Act.  This is even more extraordinary when we read in the papers practically every day of people being fined a matter of shillings for very serious offences committed against persons.  I do not suggest that the penalties should be reduced but I recall seeing in the newspapers last summer where two men were fined 60/- for holding up a member of the Garda at gunpoint.  That seems to me a very <Col N="928" /> small fine when compared with the £100 that a farmer may be fined for not reporting a disease that may have broken out among his stock.</P>
    <P>There are many other points which can best be dealt with on Committee Stage but I should like the Minister to deal with the few points I have mentioned because there are a few small amendments that perhaps the Minister would agree to make on the next Stage.</P>

      <P>I think it fit and proper that somebody on this side of the House should commend the Minister for bringing this legislation before the House.  I claim that it is fit and proper that I should do this as representative of the veterinary profession, nominated by that profession since the establishment of the Seanad in 1938.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This consolidation of the various Diseases of Animals Acts from 1894 to the present date is not as simple as one might imagine on reading it.  I think the Schedule deals with 15 Acts which are repealed <i>in toto</i> and section 2 of the Dogs Act, 1906.  Only section 2 is repealed in that case; it is a pity we could not have it all repealed and then all the legislation would be consolidated under this Bill.  The system of consolidation really means that the future legislation must be enacted by order of the Minister rather than by writing it in in the terminology of an Act.  I am in favour of legislation by order although many times in this House such a system was vociferously condemned.  But when dealing with the cases we are dealing with now, enzootic and epizootic diseases and the various circumstances relating to each of these several diseases as well as to them all jointly, we could not consolidate all the legislation from the 15 Acts which are repealed into one consolidated measure in 1966 and make it effective, so that we must have, I think, legislation by order of the Minister to cover situations as they occur and outbreaks of various diseases as they occur.  This means we must necessarily have extensive legislation under the system of orders made relative to the cases as they arise. <Col N="929" /> This is nothing new to me.  I well remember the Milk and Dairies Act, 1935.  That Act was a relatively short one but the orders that had to be made and endorsed by both Houses of the Oireachtas consequent on that legislation were voluminous.  I can visualise the same thing happening in connection with this Bill.  That will be all to the good.  The Bill allows the Minister to apply regulations for definite circumstances and to transpose diseases from one section of the Schedule to another.</P>
    <P>The First Schedule shows in Part I the animals which are to be dealt with and in Part II the poultry to be dealt with.  I read the report of the amusing discussion that took place in the Dáil in connection with item No. 9 of the list of animals in the First Schedule in which are set out the names of numerous animals, many of which I had never heard of.  I went to the trouble of looking up the names in a dictionary and found that practically all the animals mentioned belong to the rodent family.</P>
    <P>Part II of the First Schedule itemises the birds to which the Bill applies. Item No. 13 includes numerous birds commonly called parrots, parakeets, budgerigars, and so on.  They are all of the parrot family.  So I do not think we need start any discussion here.</P>

      <P>I do not follow the Senator.  The first serious suggestion I have to make, if Senators do not regard my references so far as being serious, is as to the position of fish disease.  The Bill allows the Minister at any time to insert a new disease in connection with animals or poultry.  I should like to ask the Minister what stage has been reached in connection with the investigation of epizootic disease of fish in certain districts.  I understand that the matter is being investigated by the Veterinary Section of the Fisheries Department, for which the Minister is responsible.  According to Press reports, hundreds of salmon were found dead on the banks or in the rivers in Kerry and along the Black-water. <Col N="930" /> These would seem to indicate that there is some serious infectious disease affecting fish, of which we have very little information.  In view of this state of affairs, I would suggest the inclusion of fish in the First Schedule. It is the responsibility of the Minister and his Department to clarify the position relative to the disease which is affecting fish in Kerry, Waterford, and possibly elsewhere.</P>
      <P>I can speak with some experience of epizootic disease in animals.  It is a fact that our livestock are the most disease-free in the world.  Foot-and-mouth disease and other epizootic diseases do not spread so easily in this country because of our insular position.  There has been no incidence in this country for years past of most of the diseases specified in Part III of the Schedule and I do not anticipate that there will be any incidence of them in years to come. We do not know anything about cattle plague; we have not had it.  We have not had any outbreak of pleuro-pneumonia. We have had foot-and-mouth disease.  I have had some experience of it.  We have not had sheep pox.  We have had swine fever.  We have not had epizootic lymphangitis.  We have had parasitic mange.  In my time it has disappeared completely from this country.  We have not rabies but there would be a certain amount of danger of its being introduced here if we abolished the quarantine regulations applying to animals being imported. Glanders has disappeared.  Anthrax does occur in this country.  The eleventh item included in the list is fowl pest in any of its forms, including Newcastle disease and fowl plague, which are diseases which have been investigated and information obtained in relation to them.  As far as the other diseases are concerned, we do not anticipate any danger of their reaching us unless by some extraordinary circumstance. Therefore, the list really can be reduced to about four diseases&mdash;foot-and-mouth disease, swine fever, anthrax and fowl pest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like at this stage to emphasise the danger of an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease and to discuss briefly the difficulties of controlling it <Col N="931" /> when it does arise.  At the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, in 1941, which started up North and came down here, and occurred in the city of Dublin, I was on the veterinary staff of Dublin Corporation.  For the veterinary staffs it was a 24-hour day job.  We were collaborating with the officers of the Department of Agriculture.  They appreciated the collaboration of the veterinary staff of Dublin Corporation. I would nearly boast that the Corporation staff were as efficient and competent a staff as the Department had at that time.  They had to supervise operations which had reached nation-wide extent at that time.  I refer to the export of animals, post mortems on animals, and so on.</P>
    <P>I have some very amusing recollections of that period, one or two of which I should like to mention to demonstrate the difficulty of providing for everything by order.  We had the job of disinfecting premises in which the central authority had had the affected animals slaughtered and disinfecting those who had been in contact with these animals.  Fortunately we had several barrels of formalin.  I remember on one occasion we were spraying with formalin when we suddenly saw a cat sitting on top of an unenclosed rick.  His poor eyes were running as a result of the formalin and he was miaowing quite piteously.  We did not know what to do with him and decided that the best thing was to ask the Garda to shoot him.  A garda came. We did not know whether we had any power to shoot the cat; we did not know whether the cat was worth £100 or nothing at all.  The garda said it would be no trouble to shoot him.  He went as near to the cat as I am now to the Senators on the other side of the House and drew his revolver.  I said: &ldquo;You are missing&rdquo;, and actually he did miss him.  The cat took off and we saw no more of him.  The incident was amusing.</P>

      <P>He got away. <Col N="932" /> I remember there was considerable difficulty in disinfecting, particularly when we had to do a whole street.  It was a narrow street admittedly; the lorries carrying the slaughtered animals travelled along it.  Of course, it was also used by people.  We had to close that street in order to disinfect it.  Another power we had was that of disinfecting people who had been in contact with diseased animals.  There is provision in a section of this Bill for disinfecting the clothes of those who might be contaminated.</P>

      <P>It was a pity the Senator was never sprayed.  Not only did we disinfect clothing but we also provided baths.  We had the municipal baths in Marrowbone Lane and we transported those in contact with foot and mouth disease to these baths for disinfecting.  That was very useful because it lessened the danger of the disease spreading.  There was one amusing incident in which one of those who had been taken from a dairy premises to Marrowbone Lane came back and showed us his hat after disinfecting: it was like the sort of little hat a clown wears.</P>
      <P>There was an interesting case, too, in which foot and mouth occurred in a dairy premises on the north side. The premises were closed and all the routine steps were taken.  One of the milkers, however, went over to south county Dublin the next morning and subsequently an outbreak of foot and mouth disease was notified.  I have no personal proof but I was told that the man from the north side had milked in that premises and must have transported the disease on his person.  Apart from disinfecting clothes, disinfecting the individual is also very important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had the experience of seeing a grave prepared in County Meath for animals that had been slaughtered.  It was about eight feet deep and for that eight feet the soil was the same all the way down.  It struck me that if we could transport some of that soil to Connemara, we would have no need <Col N="933" /> to worry about Deputy Dillon's rock clearing scheme.</P>

      <P>I have been speaking about realities.  In Class B then we have sheep scab, bovine tuberculosis, brucellosis and warble fly infestation. We have succeeded in eradicating bovine tuberculosis.  There is, of course, always the danger of reinfection. We are starting now to eradicate brucellosis and warble fly.  I shall deal with warble fly first.  The life history of the fly is really fantastic.  In the years gone by, the life history was traced from the time the fly lays its eggs on the beast to the stage at which the next generation of warble fly is on the back of that beast.  The warble fly is no respecter of fences.  When, on a previous occasion, an earlier Fianna Fáil government endeavoured to rid the country of warble fly, they were derided by the Opposition and by the National Farmers Association of the day.</P>

      <P>A resolution of mine in favour of eradication of the warble fly was passed unanimously by this House.  I exhibited specimens in the ante-room showing the damage done by the warble fly.  Indeed, a general election was almost fought over the warble fly; Deputy Dillon told the farmers not to let one inspector inside their gates.  The scheme proposed then fell through and I should like to emphasise now the enormous difference in the situation today.  I do not mean in the opposition to the Government or in the National Farmers Association but in the facilities we have been afforded by research in dealing with the eradication of warbles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not the warble on the back of the animal we are trying to deal with now, as we were trying to do with the derris treatment, but with the penetration of the parasite which hatches from the egg of the warble fly.  The fly lays its eggs below the hocks and the fetlocks <Col N="934" /> of a beast.  That is why the animal tries to get into the shade to avoid the fly.  Then the beast starts gadding and will go into a stream or river, anywhere there is water, to prevent the fly attacking it.  Apart from the injury done to the animal through penetration by the warble fly, there has also to be considered the loss of animals through falling over cliffs and into ditches to avoid the fly.  When the egg hatches out, the parasite penetrates the skin and pokes its way along through the lymphatic system of the animal and succeeds in coming to its permanent location beneath the skin on the back of the animal from which it is convenient for it to develop into a warble. When the grub develops, it then has to puncture the skin and the back to get out on to the ground and continue the rotation from grub to fly again. It is in course of the parasite's transit from where it penetrates the skin of the animal to its permanent location on the back that the dressing on the back of the animal becomes effective.  The dressing is absorbed into the lymphatic system and kills the parasite in transit to the animal's back.  This dressing, so conveniently and easily administered, can prevent the grub from developing into a warble which is the cause of great difficulty to leather manufacturers and others concerned with the cattle trade.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister how many animals were omitted from the last eradication effort.  I would say every farmer in the country is anxious to co-operate in this scheme.  It is in every farmer's interest from the point of view of the appearance of the beast, the appearance of the carcase when the beast is slaughtered, and increasing the milk supply from dairy cows.  Even if a couple of hundred thousand were missed during the last effort, many of them might not have warbles on them. However, I would like to know what number of animals are involved there. It should be possible, with full co-operation from the farming community, to eradicate the warble fly within two years, and that would be one other problem out of our way.  I should like now to refer to sheep scab.</P>

      <P>It was to the warble fly and sheep scab that I wanted to refer particularly.  However, possibly I can refer to these in some detail on Committee Stage.  The Minister mentioned that his estimate of the loss to the country was £100 per farmer. That is a tremendous amount of money and it would be interesting if the statisticians could tell us whether that is right or wrong.  If £100 were added to the income of every small farmer, it would be an immense increase.</P>

      <NameTxt>Seán Ó Donnabháin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator ought not to bring me back to the tanners.  I could go back to the time when some of his colleagues said: &ldquo;The tanners are the people who would be interested in this.  We do not want to be bothered with the warble fly&rdquo;.  They used those arguments and they were all erroneous.  I had two specimens of hides which had been damaged by warble fly.  They were like sieves, there were so many holes in them.</P>
      <P>The matters of dishorning and colouring matter in sheep dips do not seem to be relevant to a measure dealing with animal diseases, but we shall have made very good progress if all the animals in the country are dishorned so that they will not injure other animals when being exported.</P>
      <P>Senator Stanford referred to the Protection of Animals Act.  In my opinion, this Bill goes a step further because if I recall correctly, in the earlier Bill, we did not succeed in ensuring that animals straying in the country would carry collars with the owners' names on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think Senator Stanford was correct in his reference to the Veterinary Council.  Like any other professional association, there is a controlling body which is called here the <Col N="936" /> Veterinary Council and then there is the Veterinary Medical Association which I shall refer to as the trade union body of the profession.  Senator Stanford did not mention that the Protection of Animals Bill was a private measure signed by a few Senators.  He asked me at the time if I would like to give my support to it and I agreed. In discussing the details of the Bill with the Veterinary Association, we found there were many points needing amendment and the Minister for Agriculture was in this House when I proposed between 12 and 14 amendments. My point is that Senator Stanford appears to be confusing the Veterinary Council with the Veterinary Association. I jocosely referred to the latter body as the trade union branch of the profession.  There are other professional bodies in a similar position.  I shall not delay the House further at this stage.  There are other points on which I made notes but which I shall leave until Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. J. Fitzgerald Mr. J. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join the other speakers in congratulating the Minister on this very important Bill.  Its importance is spelled out in the Minister's introductory statements here and in the Dáil.  He gave a figure of £25 million as the annual loss sustained by Irish farmers through diseases and pests, whether from deaths in flocks and herds or in reduced milk yields.  He broke this figure down as representing £100 per farmer per annum.  This, to my mind, is a staggering figure.  Many people may be dubious about accepting it as correct but I believe it to be correct and if one examines the reports issued from time to time, one must agree that the Minister's figure is not very far off the mark.  Our losses in yields and in deaths are far too high.  It must be brought home to everyone engaged in agriculture that a great responsibility rests on them to co-operate in every possible way with officials of the Department in efforts to reduce this figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figure makes one realise how very little was done between the Act of 1894 and the introduction of the Act of 1957 to eradicate bovine tuberculosis. <Col N="937" /> There was a period of 35 years after the achievement of native government when nothing at all was done in this field.  Then, we were compelled, because the British insisted on it, to ensure that our cattle were free from tuberculosis.  We had to embark on the costly exercise of eradicating TB in our cattle herds and we can be very proud of the successful outcome of that campaign which proves that what was done in the tuberculosis eradication scheme can be done with equal success in the implementation of the Bill now being considered.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of a comprehensive programme for the eradication and control of such diseases and conditions as brucellosis, warble fly, sheep scab, liver fluke and mastitis.  If we look at the losses occasioned by mastitis, we will be unanimous in agreeing that the Minister has done a very good job in introducing this Bill.  The <i>Irish Independent</i> of 13th January published a report by the Agricultural Institute, compiled by a technical study group, on milk quality.  The report stated that the group had been studying the problem of mastitis in Ireland during the previous year and it revealed that an annual loss of 30 million gallons of milk per year was sustained.  A reduction in that figure would mean a considerable increase in milk production and it would also mean a big increase in the income of milk producers.</P>
    <P>The success of the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme has proved that when the farmers and the Department of Agriculture co-operate, they can be very successful.  If we get the same co-operation in this matter, we can be as successful as we were in freeing our herds from tuberculosis.  It is imperative that the terms of the Bill be implemented in view of the losses incurred in the agricultural field by the very diseases this Bill seeks to eradicate. To do so we must seek the co-operation of the voluntary organisations throughout the country who, assisted by the county committees of agriculture and their advisory services, can play a very important part in this matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="938" /> The bovine tuberculosis scheme cost the State quite a lot of money but it was worth every penny.  If this scheme is to be successful, we all must face up to our responsibilities.  We must begin by ensuring that money will be made available for the successful implementation of the Bill.  It will not do just to appeal to the good sense, the patriotism, the good citizenship of our farmers. Many people do not like the word &ldquo;compulsion&rdquo;.  I dislike it myself but here I cannot see any other answer because here it will not do to have 90 per cent of the people co-operating and the other ten per cent adopting the old casual attitude of saying: &ldquo;God is good; we might escape.&rdquo;  We must get into this in the same way as we did in the case of the TB scheme if we want to reduce the staggering figure of £25 million.  This is equally important.  As Deputy Murphy pointed out in the Dáil, many a Minister for Finance in the past could have very usefully used the money lost every year&mdash;this loss was referred to by the Minister&mdash;in the agricultural field.  I welcome the Bill and I sincerely hope it will achieve its purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMolone" hpid="Mr. Malone Mr. Malone">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Malone</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, should like to welcome the measure before the House. While I do not for one moment question the accuracy of the Minister's figure of £25 million in respect of losses the fact is that there was very little the country could do about it up to now. The eradication of some of the diseases dealt with in this Bill was rendered possible by the impressive advances made in veterinary research in recent years.  I am sure the Minister knows very well that farmers can be led but not driven.  The Minister is extremely fortunate in being able to get away with compulsion under the guise of a voluntary effort.  I shall deal with that in more detail later on.  I would divide the Bill into three categories&mdash;the part for which I have the most enthusiasm, the part about which I am least enthusiastic and the part which concerns me most.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The part about which I am least enthusiastic is that which relates to the dehorning of cattle.  While it is, I suppose, <Col N="939" /> true to say that the horns of an animal are more ornamental than useful, I can, nevertheless, see certain pedigree breeders objecting very strongly to having the horns removed from their animals.  If you take a man who is breeding pedigree cows or bulls, who retains them on his farm for the duration of their useful life and who then wants to offer them for sale at a slaughterhouse, is such a person to be prevented from doing so because during the animals' life he had not had the horns removed?  It would seem rather a hardship on the animal as well as on the farmer to have to do the job a couple of days before the animals are slaughtered.</P>
    <P>The part about which I am most enthusiastic is that which deals with the control of dogs.  Every item in this Bill is welcome and I am sure will receive from the House every commendation but the control of dogs is something that is so long overdue that people began to wonder if there could be anything at all done about it. Frankly, I cannot see how even the measures proposed in this Bill will be implemented.  The greatest menace to sheep farmers is the number of dogs in and around towns.  It very often happens that parents get a puppy for the children as a pet.  When the puppy grows to maturity it turns out to be a most ugly mongrel.  The children lose interest in it and it gets the door.  A number of those dogs band together and they go out hunting sheep.  It has happened I know on a number of occasions in Carlow.</P>
    <P>When the dogs hunt the sheep the farmers follow the dogs back to the town but, of course, there are no owners.  Will it be possible to insist on every dog owner having the name on the collar?  While 5/- is a very small fee to pay for a dog licence&mdash;I do not know what it brings in&mdash;I think it could be very usefully doubled or certainly increased in order to discourage people from keeping so many dogs.  It might possibly be a hardship in some cases where a poor person living alone keeps a dog for protection but I believe in the long run it would reduce the number of dogs in the <Col N="940" /> country and help greatly to implement the measures proposed in the Bill.  This would eliminate the frustrating experience which many farmers in the country have of seeing their sheep and lambs torn to pieces in the fields.</P>
    <P>The part of the Bill about which I am concerned is that which deals with the power given to inspectors.  They have power, under this Bill, to arrest and detain.  I do not think any civilian should have such extensive power. Farmers are law-abiding citizens and they will be very co-operative as far as the Garda Síochána are concerned but if a civilian inspector, however wellintentioned he may be, approaches a farmer, who is going into or leaving a farm which is designated as isolated, and taps him on the shoulder and says: &ldquo;If you are either going into or leaving that place I will arrest you&rdquo; the farmer will not take very kindly to him.  Surely there are sufficient members of the Garda Síochána throughout the country to deal with matters of that nature without giving such wide power to the inspectors of the Department?</P>
    <P>I am quite sure, as some of the other speakers mentioned, that the Minister is as concerned as we all are with the danger of foot and mouth disease being introduced into the country at the present time.  I believe the greatest hazard arises from the number of cars which are entering the country from the point of view of tourism. What control can be exercised over transport coming from rural areas in, say, England, Holland, Belgium or anywhere else where there may be an outbreak of foot and mouth disease? This is something which I am sure is engaging the attention of the Minister. I hope, in his reply, he will be able to outline the precautions taken in that regard.</P>
    <P>I dealt with the question of warble fly and sheep scab on a previous occasion.  We had the Minister for Finance here on that occasion but he was much more concerned with getting the Finance Bill passed than he was with the question of whether sheep would be dipped or not.  Therefore, I would mention a few of the requests <Col N="941" /> I made on that occasion, now that we have the Minister for Agriculture here. The sheep dipping arrangements are not to the satisfaction of the farming community in so far as they entail three dippings rather than two in many cases.  Following the shearing, the farmers have to dip their sheep in order to prevent fly strike.  A month later, they must dip them again under the new regulations, and a couple of months later, yet again.</P>
    <P>A recommendation has been sent to the Minister from the General Council of the County Committees of Agriculture to have the date set changed from 1st July to the middle of June.  Personally I should like it to be 1st June but I would settle for the middle of June which would ensure that all the sheep will be dipped at shearing time. Mountain sheep farmers gathering their sheep for shearing will not be so particular if the sheep have to be let out after shearing and then rounded up and brought back for dipping three weeks or a month later.  It would increase the percentage of sheep dipped.  I am also pleased that colouring is being added to the dip.  That will ensure that all the sheep have gone through the dip tub.  I wonder will that eliminate the necessity for having inspectors, because unless the sheep are fully immersed in the dip, it will be quite obvious that they have not been dipped.  If they are properly immersed, the dye will show on the wool and there will be no necessity to have inspectors standing over them to see that they are dipped.</P>
    <P>On the question of the warble fly, I am wondering about the compensation. Farmers who do not have to have their cattle dressed for warble fly should be encouraged to have them dressed. There are a number of them; for example, dairy farmers who do not intend offering their cows for sale within the following 12 months do not have to have the cows they are retaining in their herd dressed for warble fly under the present scheme.  If by any chance they are unlucky enough to lose an animal because of the dressing, the compensation payable should encourage those farmers to offer their cows for dressing.  I have sent details <Col N="942" /> of one case to the Minister but I have not yet heard from him about it.</P>
    <P>If the cow dies as a result of this dressing, the farmer is paid compensation on the slaughter value only.  To my mind, that is not an encouragement to the farmers to offer for dressing animals that do not have to be dressed, because it does not take into consideration all the potentials, the milk yield, the calves, and so on.  I should like to know at what stage a cow heavy in calf need not be dressed.  There have been a lot of losses of cows which were near calving.  Some direction should be given to the operators as to the stage at which an in-calf cow need not be dressed for warble fly.</P>
    <P>Everyone will welcome the provision in respect of brucellosis and we hope it will be implemented as quickly as possible.  It is frightening to think that while it has always been an offence to offer for sale a cow that had aborted, it happens all too often.  It is such a frightfully contagious disease that even birds can carry it from one field to another.  One can imagine how disheartening it must be to farmers to have that disease introduced into their herds in saleyards or at fairs.  A man may not fully realise the harm he is doing, but he should be constantly reminded that such animals should not be offered for sale in any circumstances, just as the committees of agriculture and the various voluntary rural organisations can point out to the farmers the harm they are doing to the State by such sales and the danger of spreading undulant fever by offering for sale milk from such cows, and the danger of penicillin rash from milk from cows that have been treated for mastitis.</P>
    <P>The co-operation between the rural organisations, the committees of agriculture and the Department has been very noticable in recent years.  Nowadays the farmers are willing and anxious to learn, and the committees of agriculture are dealing with far more in the general range of agriculture than they did some years ago when they spent their time at meetings dealing with premiums for bulls, prizes at shows, turkey-cock stations and such matters.  They are now dealing with <Col N="943" /> every aspect of agriculture, a very healthy sign.  The farmers are very interested in what is going on at these meetings, and are anxious to learn from them.  I am quite certain they are prepared to co-operate in the implementing of this Bill, and to see that everything in it is carried to a successful conclusion.  While it will cost a lot of money and no doubt involve a certain amount of inconvenience for farmers, I am sure the Minister will see that the cost and the inconvenience are kept to a minimum.</P>
    <P>In regard to liver fluke, there is provision in the Bill that certain areas of land may be entered on and sprayed. Some of the smaller farms are run as one unit and there is no fencing available to keep the stock away from land that has been treated until it is ready to be used again.  I can foresee a considerable hardship in that respect but I am sure that when the time arrives, the Minister will take that into consideration. I certainly welcome the Bill and I wish the Minister every luck in its implementation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>The previous speaker referred to the control of dogs.  I should like the Minister to consider adding one other subsection to the section dealing with that matter, section 56. Would he consider declaring an area a danger area, for a certain time, for any dog found wandering in it either during the day or at night?  This would be an area in which sheep had been killed and the dogs could not be traced.  It could be declared an area in which no dog should be seen wandering by day or night for a week, two weeks or a month.  In certain cases dogs are traced to some man's house and he disclaims ownership of them. The dogs may be wandering around unfed and doing damage.  Therefore I hold that such an area should be included in that section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The points which I have to raise are to some extent Committee points.  One point I should like to mention is that we now have the blue card for tuberculin-tested cattle and attached to it, we have the warble fly certificate, and I take that we will have to join on <Col N="944" /> the brucellosis test certificate, for the heifers at any rate, and perhaps also the warble fly certificate for the following year.  It seems to me that we should devise some sort of blue card which will have space for noting the annual tests which have been carried out. Sometimes the blue card will last for four years.  Sometimes when one buys cattle, one finds the warble fly certificate attached to the card with safety pins or stuck on with adhesive paper. A card will be in an awful mess, if it can be preserved at all, at the end of a year or two and therefore the Department should devise some type of card with appropriate spaces on it for notification of these diseases so that they will not have to be fastened on to it.</P>
    <P>In regard to section 16, which deals with a private person putting up a notice prohibiting anyone from coming on his land if there is a disease of some kind or other, such as foot-and-mouth, in the area, I must say that I cannot see how this can be enforced unless he takes an action for trespass.  I cannot find any way in the Bill in which this section can be enforced.  The section excludes rights of way and I feel that the Minister, under section 19 where he may declare an area to be a diseased area, should take power to include rights of way.  I think most people would be perfectly willing to uphold that for a certain time if there was any danger of them carrying disease to a farm.  Either the Minister or the private person should have power to stop people from going over rights of way for a limited time if it was necessary that this should be done.</P>
    <P>In regard to Part III, which brings in local authorities, it appears to me, having seen what powers are given to local authorities, that this part is unnecessary. I cannot see any local authority making orders under this Bill, when it becomes an Act, which will not be orders that are not directly sent out from the Minister's Department.  The local authorities have no veterinary officers except those who carry out the meat inspections and they have no other officers to enforce any of these orders except perhaps poultry instructresses or people of that type.  I think this whole matter is now carried out by <Col N="945" /> the Minister's Department in some way or other.  Perhaps they may collect something from the rates or perhaps Local Government are nominally allowed to make these orders.</P>
    <P>Section 21 reads:</P>
    <P>Section 7 (1) of the Animal Remedies Act, 1956 shall, notwithstanding subsection (2) of that section, apply to any animal remedy specified in any order of the Minister in relation to any Class B disease.</P>
    <P>The section in the 1956 Act allows the Minister, after consultation with a consultative committee set up under that Act, to control the manufacture of various drugs and remedies and I should like to know why is it confined to Class B diseases.  Why could the Minister not control remedies for Class A diseases?</P>
    <P>There is another question which I should like to ask in regard to section 42 subsection (6) which reads:</P>
    <P>A certificate of an inspector or other authorised person to the effect that an animal is or was affected with a disease specified in the certificate shall, for the purposes of this Act, be conclusive evidence of the matter certified.</P>
    <P>There should be some method of appealing to a second authority in some cases.  I know of a recent case where a mistake was made over a certain disease and the small farmer involved was put to considerable trouble.  If the certificate of an inspector is conclusive evidence without any appeal to a second authority, a grave mistake or grave loss could occur and the farmer might be put to considerable loss before it was discovered that the inspector had made a mistake and that the disease was not present at all.  The use of the phrase &ldquo;conclusive evidence&rdquo; makes it rather severe.</P>
    <P>The Bill is rather comprehensive in a way and a lot of things are said a great many times in different ways. The drafting of the Bill is perhaps somewhat lax.  I should like to refer to section 48 which commences by stating &ldquo;If a person without lawful authority or excuse&rdquo; etc., does any of <Col N="946" /> the following things and then we have at the beginning of each paragraph another &ldquo;if&rdquo;.  In paragraph (c) it says:</P>
    <P>if he fails to give, produce, observe, or do any notice, licence, rule, or thing which by this Act, or by an order of the Minister, or by a regulation of a local authority, or by an authorised person he is required to give, produce, observe, or do; or</P>
    <P>Surely the words &ldquo;this Act&rdquo; include an order of the Minister or a regulation of a local authority because we come down to paragraph (h) in the same section which says:</P>
    <P>if when duly required to do so under this Act or any order made thereunder he refuses or fails to give information within his knowledge or wilfully or negligently gives false or misleading information.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to comment on just one section here and to agree with Senator McDonald when he said there are not sufficient dipping inspectors to supervise the dipping of sheep.  This is particularly so in a county such as <Col N="947" /> mine where there are so many small hill farmers.  Until a year or so ago, sheep owners could dip their sheep on their own farms if they had pens and used their own dip.  The dipping inspector took a chance and issued a certificate.  In 99 cases out of 100, he was justified because most farmers, for their own protection, take the necessary steps to ensure their sheep are dipped. If sheep scab is discovered, the restrictions are such that farmers do not like to have to face them.  It is true that occasionally sheep could be missed and scab discovered from place to place.</P>
    <P>I think this restriction whereby all sheep have to be dipped in the presence of the dipping inspector is now no longer necessary because of section 55, which is an important step forward. With the introduction of the dye, everyone, whether professional or layman, can see at a glance if the sheep have been dipped or not.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister to reconsider this restriction whereby all farmers had to send their sheep to the local authority dipping pens to ensure they were dipped in the presence of the inspector. This is most inconvenient not alone for the farmers themselves but certainly for the dipping inspectors who, having regard to their present strength, cannot possibly carry out all this work.  With the introduction of section 55, it is no longer necessary and I would ask the Minister to consider the withdrawal of this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. P. O'Reilly (Longford) Mr. P. O'Reilly (Longford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Longford):</i> In rising to speak on this Bill, I am inclined to reminisce.  I am blessed with a good memory, which probably compensates for other defects.  I remember speaking on the Diseases of Animals Bill in 1949.  I was probably not as experienced as I am now and certainly a good deal more ardent.  I then made a case, which I had studied and substantiated, that some steps should then be taken towards the eradication of bovine TB.  My approach at that time was that, if steps were taken to eliminate that disease from the cow population, it would reduce substantially the number of children finding their way into such <Col N="948" /> institutions as Cappagh and Coole.  We know that many of the cases in those places are directly the result of bovine TB being fed through milk.</P>
      <P>I am convinced at this stage that, if we had attacked that problem much earlier, it would have been much less costly.  If we had extracted the tubercular cows over a 15 year period, we would have prevented a lot of suffering and saved a large number of valuable lives.  We would also have brought about the situation that, when it became economically necessary for us to tackle bovine TB, it would not have been the big problem it turned out to be and certainly would not have been as costly as it was.</P>
      <P>We all know it is just as bad to be before your time as after your time. Because of the pattern of thinking at that time, I was attacked by those who should know better, by the representatives of the cattle traders' association, in this House.  Apparently, it would appear if a butcher in England or this country was unfortunate enough to find himself with a carcase infected with bovine TB, he just had to take that risk.  Senator Bigger, a member of the House at that time, was the only one to take my side in the argument. Were it not for him, I would have been completely overwhelmed; but Senator Bigger took the view that I was right.  He was in a better position to prove I was right because he knew much more about the problem than I did.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Longford):</i> He knew more about the matter.  I owe him a lot for taking my side in that rather heated debate.  I felt I was held up to ridicule.  It was said that my remarks would lead to depressing cattle prices if taken seriously.  When Senator Malone now asks why was something like this not done earlier, I have given him the answer.  Our pattern of thinking was such that it apparently was not possible to do much about it at that time.  Only when it became economically necessary to do something about it, did we tackle the question seriously. <Col N="949" /> I am glad it is a success and that there was so much co-operation.  In my view, it would have been much less costly if it had been tackled sooner and if the infected cows had been eradicated over a period.  However, it is now successful and, with our new pattern of thinking, we must get down to doing the other things that still remain to be done, in co-operation with the Department of Agriculture and the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
      <P>That brings me to this question of warble fly eradication.  Somebody mentioned that it was not necessary for people who were not selling animals such as cows to have a certificate.  That may be.  I agree that if the Minister for Agriculture can get things done voluntarily, it is far better than compulsion. It is in the nature of things that some people will do a thing voluntarily while they get it hard to do it under compulsion. Again, at the other end of the scale, some people will do a thing only when it is compulsory.  I still feel that since it is so necessary to eradicate completely and in a short time warble fly infestation, it is essential that the Minister take whatever steps he thinks best to make sure that all our cattle are treated with a view to completely eliminating warble fly infestation.</P>
      <P>I shall now mention something about which I know very little, a scientific matter.  I refer to the development of warble flies resistant to the treatment. If that should come about, we should find ourselves in a very disastrous position. Some people I have met have told me that it is possible: I do not know. It is a highly technical matter.  I am not in any position to give an opinion and I just mention now that people have told me it is possible for a strain of warble fly to develop that would be resistant to the present treatment.  If that should happen, it would be a disastrous situation and we should be back again where we started.  That is why it is so necessary that the Minister should get every assistance possible in the eradication of the warble fly to make sure it is successful in a short time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am tempted to deal only with diseases in cattle because some <Col N="950" /> Senators know more than I do about diseases in sheep.  I might say this, however, in regard to the warble fly.  I am afraid our farming population do not realise the amount of loss the warble fly causes to the nation and to the individual farmer.  I went to the trouble of studying the effects of the warble fly on cows on a small farm of approximately 40 acres where milk was being sold to the creamery and the only test was the sale of milk.  On this farm, in the year before the cows were treated, the sale value of the milk in July, as against June, fell by some £13 and some shillings and pence.  The following year, on the same farm, for the same number of cows and after they were treated&mdash;I cannot tell the Seanad if there was any great upward adjustment in the price: not as much as I think there should have been&mdash;the cash value rose by £2 odd, and that was a small farm in the west of Ireland.  If that happens on one farm, it is bound to happen on another farm.  I am afraid it is only when the amount of loss he is suffering is fully brought home to the individual farmer that he will really take note.  To speak in large figures about millions of pounds in losses is not nearly as effective as to tell a man how much he himself lost. To the extent that the Minister tried to calculate what it would mean to the individual farmer, I think his approach was the right one.  I can tell him and the House, in relation to the case I mentioned, that the figures are accurate.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention the question of brucellosis.  I wonder whether it is now confirmed opinion that brucellosis is responsible for contagious abortion in cattle between the sixth and the eight month of pregnancy.  That is one good reason why brucellosis should be eliminated but there is another reason, too.  Milk from cows infected with brucellosis will cause a very severe fever in the human population.  I have met people who have had that fever. I know an officer of the Department of Agriculture who was severely ill with that fever for quite a substantial length of time.  His work necessitated his dealing with animals suffering from the disease.  I should like to hope that, <Col N="951" /> in our new pattern of thinking, it will not merely be economic necessity&mdash;a higher cattle population&mdash;that will force us to take steps to eliminate brucellosis.  I should rather like to hope that we shall also work with a view to improving the health of our human population.  Certainly, we must agree&mdash; it is a hard thing to have to say&mdash; that it was economic necessity that forced us to undertake the elimination of bovine tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>I come now to a matter on which I shall not make a statement but ask a question.  Can the Minister tell me, offhand, if trichomoniasis is a scheduled disease under this measure? I hope he will be able to give that information when he is replying. Because of the widespread use of artificial insemination, I agree that trichomoniasis is a disease which is not now as important as it was at one time but there are still some areas where that disease can flare up and in a congested district, it can have very serious economic consequences.  I know a district where the spread of that disease became a very serious problem for the Department of Agriculture.  I should like to think the Minister has some plan for its elimination.  The unfortunate thing is that it is more likely to occur in congested districts.  Some Senators may be anxious to interrupt me on this matter but this is a problem in relation to which I know what I am talking about.  I know the amount of damage that was done some years ago in an area comprising parts of Cavan, Leitrim and Longford as a result of a high incidence of trichomoniasis.  The effect of the disease is that cows which are proven in calf will abort in the first to the fourth month.  That is a very serious matter in any district, not to speak of a congested district.  I should like to Minister to tell me if trichomoniasis is regarded at the moment as a serious problem and, if it is a serious problem, what steps will be taken in the foreseeable future to deal with its incidence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>Any consolidation Bill is always welcome and this measure is certainly a consolidation <Col N="952" /> Bill, Most of the points I wish to make I shall deal with on Committee Stage but, just in case I might be informed that this was not quite in order on a particular section, there are one or two I should like to make now.</P>
      <P>It seems to me, and Senator Cole referred to this, that there is certain amount of repetition.  For instance, I cannot see why it was necessary apparently to duplicate what is in section 15, subsection (b) in the first couple of items in the Second Schedule. In regard to the Second Schedule, in fact, I cannot see why it is put in as a Schedule and not just as a section.  Neither can I see why section 13 should have given authority to the Second Schedule, rather than just putting all the items in at section 13 because it does not seem to me to vary very much in character from the other sections of the Bill in the sense that it goes into very great detail, because most of the sections do.</P>
      <P>Again, in regard to section 13, I am wondering what would be the precise difference between the effect of section 13 on the Schedule and the effect of section 27 because section 13 deals with orders which may be made by the Minister for the purpose of the prevention or eradication of disease, section 27 empowers the Minister to make orders with regard to the regulation of movement of animals, etc. and again under section 28, with regard to the transport of animals.  I am wondering whether disease does not come into it.  Section 27 seems to me to be a very wide section in that the Minister may make an order for any reason he likes prohibiting the movement of animals to or from a fair.  There is no question of eradication or prevention of disease entering into it.  At least that is what it appears to be on the surface.  I am not saying that this is what it does but it is what it appears to me to do and I am not sure that such a wide provision should be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I confess I did not read the 15 Acts which are repealed to find out how much of the present Bill is in them or whether this is practically a reinstatement; in other words, how far is the Bill consolidating and how far is it <Col N="953" /> new.  I did not wade through the 15 Acts to work this out.  If the Minister can say that my fears in regard to these points are groundless because he already has such power, I should not be entirely satisfied but I raise these couple of points because on Committee Stage, where something is concerned with different parts of the Bill, it is difficult to find what is the best way to deal with them.</P>
    <P>There is just one other point I should like to refer to and which was raised by Senator Stanford.  He referred to the use of over-sharp goads in dealing with cattle.  I am sorry he did not say where he saw this.  It was the use of a sharp goad in a vicious way.  I hope nobody will think I am being over-critical of the Senator in saying this but I do think that in anything as bad as that, the details should be given.</P>

      <P>It is important that we should try to get that message to more and more of our farmers, that the proper care of livestock is essential to good husbandry.  Briefly, this measure is concerned with the whole question.  In fact, what we are dealing with here is really an aspect of agricultural productivity.  In this whole matter of the elimination of disease and pests and the care of livestock, we are in fact concerned with an attempt to get better production.  We are trying to get greater output of animals per year from the same breeding stocks through improved methods of husbandry.</P>
      <P>Mention has been made of the sum of £25 million per annum that I indicated that diseases and pests of one sort or another cost agriculture.  I would personally put it at much more than £25 million per year but I gave that very conservative estimate in order to indicate the seriousness of this problem and the benefits we can reap from a comprehensive, vigorously-pursued programme of eradication of diseases and pests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested that the Veterinary Council were not consulted in regard to this measure.  That is probably true, as a bald statement, but <Col N="956" /> it does not at all represent the situation. In my Department the veterinary officers are in more or less constant touch with both bodies that Senator O'Donovan mentioned.  We consult them regularly about all the different aspects of our campaigns and we shall continue to do so.  We shall also consult them fully on the implementation of this particular measure, either in the form of particular schemes or campaigns inaugurated under its legislative sanction or in relation to any order which we shall make under it. The question of compulsion has been mentioned and I agree with a great deal of what Senator O'Reilly has said in this regard.  It is undoubtedly far better if we can achieve the results we desire by persuasion, argument and co-operation. It may be necessary from time to time to have recourse to compulsion to succeed in persuading what is only a very minor hard core of farmers to adopt a particular course of action.  By and large, if we want to achieve results on a large and comprehensive scale, we can only do so by getting the wholehearted and enthusiastic co-operation of the general body of farmers.  That will always be my approach to this whole question.</P>
    <P>I think it is indicative of the change that has come and the progress that has been made in the outlook of Irish farmers that nowadays we frequently find farmers themselves suggesting, or demanding from the Minister, that he should use compulsion because they are so convinced of the desirability of particular steps and the beneficial results that will flow from them that they think it worthwhile seeking to impose compulsion on themselves. That is probably the best indication we can get of the degree of progress made in Irish farming and the stage we have reached.  A great many people deserve a great deal of credit for that situation.  The advisory services, farmers' organisations, officials of my Department, An Foras Talúntais and a variety of other individuals and organisations deserve credit for the fact that we now have widespread acceptance of the necessity for the various measures which the Department proposes from time to time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="957" /> Senator Malone was concerned about the question of dehorning.  As I explained in the Dáil, this is something we must do and do pretty quickly because the retention of horns in any substantial sector of our cattle can bring about a great deal of loss and waste.  I think that with the co-operation of the authorities in the North, we should press on, as we intend to do, with proposals for dehorning the general body of our cattle.  The Bill enables us to exempt certain categories of animals from this general provision and it is a matter which we shall certainly discuss with the pedigree people and see if they have any suggestions they want to make to us in that regard and see if we can go some, or all, of the way to meet them.</P>
    <P>Probably because it aroused much more interest than any of the other points mentioned by Senators, I should like to refer to the disease Senator O'Reilly mentioned of trichomoniasis. I shall refrain from explaining to Senators, for reasons of delicacy, exactly what that disease is but I assure the Seanad that the reason we have not scheduled it as a disease is the difficulty of identifying it: there are other diseases of the same sort.  The real remedy for this situation, I think, is increasing use of artificial insemination and it is along those lines we should direct our efforts in this matter.</P>
    <P>As I expected, Senators mentioned the present threatening situation in Europe regarding foot and mouth disease.  Of course this is a source of anxiety to us and I want to assure the House that we have been giving the matter very close attention.  We have been reviewing all our practices and procedures in regard to veterinary regulations and controls to see if, in the light of this situation, they should be tightened up, and if any steps are necessary, Senators may be assured they will be taken.</P>
    <P>I should have thought that more Senators would have mentioned contagious abortion or brucellosis because this Bill came into being because of brucellosis.  Having eradicated bovine tuberculosis at a cost of over £30 million, the next step was clearly the eradication <Col N="958" /> of brucellosis.  We needed legislation to deal with it, just as we needed legislation to deal with bovine tuberculosis, and it seemed appropriate when having new legislation of this nature that we should proceed to consolidate all existing law in the matter and in addition to providing for brucellosis, provide also for any other possible campaigns on which we might wish to embark at any time in the future.</P>
    <P>Basically, this Bill is before us now because of the necessity to initiate a campaign for the eradication of brucellosis and, as I have mentioned, we plan to tackle brucellosis on roughly the same lines as we have tackled bovine tuberculosis, with one refinement: we intend to start in the north-western region with an eradication campaign but at the same time, we plan&mdash;indeed, we have already inaugurated&mdash;in the two main dairying areas in the south and the east, a calf vaccination service so that we hope that, by the time we come to spread the eradication campaign to these areas, the disruption of herds and so on will be much less than was the case with bovine tuberculosis because of the fact that the calf vaccination service will have already been in operation for a few years.</P>
    <P>Of course, while brucellosis is probably the greatest single source of loss in our livestock, there are many others, and I may mention in that connection particularly mastitis, which is the scourge of the dairy farmer and, undoubtedly, a matter that must be attended to as quickly as possible.  We have, as many Senators know, taken preliminary steps with regard to mastitis with the establishment of regional laboratories, in co-operation with the great co-operative societies in the dairying business, but the fight against mastitis will be a long, hard and difficult struggle.  It is estimated that mastitis certainly causes losses in any year to the extent of £6 million, £7 million to £8 million, maybe more.  When it is realised that a penny a gallon on milk delivered to the creamery brings in to the dairy farmer somewhere in the region of £1¼ million, the impact that elimination of mastitis or even substantial <Col N="959" /> reduction of the disease will have for the dairying industry can be immediately visualised.</P>
    <P>Side by side with the attack on these various diseases and pests in our cattle population, we have to deal with our sheep.  The situation there is also one in which active campaigns for the elimination of diseases and pests can bring very great and very beneficial results and we do not intend to neglect any opportunity of pursuing these objectives.</P>
    <P>The warble fly, naturally, has been mentioned by Senators.  I am pleased to be able to tell the Seanad that we have achieved what we can only regard as victory in this struggle.  In the campaign in 1965, we estimate that we treated somewhere in the region of 4¼ million cattle, and that is out of a total of over five million.  When you remove from the calculation all the animals that could not be treated or did not have to be treated for one reason or another, it is certain that the percentage was very high&mdash;indeed, well over 90 per cent&mdash;and can be taken as meaning that the campaign in 1965 was a complete success.  We are now reviewing the situation in the light of the campaign and its achievements and are deciding on what further steps have to be taken.  The Seanad can be satisfied that that particular battle is over and the warble fly, to all intents and purposes, has been eradicated or is well on the way towards final eradication.</P>
    <P>There are quite a number of other points which Senators mentioned and which I think it is more appropriate that we should deal with in greater detail on Committee Stage and I shall not mention any of them now.  I want again to assure Senators that the fact that I am not referring to them in this reply to the Second Reading debate does not mean that I am ignoring them in any way.  I will certainly be giving a great deal of thought to the points that have been raised and, if it is considered necessary, will certainly either put down amendments between now and Committee Stage or else look forward to Senators themselves putting <Col N="960" /> down their amendments in regard to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to follow the Minister in speaking in Irish on a scheme which we have before us only through the medium of the second national language but will refer to the text which is in English.</P>
      <P>In the translation of his remarks which the Minister was good enough to furnish in the first sentence there is a reference to the repayment in full of lump sums known as &ldquo;<i>ex gratia</i> grants&rdquo;.  I did not catch precisely the word the Minister used in Irish and I am wondering if there is any significance in the word &ldquo;repayment&rdquo;. I should have thought it ought to be &ldquo;payment&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Repayment&rdquo; suggests that at some time teachers have paid money to the Minister and he is now handing it back.  Is this the case and, if not, then why is the word &ldquo;repayment&rdquo; used here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, I note the Minister says this is an amending scheme of a statutory instrument governing payments made under the authority of a Supplementary Estimate passed by Dáil Éireann in March 1960.  I wonder why more than five years elapsed from the <Col N="962" /> time the Supplementary Estimate was passed until the scheme was introduced. It seems a very long delay and, talking of delays, I was wondering, too, why it has taken six months from the time the order was made to submit this scheme to the Seanad for approval.  There may be and, no doubt, are, good reasons for these delays, but I think it is worth inquiring as to the reasons for them.</P>
    <P>I notice that the service of certain teachers who taught in Northern Ireland is to be given credit for pension purposes, provided the service is pre-1934. I suppose this date has some special significance in relation to national teachers' pensions but I should be glad if the Minister would enlighten me as to the reason for this particular date and as to why service given by teachers in the past 31 years should not be credited for pension purposes. There are, perhaps, good reasons for this, but it would be helpful to know just what they are.</P>
    <P>The scheme makes special provision to enable teachers who have nearly completed a year to continue working for another three months in order that they may be credited with a further year.  That is a good thing.  I suppose it is necessary to limit it but it has been my experience that teachers retiring at the age limit are very often far from being beyond good teachers. On the contrary, some of the very best teachers are teachers over the age limit who have continued to teach.  I know that it is the practice now on the part of some secondary schools to snap up first-class national teachers when they reach retirement.  In particular subjects in secondary schools, some of these teachers are exceptionally good and, indeed, better than any other teacher available for these subjects because of their long experience.  I suppose we have no alternative but to insist on the retirement age, though many people continue hard at work and make a contribution well beyond the age of 65, and it seems a pity that this retirement age should be rigidly applied in a sphere in which experience is so valuable and in which age does not necessarily constitute a barrier to effective work in all cases.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="963" /> There is another question I should like to ask in regard to abatement.  Not very long ago we had legislation dealing with abatement of pensions.  What happens if a national teacher takes up employment after retirement in a secondary school?  Is there abatement of pension or has that anomaly been removed?  If it is still in existence, then it is something the Minister should look into because it would seem undesirable to discourage teachers in this way.  Of course there must be a provision with regard to retiring in the case of those who have gone beyond teaching.  Where, however, a secondary school decide they want as the best possible person for a particular post a retired national teacher because they believe he is the best qualified, it seems a pity that he should be discouraged from continuing to serve because of reduction of pension.  I wonder if abatement governs his pension in such circumstances.  If it does, then it is something that should be examined into without delay.</P>
    <P>In section 4 (1) (b), there is a reference to a widow.  I take it that includes a widower as well.  I take it there is no discrimination against the male sex here.  The Minister might confirm me in that conclusion.</P>
    <P>In section 10 there is something I do not quite understand.  Quite frankly, I have not had an opportunity of studying the original order.  I found this on my desk only today at lunch time when I returned from Cork.  In section 10 there is a reference at the end to the limitation of three years' pensionable service.  I am wondering if the Minister would explain what that limitation is in the principal scheme.  It is not selfevident on the face of it here and not having had an opportunity of studying the principal scheme, I wondered what the limitation was and what its purpose is.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to welcome the fact that the scheme refers to the other part of our country by its proper name of Northern Ireland, which is in accord with more recent Government practice in dropping pseudonyms such as the &ldquo;Six Counties&rdquo;.  It would be a <Col N="964" /> good thing if the Government were to use its influence with Telefís and Radio Éireann to get them to follow the same practice and cease referring, in these ecumenical days, to Northern Ireland as the &ldquo;Six Counties.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is somewhat astonishing to find a reference to Saorstát Éireann cropping up.  Presumably this is an historical reference and it is, I suppose, necessary for legal reasons.  It seems an odd way to refer to the State, but no doubt there is good reason for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrosnahan" hpid="Mr. Brosnahan Mr. Brosnahan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnahan</NameTxt>
      <P>Níl san tairiscint seo ach ordú chun feidhm dleathach a thúirt do neithe atá in úsáid cheana. Cuireann múinteoirí fáilte roimh an ordú ach ceapann siad gur ceart don Roinn aithint a thúirt freisin don tseirbhís iomlán a thug oidí nea-oilte roimh 1934 agus oidí a mhúin i scoileanna caipitíochta roimh 1934 le haghaidh cnapshuim.</P>
      <P>There is in this order nothing more than giving statutory effect to provisions already in operation for a number of years.  From the teachers' point of view, the provisions are welcome, but there is one point I want to make on the section which gives recogntion to two-thirds of service prior to 1934 in respect of junior assistant mistresses, untrained assistants and those who gave service in capitation convents and monastery schools.  We think the Department should have gone all the way and given recognition to two-thirds of the same service in respect of lump sun as well as pension.  I cannot understand the reasoning of the Department when they stop more or less half way, giving recognition to two-thirds of the service for pension but giving no recognition to two-thirds of the same service in respect of lump sum, whereas in regard to the teacher who serves in the capacity of a national teacher in the ordinary way, for service prior to 1934 and thereafter, entire recognition is given for pension and lump sum.  We have that criticism to make of the order before the House today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the section which deals with the granting of recognition to <Col N="965" /> people for service so that they can make up a further year of pensionable service where their birthday falls in the quarter ending 30th of any June, we welcome that provision also, and I have had the pleasure of being a member of the Conciliation Council which negotiated that arrangement.</P>
    <P>While speaking of pensions, I think I should avail myself of the opportunity to express what I consider would be the opinion of every side of the House, that parity of pensions should be introduced whereby pensions will be related to current salaries.  Many of the people affected by the depreciation in the value of money reducing the purchasing power of their pensions are people who have given wonderful service to the State since it was founded.  They came into the nation's service in difficult times and have made a major contribution to its welfare.  We would appeal to the Minister to convey to the Government our desire to see pensions based on current salaries. It is a shocking experience to be present at a meeting, as I and other members of the House were, to see ex-superintendents of the Guards, exinspectors of schools, ex-nurses, expublic servants generally, in their seventies and eighties all trooping in, asking for justice in this matter, people to whom we should be very grateful indeed for the nation they have left in our hands.  A community or a society which allows these old people to end their years in anger and disillusionment does not deserve to prosper.  It would be appreciated if the Minister would be kind enough to convey the appeal for parity of pension to the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to make more than three points on this order.  The first is very strongly in support of what Senator Brosnahan has said.  I am not very often given an opportunity of supporting what he says, but what he says about parity of pensions is absolutely sound.  It seems to me the Minister and the Government must agree with him in this.  It applies not only to teachers' pensions but to <Col N="966" /> all pensions.  It is obvious that when the cost of living goes up sufficiently to warrant an increase in salaries within the Civil Service, this should apply also to pensions and to parity of pensions. Of course this is looking forward to some future Order, but I urge on the Minister the justice and the necessity for doing this and of putting it before his Cabinet colleagues.</P>
      <P>The other two points I wish to make were mentioned by Senator Garret FitzGerald.  One is in relation to allowing a certain amount of service in the North of Ireland to count towards pension rights.  Quite clearly, this is a very good thing.  I am disappointed, though, to find it is apparently to apply only to service in the distant past&mdash;pre-1934 I understand&mdash;and this does not seem to me to be just.  I ask the Minister again to see if he could not consider service in Northern Ireland or indeed in Britain in primary schools to be regarded perfectly legitimately towards pension rights in this country.  The effect of such a consideration would be an increase in the recruitment of valuable and experienced primary school teachers in Ireland, because there must be many in the North of Ireland, and more particularly in Britain, of Irish parents or Irish extraction who would quite gladly come back here were it not for the fact that they would, by coming back, be sacrificing many valuable years of pensionable service.  This point has been made very well already, but I stress it, and hope the Minister will view it with sympathy.  In this respect I refer to paragraph 7 on page 6 of the Report before us, though it is not sufficiently extended.  It seems to me the Minister might well consider in relation to secondary teachers on the incremental scale that their years of service in Britain and the North might similarly be counted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last point is in reference to retirement at the age of 65 years.  Is the Minister really satisfied&mdash;Senator Garret FitzGerald put the question to him&mdash;that he is not losing most valuable members of the staffs of primary schools by insisting on retirement at 65 years?  It is well konwn to me, too, that many national school teachers <Col N="967" /> give long years of valuable service in secondary schools.  I can think of specific examples of absolutely brilliant teachers with long experience, and the primary schools no longer want them at the age of 65.  I know voluntary hospitals in this city which allow surgeons to serve on to the age of 70. Teachers can still work extremely well with a shake in their hands.  I am not quite so sure about surgeons.  If it is all right for surgeons to continue working up to 70 years, I do not see why teachers, if they want to, should not have their service extended, which might then increase their rate of pension. This is also a point to which I should like to direct the Minister's attention.  It was touched on, too, by Senator FitzGerald.  Apart from this, as far as I read it&mdash;I do not claim to have read it in all its implications&mdash; the order is clearly a good and just one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome what has been done under the National Teachers' Superannuation Scheme because everything in the scheme before us has already been implemented.  It is just a question of putting the matter in order.  The pre-1950 teachers&mdash;many of my friends are among them&mdash;certainly appreciate what was done under the scheme.  They went out without a gratuity but by the action of the INTO, they have been brought in and the Government have agreed that those people should not be left without gratuity when they retire.</P>
      <P>It was a pity the Minister did not see his way to include the pre-1934 teachers for the full amount instead of for the two-thirds.  The number of those pre-1934 teachers who are still alive is very small and the amount of money involved would be very small indeed.  It would be a tribute to those people to pay the full amount to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to allowing teachers to continue to teach after 65 years, I do not agree that teachers should do so.  I agree with the three months that has been given.  It is a good thing. Someone could be caught for a couple of days and the fact that he will get an extra three months to qualify for <Col N="968" /> another year's pension is very good. When I was trained, there were 300 teachers walking around with their hands in their pockets, and I was one of them.  There were people who were kept on after their time and their time was extended because of certain service they had given.  I should not like to see that happen again.  The average teacher is trained at 20 years of age and by the time he reaches 65 he has 45 years' service in the national school. It is time for him to retire them.</P>
    <P>I welcome the three months extension period but I would not welcome extending the number of years because there are too many people emigrating from this country at the present time.  If more teachers are required, it should be quite an easy matter to train and employ them in their own country. I am not asking them to take the emigrant boat to England or somewhere else.  I should like to see the day when everyone in this country, no matter what his position, whether it be politician or otherwise, would retire at 65 years of age.</P>

      <P>Senator McAuliffe mentioned a point I want to stress, that is, that this scheme really implements a number of agreements arrived at in the conciliation scheme for national teachers.  This gives formal, legal effect to matters which have been in operation for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want, first of all, to apologise for the inaccurate translation which was given to Senators.  Senator Garret FitzGerald referred to the word &ldquo;repayment&rdquo; in the English translation, which of course should read &ldquo;revision&rdquo;. The reason for this, if I may mention it, is that due to a slight breakdown in communications, I was not aware until a fairly late hour that this matter was coming before the Seanad today.  Therefore, the statement I made, which had been prepared in Irish, was all I had. There was no English translation available at the time.  One was prepared in <Col N="969" /> a hurry and I am afraid it led to this slight inaccuracy.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of service in Northern Ireland.  I should like to make it clear that what is referred to here is service in respect of which there were arrangements between the Governments in Belfast and Dublin.  There were some kind of reciprocal arrangements which came to an end in 1934.  I do not think there is any case for reviving them in the form in which they existed then, but I should like to make it clear to the Seanad that there is provision at present for teachers of any kind, including national teachers who serve in Northern Ireland, to get credit for that service, within certain limits, if they teach here.  Whether that should be extended beyond Northern Ireland is a much wider question which was debated some time ago on a motion in Dáil Éireann.  There are strong arguments to be made on both sides.  My position on that question is that I am waiting to see how the scheme with Northern Ireland will work out, and to see whether in fact extending the scheme to Britain would be of benefit to us or would simply be of benefit to Britain.</P>
    <P>With regard to the retiring age of 65, I should like to make it clear also that it is possible at present for teachers to continue after the age of 65 for a period of three years, but on that basis their service is renewable from year to year, and they are granted this extension only where their record as teachers is satisfactory.  A number of teachers do avail of this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There were other factors, too.  Senator Garret FitzGerald asked what was the reason for the delay. The main reason for the delay is that the awards at conciliation which are being implemented did not take place at the one time.  They took place at intervals.  It was known or suspected that they were coming.  I wanted to introduce them together in one instrument. This, combined with certain other matters, held them up.  What was held up was the formalising of them, and they have been implemented for some time past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Senator Garret FitzGerald also raised the question of what happens to the teachers who resume employment after retirement.  The position is that if a teacher is employed or <Col N="971" /> re-employed after he retires, his pension stops until his employment stops and then commences again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that.  I think Senator Garret FitzGerald raised a question about the limitation of transferred service, which is the case of a national teacher becoming a secondary teacher.  In that case, under an arrangement made before this scheme was introduced, a national teacher had a limitation of three years' service.  That was all that would be recognised if he became a secondary teacher.  This scheme does away with that limitation.  His full service would be recognised but this is for pension purposes only.  Under our present arrangements also, a national teacher who wants to become a secondary teacher has to comply with the requirements of the Registration Council for Secondary Teachers, apart from the academic qualifications.  He would have to start at the bottom, as regards doing the year on probation which secondary teachers have to do, but for pension purposes, his service as a national teacher would count fully under this scheme, and prior to this, only three years' service would count.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The extent to which it might have been abated would depend on his salary from State funds.  If he retires as a national teacher, he cannot become a recognised secondary teacher.  These are the cases that the Senator is thinking about.  He must go through a fairly formal procedure.  He cannot do this if he serves fully as a national teacher and then retires.</P>
      <P>Senator Garret FitzGerald asked whether the reference to a widow included a widower.  The answer is &ldquo;no,&rdquo; and the reason is that what is being dealt with there is a situation which applies only to some teachers retiring between the years 1950 and 1960.  The arrangement made is an <i>ex gratia</i> one and does not apply to any teachers retiring after 1960 or before 1950.  As I say, the arrangement was an <i>ex gratia</i> one, if I can use that term.  It was settled on that basis, I understand, and the terms on which the settlement was made applied only to widows.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There was one other matter raised by Senator Brosnahan, supported by Senator Sheehy Skeffington, the question <Col N="973" /> of the pension parity.  I am not sure whether it is a matter that, strictly speaking, arises on this, but I want to draw the attention of the House to the fact that while the present position cannot be regarded by anybody as being satisfactory, nevertheless it is vastly superior to what it was say five or six years ago.  A considerable improvement has been made in bringing pensions up much nearer to those being granted to people retiring today. I am speaking not just of national teachers but in general, in regard to pensions for which the State is responsible. While, as I say, the position cannot be regarded as satisfactory, nevertheless considerable progress has been made and it indicates the direction in which one could reasonably expect the movement to be in the future.</P>

    <Title>Rules for National Schools:    Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That the Seanad would welcome a reconsideration by the Minister for Education of recent changes made by him in the Rules for National Schools.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Senator Sheehy Skeffington.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not delay the House long.  On the last occasion I was dealing with the necessity of spelling out as clearly as possible what is allowed to teachers under the rules as far as corporal punishment is concerned. The more clearly we spell out the rules, the better it will be for the teachers and for the pupils and the more peace the Minister is going to have in his headquarters.  The Minister in his contribution to the debate said, at column 593, Volume 60 of the Seanad Debates for 24th November:</P>
      <P>It is only on these rare occasions when what is at stake is the teacher's authority that corporal punishment should be used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a pretty clear statement and I cannot understand why a draft rule embodying the Minister's view on that should not be incorporated in the book of regulations.  The Minister seems to have cleared his mind on it and I should like to accept that that is the Minister's sincere viewpoint.  I should like him to tell the House why it is not possible to embody that rather than leave the rules so vague.  He did mention here, and I think in the Dáil, that perhaps the very vagueness of the rules could in certain cases act as a deterrent as far as certain teachers are concerned when it came to the use of corporal punishment, that the fact that they did not know what was in the Minister's mind might act as a deterrent.  Personally, <Col N="975" /> I cannot follow that and I do not accept it.  I would much prefer if all should know where they stand.</P>
    <P>I mentioned on the last occasion some comments on the old Rule 96.  I did that because some of the speakers who put the case on behalf of the teachers so ably, thanked the Minister for removing Rule 96 which stated that the boxing of pupils' ears, pulling hair and similar treatment were forbidden. The argument put forward by certain Senators was that the very fact that that rule was there to be seen cast a slur on our teachers and that visitors coming here and asking to see the rules were horrified at the idea that such a rule was necessary.  The view was that this was not necessary at all: &ldquo;Let us remove this rule&rdquo;&mdash;sweep under the carpet, if you like, the idea that such could take place.  At the same time that that rule was removed, an entirely new paragraph was added to Rule 130, to the effect that ridicule, sarcasm, or remarks likely to undermine a pupil's self-confidence should be avoided.  That did not appear in the old Rules.  It has been brought in deliberately by the Minister.  It is accepted by many people who are entitled to speak on a matter of this nature that sarcasm or standing pupils in a corner and exposing them to ridicule could be even more hurtful than physical punishment and that a good teacher would not even dream of doing that; yet the Minister finds it necessary to incorporate that specifically in the Rules and his action is welcomed by the teachers' spokesmen.</P>
    <P>I do not think they can have it both ways.  In my opinion, it is just as great a slur, if you put it that way, to have that incorporated as the previous Rule dealing with the pulling of hair.  I welcome that paragraph in Rule 130 because I do not think it casts any slur on the teacher and it clears the air for all concerned and likewise I accept the same applies to the old Rule 96 in that it makes it quite clear to all and sundry, and to that section of the teaching profession which might be tempted to use corporal punishment.</P>
    <P>The present position, as far as I can <Col N="976" /> ascertain, and I have made quite a number of inquiries, is that corporal punishment is inflicted for not knowing lessons in national schools.  I am satisfied that that takes place.  We are not discussing here the question of cruelty or the use of any weapon other than the cane.  I am talking about the use of corporal punishment for not knowing lessons.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister believe that this is so?  If so, is he prepared to see that the rules, as they are laid down, are carried out?  Even during the course of the discussion so far, a number of speakers, and on his own side of the House, made it quite clear that from their experience children were being slapped and beaten for not knowing their lessons.  If there are rules laid down, let them be observed.  Those whose function it is to teach respect to the youth should have respect for any regulations laid down for their own conduct.</P>
    <P>To me, the test as far as children are concerned is their view about going to school.  Do they like to go to school or are they afraid to go to school? If children go to school shivering in their boots, afraid of facing the teacher, there is something wrong.  I think such fear is being eliminated as the years go by.  I know from talking to my own nieces and nephews, of whom I have plenty, that the majority love the idea of school and the question of fear does not enter their minds at all.  That is a welcome sign.  It is a sign that the teacher is not there as a bogeyman or somebody to frighten them.  However, there are still schools where the children go fearful of punishment.  It is in these schools we will find an excessive use of corporal punishment.</P>
    <P>I listened with great attention to the various speeches made and I read many of the comments outside in letters to the various papers.  It is extraordinary that running through most of the contributions of those who still favour corporal punishment was this: we must drive out original sin.  Drive out original sin&mdash;with the stick, I presume? We have others who say that we must be cruel to be kind.  Then there are others whom I would describe as the <Col N="977" /> Bible-searching, Scripture-quoting protagonists of corporal punishment.  They are prepared, like Cromwell, to produce something out of the Bible in order to justify their belief.  Cromwell was a great man to quote Scripture, but he is not thought very highly of in this country in spite of his great faith in the Bible and Scriptures.</P>
    <P>Those, like the Senator who moved the motion, who have interested themselves in this issue have been described in this House and outside it as &ldquo;cranks&rdquo;.  That word has been used here several times.  As far as outside is concerned, it is the most frequently used word to describe those who took it on themselves to initiate a discussion on this matter.  The idea is to put this into the minds of the public&mdash;that these people are cranks&mdash;and thereby reduce the value of any contribution they may make to the debate.</P>
    <P>Let us ask ourselves: what is a crank?  It varies in different periods. In records kept in the town of Roscommon, for instance, about 140 years ago, a child between 11 and 12 years was hanged for stealing.  A number of people were horrified by that barbarity, but quite a number felt also that this was a sin that had to be punished.  Those who thought it was barbarous were looked on at that time as cranks.  The people who condoned that hanging were otherwise decent, good-living people in every respect.  But they condoned the action as being carried out under the law as a punishment for evil.</P>
    <P>Sixty years ago, children from seven to ten years were harnessed to trolleys and carriages underground and forced to draw coal in many pits in Wales and other parts of the world.  Young people from eight to 12 years were forced to work in factories in industrial Britain at that time for from 14 to 16 hours a week in dark rooms.  A number of people said at the time that this was a terrible way to treat young people.  The description I find of those people is that they were well-meaning but they were cranks.  That was the description applied to them by those who did not want to change that society.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that during <Col N="978" /> that period, when this exploitation of the young was going on, the economists of the day, speaking on behalf of the benevolent employers, were able to produce statistics of the danger to the economy if child labour was done away with.  One hundred years ago, slavery was in operation, and those who tried to stop it were regarded as cranks.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in our Christian community today, when people like Senator Sheehy Skeffington have the courage to lay their head on the block in a matter of this nature, we should recall that it was cranks of the type I have described who down through the years brought about the change in our outlook so far as children and society are concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister has admitted there was a problem.  He said:</P>
    <P>I believe that there is a little more than comes to light officially for one reason or another but I do not believe that it is widespread or extensive.</P>
    <P>He was referring to the excessive use of corporal punishment.  He asks us to help him devise ways and means of bringing these cases to light.  He suggested that parents could appeal to the Minister.  Possibly, that is a solution; but for a progressive Minister who believes himself to be practical in his approach, I do not think that that approach could be described as a practical one.  We know the Minister's predecessor was submerged with letters of complaint from parents and others. I do not think the Minister should have his valuable time taken up investigating complaints of this nature. His function is to plan education and not to act as a kind of referee or umpire on complaints about corporal punishment in schools.  I do not think it should be necessary for him to come into this at all.  Furthermore, the Minister should know that parents will not complain to him.  After all, the parent who may feel very annoyed about a child's being ill-treated, as he thinks, says to himself: &ldquo;Well, my child will be in this school for another number of years and I have to make sure there will be no further punishment or vendetta <Col N="979" /> because of a complaint&rdquo;.  It is only natural that a parent will be very slow in the circumstances to do anything about it.</P>
    <P>I want to come to what I think could be done, and reference has been made to it by the mover of the motion and, indeed, by others.  I want to refer to what I think is the proper way to deal with this question, instead of having the Minister cluttered up with it.  The Minister should take his courage in his hands and initiate parent-teacher groups.  In the Dáil he was asked a number of supplementary questions about corporal punishment and no less than five times in the course of his reply, he said: &ldquo;A just and wise parent would do this&rdquo;, &ldquo;a just and wise parent would do that&rdquo; or &ldquo;this is being done just as a just and wise parent would do it&rdquo;.  As far as the education of the child is concerned, we accept that the parents' rights are inalienable, but will anybody tell me where the parents are consulted?  The Minister has referred to the just and wise parent but I am blowed if I can see where that just and wise parent is consulted at any stage of the educational planning as far as the children are concerned.  Whatever way the Minister flatters the parent here by describing him as just and wise, I am afraid the parent is not supposed to have a mind of his own at all.</P>
    <P>The winds of change&mdash;that expression has been used fairly often&mdash;have been blowing recently in places other than Africa.  I believe it is time for fresh thinking on this question.  After all, the parents are there, unorganised and helpless to a great extent.  I hope the able spokesmen for the teachers' organisations will not feel annoyed when I say I believe that the teachers' organisations and the representatives of these organisations must take part of the blame for keeping things as they are.  When I find the teachers' leaders and spokesmen saying they did not want to be consulted on the rulings, I think they are taking the wrong view. When the teachers' representatives say they did not ask the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I have never heard of a parish group being invited by the manager, by the Department or by anybody else, to give <Col N="981" /> their views on education.  I do know that parent committees are very welcome when it comes to running a bingo session or when it comes to running a carnival.  At that stage, their brains are very useful.  However, I should like to see the reaction of some managers I know if such a committee said: &ldquo;We have formed ourselves into a bingo committee or a carnival committee, as the case may be, and we shall now form ourselves into a parents' committee&rdquo;.  I should be interested to know the reaction in some parishes to such a suggestion. Therefore, I think the onus, at this stage, is on the Minister.</P>

      <P>The Minister should accept the responsibility of initiating the parent-teacher committee.  I shall not enter into it in detail because I believe there are many views on it and there are plenty of people better qualified than I am to suggest to the Minister how often such a committee should meet, what the discussions should be about and the extent of its powers.  As a public representative, I am completely in favour of the idea and whatever backing I can give the Minister&mdash; he may not accept it or otherwise&mdash;he will have it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I resent very much the idea of a Minister of this Parliament suggesting that the less talk we have about this matter, the better.  He sought to suggest that certain elements in this country who were advocating parent-teacher groups should keep silent because they <Col N="982" /> are doing damage.  I do not accept that at all.  The people who are doing damage are the people who are keeping quiet and have not the courage of their convictions to say out openly what they know to be true and what the position actually is.  This cannot be done overnight.  We do not expect a revolution to take place even during the Minister's tenure of office, be it long or short, but as he has spoken&mdash; prior to taking over this onerous burden as Minister&mdash;in favour of the parent-teacher groups in no uncertain fashion, we know that his mind at that stage was very much in favour of the idea.  I hope I am not doing him an injustice when I say that he seems to have been affected by the departmentalisation disease since he took over.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not like the Minister to depend on the suggestions made by Senator Ó Maoláin the previous day.  If the Minister does take the initiative on this, I think the idea of bringing about a decentralisation would relieve him of a lot of the annoyance and routine he will have to deal with as far as school problems are concerned.  If his desk is cluttered up with complaints on the rules from some parents, that is because he is the final decider, shall we say, outside of court, as to whether or not justice is being done to the pupils.  It is not reasonable to suggest that that should be a Minister's function.  If he has a parent-teacher group in a parish, very often, as I believe at any rate, those complaints would be solved without any trouble when the parents got together. I know you will have the awkward parent who thinks that the sun shines out of Johnny, or that his daughter Mary is beyond reproach&mdash; two little angels.  A parent may very <Col N="983" /> often feel annoyed at the way children are treated but the best possible way to have that matter cleared up is by the parents getting together.  It is very easy to get an awkward parent cut down to size by the other parents in the parish when they all get together. To my mind such a change would bring about big changes in our society after a short period.</P>
      <P>As it is, particularly in the rural areas, there is no such thing as what we would describe as organisation to help the groups in a proper way.  There may be this organisation for amusements, for certain other functions, but there is no real initiative displayed by the people themselves.  They have to be led and they expect leadership from certain people, particularly from the religious groups.  It is not fair to expect a parish priest to lead the parish in all aspects or to act as a general adviser on matters outside his own particular scope.  But the position today is that the people have become so accustomed to the present day situation that they are not prepared to move on their own in any regard.  By bringing parent-teacher committees into existence, the Minister would be opening the door to a bright future as far as initiative and so forth is concerned on the part of our people and I would ask him to start on this now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime, if the Minister is determined to allow corporal punishment, apart from the suggestion that another teacher should carry it out, and that of course is not practicable in many schools, one thing could be decided upon, that is, that a rules or punishment book should be kept in every school.  It should be mandatory on the teacher to enter into that schoolbook, for inspection by the Minister's inspectors, every occasion when corporal punishment is carried out.  The reason I say that should be done is that it would be a safeguard for the teacher himself and, very often, would prevent punishment being given where a loss of temper is involved.  It would act as a restraint.  That is one suggestion which might be of help to the Minister.  Outside of that, I would suggest to him that when rules are <Col N="984" /> made, he should see that those rules are obeyed.</P>

      <P>At the outset I want to say I have read over this motion and have listened to the proposer, Senator Sheehy Skeffington, and the other speakers who supported him on it. I have the height of respect for Senator Sheehy Skeffington from what I know of him.  I cannot say I know him personally but I have heard of him on many occasions.  I listened to him making his case and one thing impressed me&mdash;the way he skipped lightly over many of the rules&mdash;and, before he was speaking for very long, there was no doubt in my mind or in the mind of any of the Senators here as to where he is heading because I had already heard of one of his pet subjects, and, like the grandfather clock of old, he stopped short when he got to this particular Rule.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to this Rule on corporal punishment.  I think it is not unfair of me to suggest that he is merely using this motion to ride the hobbyhorse of publicity.  I have been amazed at the way in which he has used the sanctuary of Seanad Éireann to make statements, some of them slanderous, about defenceless people who are unable to come into this House and defend themselves and who have no chance whatever of refuting the allegations he has made in support of his motion.  I would venture to say he seems to play the role of a fairy godfather, very tender-hearted as far as his attitude to children is concerned, but, at the same time, the very way in which he attacks these defenceless people <Col N="985" /> shows that he is very vindictive and inflicts very severe punishment on other people&mdash;who are not children but actually grown up people&mdash;who are unable to reply or defend themselves because he makes these accusations within the privilege of this House.</P>
      <P>I feel that he is more or less the mouthpiece of some pressure group or groups, whoever they may be, who for a long time have been making attacks on the teaching profession.  I venture to say that it may be a thinly-veiled weapon used to attack teaching brothers and nuns and managers, using the lay national teachers as a kind of cannon fodder.  I think it was one of the supporters of the motion who recently said that he was actually putting his head on the block.  I cannot see very much bravery in a man putting his head on the block when he knows quite well the executioner will not be in a position to bring the axe down on his head because he is protected by the fact that he is in this House.</P>
      <P>I distinctly remember that when introducing his motion, he drew a letter from his pocket, a letter from a parent whose boy was attending the college attached to St. Patrick's Training College, Drumcondra.  Incidentally, that college is the cradle and <i>alma mater</i> of a great many of the lay national teachers, and it is a college which has done a tremendous amount of work in fostering the education of our people and also national ideals.</P>
      <P>In this letter the Senator accused the teacher, Mr. Frank McAleer, of boxing the child's ear.  I might say that Senator Brosnahan, who is a representative of the teachers and who is here in this House, has since investigated that case and I think I should read here what has been said on it, seeing that the proposer read the other letters. I should like it to go on the records of the House that the charge made in the letter is without foundation, is based on falsehood and was used in an irresponsible and invidious manner under the privileges of this House.  In fairness to Mr. McAleer, against whom a false charge has been put on the records of this House, I wish to read a statement which Mr. McAleer has furnished to the INTO.</P>

      <P>The statement says:</P>
      <P>On Friday afternoon, November 12th, Vincent Perry was in the school shed interfering with broken desks when he should have been in his line with the rest of his class. When I asked him to go to his line, he did so with evident reluctance and in a disrespectful manner with his hands in his pockets and a cheeky smirk on his face.  I then ordered him to come with me and join Mr. Blake's class (III).  I was in charge of that class as Mr. Blake was absent through illness.  On reaching the classroom door, he stopped and refused to enter.  I took him by the arm and brought him inside the classroom.  That was the one and only time that I touched him and I used only enough force to make him go into the room.  Then I asked him to go and sit down by himself in a back corner seat.</P>
      <P>He immediately adopted a defiant attitude, refused point-blank to obey me and said in a loud and defiant voice that he would not sit down and that I could not make him do so and that he would bring up his father to deal with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reminding him that I was the Principal Teacher, I repeated the request <Col N="987" /> with the warning that if he refused to obey me he could possibly be expelled from the school for gross insubordination and for showing such bad example to younger boys.  He still maintained his defiant attitude and refused to obey.</P>
    <P>I then told the boys in the class to listen carefully and to observe what happened.</P>
    <P>I ordered him again to sit down and he again refused.</P>
    <P>I then told him to tell his father that I was going to report him to the Rev. Manager of the school and to suggest to him (the Manager) either that the boy be removed from the school or that he make a public apology to me before the class for his outrageous conduct.</P>
    <P>Frank McAleer, Principal, St. Patrick's No. 1 National School, Drumcondra.</P>
    <P>It is obvious to all that the boy, in an effort to protect himself, got to his father before the teacher could carry out his threat and told him a deliberate lie, as happened in the Ballyfermot case.  We had some references to that on the last occasion.  We know that a court case was brought and we know exactly what the findings were.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion also, I think some references were made to the case at Raharoon and since then somebody said that the Department took disciplinary action and actually changed the teacher from that school to what was described as a penal settlement, to the Aran Islands.  I think it was Senator Brosnahan who very ably refuted that and said that the Department does not appoint or transfer teachers, that this is a function of the manager.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have put that statement on the records of the House because otherwise the teacher concerned would have no opportunity of refuting the charges made against him here.  That is only one of the letters.  I distinctly remember the proposer of the motion taking stacks of letters from his well-stocked bag and reading them.  They are all on the records of the House. Many of them were signed by some pen <Col N="988" /> name and probably they could have been written by the proposer of the motion himself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  I was not at all impressed by the way in which Senator McQuillan jumped to the assistance of Senator Sheehy Skeffington, as I had expected it.  I have listened to most of his speeches on this matter and I find they follow his usual line. He alleges he visited many schools and found that corporal punishment is more or less rampant in his district.  I wonder how he succeeded in ascertaining these so-called facts or alleged facts and on whose authority he visited these schools and where they were.  I am quite sure that most people do not attach a great deal of value to his opinion but nevertheless he did make the statement here and I think it worth quoting on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quoting from column 736 of <Col N="989" /> the Official Report of 1st December 1965:</P>
    <P>In the past week, I went specially to a number of schools to find out for myself whether I had been in sufficiently close contact with the situation.  I found that not alone were those punishments being carried out but that they were being carried out for not knowing the lessons&mdash;the one thing the Minister has been specific about for which punishment should not be inflicted. It has been carried out not alone where lay teachers are concerned but where nuns are concerned.  They are just as guilty of breach of the Rules as the ordinary lay teacher.</P>
    <P>On whose authority, I wonder, did Senator McQuillan go around and make these investigations.  I certainly do not attach much weight to his statement there and I do not think the majority of Senators will attach much weight to it.  I could safely say they have good reason to doubt the accuracy of it.</P>
    <P>During the debate many of the supporters of the motion have labelled the teachers in general here as sadistic, savage monsters.  One would think that the majority of the teachers took special delight in inflicting punishment on their pupils.  Very little reference was made from the other side of the House, except from teachers' representatives, to the excellent work that the lay teachers and the teachers in general are doing and have done for the youth of this country all down the years.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Maoláin very ably described the role of national teachers in the national sphere down the years and paid tribute to their integrity and devotion and to the service in general they have given the community.</P>
    <P>I thought it better to make some reference to the matter which I mentioned in the beginning.  Now I come to the change of Rules, which the motion is supposed to cover.  I do not see anything wrong with the Rules as they have been issued to the teachers. There may be minor things here and there which need adjustment but, if <Col N="990" /> they do, the Minister or his Department can make those adjustments when they wish.  So far as I know, the Rules have not been amended since 1946.  We are living in a time of change.  It is only natural that after a lapse of 20 years some amendments or addenda should be made and some rules which were not suitable to modern conditions rescinded.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Rule which seems to have caused the greater part of the discussion here, that is, the rule dealing with corporal punishment, the Minister and his predecessor and, indeed, most Ministers for Education that I have heard of, have always been very firm with regard to this matter of corporal punishment.  It may be the case that because the majority of the 14,000 teachers are in the INTO and a special insurance scheme covers teachers against accidents and, probably, corporal punishment cases, <i>et cetera</i>, some vindictive parents might try to come by easy money by making false charges and very often sums of money are paid out and that may give rise to the fact that these practices are widespread whereas if the cases were taken into court, like the two cases that have been mentioned here, it is almost certain that they would be thrown out as frivolous cases, having no foundation.</P>
    <P>To my mind, there is more noise than importance in connection with this motion.  If there never had been a motion, the majority of the people of the country would realise what the teachers and the Department know quite well, that it is necessary to have order in schools so as to give efficient service.  I do not mean that it is necessary to resort to corporal punishment but it is necessary to have order and from a very young age children must be taught to know and to observe the difference between right and wrong. All that is expected under the Rules from the teacher is that he would give to the children placed under his control the same attention and guidance and expect the same standards of behaviour and righteousness as a good parent would expect from his own children.</P>

      <P>The motion we are dealing with is an extremely important one concerning the wellbeing of 500,000 children and the livelihood of about 15,000 teachers.  It is a very good thing that a motion of this importance should be debated in Seanad Éireann and I suppose we are all grateful to Senator Sheehy Skeffington for putting down this motion in the Seanad and for giving us the opportunity of calling the Minister's attention and the attention of the House to various matters in the Rules governing national schools and of expressing our own views on what we believe to be the proper things to be done.</P>
      <P>I do not think for a moment that it will help children, teachers, parents, the Minister, managers or anybody else if there is to be charge and counter-charge here in this Chamber and I do not think that speeches such as the last one we have heard, impugning improper motives to a man of Senator Sheehy Skeffington's calibre, will do any good.  We may not like Senator Sheehy Skeffington; we may disagree thoroughly with him; but there is nobody who can say that he is not honest and there is nobody who can ever say that he would come into this House and quote a letter which he himself had written.  I do not think that kind of suggestion is of any assistance whatever to a debate of this kind.</P>
      <P>The motion before the House deals with the Rules and asks the Minister to reconsider some of the Rules.  I think it was wise of Senator Sheehy Skeffington to cast his net as widely as possible so that he could not possibly be ruled out of order in roving through these various Rules.  Of course, everybody realised that what Senator Sheehy Skeffington wanted to get at was the Rule dealing with corporal punishment and that the rest was the <i>hors d'oeuvres</i> to the main course to which he wished to treat the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The thing that surprised me reading <Col N="992" /> the debate was that the Rules which concern the wellbeing of 500,000 children and the livelihood, fortunes and integrity of 15,000 teachers were never the subject of consultation between the Minister for Education and his Department, on the one hand, and the managers and the teachers' organisation, on the other.  Senator Brosnahan said in his speech:</P>
    <P>However, if the INTO had been consulted I think they would be in favour of the changes.</P>

      <P>I am not being dichotymous at all.  I observe professional etiquette in this matter.  I shall not be in any way dichotymous. I have great sympathy with teachers. Both my parents were teachers. Members of my family are teachers. I also have great sympathy with parents.  I am a parent myself.  I have great sympathy for children.  I have great sympathy for the Minister for Education, for managers, for Senator Sheehy Skeffington.  It now seems quite clear that the INTO were consulted.  They were sent a draft copy of the Rules.  I presume the Minister sent out that draft copy for the observations of the INTO, and if that organisation thought that the Rules needed to be amended or if there were Rules with which they did not agree, they were entitled so to inform the Minister and presumably they would have done so.</P>
      <P>It is quite clear now they got a copy of this Rule before it was signed by the Minister for Education as part of the new Rules relating to national schools.  The extraordinary thing is, and this is where the Minister put himself in bad with a great many people, that there was no publication.  Some time way back in 1964 the Minister decided to promulgate new Rules.  The Government are not lacking in means of propaganda or organs of communication, but there was no word about all this in the public Press&mdash;it did not come as far as Senator Sheehy Skeffington until after July&mdash;and the only conclusion to which people could be driven was that the Minister wanted to do this secretly.  If he did not want to do it secretly, why had he not publicised it?  That is the mistake the Minister of the day made.  He should have announced in some Press release that he had revised the Rules, among others the Rule relating to corporal punishment.  There was no earthly reason why he should not have publicised that, no reason why he should not have shouted it from the housetops.  It is regrettable that the Minister at the time was either not advised at all or ill-advised in regard to publicity.  There was no reason why he should not have publicised this.</P>

      <Col N="994" /> When a Minister makes a change of this kind, there is obviously some reason for making the change.  I am not prepared to say, and I am sure no one else is prepared to say, what is the best thing that could be done to secure the necessary discipline in the schools and enable teachers to carry on their work and the students in their charge to grow up with a proper respect for authority.  I am sure if I were to examine the Estimates for 1964-65 and 1965-66, I would not find any provision for a panel of psychologists with whom the Minister for Education could consult.</P>

      <P>The Minister is making changes.  I am sure they were not available to his predecessor.  In a matter of this kind, there should be not alone a panel of psychologists but also panels of sociologists, teachers and parents available to the Minister for consultation.  I have heard politicians say that one gets a certain view in Departments and there is always a most compelling reason for adopting any particular line, that reason being backed up by all the resources of the particular Department.  Very frequently a Minister requires an opinion other than a departmental one.  He should be able to go to some other body.  The body may be constituted any way he likes.  He can put in as many of his political supporters as he likes, provided he can get from that body a non-Civil Service view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are cases, and this is one of them, in which a Minister should be able to go to another body and ask what is the way to deal with a particular problem; with the help of his advisers then, he can make up his mind.  It is important in this day and age, remembering the way young people behave, for the Minister to have at his disposal all available advice as to how problems should be dealt with and how situations may be turned to the best advantage.  That is something in which the Minister needs the guidance of experts.  I do not regard inspectors appointed from the ranks of teacher as experts in any field.  They are very good inspectors, but they are <Col N="995" /> not experts.  I know that there is very little research work done; there is very little time available to these officials in which to engage in the kind of research necessary to garner the benefits of modern techniques and modern methods.</P>
    <P>Apparently the Minister had some consultation with his officials in relation to these Rules.  He then decided these should be the Rules.  But he did not publicise them.  That was a serious mistake and it has resulted in the quite justifiable criticism that all this was done in secret.  What we have to bear in mind in this debate is that discipline must be maintained in the schools.  Somebody has said that order is Heaven's first law and bears upon it the impress of Divinity. There must be order in the schools. I, for one, am not prepared to say that that order can be achieved and maintained all the time in all national schools, or indeed in secondary or vocational schools, without on occasion resorting to corporal punishment and punishments of other kinds.  Neither am I prepared to say that corporal punishment is the best way of achieving and maintaining order and discipline in the schools.  My attitude is that to date we have corporal punishment in the schools; irrespective of what people may say about it or whether or not they disagree with it, we have had it.  It has worked not too badly and I would not be prepared to part with it, unless and until I knew I was replacing it with some better method. It is for that kind of reason that I am not certain that if no teacher is to have resort to corporal punishment it would not be the undoing of a whole generation of pupils in some of our national schools.</P>
    <P>Every teacher will tell you that oftentimes there is in one particular class one boy or, less frequently, one girl who is absolutely incorrigible, who, like the bad apple in the basket, affects the whole class.  Teachers will tell you this about a whole class, and this applies to secondary schools as it does to national schools: &ldquo;That whole class&rdquo;&mdash;fourth, fifth, sixth or seventh class in a national school or third year, <Col N="996" /> fourth year, or fifth year in a secondary school&mdash;&ldquo;was never a good class&rdquo;. One even finds that in universities.  I have known university lecturers to say: &ldquo;That was always a bad class.&rdquo;  It happens that there is some malevolent influence that gets into a class and which creates a certain level of in-discipline, a wrong approach to work, perhaps a certain attitude to the teacher.</P>
    <P>Having grown up myself in a two-teacher national school in the country &mdash;and I hope I am not an altogether too unworthy product of the now somewhat maligned two-teacher schools&mdash;I could give the names of the boys, but I will not do them wrong, of whom no good could ever be got until they got a good &ldquo;skelp&rdquo; from the teacher.  That was the kind of thing that brought them to their senses.  We cannot get away from what Senator Brosnahan has said, that pain and suffering are an incident of our lives in this world, and if we offend the civil law or the criminal law, we are up against punishment.  It is a great pity that people cannot be reformed by means of psychology but teachers must carry on with the teaching of the children and there is not all this time for mental therapy, to take a particular child who is unruly and undisciplined and consider that there is a whole background of family life to be got over.  The teacher cannot neglect 95 per cent of the children to devote his time to the unruly and undisciplined one.  Perhaps if that could be done, that child could be brought to heel. However, as a practical proposition, very often corporal punishment, like a surgical operation, is the only way in which results can be achieved.  I cannot, therefore, assent to the proposition that we must abolish corporal punishment in our schools.  I do not think we can dispense with the present Rule until we have something better to replace it, something which can achieve at least the same level of discipline or, until we should hope, a higher level of discipline in our schools can be achieved by different means.</P>
    <P>I am not a psychologist, nor do I pretend to be, but I have known people of my own generation, people who are <Col N="997" /> older than I am, people who are younger, who have got a good clouting, a proper thrashing at school from time to time.  Yet I have never known anybody to have resented that except in the case where it was unjustly inflicted, where a teacher took the wrong view, took one person's evidence rather than somebody else's and punished a child in the wrong.  That punishment is always remembered, but the other punishments which were well deserved are never resented, and I do not believe they have any adverse psychological effect on the children, any more than if, when a child of nine or ten months is struggling to stand and falls on its head, on its forehead and so on, it hurts itself in the process of growing up.  Nobody will say that that has any adverse psychological effect.  The child gets hurt and the child cries; the mother picks it up and kisses it, and that is all there is to it. Pain is an incident of life and the child learns by these things.  I do not think the normal kind of slapping a child gets at school has any adverse psychological effect.  I have never known it to be pleaded even by lawyers making the best possible defence for some criminal&mdash;we say many things about bad family background, about the defendant never getting a chance, and so on&mdash;that the misfortune of such a poor unfortunate fellow was attributable to a couple of beatings at school, that that is why he embarked upon his life of crime.  Before agreeing that corporal punishment should be abolished in the schools, I would want to see it established that it has an adverse effect upon children.</P>
    <P>I would say the great gap and the great breakdown in our educational system is that parents and teachers have no, to use a modern word, dialogue in relation to children.  It is quite true to say that the vast majority of parents who ever speak to the teachers&mdash;a very limited number of parents&mdash;do so only when they have to go to the teacher to complain about the way their child has been treated. That is the only occasion upon which there is a confrontation between the parents and the teacher.</P>

      <P>I am talking only from my own experience and that is all I intend to speak about.  How often does it happen that parents write to the teacher or the teacher writes to the parents in order to have a consultation about the handling of a child?  It certainly is not the practice.  In my own experience in regard to my children going to the national school, I have approached very gingerly the question of talking to teachers about this or that aspect of the children's progress, because I felt that the very idea of going to talk to the teacher might be construed as implying criticism of the way the children were being handled. That was my reaction.  It may have been a very wrong reaction.  Of course, I should hasten to add that when I did talk to the teachers, there was no difficulty at all and that, in the joint operation of educating my children which is being done extremely well by the national teachers in the school to which they are going, we are working hand in hand.  I would hope that every parent without exception would feel that he or she could go to the teacher and say: &ldquo;The doctor says this child is not so well and I shall be putting it to bed very early for the next three months.&rdquo;  The child may be always crying about his lessons.  Is he too anxious or is he getting too much to do?</P>
      <P>Parents should be in a position to have these discussions with their teachers.  They need not be very frequent but the Minister for Education should establish as a right the duty of parents to consult at regular intervals with teachers.  Education, in my view, has two sides: what children do at school and the way they behave at home.  Very often the two sides are quite different.  Very often children who are brash and forward at home are shy and diffident with small voices at school.  I may be speaking from personal experience when I say that.  It is hard to understand but it is there, and the teacher should know the child's form at home and the parent should know the way the child acts at school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no opportunity for that kind <Col N="999" /> of consultation and the Minister for Education should see that it is established, instead of the parent-teacher association which I do not approve of because it would only provide an opportunity for speechifying at the teacher and there is always in every parish somebody who is smarter than the teacher, somebody who will put the teacher in his place&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe in that.  The rearing of children is a family matter, a private affair.  When the parent delegates the responsibility of rearing and developing the faculties of the child to the teacher, as he does when he sends the child to school, that family function and that individual attention should be continued.  If it were, great results would flow from it. I readily believe that instead of a child getting to the stage where he has to be pushed to school, the child would know that his father and mother and the teacher from time to time have chats about him, and that might have a more sobering influence on the child than threats of being &ldquo;skelped.&rdquo;  If the teacher were to say: &ldquo;Very well; I shall talk to your father about this&rdquo;, and then let the father deal with the child subsequently, it might be a very easy and practical way of getting rid of the teacher's unpleasant duty of inflicting corporal punishment in order to discipline the child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and others may say there is nothing to prevent parents approaching teachers.  That is a hopeless attitude.  What must be introduced is a formal system of regular communication between parents and teachers.  If there were formal meetings and, as prescribed, an opportunity for parents to meet teachers at the end of the Christmas term and in June when the children are being promoted, it would help to establish an interchange of ideas and experiences between teachers and parents which would be invaluable and which I believe to be indispensable for the proper rearing and development of children.  At the moment the <Col N="1000" /> parent does not know what the teacher is doing and the teacher does not know what the parent is doing and this lack of co-ordination does not make for the proper training and development of the child.</P>
    <P>The attitude has been adopted of saying there have been extensive and even serious abuses of corporal punishment or its administering and that the teachers all close their ranks and say that nothing like that has happened. The parents go to court and the insurance companies, to use a very interesting phrase of Senator Dolan, give out soft money.  That is a new one on me. However, the courts give decrees in wrong circumstances, it has been said. I do not think that gets anyone anywhere. Of course, in every thousand teachers, there will be one or two who will kick over the traces.  That is not to be wondered at.  When people become sensitive about that, they ought to recall that of the 12 hand-picked by Our Lord, one went wrong.  It is not surprising that in any profession, barristers, lawyers or what have you, one may go wrong.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is profitless to say that teachers in this country at all times in the past and in the future can be trusted never to do anything wrong in relation to the administering of corporal punishment.  What I do say is that under the present system, immediately there is a charge against a teacher of inflicting unnecessary corporal punishment, the ranks of the teachers close and Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Independents are all united in one thing&mdash;rightly so, in one sense &mdash;defending the teachers.  That is profitless.  When the Minister's inspector comes from the Department, God knows what way his inquiry will be conducted or what kind of evidence he will get.  If he is to make inquiries among small children, he will get not perjury or untruths but very often varying stories in the same way as people coming from a football match have various versions.  One says a player was offside and the other says he definitely was not.</P>
    <P>From the manner in which inquiries are conducted by the representatives of the Department of Education, one <Col N="1001" /> can be certain that the sympathy of all organised teachers and unorganised teachers will be on the side of the teacher and I do not think that is a good thing.  If I were in the Minister's position, I should make another change like that which he has made in reorganising his panel of psychologists. I would have a look at the profession and say: &ldquo;Here is a highly skilled body with very high standards who, on any view or by any standards, are producing great results.  These people are to be trusted, and in fact we do trust them, and we are entrusting the education of our children to them, whether they are in Belmullet or in the primary school attached to St. Patrick's Training College&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We do trust them, and with every reason.  Having that kind of body, they, like the doctors and solicitors, ought to be entrusted with seeing that standards are observed within their profession so that instead of having an inspector&mdash; we know how detested the inspectors of the Department of Education were so long as the high rating system was retained and we know the legacy of distrust that grew up&mdash;we should entrust inquiries into breaches of professional etiquette and discipline to the teachers themselves in the same way as we give to the Incorporated Law Society their own disciplinary committee. The standards they would ensure would be standards which would be accepted by the entire profession, not something handed down to them by the Minister for Education or any inspector making an inquiry.</P>
    <P>If a disciplinary committee of teachers, looking after and checking the standards, the integrity and the professional etiquette in their own profession were established, instead of having something that is outside them, something decided by an inspector or approved of by the Minister, we would have those standards laid down and enforced by the teachers.  I believe they would be much more readily accepted by the teachers and that that, together with a more close consultation between parents and teachers, would get rid of this business of corporal punishment and the Rule would wither for want of being used.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>The duty primarily falls upon parents to educate their children. When the State comes into the picture, it comes in simply to supplement what the parents themselves want to do, either because the parents are unable to do it or unable to do it completely. The rules for primary education set out the basis upon which the State is prepared to undertake the primary education of children.  They are, so to speak, the framework within which the State is prepared to act, to give grants for the building of schools, to recruit teachers and to pay teachers.  They set out the programme to be carried out, the school hours to be worked and so on.</P>
      <P>The motion before the House calls on the Minister, if one may paraphrase it, to have another look at the alterations made in the Rules with a view to seeing whether those Rules should not be amended further, either by going back in some cases to what they were or altering some further Rules.  At least, that is my construction of the motion which is worded:</P>
      <P>That the Seanad would welcome a reconsideration by the Minister for Education of recent changes made by him in the Rules for National Schools.</P>
      <P>It is not by any means a debate on this Rule for corporal punishment.  It is most regrettable that it has been reduced to that.  I feel this entire debate could have been far more instructive and far more constructive, if it had followed the actual terms of the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The planning of education goes hand in hand with economic planning and manpower planning.  The whole three put together are part of the warp and woof of the economic and social pattern of our society.  The children who are today beginning to go to the national school will be the young men and the young women of the last decade of this century.  The rules of education which are set out for them, will, to some extent, decide how those children will turn out in the last decade of the century because the teachers in the primary schools train the children to exercise their critical faculties.  They <Col N="1003" /> train the children to mental discipline and they train the children in certain courses of conduct.  Therefore, in considering this motion, we should really consider what we, in our view, consider will be, or think will be, the economic and social state of this country in the last decade.  We should also project our minds into what we would like the Ireland of the year 2000 or the year 1990 to be like, from the social, the economic and the manpower points of view.</P>
    <P>I regret, therefore, very much that this debate has been confined to the narrow terms in which it has been kept by the proposer of the motion.  He started off with what Senator O'Quigley described as a <i>hors d'oeuvre</i>.  The first comment he made referred to a Rule to which I do not think there could be any exception whatsoever.  It is the rule which says that children could not be segregated by reason of any social or class distinction, nor could they be refused admission to school by reason of any social or class distinction.  When dealing with that, he said either too much or he said too little.  The substance of what he said was that he had a shrewd idea that children were being excluded from school or treated differently in school by reason of financial, social or other considerations.  That is a reasonably accurate paraphrase of what he said.</P>
    <P>This is, to some extent, a repetition of what he said here in a debate some time ago when he stated that poor children were attending overcrowded schools in this city and that well-to-do children were afforded better facilities. If that were true, and if what the Senator said at the beginning of this debate were true, it should be followed up far more closely than he did.  I have gone to the trouble of investigating whether, in this city, the poorer children are herded together in overcrowded schools and the richer children get more facilities.  I find from an objective inquiry on my part&mdash;I certainly would oppose it as strongly as Senator Sheehy Skeffington if what he said were true&mdash;that the direct opposite is the case.</P>
    <P>Take the schools in the poorer districts. <Col N="1004" /> In East Wall school, approximately three or four of the rooms in the school are unoccupied.  A bus is sent to bring the children to this school, to keep the portion of it, which is occupied, reasonably occupied by the children and to keep the teachers there reasonably occupied.  In Drimnagh boys' national school, there are three rooms unoccupied and the number of boys to each class is lower than in any of the well-to-do districts in this city.  In St. Finbarr's school in Cabra, another poor district, almost half the school is unoccupied.  In Whitefriar Street school, there are a number of rooms unoccupied.  In order that something may be done about these unoccupied rooms in a number of those schools, in certain cases, the vocational committees have been invited to hold classes in them.</P>
    <P>Take, on the other hand, some of the schools in this city, where most overcrowding exists.  I find they are in the well-to-do parts of the city.  I understand, that in Fortfield, an addition is being built to the school and that a new school is also being built. There is also overcrowding in Terenure. Those are the districts where you have population explosions.</P>

    <P>On the next Rule to which he referred, he indicated a ghost.  I fail to see where the ghost was.

He quoted the second half of the Rule that is now there; he quoted the second half of the Rule that formerly existed; but he did not quote the first half of each, because if he did&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;he would have shown what he was not endeavouring to establish: a distinction without a difference. In the old Rules, in the first portion of the Rule relating to the appointment of managers, it was set out that the patrons or the school committees had the right to appoint the school managers, and then it went on in the second half to say that before the appointment was sanctioned by the Minister, the manager should first sign an undertaking to abide by the Rules. In the new Rules, the manager is defined not as someone appointed by the patrons, not as someone appointed by the committees, but as the person recognised by the Minister in the first half of the Rules.  It goes on to say that when the manager is being recognised by the Minister, he shall sign this undertaking.  There is nothing sinister in that.  One would have thought from the way the matter was referred to in the <i>hors d'oeuvre</i> that the Rules were now altered so as to allow the managers to become managers without undertaking to abide by the Rules.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for the change was so that the words would have a clear meaning because the definition of &ldquo;manager&rdquo; in both cases was completely different.  Another suggestion the Senator made is that the Rules of education should be hung up <Col N="1006" /> in the national schools so that the children could see under which Rules they are being educated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly these were hung in the national schools when I was going to school.  These are the Rules which set out how the teachers shall behave themselves and shall comport themselves among other things.  The people in authority over the teachers are the managers, the inspectors and the Department.  The children are not in authority over the teachers.  The Senator suggested that if an inspector goes to the school or if a manager goes to the school and disputes with the teacher whether the teacher is doing his work as he should do it the Rules should be available.  To hang up on the walls of each classroom as the Senator suggests, the rules which govern a man is, to my mind, like causing a man to wear a livery servant's cap.  I think it is completely degrading and I think it is completely unworthy that such a suggestion should be made regarding teachers.</P>
      <P>It was also suggested that there should be parent-teacher committees. The Minister dealt with that, and I agree with him.  I feel that if there were parent-teacher committees, some cranks would be bound to be elected and you would end with getting nothing constructive done.  I would say further that I feel no teacher is really doing his work as he should do it unless occasionally&mdash;perhaps once a year or perhaps twice a year&mdash;he meets either in the school or in their own homes the parents of the children who are in his class, so that he can understand the difficulties of those children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can visualise many cases in which children may be wrongly blamed or badly handled otherwise.  I can visualise a little girl whose conduct in school may be such that the teacher thinks she is either stupid or lazy or that she will not obey him, but she may have to work long hours at home at work which an invalid mother is not able to do.  I can picture a boy in school who is perhaps the child of a broken family, whose father is useless.  I can realise <Col N="1007" /> that such a child in school may be truculent or difficult, but if the teacher understood the difficulties and the background of that child, I can visualise that the treatment of that child in school would be different. There would be sympathy which would awaken a new chord in the child's heart.  I feel that unless the initiative comes from the teachers themselves, very little good would come from the parent-teacher meetings.  They will be skimpy and formal.  I should like to see the INTO making a recommendation to each one of their members in this regard.</P>
    <P>Now, having passed the <i>hors d'oeuvre</i> we come to what apparently was regarded as the pith of this motion: whether the Rules that at present exist relating to the prohibition of unreasonable corporal punishment of children are adequate, whether the phraseology is correct and whether the Rules are correct.  When a child leaves his or her parent's home and goes to school, the teacher takes the place of the child's parents and the teacher is <i>in loco parentis</i>.  Any treatment or ill-treatment given to children by the teacher which is such as any reasonably prudent and loving parents would not give the children is wrong and is prohibited by the law of the land.  That is the law of the land and no rule that may be made by the Minister, no statutory rule, can alter that.  A statute can alter it, but not a statutory rule.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if a teacher inflicts upon a child any corporal punishment which is excessive or improper&mdash;and what those two words mean is that the punishment is such as a reasonably kind parent would not inflict upon a child for the child's own good, for the good of the family, or for the good of the community in which the child lives &mdash;that teacher makes himself liable to severe disciplinary measures by the Department which employs him.  Now it may be suggested that these words are too vague.  What would a reasonable or prudent parent do?  Those are matters which have been decided by the court for centuries.  In fact, if the attitude of parents towards their <Col N="1008" /> children changed in ten or 20 years' time, and the ordinary responsible parent felt that no corporal punishment should be inflicted, then that Rule would provide that no corporal punishment could be inflicted.  What is reasonable and prudent in various circumstances has been acknowledged by the court from time to time even in relationships between husband and wife, between employer and employee, between neighbour and neighbour, and in practically every social relationship we have.  Therefore, it is not beyond the wit of man and not beyond the wit of the ordinary teacher to realise the extent of his responsibility.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is relevant to this motion to consider whether or not teachers do or do not obey that Rule. That is not the point at issue.  However, as so much has been said about it, I will ask the House to bear with me for just one moment in being irrelevant while I give what appears to me to be the objective test.  Over a period of, say, five years, the national teachers of this country fit in 14 million teaching days between them.  Over that same period, there have been proceedings in court, for the most part, civil proceedings, against a teacher arising out of these 14 million days, in eight cases.  Not all of these eight cases succeeded: a few did: some did not.  I agree that that perhaps is not a perfect balance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that for many reasons and in many instances a parent will not take proceedings against a teacher.  On the other hand, I take a contrast with which I put it in balance, the number of cases over those five years where there have been criminal proceedings against Irish parents for neglect of their children, and for cruelty to their own children, and I find that the number of cases of proceedings, not civil proceedings, against the parents have exceeded many times the number of proceedings against teachers.  I do not think anyone can suggest that we Irish people are unduly unreasonable as a nation, or unkind to our children.</P>

      <P>Therefore, it does seem that in those circumstances and to balance those two figures, while neither is a perfect barometer, it does seem to me that objectively it cannot be suggested that there is any undue hardship or unkindness on the part of teachers.  Now, if I may in dealing with this portion of the Rules, say it, Senator Sheehy Skeffington introduced a large number of extracts from letters and a large number of articles written in various journals, in support of his arguments, and I think he will be fair enough to agree with me that if I took the same time and the same trouble to get letters and newspaper articles to the contrary, I could have done so, so I do not think that it does prove anything one way or the other. I do say and I say it with very great regret, that there was one case he referred to, a case with the details of which I am personally and thoroughly conversant.  I regret having to refer to it in this House: I do so only because he mentioned two people by name, Canon Troy, parish priest of Ballyfermot, and Mr. Keegan, the principal teacher of that school.</P>
      <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington stated that if what the Minister said in reply to a question in the Dáil were true, then what Canon Troy swore in court in evidence was untrue and what Mr. Keegan swore in evidence was untrue. I am prepared to assume that Senator Sheehy Skeffington, when he made that statement, made it in good faith.  I shall give him the facts and having given him the facts, I shall ask him to accept my word that I accept responsibility for the accuracy of those facts and I shall ask him to be good enough to withdraw that charge.  I feel confident that he will have the courage to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The facts of that case are that on 2nd October, 1964, a little boy was beaten in school by Mr. Keegan, the principal teacher of Ballyfermot school.  A day or two later there were banner headings about this matter in one of the evening papers.  Presumably these banner headlines were seen in the Department of Education because on 6th October, 1964, a divisional inspector of education turned up in the school and held an inquiry.  At that time, what <Col N="1010" /> happened, what was said, what was done, was fresh in people's minds after the expiration of only four days.  In the evening, having got together all the evidence he could, having satisfied himself to the best of his ability that he had all the facts accurately, the divisional inspector audibly remarked that he could not see that there was anything else the teacher could have done if discipline were to be maintained in the school.</P>

      <P>On 5th May, 1965, there were proceedings in the Circuit Court <Col N="1011" /> brought by the parents of the child for damages against the teacher.  It was heard by a judge and jury.  The teacher gave evidence and he was examined and cross examined.  The answers he gave were to questions put to him.  In the course of his cross examination, he was pressed that the punishment he gave the child was unreasonable.  He said it was not.  He said in reply to a question that the punishment he gave the child was no greater than he would have given to his own child.  He was questioned as to whether there was any investigation.  He stated there was. He was questioned as to whether the inspector agreed that what he did was unavoidable.  He stated the inspector had said so and that he had heard him say so.  That teacher said what was the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.  Canon Troy did not give evidence in the Circuit Court.</P>
      <P>In the Circuit Court the case was dismissed. The parents of the child appealed and the appeal came for hearing before the High Court on 6th October, 1965&mdash;12 months to the day from the date when the inspector had been in the school.  Canon Troy gave his evidence in answer to questions put to him in examination and in cross examination.  His evidence was that he was manager of the school; that the defendant was the principal teacher of the school; that he was aware a complaint had been made against the teacher to the Department; that an inspector had called to the school and had investigated; that the teacher was responsible not to inflict on any child punishment excessive or improper; that, if the teacher were found to have broken that, he could be punished in various ways&mdash;by financial loss in salary, by being dismissed if it were a very, very grave matter and at the very least by a reprimand&mdash;that as manager of the school he would expect if any of those punishments had been inflicted on the teacher he would have been notified and that he received no such notification.  That was his evidence.  That, again, is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with what the Senator said and the charges he made in this House.  Here is what Senator Sheehy Skeffington said, and I quote from the Seanad Debates, column 549 of volume 60:</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware that he was asked in the Dáil recently by Deputy Ryan whether an inquiry had in fact been held and with what result. The Minister's answer was that an inquiry had been started but had never been finished because there was a law case on, and would not be finished now, and, consequently, there was no foundation for the statement that the teacher had been exonerated by the inspector.</P>
      <P>As I have said, the teacher's evidence in court was he was asked a question if the inspector considered the punishment he inflicted on the child as excessive and he stated that the inspector did not consider it so because he had heard the inspector say so.  Having given those facts I want, through you, a Leas-Chathaoirleach, to ask Senator Sheehy Skeffington if he will be good enough to withdraw the charges he made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>As I came in here this afternoon I saw our national flag fluttering over Leinster House&mdash;the symbol of the liberties of our people.  May I say if this House, which should be the protector of the citizens of this State, <Col N="1014" /> is to be used as a forum for attacking the characters of our citizens who are unable to defend themselves, who cannot defend themselves, who can take no steps for redress because of the privileges of this House, then what should be the symbol of our liberty is merely an example of licence.  I regret to have to speak so strongly. I feel that no one should take cover within this House to attack the characters of citizens, in particular without being absolutely certain of the facts; and, if they are so certain, they should be prepared to go outside the confines of this House and repeat what they stated, so that they can get the opportunity of proving it if it is true and paying for it if it is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Senator give the terms of what he calls my accusation?  That is something he has not done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall.  The Senator stated:</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware that he was asked in the Dáil recently by Deputy Ryan whether an inquiry had in fact been held and with what result. The Minister's answer was that an inquiry had been started but had never been finished because there was a law case on, and would not be finished now, and, consequently, there was no foundation for the statement that the teacher had been exonerated by the inspector.  This meant, in fact, that the judge in the appeal court, Judge Teevan, had sworn to him by Canon Troy and by Mr. Keegan, the teacher, something that was not factually sound, if what the Minister told the Dáil was factually sound.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, when Senator Brosnahan was speaking, he remarked that the judge had stated that the little boy in this case had perjured himself and Senator Sheehy Skeffington interrupted him and said that he was not the only person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnahan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one inaccuracy and that is the word <Col N="1015" />&ldquo;perjurer&rdquo;.  The High Court judge, referring to the boy in his summing up, used words something like this &ldquo;We know he is a little liar&rdquo;.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington interrupted me and said that he is not the only liar.  It means the same thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>I have yet to distinguish between a lie on oath and the term &ldquo;perjury&rdquo;.  I regret very much that this debate has taken these lines.  As I stated originally, I feel it should have been both instructive and constructive. We could have examined, with advantage, very many of these Rules and many suggestions could have been made which would certainly be the subject matter of thought for our Minister.  Having regard to the terms in which the motion was proposed, I presume I should now be out of order if I were to make such suggestions. Therefore, I feel there is no course open to me but to confine myself to the motion as dealt with by the proposer. I sincerely hope that the Minister, having regard to the form of the reasons given and having regard to the manner in which they were given, will not accede to the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened carefully to most of this debate and I intervene with some hesitation because I am opposed to any form of corporal punishment as being useless and degrading.</P>
      <P>I have a good deal of experience in dealing with children and young people and I, too, come from a teaching family.  I cannot see how there can be any respect or confidence between pupil and teacher once there has been a physical punishment session between them.  If punishment must be levied, then it should be done by way of withdrawal of favours or privileges.  Where this is the pattern, pupils will realise the fact that they are in temporary disgrace but the teacher-pupil relationship will not be harmed as it must be, following the imposition of corporal punishment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in full sympathy with the overworked teacher in an overcrowded school.  He has a mixed bag of pupils with different temperaments and perhaps <Col N="1016" /> he has a lot of the tough swaggering brand.  I do not envy that teacher his job but I am of the opinion that, when a teacher reaches for the cane, he demonstrates that he has lost control and in the eyes of the watchful children he has also lost some of his dignity.  The difficult section of his class&mdash;the tough element&mdash;are very quick to sum up the situation and the offender will pass the word around to the others to watch developments.  How often have we heard the boast about the teacher who &ldquo;got mad because I showed him I did not care how hard he hit?&rdquo;  That situation is not calculated to help the teacher in his work nor to keep discipline among pupils.  Most teachers can deflate the tough youngster with a few words calculated to leave him &ldquo;cut down to size&rdquo; in the eyes of the class.  I cannot see what harm could arise from this when we remember we are discussing the occasional difficult pupil, not the normal school child.</P>
    <P>I again stress my opinion that the withdrawal of privileges is a most effective method of dealing with children and young people who need correction.  In saying this I am aware that many of our national schools are not of the high standard of those built in recent years.  We still have old, insanitary schools impossible to keep clean and warm.  In schools of this type there are few, if any, privileges to withdraw but it should not, even there, be beyond the capacity of teachers to think up ways and means of showing disapproval and applying punishment other than corporal punishment where it is deemed necessary.</P>
    <P>Another reason why I oppose corporal punishment is that it is impossible to apply it with equal justice.  Several children might be adjudged to suffer a stroke on the open hand.  Apart from the mental effect on different children, is there any comparison between the amount of pain suffered by that stroke on the well-padded palm of the warmly clad, well-fed child and the thin, chapped or chilblained hand of the ragged, cold and perhaps hungry child who might have been rain-soaked on the way to school and who will most likely return to a home where there <Col N="1017" /> are few comforts or remedies for his aches?</P>
    <P>Something else requires to be considered in regard to corporal punishment. How can anyone measure the strength of a stroke of a cane as between one person inflicting the punishment and another such person? What one teacher might consider to be a reasonable stroke another might consider to be excessive.  We should abolish this form of punishment altogether. Consider the care with which we handle a delicate precision instrument.  The human hand is a most complex and wonderful precision instrument which must be used in all callings and all professions, yet we think we are being very reasonable in permitting this irreplaceable instrument to be exposed to injury by being whacked by a cane &mdash;light or otherwise.  I am not convinced, as some Senator has claimed, that there is no risk of damage being done.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, let me say that any teachers I know are genial souls but, unfortunately, there are others outside that category and we should not take risks in a matter of this kind.</P>
    <P>I think there can be no doubt that the new Regulations are a step backwards and expose the pupils to greater risks by leaving the interpretation of &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; wide open to abuse by teachers who might not be so genial as we would like them to be.  I sympathise with the difficulties which the teachers have to face in maintaining discipline but I think they and the Department should have the ability to work out a scheme which will do away with the need for corporal punishment. The most important step in this work &mdash;I would almost call it cultural work &mdash;would be the provision of schools with so many and so great privileges that the pupils would take great care not to cut themselves off from their enjoyment.</P>
