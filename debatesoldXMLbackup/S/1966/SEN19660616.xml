    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 31 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to draw the attention of the House to subparagraph (b) of subsection (1) which provides that:</P>
      <P>Regulations may provide for disqualifying a person for receiving injury benefit or disablement benefit for any period not exceeding six weeks, or for suspending proceedings on any claim for, or on any payment of, injury benefit or disablement benefit, if the person fails without good cause&mdash;</P>
      <P>(b)  to submit himself from time to time to appropriate medical treatment for the relevant injury or loss of faculty.</P>
      <P>Then we are told in section 33 that:</P>
      <P>... &ldquo;medical treatment&rdquo; means medical, surgical or rehabilitative treatment (including any course of diet or other regimen), and references in this Act to a person receiving or submitting himself to medical treatment shall be construed accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the Minister is seeking in subparagraph (b) of subsection (1) of section 31 is power to make regulations to provide that if a man does not want to submit himself to a surgical operation he will starve him out for six weeks and compel him to submit.  That is the power the Minister is seeking and there <Col N="972" /> is no equivalent power contained in the workmen's compensation code which we are now abolishing.  The Minister will, of course, say that the power to starve a man out, to starve his wife and his children, if he is obliged to undergo an operation, will never be exercised when the workman has good cause for refusing an operation.  We have all seen the workman in the courts whose doctor has advised him to have an operation, the doctor of his employer has advised him to have an operation but the workman says: &ldquo;No, I will not have an operation, I prefer to put up with my disability, I prefer to stay as I am.&rdquo; If you talk to the workman he says: &ldquo;I am afraid of an operation, I would not like an operation.&rdquo; The operation may be for, say, treatment of a slipped disc, a common enough injury from which workmen suffer.</P>
    <P>If a workman comes and says he has a certain premonition about the outcome of the operation or that for other reasons he refuses to undergo the operation, the Minister says that he will starve him out for six weeks and &ldquo;We will make you undergo the operation or else you can look at your wife and children not getting benefit for up to six weeks.&rdquo; That is what we are substituting for the existing workmen's compensation code which, as I say, was not the most perfect code but we ought to understand what we are putting in place of it.</P>
    <P>There was power under the old code to take into account a man's reasonable fears to undergo an operation or to take medical treatment.  Sometimes people will be downright unreasonable because they do not want to submit themselves to an operation.  We all know of people who do not want to go to a dentist, a doctor or a hospital. The last thing they want to do is to go under an operation where they give themselves over body and soul to a surgeon.  If a man is allergic to surgical operations the Minister says: &ldquo;It does not matter; my Deciding Officer will starve you for six weeks and will make you undergo the operation. At the end of six weeks if you have not undergone the operation and you are still alive we will pay you compensation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="973" /> The Minister will say that you cannot operate this kind of code under the Social Welfare Acts.  He will say: &ldquo;We cannot operate in this impersonal way to the complete satisfaction of the contributors.  We could not work in this impersonal way if we did not have this kind of power.&rdquo;  This is all reminiscent of the attitude of employers in Dublin in 1913 who, in order to make the employees suffer, did what they considered was good for them.  They decided to starve them out.  I cannot think the Minister will persist in this power in the anniversary of 1916 when we have heard so much about the work of James Connolly and James Larkin.</P>

      <P>We have been hearing about the Irish Ireland James Connolly died for so that people would not be starved out.  I am sure that in modern times he would equally not say, if a man for any cause, because he is entitled to assert his freedom, refuses to undergo the operation: &ldquo;We will starve you out&rdquo; or &ldquo;We will starve your wife and children, paying you nothing for six weeks if you do not undergo an operation.&rdquo; I do not think that is the Irish Ireland we are told we must fight for and for which the men of 1916 and particularly James Connolly fought.</P>
      <P>It is well to have a look where we have come from and what the position was in the past.  We have a Constitution and I hear great talk about the tremendous advantage it was to this country to introduce the Constitution of 1937.  I constantly refer to the Constitution in this House and I constantly refer to the obligation on Seanad Éireann to observe the provisions of the Constitution and that the Oireachtas shall not enact any legislation which is repugnant to the Constitution or any of the provisions thereof.  That is a very specific protection given to the people of Ireland by their legislators.  They may enact legislation that shall have proper regard to the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a Health Act in 1947 which caused considerable controversy in this country and Senator Dr. <Col N="974" /> Ryan, who was then Minister for Health, bethought himself and took counsel with his legal advisers.  As a consequence he introduced the Health Act of 1953 which is now in decline and which the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Malley, hopes to replace. He brought in this Act to amend the 1947 Act which was being challenged on constitutional grounds.  In order to meet the constitutional objection section 4 of the Health Act, 1953, was enacted to preserve to the citizens of this country&mdash;and all injured workmen I number among the citizens of this country&mdash;the right to refuse to submit themselves compulsorily to medical treatment of any kind.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Act provides that &ldquo;nothing in this Act or any instrument thereunder shall be construed as imposing an obligation on any person to avail himself of any service provided under this Act or to submit himself or any person for whom he is responsible to health examination or treatment&rdquo;. That is not the spirit of paragraph 3 of subsection (1) of section 31 of the Bill before us, because this requires a workman to submit himself from time to time to appropriate medical treatment for the relevant injury or loss of faculty, and that includes medical, surgical and rehabilitation treatment.  This is oddly at variance with the provisions of section 4 of the 1953 Act.  We are now going to compel a man against his will to submit himself to treatment which he may not like, which he may fear, but which his medical advisers or those of the Department of Social Welfare say is good for him.  I think that we have reached the ultimate that it is possible to reach in police State type of legislation, and I very much doubt if the Minister can find any other precedent for this in the legislation of this country.  The House must reject paragraph (b) and I hope that the Minister will indicate that he is prepared to accept an amendment on the Report Stage to delete this extraordinary power over the injured workman.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. K. Boland) Kevin Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. K. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that this is a power which it is obviously necessary to have.  The whole thing is, of course, governed by the clause <Col N="975" />&ldquo;if the person fails without good cause&rdquo;.  The extreme type of case to which Senator O'Quigley has been referring will not, of course, arise. In fact, provision is already made in section 17 of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, on similar lines.  This says that &ldquo;regulations may provide for disqualifying a person for receiving disability benefit for such period not exceeding six weeks as may be determined under the provisions of this Act&rdquo; if he fails to submit himself to such medical treatment as may be required in accordance with the regulations. Regulations for this purpose have not, in fact, been made.  It is considered, nevertheless, that as failure to submit to medical treatment may retard recovery in some cases and so unnecessarily prolong payment of benefit, power to make such regulations in relation to injury and disablement benefit should be provided. This is practically the same as the position of a person in regard to workmen's compensation, where the arrangement is that the court has to decide whether the workman's refusal to submit himself to medical treatment is unreasonable.  The phrase &ldquo;without good cause&rdquo; is the same thing. It may not, in fact, be found to be necessary to make these regulations at all, and they have not been made under the Social Welfare Act in respect of disability benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that there is all the difference in the world between some judicial person with experience and knowledge and a Deciding Officer who has only before him a file of papers to decide these matters?  In the case of the courts I have known of many persons who have been urged by doctors to undergo operation but the man says &ldquo;I will not&rdquo; because he would prefer to live with the disability, and workmen's compensation was not stopped in these cases, because the judges having seen the man and got some idea of his background, his mental makeup and his general approach to life, have decided that although it would be objectively quite unreasonable to refuse to undergo <Col N="976" /> treatment, medical or surgical, subjectively it would be reasonable.  In this particular section construed as it is drafted &ldquo;good cause&rdquo; may be objectively good cause, but not good cause from the point of view of the workman.  The Minister says that this particular power would not have to be used except in extreme cases, but of course it is only in extreme cases that a man will say &ldquo;I do not agree with the doctors, I will not undergo a surgical operation&rdquo;.  It might be a person who was supposed to get shock treatment for some psychiatric disorder who will say &ldquo;I will not undergo that, you cannot persuade me&rdquo; even though that would be the thing to cure him. The Minister says: &ldquo;Well, it depends on whether he has good cause or not&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am somewhat shocked to hear that this provision is contained in section 17 of the Social Welfare Act, 1952.  I do not know whether medical or other examination or treatment includes surgical treatment under the 1952 Act. Perhaps the Minister would tell me if that is so.  Looking at it quickly from the definition section I do not find that medical treatment under the Social Welfare Act includes surgical treatment. Medical treatment merely means giving a person pills, putting him on a diet, telling him to abstain from this and to do that.  That is different from putting him on a table, knocking him out, opening him up and dealing with him.  It is quite reasonable to say if a person claims medical benefit or disability benefit on the ground that he is sick that the Department of Social Welfare paying him benefit should be entitled to say: &ldquo;Wait a minute, we do not think you are sick any longer.  We want you to undergo a medical examination.&rdquo; That is perfectly reasonable. People do that every day, and that provision is contained in the old workmen's compensation code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite a different story to say to a man: &ldquo;We believe that this pain in the back that you have is due to a slipped disc and an operation will fix it up.  You attend at the county hospital, Castlebar, on such and such a date for surgical operation, and if you do not we will withdraw your compensation for six weeks.&rdquo;  I think this <Col N="977" /> power is quite different from the power contained in section 17 of the Social Welfare Act, unless the Minister can assure me to the contrary.  Even if it is, I do not think that in this day and age, now that we have been alerted to it, we should agree that a man should hand himself over body and soul, against his will, or hand over a young person under the age of 21 years against his will and against the young person's will, to a surgeon to be operated upon.</P>
    <P>If the Minister says that power is necessary in order to implement this Bill, that merely goes to show how unsuitable it is to have legislation of this kind administered in the impersonal way so beloved of the people who wrote the Minority Report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the point made by Senator O'Quigley.  We are told that under the natural law a person is entitled to bodily integrity. Surely the person's medical adviser should decide whether an operation is necessary.  If this power is availed of in an impersonal way, someone will decide that a particular person has to undergo an operation.  Is that person competent to decide what form the operation should take?  We know that in these matters there can be differing points of view.  In recent months we have seen the conversion of many people in prominent places to the principle of free choice of doctor.  They appeared to have been moving forward in that regard, but in this measure we have a complete reversal of it.  Surely it can be alleged that if we now accept the principle in this Bill we may later be required by the Minister for Health to accept it in relation to disablement benefit or other State assistance.  This is an obnoxious inclusion and the Minister should look at it again.</P>

      <P>As I have said, under the existing power in relation to disability benefit, regulations for this purpose have not been made.  They may not be made in this case either, but if they are there will certainly be no intention of compelling a person to submit himself to a major surgical operation if he does not feel inclined <Col N="978" /> to take that risk.  This will be operated in a reasonable way, and the position will not, in fact, be any different from the position at present under the workmen's compensation code.</P>

      <P>If the Minister says there is no intention of requiring a person to undergo a surgical operation against his will, he does not require this power in the Bill.  It is most undesirable that he should be given a power which he says he does not want, and which goes far beyond what is proper or reasonable.  I suggest that the matter should be looked at between now and Report Stage with a view to eliminating the word &ldquo;surgical&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section which defines what medical treatment is going to be.  Under the Social Welfare Act, 1952, a man is obliged to submit himself for some medical treatment, but in this case we are going further and including surgical treatment.  I do not care what the Minister has to say about major operations.  I do not believe it is correct for the Legislature of this country to give any civil servant the right to say that if a man does not undergo a surgical operation he shall be starved for one week, two weeks, or three weeks.  Whether the man has good cause or is being unreasonable, I do not think it is proper that we should vest this power in the Minister to make this regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear a lot of talk about the Constitution of 1937&mdash;which I believe is not a bad document&mdash;but I wonder do the Government and Government Ministers ever pay any attention to it. There was a case in the courts in recent times which clearly laid down that the right to deprive a man of his livelihood <Col N="979" /> should be vested only in the courts of law, that the only body in the State in which that extraordinary power should reside is the courts.  That was a case of striking a solicitor from the rolls.  In this Bill we are taking it out of the power of employers and employees to make any private arrangement for the payment of disability benefit.  We are now obliging the employers to make contributions in respect of workmen's compensation. Therefore, it is quite clear that they will not make any private arrangements.</P>
    <P>Having done that, we are leaving it to anonymous civil servants to deal with these matters&mdash;and I insist on repeating this phrase because it is very relevant every time this kind of situation comes up&mdash;in an impersonal way. We are giving these faceless civil servants power to decide that a man shall undergo an operation.  I do not care whether it is dislodging an ingrown toe nail or repairing a slipped disc. I do not care what the operation is. Once you raise a knife to a man who is knocked out on the operating table, you are certainly depriving him of his liberty.  I do not think it is right or proper that we should give power of life and death to civil servants in legislation of this kind.</P>
    <P>The business of striking a solicitor off the rolls is not nearly as important as telling a man he must submit himself to a surgical operation.  The courts have found that that power should not be exercised by the committee of the Incorporated Law Society, and that ultimately that kind of power can be constitutionally vested only in the courts.  Here we are giving a much more drastic power&mdash;power to decide whether a man shall have food and drink for himself and his children for a period of six weeks&mdash;to a civil servant. Do any Senators on the Government side think that is in accordance with the provisions of our Constitution, with our notion of liberty, or with the Irish Ireland for which the men of 1916 and James Connolly fought?  I should like to hear them defend it and say how it is in accordance with those concepts.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Quigley talks as if the man was going to be instructed to undergo a major operation.  Let us take the case of a man who has a ten per cent disability.  He has a broken finger.  If that finger is set surgically he ceases to be disabled.  Is it suggested that he should be able to say: &ldquo;I am doing all right.  I have got my ten per cent.  This is not doing me any great harm.  I will carry on with the finger unset&rdquo;?  Is the Senator suggesting that there should not be any power to insist that a man should undergo a simple operation of that kind?</P>
      <P>Senator O'Quigley seems to suggest that people have a right given them by God or the Constitution, or both, not to take any care of themselves.  He wants to create an even worse police State atmosphere when he mentions the unfortunate 18 year old, the minor, and asks: &ldquo;Is the Minister going to insist that not merely should the minor undergo the operation but that his parents should agree to it?&rdquo; Any parent who does not allow his child to undergo an operation is guilty of a criminal offence.  People should look after their health and parents should look after the health of their children.</P>
      <P>I cannot conceive why disability benefits under the Bill should be paid to a man who refuses to undergo a simple operation such as the setting of a finger.  The Minister said that under the existing law almost exactly the same provisions exist and the courts can do what has been set out under the Bill.  Senator O'Quigley may say that in practice this is not done but the power is there.  Of course, this talk about James Connolly is just so much nonsense.  Senator O'Quigley, as he has so often done on this Bill, and as he has so often done on other Bills, makes an incalculable amount of criticism and talks about what is in the original Bill. Some of this is quite nonsense.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to chase all those hares Senator O'Quigley has been raising such as the fact that the efforts of the Oireachtas to protect the community against defaulting solicitors were frustrated.  Any reasonable person will see that this is a reasonable provision which it is necessary to have in the interests of the workmen themselves in order to ensure that the funds will not be wrongfully disposed of.  As I said, it may not be necessary to make those regulations at all but if it became necessary and it was obvious that wrongful practices were being availed of in order to obtain benefits, this is a power which it is obviously desirable to have.</P>
      <P>I would point out that there is a provision in the Convention concerning benefits in the case of employment injuries adopted by the International Labour Office.  Article 22 provides for such a power which we are seeking here in this subsection.  It appears to me that the more this goes on the object of Senator O'Quigley is to try to make this scheme unworkable, to try to make it a flop.  This is, in fact, a desirable thing to have and it may prove unnecessary to make those regulations. We must have power to ensure that people will not refuse reasonable medical treatment without good reason.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister just answer one question? What is wrong with changing the wording of the Social Welfare Act: &ldquo;to submit himself to such medical or other examination or treatment as may be required&rdquo; to &ldquo;medical, surgical or rehabilitative treatment&rdquo;?  The Social Welfare Act says &ldquo;treatment as may be required&rdquo;.  The Minister has deliberately chosen to change the wording of the Social Welfare Act within the framework of which this present Bill is drafted.  The Minister must have some strong reason for making this change when he says he wants to fit this Bill within the framework of existing legislation. I shall be glad of an explanation for this change.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a kind of Alice in Wonderland dialogue.  I certainly welcome all these interruptions in order to get some clarity into the debate, if the Chair will allow that.  The point I want to get clear is that medical treatment means medical treatment.  In every hospital there are medical doctors and there are people who are medical <Col N="983" /> consultants.  There are others who are surgical doctors and also surgical consultants. Medical treatment and surgical treatment are two quite different things to a layman like myself.  I have no doubt about that.</P>
      <P>The Minister agrees with me in regard to the interpretation of medical treatment in section 31 but then in this section he defines medical treatment as meaning &ldquo;medical, surgical or rehabilitative treatment.&rdquo; Those are three different things.  It is quite clear that nobody is obliged to submit himself for surgical treatment under paragraph (b) subsection (1), section 17 of the Social Welfare Act, 1952.  There is no doubt in the world about that.  Nobody wants to waste time on that so I shall not waste any further time on it.  The Minister says his main job is to make this Act a reasonable one.  My object is to make this Bill a better Bill when it is enacted into law.  Senator Yeats had strong strictures to make on me in this and in other debates.  There have been debates in this House in which other Senators and I have taken different views from those of Ministers. Some Ministers have had the quick-wittedness and graciousness to see that what was suggested was better.  We have had the happy experience in this House of making many amendments to quite a number of statutes.  I do not think it is right or proper to say that because we point out these deficiencies our purpose is to obstruct the enactment of this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's case for this definition is: &ldquo;Ah, the regulations will not have to be used.&rdquo; On the other hand, he is illogical enough to say that if this section and section 31 were deleted the whole thing would become unworkable.  How can the inclusion of what he says is the exceptional case make the whole scheme workable? What I am concerned with is to ensure that people in the position of injured workmen who may not be very well up but who, like us, resent being pushed about, will not be obliged against their will, which they are entitled as human beings to express, to submit themselves to surgical operations. That is good commonsense, a <Col N="984" /> good democratic principle on which to insist.  If people across the House say: &ldquo;We do not want that; we insist that workmen submit themselves to surgical operation against their will&mdash;it is good enough for them&rdquo;, that is the kind of authoritarian concept that bred Nazi Germany and Communist Russia. It is the State, the faceless civil servant, who is to decide what is good for the workman.  I do not think the ultimate decision should rest with the Civil Service on the penalty that if the workman does not accept that he can be starved for six weeks.  That is a barbaric piece of legislation and I shall never consent to its being enacted.</P>

      <P>I can think of a very good reason why the term &ldquo;surgical treatment&rdquo; should be included. I have practical knowledge of a case where a workman had his hand injured and from that injury a cyst or lump came on his wrist.  In such a case, is the State to be obliged to continue to pay out compensation or should the workman be obliged to submit himself to a minor surgical operation?  These are common cases and to meet them there is need to insert this term.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 61:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), line 29, before &ldquo;shall&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and every other person who wishes to become a voluntary contributor&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment seeks to give people the power to become voluntary contributors. This seems to me to be a very desirable principle.  It has been urged on me by an expert on social welfare but it commends itself to me in any event, particularly in an agricultural country with a large number of small farmers engaged in a hazardous occupation nowadays because of the use of chemicals and machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We ought to give the small farmers the right to opt into the scheme and, by paying contributions, cover themselves against risk at the contribution rate laid down.  This is a bare minimum <Col N="985" /> and I had two views on it. Firstly, I wondered whether we should not make provision for the inclusion of small farmers and even, if necessary, to require that the contributions be paid for them.  However, I decided that one should move in stages in this matter.  The first thing would be to allow them to join and see how many took advantage of it.  Later, we could include them compulsorily.</P>
    <P>In this country we are increasingly treating the farming community on a par with other workers as regards remuneration, as we know literally to our cost at this moment.  Therefore, as a minimum they should be given the right to opt into the scheme.  Otherwise the small farmer is faced with the problem of insuring himself.  The Minister has made a case for the spreading of risk and the only reason he has given for risk rate is the desirability of spreading the risk to agricultural workers.  If the Minister believes in the spreading of risk, which I am convinced is a sound principle where the employer is concerned, then he ought to agree that the small farmers should be given the opportunity of getting into this scheme on a par with the agricultural labourers.</P>
    <P>It does not seem right that the agricultural labourers should be in the scheme but that the small farmers should be forced, if they want to cover themselves, to pay high premiums.  I am not sure whether the small farmer can insure himself voluntarily or what kind of a premium he would be charged in view of the possibility that the insurance companies might hold that he has some control over his own destiny in the matter.  In any event, we should give the small farmers this right.  At least it would give us an indication of what kind of demand there is for this.  I suspect that in the first instance the number of voluntary contributors among self-employed people will not be great but they should, nevertheless, be given the opportunity so that we can test the market, if you like, among the farming community.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will agree to this.  The small farmer would have to pay his own contribution, of course, <Col N="986" /> and it would be necessary, if the benefits were to be related to wages, which I have proposed but which the Minister has not yet accepted, that the small farmer should state what earnings he wanted to insure himself against and then pay the appropriate contribution rate.  If the Minister is not in agreement with wage-related benefits, then the contributions applicable to employers could be applied to the small farmers.</P>
    <P>It may be this would cost the scheme a little extra because the relatively small number involved may have an above average risk but as the Minister is very keen to spread risks in relation to agricultural workers, he can have no objection to the small additional burden this amendment would represent.  We should take this additional step to cover small farmers who have all the disadvantages of being entrepreneurs but none of the advantages enjoyed by self-employed people in other fields.  At least we should introduce this principle and see how it might develop.</P>

      <P>I agree there is value in bringing in voluntary contributions. I feel it should be confined to persons going out of insurance when they reach salary limits.

I think that would overload the scheme against the workman.</P>

      <P>It is amusing how we can change the wording of an amendment here.  The wording of Senator Garret FitzGerald's amendment is:</P>
      <P>...every other person who wishes to become a voluntary contributor</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald's recommendation confines it completely to small farmers. What does the adjective mean?  Does it mean that the farmer is small?  Why not use the words: &ldquo;Owner of a small farm&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;small farmer&rdquo; because there has been misunderstanding over such an expression already?  Senator FitzGerald changes <Col N="987" /> the whole text of his amendment to confine it to the small farmer with emphasis on the word &ldquo;small&rdquo; whatever it means, forgetting the fact that the text of his amendment deals with the voluntary contributor, or a person becoming a voluntary contributor. Then we have the Labour point of view where the other Senator wishes that it should not embrace the owner of a small farm at all; that it should deal only with a person whose remuneration has increased from the compulsory insurance limit to the salaried person.  We are getting terribly confused in our arguments here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that my colloquial reference to small farmers should have disturbed a big Senator but, nevertheless, the case I was making was one which was mainly based on the small farmer because I think the case is strongest there for two reasons.  The risk element is high in farming and the owner of a small farm is in the position where, if he is injured, and his livelihood is affected, it might mean much more to his family than somebody with a large farm who may have others employed on it, even though the owner is knocked out.  I have expressed the amendment widely because, having thought about this particular case, it seemed to me that there was no particular point in trying to confine it because, if you open it up in this way, you are opening it up to self-employed people in other areas and the great bulk of self-employed people are not engaged in risky occupations and would not think it worth while insuring themselves.  It seemed to me that widening it would not add any significant number of people to the scheme and, as there was no particular point in narrowing it down, I left it as wide open as possible.  I would have no difficulty at all in modifying the amendment, if any case is made for that.</P>

      <P>There is much to be said in favour of Senator FitzGerald's suggestion but I would be inclined to widen it a little more.  I do not know enough about the economics of the matter to decide whether it is practicable <Col N="988" /> but I can picture many cases&mdash; the local blacksmith, a local carpenter, <i>et cetera</i>, working at home, or somebody who calls himself a small contractor not paid by the day but paid by the job; he takes on a little job for £50 or £100.  I can see a good deal in favour of having such people insured in a scheme like this.  Whether or not it is practicable under this scheme, I do not know.  I can visualise also the man who cuts turf for sale.  I can see a number of drawbacks in it.  The man who is in the more risky occupation will insure himself. The local tailor who is taking no risk, of course, will not want to insure himself.  That is the difficulty I see in it but, up to a certain income scale, I can see many advantages in it.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister or his officials could in any way include in this scheme, so as to make it economic, a method of covering all such people up to an income scale of, say, £15 a week or thereabouts.  It would be a wonderful thing if it could be done.  I can see the difficulties in doing it but, from a social service point of view, there are very many advantages.</P>

      <P>I should like to support this and recommend it very strongly to the Minister.  As far as the small farmers are concerned, how one defines a small farmer is, at times, very difficult.  The number involved would be very, very few indeed because there are so many farmers living on uneconomic holdings employed by county councils or contractors of one sort or another who would be covered by insurance to a certain degree.  But where a man is fully occupied on his own small holding and has no help whatsoever, if he meets with an accident, it will cause very great hardship to himself and his family.  I would very strongly recommend that they be included in the scheme.</P>

        <i>(Longford):</i> My view is that it would be socially desirable to try to include farmers living on uneconomic holdings and possibly, as Senator Nash suggested, other self-employed people in our community.  I am conscious of the fact that the whole pressure in our society is in favour of <Col N="989" /> organised workers.  It is one of the good, or possibly not so good, effects of trade unionism.  We seem to forget about the unorganised or self-employed. It would be socially desirable that we move in that direction, as suggested in Senator FitgGerald's amendment, but I am not too sure that it is practicable, because it is much more complex.  I should like to hear from the Minister how far it would be practicable because to attempt to do something, no matter how socially desirable it may be, unless it is politically possible and this is politics in its best sense&mdash;&mdash;</P>

When I speak of the small farmer I do not want to score a point on Senator Garret FitzGerald.

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of making the social insurance scheme in so far as possible available to self-employed people but there are obviously a great many difficulties involved. In fact, I think it would be practically impossible to make some of the existing social insurance schemes available to them all.  Disability benefit and unemployment benefit are two cases in point.  The idea behind the payment of disability benefit to insured people is to compensate them for loss of income as a result of sickness but in the case of people who are proprietors of small businesses, whether they be small farms or otherwise, there is not normally a complete cessation of income as a result of the normal type of illness.  It would obviously be a difficult thing to extend such disability benefits to them and it is doubtful if unemployment benefit would be practicable at all.  I must say, for a start at any rate, that the only schemes which I would consider to be feasible to extend on a voluntary basis to people other than employees are the pensions schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This question then of admitting the self-employed people, as voluntary <Col N="991" /> contributors, to the social insurance is a very difficult one to decide.  As Senator Nash pointed out, the whole social insurance scheme is only feasible because the risk is spread.  It is only feasible to pay unemployment benefit at the rate it is paid to those people who become unemployed because contributions are also paid in respect of people with comparatively small risk of unemployment.</P>
    <P>In a case such as this it is, of course, likely that the only people who would opt to become voluntary contributors are those who are in the more risky occupations.  If that were to occur on any kind of large scale it could upset the whole scheme.  Obviously the same difficulty would apply to unemployability supplement or injury benefit under this Bill as to disability benefit in the present social insurance scheme and we would, I think, in considering whether self-employed people could be admitted or not probably come down to consider whether we should make disablement benefit only available to them.</P>
    <P>In any case it is a difficult thing, which could not be considered at this stage.  The only feasible way would be to consider the question of admitting self-employed people to the social insurance scheme as a whole. Apart from anything else, the amendment here does not deal with the question thoroughly at all.  It deals only with the admission of contributions but there would be a lot of other consequential amendments involved before these people would, in fact, be entitled to benefit.  It has not been proposed to amend the general conditions for benefit, which is &ldquo;an insured person suffers injury by accident arising out of and in the course of his employment being insurable (occupational injuries) employment.&rdquo; I do not know how Senator Garret FitzGerald and Senator O'Quigley would propose to get over that but it would be obviously particularly difficult in the case of small self-employed people.  It would be particularly difficult in their case to distinguish between injuries arising from occupational or non-occupational accidents.  It is a very <Col N="992" /> difficult question and cannot be decided easily at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reasonable reply.  On the contribution side, I do not think the difficulty is the fundamental one. I do not think that would constitute an excessive burden on the Fund.  It could be met by having a somewhat higher rate of contribution for voluntary contributors.  On the other hand, I do see the difficulties in the implementation of the provision of benefits in these cases.  The Minister has made some good points in regard to that and, therefore, I can see that that in my amendment would give rise to many problems.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, that does not go far enough to solve things.  I should like the Minister to look at this further. Probably he has an open mind on it. One thing worries me.  I got the impression that the Minister was looking at it in the context of opening the whole social insurance scheme to self-employed people.  It may get held up by all the other problems that arise in regard to social insurance but I should like the Minister to look at this on the merits.  This &ldquo;occupational injuries&rdquo; provision differs from the other provisions of social insurance. One can see the long term desirability of pensions for self-employed people. There are good economic reasons for this.  The effect of bringing them in on savings grounds and on finance for capital development grounds would be very good indeed, not to mention the social benefits that would accrue.</P>
      <P>That is a long term policy we should take and I see on the unemployment and disability side you cannot bring self-employed people in.  This is a separate thing and I think the Minister ought to look at this matter on its merits and he should not wait until the major development of extending social insurance to self-employed people becomes feasible.  A change in the Bill to bring in voluntary contributors is something that could be undertaken in its own right without a complete review of the social welfare code.</P>

      <P>To delete subsections (2) and (3) and substitute the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) Contributions to the scheme shall be made by the employers on behalf of insured persons in their employment and by voluntary contributors on their own behalf, the amounts being so determined as to ensure that the Fund will be actuarially sound, and that the amounts payable on behalf of employed contributors have regard both to the element of risk involved in the particular occupation followed by the employed contributor and also to the level of his weekly earnings, and the Minister shall from time to time make regulations&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  determining the level of these contributions,</P>
      <P>(b)  providing that contributions from employers may be levied either in relation to each individual employee or on the basis of total payroll, and</P>

      <P>&mdash;Senator Garret FitzGerald, Senator John B. O'Quigley.</P>
      <P>In its present form the amendment would obviously be unacceptable because it includes &ldquo;voluntary contributors&rdquo; which was turned down earlier.  I merely suggest that it should be discussed separately because it gives the opportunity to raise the point that the contributions to this scheme ought, in my mind, be related to the risk element.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Second Stage I explained why this was desirable.  It is a widespread practice throughout the world to do <Col N="994" /> this because of the desirability of giving some incentive to employers to minimise risks.  In fact, in something like 48 out of 73 countries there is a risk element in the contributions which is designed to discourage risk taking by employers.  The reason it is there is that one-third of the countries of the world believe this is desirable. The reason it is not here is that the Department of Social Welfare is still operating on this antiquated flat rate contribution.  Contributions to schemes should be on a more flexible basis related to wages on the one hand and in this particular instance related to the risk involved.  I feel that the Minister should consider this and that he ought to be prepared to vary these contributions in relation to risk.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the elimination of risk-rating is one of the most important and most praiseworthy features of this Bill.  There may be a majority of countries which still have risk-rating but they probably have it in a lot of cases because of the same reason that we have had it up to now, that they have not got around to removing this feature which I think is an objectionable one.  Not all risks are avoidable.  They are not all completely within the control of the employer to avoid by any means.  Some occupations by their very nature contain greater risks than others, and some of these are among the more important industries to the economy of the country.  It is desirable that industries such as agriculture should not have to carry an excessive overhead.  The principle of spreading the risk is a very desirable one from the point of view of the economy as a whole.</P>
      <P>The question of ensuring that proper steps are taken to avoid unnecessary risks can be dealt with in other ways. There are, in fact, ways in operation for ensuring that avoidable risk is guarded against.  There is a complete divergence of opinion here.  Senator FitzGerald believes that risk-rating is desirable.  I believe that it is undesirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to reply to the Minister on one point. He says that those countries that have <Col N="995" /> risk-rating have it because it is a feature of an old system like our insurance system which is going out, and happen still to have it.  This is not the case.  If the Minister had read the relevant tables in the Report he would have known that of the 48 countries which have a system involving a risk element there are, in fact, 28 which have State schemes and have the risk element incorporated in the State scheme.  It is only in the minority of cases that these schemes are run by commercial insurance companies.  The majority of countries with State schemes, whether under a State Department or under State-sponsored bodies, have a risk element because it is believed widely and by a big majority of countries to be desirable.</P>
      <P>The Minister's argument about spreading risks is irrelevant in cases like this.  Spreading the burden of social insurance is something about which there might be a case, but not that the risk is avoidable, and, therefore, the establishment of a relationship between premium and risk discourages taking risk.  When the contingency is one which is unavoidable and not something that anything can be done about there is no point in having such an arrangement.  Where risk can be avoided anything which encourages people to avoid it by making it expensive to take risks with other people's lives or health is desirable and is thought by the majority of countries in the world to be desirable, is in the majority of State schemes, and this taking it out of our system is completely retrogressive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every one of the EEC countries has this risk element, and because the Department of Social Welfare is supposed to be, under the Taoiseach's direction, working towards the harmonisation of our social welfare system with that of the EEC countries, which admittedly have certain different features in their schemes but have one thing in common, that they all have a risk element, the Minister will have to come back in a couple of years when we join the EEC&mdash;as we are likely to do, if the <Col N="996" /> Government improves its diplomatic efforts in Europe a bit, in all probability in between two and four years&mdash; the Minister will have to come into this House and ask us in harmonising our legislation with that of the Community to bring back the risk element into this scheme.  It seems pointless to take it out for a couple of years contrary to the direction which all Departments have to work towards the harmonising of our social legislation with that of the EEC, and then to have to put it back again.</P>
    <P>The Minister's arguments in favour of this are most unconvincing, and why he thinks he should remove something which most countries have adopted, only to come back in a couple of years and put it back again, I do not understand.  It seems to be very silly and a complete waste of the time of the House to have to come back again and tell us that we must have it back in again.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 65:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), lines 10 to 12, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;and&rdquo; in line 10 to the end of the subsection.</P>
      <P>My worry is simply about the words at the end of subsection (1) of section 40 giving the Minister power to do anything he likes in regard to this Bill.  Of course, the Minister should have power to make all the necessary regulations to bring it into operation.  There is no problem about the first five lines of this subsection, which provided that he may by order do anything necessary to bring the Bill into operation.  But the subsection enabling him to make any order modifying provisions of the Acts so far as may appear necessary or expedient for carrying the order into effect makes nonsense of legislation.  The purpose of legislation is to specify what can be done by the Minister, if necessary under regulations, but the regulations must implement the Act and have regard to its provisions.  I do not think that the Minister should have power to modify the provisions of the Acts wherever it is necessary or expedient.  I suggest that these words should be deleted as they are not only unnecessary but inappropriate in a Bill of this kind.</P>

      <P>The wording of section 40 is in line with the wording of section 71 of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, and of section 22 of the Social Welfare (Amendment) Act, 1960.  It gives a similar power in relation to bringing this Act into operation.  If it is necessary to make any order under this section, under the provision of subsection (2) the order will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, and it will be open to Senators to move a <Col N="998" /> resolution for the annulment of the order.</P>
      <P>I do not visualise a necessity to make any change, but it is conceivable that it might be necessary, and if it is considered necessary there is this power &mdash;if I appear to be doing anything objectionable&mdash;to move to have the order annulled.  I think that is sufficient safeguard.  It is quite a usual power to seek.  It is unusual to have to operate it.</P>

      <P>There are difficulties that arise in the application of statutes of this kind when they have to be welded into existing schemes.  That kind of difficulty did arise under the Social Welfare Act, 1952, but there is a more appropriate device and one which I think is more in accordance with the authority and standing of the Legislature.  If the Minister wants to make an order to modify any of the provisions of an Act there is a speedier way of doing it, by bringing in a draft order before each House of the Oireachtas and having it approved. That was done under an earlier section of the Social Welfare Act, 1952.  I think it is more in harmony and more consonant with the dignity and authority of the Houses of the Oireachtas. As we all know orders and regulations which are laid before the Houses for 21 days seldom engage the same kind of attention and inquisitiveness as an order made in draft form.  If the Minister has nothing to fear or hide &mdash;and I am sure he will not have&mdash; there seems to be no reason why he should not bring in a draft order and have it confirmed.</P>

      <P>What the Senator is suggesting would impose a certain amount of delay which might be unnecessary. In the case of my proposal if Senators or Deputies felt that what I was seeking to do was something that should not be done, they could move to annul the order, whereas if what I was seeking to do was unobjectionable there would be no need to go through that procedure.  I think this is a reasonable thing to ask for, and it is unlikely that any order which will make any change will need to be made.</P>

      <P>I think it is quite unreasonable.  Subsection (6) of section 4 of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, provides:</P>
      <P>Where regulations are proposed to be made for the purposes of subsection (4) or subsection (5) of this section, a draft thereof shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the regulations shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.</P>
      <P>This is a question of maintaining the authority of Parliament.  If the regulations are to be of the kind we anticipate, I cannot see any reason why they should not be brought in in that form.</P>
      <P>This emphasises the need for this House to address itself in the very near future to establishing a statutory instruments committee quite different from the one in existence at present to look at the substance of the various regulations that are being made.  One can see the kind of regulations that will be made under this Act.  They will affect the lives and wellbeing and, indeed, the liberty of injured workmen. It is time the Oireachtas addressed itself to carrying out in a proper way the duties which it imposes upon itself, and had a proper look at these regulations.</P>

      <P>The provision made in this regard in the Social Welfare Act, 1952, was in section 71.  It is exactly the same provision that is being made here. I understand that, in fact, three orders were made under that section.  I do not think it is reasonable that we should be asked to go through this procedure of bringing it before each House of the Oireachtas unless it appears to be necessary to do so.  If Senators consider it necessary they can insist on it being brought in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the Minister can make a case for not bringing draft orders before the Houses of the Oireachtas where the orders are to be made specifically under the provisions of an Act and where the Act contemplates specifically what is to be in them, but I do not think there is a case where the Minister seeks <Col N="1000" /> power, as he does here, to make orders which would modify the provisions of the Act.  In this section the Minister is taking power to legislate.  If the Minister would be prepared to withdraw the word &ldquo;modify&rdquo; and limit this to orders implementing the Act as we have passed it, that would be reasonable.  He cannot have the power simultaneously to modify the Act as he likes, and secondly to say that the orders shall be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  He cannot sustain those two propositions simultaneously without taking away from the rights and privileges and duty of the Houses to legislate.  The Minister should reconsider one or the other.  I certainly endorse what Senator O'Quigley has said about the need for a committee to examine the substance of the orders. We are negligent in that respect.</P>

      <P>I may be wrong but my understanding is&mdash;if Senator Ryan is referring to the Committee on Statutory Instruments&mdash;that that committee confines itself to seeing that the orders are in conformity with the legislation under which they are introduced.  It does not examine the substance of the orders.  That is my understanding of how the committee works.  It does not concern itself with the substance of what is in the orders but with whether they are in conformity with the legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The committee does not confine itself as closely as that. Among other matters it considers whether regulations provide for what was visualised in the Act.  A committee of this kind cannot examine whether the legislation passed by the Houses is good or not.  It is for the Houses to decide whether the legislation is good or bad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the point.  An order may be made <Col N="1001" /> which may be technically within the competence of the Minister to make under the Act.  It may be an order of the kind that is visualised by the Act. Nevertheless, there may be something in that order which, in the way it has been decided, is in some way objectionable or could be regarded as objectionable. It should, therefore, be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas to be debated.  At the moment if Senators do not examine those orders individually in the way they should there is a defect in our legislative system which should be cleared up.  The best way to do it would be to have some committee which would delegate those orders among Members to look at and examine.  However, that is another day's work.  My concern here is with the Minister's attitude and the administrative power he has regarding those orders.  That there is no provision for this in the 1952 Act is no excuse for not having it in this Bill.</P>
      <P>This shows that some bad legislation exists in the country.  Certainly, some bad legislation was introduced in the 1950s.  I do not know which Government was in power then.  It was a period of rather low ebb for our Parliamentary institutions and our legislation was not very good but we should not be stuck with it.  Some of this legislation was introduced by the Fianna Fáil Government and some by the inter-Party Government, but we should not be tied to it now.</P>

      <P>If that is so, why is there provision in so many Acts that orders shall be brought before both Houses of the Oireachtas? The practice is there and it is an important way to ensure that those orders contain what it is intended they should.  If the Minister is prepared to introduce an amendment on Report Stage to say that where such orders modify the provisions of the Act they <Col N="1002" /> shall be brought before both Houses of the Oireachtas, I would be perfectly happy with it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 66:</P>
      <P>Before section 41, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  There shall be an Occupational Injuries Advisory Council which shall consist of a chairman appointed by the Minister and such number of other members so appointed as the Minister may determine, including an equal number of persons appointed by him after consultations with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and such other organisations as he thinks fit, to represent employers and insured persons respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Where the Minister proposes to make regulations for the purposes of this Act (or to apply regulations already made for other purposes to claimants for benefit under this Act) or to make regulations relating to benefit or the prescription of diseases under this Act, he shall (unless it appears to him that by reason of the urgency of the matter it is inexpedient so to do) refer the proposals, in the form of draft regulations or otherwise, to the Council for consideration and advice; and the Minister may from <Col N="1003" /> time to time refer to that Council for consideration and advice such questions relating to this Act as he thinks fit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment asks for the setting up of an Occupational Injuries Advisory Council.  This is a very complex piece of legislation and many controversial matters will no doubt arise on it.  The setting up of such a Council is of such obvious value in the drafting of regulations, advising the Minister on various questions arising out of this Act that there is no need for me to say anything on what is proposed.  The proposed new section is entirely self-explanatory. An Advisory Council of the kind sought has already been set up by the Minister under the Mines and Quarries Act.  This is the type of Council that we now seek in regard to this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Miss Davidson on this particular matter.  If there was ever a case for the establishment of an Advisory Council of this type, the legislation we are considering at the moment is outstanding in that respect. Apart altogether from its usefulness, it is obvious that the Minister and his Department would be well advised to give this proposal very serious consideration. It is very necessary in this very complex Bill.  Such an Advisory Council would be of very great value to the Department.  I want, therefore, to urge that the Minister should give this proposal his very serious consideration immediately and I want to support Senator Davidson in the amendment which suggests that a new section should be written into the Bill for this purpose.</P>

      <P>We have not got this system of Advisory Councils in regard to other matters under the existing Social Welfare Acts into which this scheme is being incorporated.  The arrangements under section 3 of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, whereby any regulations that are made are laid before each House of the Oireachtas, and may then be annulled by resolution <Col N="1004" /> of each House, has proved satisfactory.

      <P>In effect, neither the majority nor the minority recommended this.  In paragraph 417, page 143 of the reports, the question of an advisory body was dealt with and the concluding sentence reads:</P>
      <P>The majority, however, were of opinion that the present arrangements whereby the Minister for Social Welfare is responsible to the Oireachtas for the workmen's compensation scheme works satisfactorily and were not in favour of the establishment of such a Board.</P>
      <P>The minority recommended the setting up of an advisory body in the event of the present system being continued but considered that regular, periodical reviews of the workmen's compensation code were essential if we were to keep abreast of developments elsewhere. They recommended such a body only in the event of the workmen's compensation system being retained but not in connection with the social insurance (occupational injuries) scheme which they put forward.  This is a matter which was considered by the Commission and neither the majority nor the minority were in favour of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Sometimes when I hear the Minister I cannot <Col N="1005" /> believe my ears.  The Minority Report recommended what should be done in relation to the continuation of the present system&mdash;they were not talking about the social insurance scheme, the Minister said.  Let me read what the Minority Report says, for the Minister's information.  Paragraph 417 sets out the functions of the Advisory Council established in Great Britain and continued:</P>
      <P>The legislative changes made in the present system here since the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1934, came into operation stemmed from political pressure which had been brought to bear to secure increases in the rates of compensation payable. These measures were availed of to introduce a few other amendments to the Code.  We believe that regular periodical reviews of the Workmen's Compensation Code are essential if we are to keep abreast of developments here and elsewhere. We think that an Advisory Board could provide an extremely useful service to the Minister for Social Welfare, particularly in view of any developments in the field of workmen's compensation which may emerge in the event of this country's entry into the European Economic Community.  We recommend, therefore, that an Advisory Board should be established as was suggested by some members in paragraph 417 of the Majority Report.</P>
      <P>What does the Minister mean by telling us that neither Report recommended this?  It is recommended specifically.  Am I wrong?  Have I misread the piece?  I am open to correction by the Minister.</P>

      <P>The Minister is again talking like a lawyer.  In this chamber we should talk like politicians and legislators.  Of course, any lawyer can, at any time, give dozens of reasons and elaborate why a certain thing must be this way and why it should not be that way.  We ought to take the view that here we are enacting a Bill which will provide occupational injuries benefit.  We should call it that.  Of course, I know it has to be welded on to the social welfare code.  That can easily be achieved by saying that this Act shall be construed with the Social Welfare Acts, 1952 to 1965 and any lawyer will be quite happy because he knows that the Occupational Injuries Act of 1965 is welded on to the Social Welfare Acts of 1952 to 1965.  But it is a waste of time for everybody writing out all the numerous forms which will be printed in regard to the Social Welfare (Occupational Injuries) Bill, 1965 because nobody will ever refer to it as such.  Everybody will refer to this Bill and the benefits to be gained under it as the Occupational Injuries Act of 1965.  Why we should waste time with some kind of legal point that is of no value from the point of view of operating it beats me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Flanagan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to make suitable legislative provision for the registration of societies known as credit unions.  It originated with the report of the Committee on Co-operative Societies, published in February, 1964, which contained a special chapter on credit unions.  A credit union is defined in section 2 of the Bill as a co-operative society consisting of individuals having a common bond and formed for the purpose of promoting thrift among the members, creating a source of credit for them at a fair and reasonable rate of interest and using and controlling their savings for their mutual benefit.  This kind of financial institution is well known in other parts of the world as a special form of co-operative effort and there has been widespread demand for a suitable charter for it in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first co-operative credit society was founded in Germany in 1849 for the purpose of combating usury. Societies of this kind became very <Col N="1010" /> popular on the Continent and in 1900 the first North American equivalent was set up in Quebec.  Enabling legislation was enacted in that province in 1906 and the credit union idea quickly spread in Canada.  The pooling of financial resources through the medium of credit unions played a significant part in arresting the economic depression in certain Canadian provinces in the 1930s.</P>
    <P>By 1934 Credit Union laws had been passed in 39 of the United States and a Federal Credit Union Act became law in that year.  The United States credit unions also promoted in that year the Credit Union National Association and a mutual insurance society with the object of providing suitable services for credit unions.  The Credit Union National Association now promotes the Credit Union movement all over the world and one of its representatives visited Ireland in 1959 to give evidence before the Committee on Co-operative Societies.  In the credit union movement it is the practice for each country to have its own national league and, accordingly, the Credit Union League of Ireland was set up around this time and it was admitted to membership of the Credit Union National Association in November, 1961.</P>
    <P>By the end of 1964, as indicated by the Yearbook of the Credit Union National Association, there were credit unions in all of the United States, in all provinces of Canada, in Central and South America, in certain Pacific countries and also in several European, African and Asian countries.  The movement now has a total membership of about 30,000,000 persons and assets in the region of £5,000 million.  The total number of individual Credit Unions is about 50,000, so that the average asset for each unit is about £100,000.  Impressive as these statistics are the movement is by no means static and continuing annual advances of striking dimensions seem to be inevitable.</P>
    <P>There have, of course, been loan societies of one kind or another in this country for a very long time. Under the Friendly Societies Acts special provision was made in the last <Col N="1011" /> quarter of the nineteenth century for the registration of societies formed for the purpose of creating funds by monthly or other subscriptions to be lent out to, or invested for the members of the society.  From the point of view of administration and finance, societies formed for this purpose were on the whole extremely unsatisfactory, particularly in the case of non-agricultural loan societies.  In 1917 the authority for the registration of loan societies was withdrawn and replaced by a new one which was limited to societies formed to grant loans for agricultural purposes.  Since that time, therefore, it has not been permissible to register non-agricultural loan societies, but those which were established prior to August, 1917, were allowed to continue in business and there are now 23 of them on the register with total membership of about 20,000 persons.</P>
    <P>As regards agricultural credit societies, the first of these was formed in 1894 and was quickly followed by a large number of others.  In 1914 a Commission on co-operative credit drew attention to a number of inadequacies in the operations of these societies.  They put forward certain recommendations to rectify the position, but war broke out before any action could be taken on their report. A later Commission on Agriculture endorsed these recommendations in an interim report on credit which was issued in 1923.</P>
    <P>In 1927, however, the Agricultural Credit Corporation was set up under the Agricultural Credit Act of that year and this seemed to create in the minds of many people the idea that there would be no point in establishing further societies of this kind in the private sphere.  No new agricultural credit societies have been registered under the Friendly Societies Acts since 1928 and there are now only seven such societies actually operating.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 125 of their report the recent Committee on Co-operative Societies stated that having considered the whole question they were of opinion that savings and loan societies conducted on the credit union plan, with <Col N="1012" /> proper safeguards, would be a useful form of co-operative effort.  They pointed out, however, that with the withdrawal of the statutory authority in 1917 for the formation of loan societies other than those in the agricultural sphere, various legal difficulties stand in the way of the formation of credit unions in this country.  They recommended, accordingly, that the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts should be suitably amended in order to make provision for the registration of credit unions.  In paragraph 128 of their report they set out in some detail the kind of provisions which they feel should apply to Credit Unions and this Bill follows generally the lines indicated by the Committee.</P>
    <P>The Committee recommended that in any legislation to deal with these societies provision should be made for supervision by some authority other than the individual societies.  This should involve, they felt, surprise inspections and also instruction and organisational assistance.  The aim should be to have supervision provided by a representative organisation as soon as possible but in the early stages the cost might, they thought, have to be borne by the State.  Since the report was published the credit union movement has expanded rapidly in this country mainly through the work of the Credit Union League of Ireland.  There are, at present, about 140 credit unions here with assets of about a million and a half pounds.  Individual unions which wish to become affiliated to the league must comply with the League's requirements. It is the intention of the League to employ suitably qualified personnel whose job it will be to make the kind of inspections which were envisaged in the report of the Committee on Co-operative Societies.  The need for interim supervisory arrangements on the part of the State has, therefore, been obviated as the ideal form of control by a representative organisation on the lines which the committee had in mind is now developing.</P>
    <P>For these reasons I have drawn up this Bill on the basis that the credit union movement should be allowed to regulate its own affairs as far as possible. I have no doubt that the Credit <Col N="1013" /> Union League of Ireland with the assistance of the international credit union organisations will keep a watchful eye on all credit union activities in this country and that it can be relied upon to take all necessary steps to protect the interests of the public.</P>
    <P>However, we cannot ignore the fact that the history of credit societies in this country in the past has been unhappy.  Senators will, I think, agree that any legislation dealing with organisations of this kind which handle money should be tightly drawn and should provide ample powers to deal with any undesirable situation that may arise.  This Bill does, in fact, contain many such provisions.  There are many detailed safeguards and restrictions of one kind or another interspersed throughout the Bill, but I should like to refer in particular to the specific provision in section 12 for the establishment by each credit union of a supervisory committee.  The function of this committee is to oversee the activities of the directors and other officers, and the manner in which this function is to be discharged is set out in section 17.  There are ample clauses designed to ensure that the supervisory committee will be be independent of the other officers of the credit union and will be in a position to carry out its duties adequately. It will be necessary, of course to maintain some public supervision also and I should like to draw attention in this connection to section 27 of the Bill which provides for the establishment by me of the Credit Union Advisory Committee.  This will be a body of persons having a knowledge of matters of significance in relation to credit unions, who will keep an eye on general developments in this field and advise the Minister for Industry and Commerce as to any action he should take to safeguard the interests of the public.  Senators will also notice the power given by section 33 of the Bill to the Registrar of Friendly Societies to petition the High Court for an order to wind up a credit union if it is unable to pay its debts or wilfully violates the provisions of the law.</P>
    <P>It should not be forgotten, of course, <Col N="1014" /> that the Industrial and Provident Societies Act, 1893, into which this Bill is being written, already contains a number of provisions which will assist in ensuring proper supervision of the activities of credit unions. Section 20 of that Act will require each Credit Union to submit to the Registrar of Friendly Societies an annual return in the prescribed form. Under section 18 of that Act there is provision for the inspection of the books of a society by an accountant or actuary appointed by the registrar, while section 50 provides for a full investigation of the affairs of the society.  Finally, the Industrial and Provident Societies (Amendment) Act, 1913, requires every society to have its accounts audited by public auditors appointed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>To a substantial extent the Bill is modelled on the legislation prevailing in other countries where the credit union movement has been a success and where failures have been rare. A considerable amount of technical drafting difficulty was encountered in fitting legislation on these into the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts. This has given rise to some delay in producing the Bill, but I am satisfied that we now have before us a set of provisions which will give a suitable basis for regulating the affairs of credit unions in accordance with the principles accepted internationally in relation to these bodies.  It is hardly necessary for me to mention that the Bill has already been examined in detail in the Dáil where many amendments were made to meet points put forward by the Credit Union League of Ireland and other persons involved in the credit union movement, and also to give effect to suggestions offered by Deputies representing all parties in the House.</P>
    <P>The figures which I have mentioned earlier in dealing with the magnitude of the credit union movement will give some idea of the economic significance of this particular kind of financial institution. It would be very hard to forecast just how rapid the growth of these societies will be in Ireland, but perhaps it is not unrealistic to contemplate the <Col N="1015" /> possibility that we will have 1,000 credit unions here in a reasonable space of time, bearing in mind especially that the urge amongst the public at large to become involved in this kind of co-operative endeavour has already lead to the establishment of 140 societies even in the absence of suitable legislation.  Taking even half the world average and assigning an asset value of £50,000 to each credit union, we would arrive at a figure of £50,000,000 in total assets of these societies.  Even in this age of noughts and millions this would be quite an important statistic in our economic tables.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that, in general, savings are a residual and that it is well-nigh impossible to extract more of them from the public even if new media and new institutions are established.  If we adopted this defeatist attitude, I suppose we would not bother at all with legislation in connection with credit unions.  From my own knowledge of rural affairs, however, I am quite convinced that the promotion of credit unions will give rise to a substantial volume of new savings that would otherwise not come into being, apart altogether from bringing into useful circulation idle funds at present rather uselessly hoarded in all kinds of strange places.  I gather from remarks made by my colleagues in the Dáil that something similar can be expected in the case of urban and suburban credit unions.</P>
    <P>Some time ago the Minister for Finance found it necessary to establish a working party on savings in the hope of turning up something that would help to restrain the propensity to spend which has been causing us so many aches and pains in recent years.  This Bill was already in existence at that time and did not come within the terms of reference of the Working Party.  I am satisfied, however, that a well-run credit union movement can do more to rectify this kind of problem than almost any other device that can be thought of.  I say this because education is the very basis of the credit union movement, which sets out to demonstrate to the public the meaning and purpose of money and how to manage <Col N="1016" /> it better.  People who have had any worthwhile contact with credit unions are unlikely to be taken so easily by the inducements to spend, even the &ldquo;easy&rdquo; way, with which they are being constantly and sedulously bombarded; the basic financial arithmetic which they will learn from their credit union will, rather, impress upon them the need to spend their money as wisely as possible, to have funds available for normal contingencies, to save for the rainy day, and to procure credit at the lowest possible terms when it is necessary for them to borrow.  And, what is more important, it will provide them with the means to achieve all these things.</P>
    <P>The Credit Union League of Ireland, whose representatives I have had the pleasure of meeting, would be the first to remind us that credit unions also have a very important social purpose. Their object is to provide machinery by which people can help each other. It is not a form of business activity which will enable the few to make profits at the expense of the many, but rather a co-operative enterprise in which all concerned can participate for their mutual benefit.  We have all heard of the unfortunates who have suffered at the hands of moneylenders and hire-purchase companies of the less reputable kind.  We all know that, for one reason or another, a large part of the population cannot gain access to normal banking facilities. And those of us who have any volume at all of letters from the public will know that when a poor man really needs money he must often pay through the nose for it.  These are all social evils and we can, I believe, hope that the credit union movement will help to eliminate them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Parliamentary Secretary for his clear and informative opening statement.  It was very interesting in that it told us the background of the movement as well as what is in the Bill.  We are very happy to welcome the Bill.  It is a great thing that this movement has now reached the point where legislation is being brought in to give it a firm foundation. The benefits, social, financial and <Col N="1017" /> economic to the country which may flow from it could be very substantial. The Parliamentary Secretary himself is very hopeful when he says that there may be as many as 1,000 of these unions in the country before long. This would involve a very substantial volume of savings.</P>
      <P>This is of great importance to us. Part of our present difficulties are due to the fact that our savings have not been sufficient for the volume of investment requirements.  The volume of investment has run ahead of the volume of savings.  Anything that can generate additional savings will make a considerable difference to us in the years immediately ahead.</P>
      <P>The only concern I have about the Bill relates to one aspect.  There is a particular type of credit union operating here at the moment.  It is a very useful activity organised by the Community Development Movement. They have 11 credit co-operatives registered at the moment and five others awaiting registration.  In the case of those awaiting registration delay has been caused by an examination of the procedure and of the standard rules.  This is an integrated movement&mdash;it has a central distribution co-operative and industrial co-operatives, and there are a number of trading groups.  It acts according to a standard system with one board of directors.  It keeps to the principle of charging the market price for goods and services they sell.</P>
      <P>The credit co-operatives in this movement operate on the principle of charging the market rate which, in their view would lie somewhere about ten per cent for the kind of money they are providing.  Members of the co-operatives benefit from the profits that accrue.  They operate an interest rate which is somewhere between the bank rate and hire-purchase rates.  The benefits of the profits are ploughed back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Their approach is different from that of the credit union movement itself which operates on the diminishing balance method of one per cent per month interest on whatever is outstanding which averages out at six or seven per cent and is a good deal less than <Col N="1018" /> the rate which the Community Development Movement charge.  It is a different system.  The Community Development Movement prefer to work on the market rate and plough the profits back whereas the Credit Union League operate on the principle of not making a profit but of lending money to each other at this much lower rate.</P>
    <P>Each of these systems has its merits. We should not do anything by legislation to prevent the spread of the Community Development Movement as well as that of the Credit Union League.  As at present constituted this legislation is inimical to the Community Development Movement.  Some amendment of the Bill would be required to cater for this group and ensure that they are not put out of business. The Bill as it is designed does not take account of this group.  On Committee Stage I shall be raising this point in detail.  I am raising it now as I feel I should point out my concern to the Parliamentary Secretary.  We will be putting down certain amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Perhaps one solution would be to drop section 3 of the Bill or to modify section 3 and for the Community Development Movement to drop the word &ldquo;union&rdquo; from their title.  They are now called &ldquo;Credit Union Co-operatives&rdquo; and they would be prepared to ease that problem by dropping the word &ldquo;union&rdquo;.  Probably some amendment of the Bill would do the trick by getting them out of the framework of the Bill and enabling them to continue in operation.  It might be necessary as an alternative to amend the rules possibly also in relation to supervisory committees which the Community Development Movement do not have in the same way as the Credit Union League.</P>
    <P>When the Parliamentary Secretary is replying I should be interested if he would indicate whether he feels he can meet this group and whether he feels it would be better to amend section 3 and get the Community Development people to remove the word &ldquo;union&rdquo; from the title of their credit co-operatives, or to eliminate the features in sections 11 and 12 which would be inimical to the successful operation of <Col N="1019" /> the credit co-operatives in the Community Development Movement.  If the Parliamentary Secretary would advise us on this it would help us as regards putting down amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Apart from that small difficulty which I hope we will get over&mdash;it should not be impossible to get over it &mdash;this legislation is extremely welcome. It is a good thing that we have reached the stage where we are introducing legislation for a movement which is growing as rapidly as the credit union movement is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>The development of the credit union movement in this country could be described as a quiet revolution.  No blaring of trumpets welcomed it, and only the foresight and persistence of public spirited men and women gave it its chance of survival, and built it up to what it now is&mdash;an accepted and dependable institution.</P>
      <P>The credit unions function for the good of the people.  Helpful voluntary workers will teach ordinary people the principles of sound saving and, when the need arises, will advise them on proper loan raising, thus imparting order and regularity to their savings, and dignity and self respect to their borrowing.  This latter is an important function which protects the uninitiated from the dangers, to which the Parliamentary Secretary referred, of unscrupulous moneylenders with their exorbitant interest rates.  We all know too many cases where homes and families have been broken up because of unwise borrowing from doubtful sources.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party have sought this legislation over many years and we are glad to welcome the measure and to express our thanks to the Parliamentary Secretary for bringing in the Bill now before us.  The credit unions themselves have pressed for legislation to give legal sanction to their activities. Membership of the credit unions has grown apace in recent years, and this must be of considerable value to the community as a whole, particularly as it encourages regular saving&mdash;a much needed virtue as we are not a saving people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1020" /> The credit union movement is a friendly, homely, organisation.  Its officers are local men and women accepted for their approachability and their integrity.  The whole business is carried on in an atmosphere of neighbourliness and mutual trust.  It is for this reason that I should like to refer to a few points in the Bill which might, I fear, remove the important element of local community trust.  I refer to the introduction of the law courts in what are surely matters capable of being handled by this movement which has proved itself so capable of carrying on its other functions.</P>
    <P>It is a mistake that in section 5 and section 24 the district court, the High Court and even the Supreme Court, should come into this neighbourly happy movement.  It seems to be a very heavy machinery to apply to simple, more or less domestic decisions of a purely voluntary organisation.  I do not like law courts and there are very many people who have the same view.  One often hears it said: &ldquo;We are a most respectable family.  We were never in the law courts in our lives.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I fear the shadow of the law over the credit unions except where it cannot be avoided.  The credit union advisory committee would be fully capable of handling the matters with which sections 5 and 24 are concerned.  I would ask the Minister to look at those sections and try to come to our point of view for the general good of the credit unions.  The introduction of the law courts might drive away prospective members and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to preserve in the Bill the spirit and atmosphere of good neighbourliness and mutual aid without the gloom of suspicion of the law courts hanging over it.</P>
    <P>Another point which I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to consider is that the credit unions do not appear to have any right or power to recover any debts due to them either before or after the passing of this Act.  I find that on Committee Stage in the Dáil on section 7 the Parliamentary Secretary undertook to look further into the point before the Report Stage.  He added and I quote from volume 222, <Col N="1021" /> No. 4, column 788 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>I would like to see a situation created where credit unions could, subject to the Statute of Limitations, sue for debts after the passing of this Bill which had been incurred before.</P>

      <P>The point I was making is one of considerable importance to credit unions but I could not trace any further mention of the matter on the later Stages in the Dáil.  I should like to hear the Parliamentary Secretary's considered view of the proposal and whether he would now think of having it included in the measure.  In this particular case I confess I cannot myself see any way of avoiding recourse to the law courts but I press the point for the Parliamentary Secretary's consideration.</P>

      <P>I should like to join with the last two speakers in welcoming this measure which gives legal status to the credit union movement.  At this stage it is appropriate that we should pay tribute to Miss Nora Herlihy and the other dedicated people who for so many years have been carrying on on their own and keeping the credit union going at the pace it has been going.  I hope, when this measure is passed, that there will be more interest shown in the credit union movement <Col N="1022" /> and that voluntary business will take a more active interest in it.</P>
      <P>The Irish Countrywomen's Association have been playing their part in this regard.  That is something we should only expect from the Irish Countrywomen's Association as it favours the co-operative movement. The credit union movement is really co-operative saving.  As Senator Garret FitzGerald said the habit of thrift and saving is rapidly disappearing and it seems to be &ldquo;live and make merry for tomorrow we die&rdquo;.  I hope, with the giving of legal status to this co-operative saving movement, that more people will be encouraged to save small amounts.  That is the main reason for this credit union movement.  It is not the amount saved that is important. It is the habit of saving.  That is what the credit union wishes to encourage and from that point of view it could be regarded as the poor man's banking system.  It is real Christian charity and practical patriotism to pool the small resources of the neighbourhood for the general good.</P>
      <P>I like this aspect of pooling very much.  It is a great boost for the morale of those who take part in the movement. I have been told that the number of defaulters in credit unions has been very little indeed.  It is surprising in Ireland that even without this measure, the movement has not made more progress. It is nothing new to consider this idea of pooling our resources.  We had it in the old days of the &ldquo;meitheal&rdquo; when labour was pooled.  This is only modernisation of that idea.  It is a pooling of money rather than of labour.  It is not so much a hand out as a helping hand.  I hope, when this Bill is passed, that the voluntary associations and every organised group in the country will get cracking and establish credit unions in their midst.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the House for their reception of this Bill and I thank the Senators who contributed to it for their remarks.  Senator FitzGerald mentioned the possibility that the enactment of this Bill would in some way wipe out the community development movement.  In regard to this I should like to mention that at <Col N="1023" /> no stage during the passage of the Bill in the Dáil did the community development movement approach me in regard to its provisions, that is until the Bill had virtually passed through the Dáil. In fact, I think it was on the very day that the Report and Final Stages were taken that the first approach was made by the representatives of the community development movement.</P>
      <P>It was certainly not represented to me on that occasion that the Bill would have very serious adverse effects on the community development movement. I am in full agreement with the aims and objects of this movement. Accordingly, I undertake to look further into the two matters raised by Senator FitzGerald, having regard to what he has represented to me and to the House today.  It will be necessary, of course, to have a consultation with the Credit Union Movement in regard to both of those items.  It is only right to point out in regard to each of them that the Credit Union League and its parent body CUNA, like the efforts of the supervisory committee agency, are absolutely essential to the whole structure of credit unions.  Secondly, with regard to the matter of interest, this is enshrined in the rules of credit unions throughout the world and is enshrined in the model rules approved by the Credit Union National Association. I am sure, therefore, Senator FitzGerald and the House will understand that it will be difficult at this stage to do anything with regard to the removal of the supervisory committee which is really a watchdog appointed by the members to watch over the activities of directors and officials.  In effect, it is a kind of running audit on the affairs of the society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as interest rates are concerned, I do not wish in effect to abolish or seriously damage the Community Development Movement and I undertake to have discussions with representatives of the Movement and with the Credit Union League between now and Committee Stage.  Senator Miss Davidson objected to the existence of things called courts.  Being a lawyer, I do not <Col N="1024" /> quite share the Senator's views in regard to their operation.  Perhaps they are gloomy places&mdash;I know many which are&mdash;but we should hesitate to view them with suspicion.  The matters raised in regard to appeal to the district court were fully debated in the Dáil. The point raised by Senator Miss Davidson was raised there by a number of Deputies.</P>
    <P>I held out then and I shall hold out here because there is an elementary principle of justice that if a genuine disagreement arises the person or persons entitled to decide who has the merit should not be one or other of the two parties.  It is only right to point out that the appeal in all cases will be to the district court which is the cheapest possible form of law.  It is stated in the Bill that the appellant shall merely state in writing the grounds of his appeal.  The higher courts come into operation only if and when a question of law arises.</P>
    <P>In the ordinary way, the question of whether a person should be admitted to membership or expelled from membership is something which is a matter of fact and of merit and unlikely to raise abstruse legal points. This Bill, therefore, provides the machinery whereby admission to membership and expulsion from membership are not merely fair and reasonable but shown to be fair and reasonable because it has been decided where necessary by independent tribunals.  I do not expect that there will be many cases in respect of which the machinery will be used.  That is already our experience in regard to credit unions: very few difficulties have arisen.  One can imagine a type of busybody in a town or village whom it is desirable not to have in a credit union and there are occasions when power to expel might have to be used.  However, as I have said this will be only very rarely.</P>
    <P>Senator Miss Davidson also mentioned the point about the credit union not being able to sue for debts.  That was covered in Report Stage in the Dáil by an amendment now incorporated in section 32 and I may say that some of the legal experts, other than myself that is, told me they had serious misgivings about whether the <Col N="1025" /> section was valid.  I insisted, in any event, on the section going in and, accordingly, subject to the Statute of Limitations, credit union leagues will have power to sue for debts due and owing to them.  I again thank the House for its reception of the Bill and look forward to seeing Senators discuss possible amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
