      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Seanad hereby approves of the Garda Síochána Pensions Order, 1966, made on the 17th day of October, 1966, by the Minister for Justice, with the sanction of the Minister for Finance, under section 13 of the Police Forces Amalgamation Act, 1925.</P>

      <P>In regard to the motion moved by Senator Browne the memorandum, which has been circulated to Members of the House with the Order, explains the effects of its provisions.</P>
      <P>As Senators will observe from the memorandum, the Order provides for the application to members of the Garda Síochána of the benefits of the Pensions (Abatement) Act, 1965, which applies to Civil Servants and Local Government Officials.</P>
      <P>At present, the Garda Síochána Pensions Orders provide for the abatement of the pension of a retired member of the Force who takes up any employment remunerated out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas or out of the Central Fund.  This will be changed by the new Order in the following respects:</P>
      <P>(1)  there will no longer be any abatement in the pension of a retired member of the Force who secures employment, other than in the Garda Síochána;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="392" /> (2)  in the case where abatement will continue to apply namely where the re-employment is in the Garda Síochána, it will be alleviated by being related, not, as heretofore, to the pay at the date of retirement but to the pay currently applying to the member's former postion, and</P>
    <P>(3)  the abatement in the pension of a retired member of the Force, who is reappointed to the Garda Síochána, may be waived by the Minister for Finance subject to the condition that the pensioner is re-employed for work, for which he has particular training and experience, and that it is not practicable to meet the requirement otherwise.</P>
    <P>The Order will have effect from the 1st January, 1965, which is the date that the Pensions (Abatement) Act came into force.</P>
    <P>As the Order will, thus, operate to the advantage of members of the Garda Síochána, I trust that the House will find no difficulty in signifying its approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>This Order is certainly a welcome one.  When the Pensions Bill was debated in this House Members on all sides indicated their desire that all abatements in regard to pensions should be removed as speedily as possible.  It is undesirable that persons who go out on pension and are brought back to full work should, just because they happen to be state pensioners and not people coming out on pension from a private employer, be penalised in some way.  This further step in the remedying of the position of Garda pensioners is certainly most welcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>On Thursday night last the Minister was just about to define for me the term &ldquo;working farmer&rdquo; when we adjourned.  Unfortunately, the pros and cons of who or what particular type of farmer is involved <Col N="393" /> in the present or any strike does not alter the unfortunate lot of so many of our farmers throughout the country at present.  Will the Minister deny that agricultural incomes and family farm incomes in particular have dropped considerably over the past year?  I should like to know where the non-working farmers are to be found in this country?  Many people seem to forget that the farmers are, I suppose, the only section of the community who do not enjoy a 5 day week at present.  The farmers have no half holiday in the week.  They must work a full 7 day week.  They have no sickness benefit, no retirement, no pension schemes and the only holiday the vast majority of them get is, perhaps, a week or two when they get married and go on their honeymoon.  These are the people to whom the Government appear to deny a reasonable living wage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that 59 per cent of the farms in the Republic of Ireland are under 25 acres.  The families on these farms are expected to survive on a figure of approximately £7 per week and it is tantamount to treason if they protest or insist on the right to bring up their families in some standard of decency.  I feel I should take this opportunity of reminding the Minister of the pittances so many of our citizens are compelled to live on.  For the five-15 acre holding, this year's income estimate is £232 per annum, or less than £4 10s per week.  For farms of between 15 and 30 acres, the income is estimated at £386 per annum, or £7 8s per week and for those of the 30-50 acre holdings, a figure of £565 per annum, or £10 16s per week. Therefore, the average family farm income, on farms from five-50 acres, is £394 per annum, or £7 10s per week. When we bear in mind that the people who are earning those vast incomes must have at least £1,000 investment in land, buildings and property&mdash;and up to £10,000 &mdash; it is surely a poor return, when we contrast it with other sections of the community.  When we break down the figure of family farm income, how many urban people realise that that income represents the return for the work done by not only <Col N="394" /> the farmer but his wife, children and all the other members of the farm who must join in and give a hand in order to secure that mere pittance?</P>
    <P>I should like to compare those figures, which were compiled by the advisory services, with those set out in the tables in the last national farm survey carried out during the years 1955-56 to 1957-58.  On page 3, Part I of that Report we find&mdash;taking the same categories &mdash; the total family farm income of the small farms of between five and 15 acres during the three seasons of that Report, almost ten years ago, was £209 for the year 1957.  Comparing that with this year's estimate of £232 per annum, we have an increase of £23 per annum in the family farm income of the smallest farms over the ten-year period.  For the 15 to 30 acre group the figure in the national farm survey was £332 and, compared with this year's figure of £386, it is only £54 more.  For the 30 to 50 acre group the figure ten years ago was £464, or £101 less than the figure for this year.</P>
    <P>I do not for a moment deny that farm incomes have been static over each of those ten years.  There was a considerable improvement during the first three or four years after that Report but, this year, family farm incomes have taken a nose-dive.  Surely the present Minister for Agriculture and his predecessor must be aware of the grave economic conditions affecting our agricultural economy at the present time.  That any Government should attempt to deny that these conditions exist is indeed extraordinary, since the farming community represent such a large sector of the population.  The urban people in general seem also to be unaware of the fact that the farmers' share of the ordinary agricultural produce they buy&mdash;and, in many cases, pay so dearly for in the shops&mdash;is only 15 to 20 per cent of the retail price.  Surely that it a poor return for the time and effort which farmers must put into their work.  When we consider the poor incomes that have been made available to the farming community over the years, it is no wonder that there is a very rapid <Col N="395" /> decline in the number of people actively engaged in agriculture.</P>
    <P>Looking at the report by Dr. E. A. Attwood of the Rural Economy Division of An Foras Talúntais, we find some very informative tables in regard to the agricultural labour force in general over the period 1951 to 1961. With your permission, Sir, I should like to quote from this report because I feel that if the Department of Agriculture studied these figures and took them into account, they would find that they prove conclusively that there is a very dangerous situation, and that if something is not done as a matter of urgency, it may even be too late to apply remedies.  It is stated in the introduction:</P>
    <P>The following tables give the absolute and percentage changes in the agricultural labour force and its main constituents over the years 1951-61 for the State, the four provinces and each of the twenty-six counties.  They are being circulated to make readily available the precise figure for each county.  The data are derived from the Reports of the Population Censuses of Ireland, 1951 and 1961.</P>
    <P>There are basically three sets of figures:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  The total Agricultural Labour Force by category of worker (i.e. farmers, relatives, agricultural labourers etc.).</P>
    <P>(ii)  Total of Farmers, Relatives and Labourers, according to size of holding.</P>
    <P>(iii)  The number in each of the three main categories of the labour force by size of holding.</P>
    <P>Looking at the first table in this report, we see that there has been a very big decline in the number of people remaining on the land.  The first table gives the total agricultural labour force of farmers and family workers.  Between 1951 and 1961, there was a decline of 10.6 per cent in the number of farmers working on the land.  The figure in 1961 was 210,331 as compared with 235,331 in 1951. Perhaps that figure is not too bad. <Col N="396" /> Perhaps we will be told that these figures are consistent with the figures in other countries where there seems to be a flight from the land, but when we look at the numbers of sons and sons-in-law who left the land during the period, we find them even more distressing.  In 1951, there were 132,895 farmers' sons and sons-in-law actively engaged in whole-time farming, and in 1961, ten years later, that figure had dropped to 80,002, or by 38.9 per cent.  That is a very drastic figure.  We find, too, when we go through this publication, that the number of farms throughout Ireland which have no one to succeed or to carry on farming is quite alarming.  We find also a very sharp decrease in the number of girls or farmers' daughters remaining on the farms of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The reason why these people are leaving the land&mdash;and they are most important to the land&mdash;is the income available to them as a direct result of the agricultural policy of the Government. The number of people on the land is declining for the simple reason that the incomes which farmers are able to earn from their holdings are not capable of maintaining them in a reasonable standard of living.  In present circumstances, it is unreasonable and impossible to expect the younger generation to work on the land.  Therefore, as a matter of urgency, the Government should try to meet the situation by at least listening to the representations made by the various agricultural organisations, be they the ICMSA, the NFA or any other body representing the farming industry. Surely the figures in the Government's statistics are conclusive evidence that these people have a very strong case and putting off the evil day just will not do.</P>
    <P>Last Wednesday, Senator Dr. Ryan said&mdash;and I am quoting from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Thursday, December 15th, 1966:</P>
    <P>... that the NFA was not satisfied with what the Government had done for farmers.  He had the conviction that if another Government was in power they would not be so hard on them.  His experience of farmers' parties was that they flourished for <Col N="397" /> a while but always ended up as Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>The people who composed these parties were always the same.  The NFA was a body which was certainly anti-Government.  He was in favour of having a representative farmers' organisation.  It would certainly make things easier for the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>I certainly do not share Senator Dr. Ryan's views on the NFA, or any other body for that matter.  Any organised group of workers or of any section of the community which was treated by any Government as the present Government have treated both farmers' organisations this year, would have good reason to be anti-Government.  I would hope that the people in the NFA and the ICMSA, in the interests of Irish agriculture and Irish farming, will not be deterred by cheap gibes or allegations that they are anti this or anti that.  I hope that in the interests of themselves and their wives and children, and in the interests of Irish agriculture, they will demand and insist on their right to a reasonable standard of living so that the farming industry can continue and flourish.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan also said that on a valuation of £20 a farmer paid only £7 10s in rates.  I do not know if there are many counties where the rates are less than 40/- in the £ but taking the figure at 40/- and taking into account rebates of one kind or another, farmers pay at least £10 rates on a valuation of £20.  Senator Dr. Ryan's figure, therefore, was too low in that respect.  On this question of rates, many people believe that farmers in general, because of grants and so on, pay very little rates or taxes: the public in general are not aware of the unjust way in which farmers are taxed.  I have no objection to farmers paying rates on buildings, including dwellings, if the urban population must do so but I appreciate that a man in industrial employment pays rates on his home all right but he gets tax abatements and reliefs in respect of his wife and for each of his children under several headings. A farmer, on the other hand, not only pays rates on buildings but he <Col N="398" /> pays rates on every acre of land he owns irrespective of whether the land is flooded, or whether it is good land or bad land.  He gets no allowance in respect of his wife or his children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no allowances in respect of rates, surely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, in proportion to the amount of money a farmer earns, he pays more than his share of taxation through rates. I put it to the Minister that a man working in industry on an income of £7 a week, though he has no family, does not pay any income tax, whereas a farmer with a wife and as many children as you can enumerate will pay rates on his land though the land may be flooded and useless.  In Offaly the land may be flooded throughout the year because of the failure of Bord na Móna to carry out necessary drainage programmes. The entire question of rates is in many cases a myth as far as reliefs to farmers are concerned because when we compare a farmer with an industrial worker the farmer pays more than his fair share.  I should like to ask the Minister to define a creditworthy farmer.  On many occasions we have heard of the capital loans available to farmers if they are creditworthy in the eyes of some of the banks and in particular of the Agricultural Credit Corporation. In reply to a question by Deputy Allen last week the Minister said there was plenty of money available for creditworthy farmers.  Therefore, would the Minister in his reply be good enough to tell us what he terms a creditworthy farmer?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It means a farmer who can pay back the loan.  Has the Senator got enough definitions now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>They are interesting definitions but I should like to hear the Minister's version.  Looking at the Gilmore Survey on Agricultural Credit in Ireland for 1958, on page 3 there is an estimated balance sheet as of 31st December of that year.  The figures will be a little smaller in some cases and a <Col N="399" /> little higher in others than for the corresponding period this year.  We find there that farmers in the Republic of Ireland had assets in land and buildings of £500 million, and livestock, £220 million.  The figure for livestock has increased considerably since 1958 in terms of numbers but the value has certainly decreased.  The figure for machinery was £40 million and crops £25 million.  The 1958 figure in money terms would be more than that for crops in 1966 because the acreage of all crops has dropped considerably and their cash value has not increased sufficiently in the meantime to sustain the overall figure.</P>
      <P>In 1958, Gilmore estimated that Irish farmers had money in credits to a total value of £100 million.  Then we come to the liabilities: land annuities to the Irish Land Commission totalled £40 million and the liabilities to the commercial banks totalled £22 million; the liabilities to merchants and co-operatives totalled £4 million and there is a similar figure in respect of hire purchase.  The figure for loans issued by county councils under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts totalled £3 million and the figure in respect of the Agricultural Credit Corporation was £2.5 million.  That figure has at least doubled since 1958.</P>
      <P>Therefore, total liabilities in 1958 amounted to £75.5 million and total assets were £885 million.  The extraordinary thing about those figures is that in their background the Minister and the Department of Finance tell the country that creditworthy farmers have no trouble in getting loans even from the Agricultural Credit Corporation, yet we find that farmers in Ireland with assets totalling £885 million in 1958 and whose liabilities were only £75.5 million are being turned down so often as being uncreditworthy. They find difficulty in getting loans amounting to a paltry £4 million or £5 million on assets exceeding £800 million.  If the Minister has considered this worthwhile report, surely he will explain why he has not followed its recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Agriculture is being starved for want of credit and farmers are being <Col N="400" /> frustrated when, having read in the papers one day that there is no limit to the credit which creditworthy farmers will get, they find they are turned down as being unworthy of credit when they apply to the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  I hope the Minister will tell the House when he is replying how he assesses farmers' creditworthiness.  I hope he will also tell us the number of loans advanced to farmers and the number of loans refused since the present economic crisis occurred.  One thing I find about all these reports published under Government aegis from time to time is that they hit the headlines before they come out and they are constantly referred to and the public are promised that they will be ready by certain dates.  Yet, after they have been published and everybody has digested the figures, very little action is taken on them.  That is a very great pity.  The farming community, in general, have demonstrated over the years their ability to reach targets and to improve their way of life generally.  They certainly take the prize for being able to survive on such miserable incomes.  I feel with rising prices and the rising cost of production that they are possibly at the end of their tether at present.</P>
    <P>The farming community must have more than lip service from the Government if farmers, as such, are to survive. There is a great disquiet in this country among farmers at present.  I know in my own county very many small farmers, despite the fact that their rates are so small, are finding it increasingly difficult to meet the rate collector.  It is no wonder then that they should protest at their falling incomes which are completely outside their control.  They are constantly advised to produce more and to work harder.  If the Minister for Industry and Commerce asked the people in the industrial sector to produce more and work harder they would understand immediately that if they worked overtime and worked longer hours they would be paid overtime rates.  They would also know that if they produced more, they would more than likely get bonds.  When the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries tells <Col N="401" /> the Irish farmers to produce more and be efficient and diligent there is no such thing as overtime for them because the law of supply and demand tends to act adversely against farmers. If there is an increase of a dozen eggs in the market or extra stock of any description the price tends to fall.</P>
    <P>The Government should get down to tackling as a matter of urgency the very many problems which the agricultural sector of the community have at present.  The least the Government can do is to hear the demands of the farmers and to endeavour to resolve the situation by consultation with the agricultural organisations, both the ICMSA and the NFA.  It is very necessary that the next increase in the price of milk should be on a two-tier system. There is no use whatever in the Government ignoring those people's just demands.  I sincerely hope that the people engaged in fighting a battle for the farmers of Ireland will not be deterred by the glib talk of people who apparently are not really interested in the future of Irish farmers.</P>
    <P>There is just one other thing I should like to mention and that is Macra na Tuaithe.  We have heard it said for many years that there are too many agricultural organisations in this country.  The outstanding agricultural organisation in this country at present is Macra na Feirme.  That organisation was founded early in the 1940's.  They have done a tremendous amount of voluntary work and have made great efforts to bring the standard of Irish farming to the reasonably high level of efficiency in which it is in today.  As a matter of fact, were it not for the efficiency of Irish farmers they would be completely &ldquo;bust&rdquo; years ago.</P>
    <P>In 1956 Macra na Feirme launched the NFA, an organisation specifically designed to look after the economic end of Irish agriculture.  Some years later Macra na Feirme launched Macra na Tuaithe and set it up as the junior arm of that organisation.  It would be a pity now if the control of that organisation were taken from the working farmers of this country.  After all, nobody understands farmers better than the farmers themselves.  Those people <Col N="402" /> have done a great amount of voluntary work and I am glad to see that the Department of Education have more or less returned the grant to Macra na Tuaithe.  I hope the good relations between those organisations will continue through the years ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>The remarks of the representatives from the universities in this debate have necessarily been handicapped by the delay in the appearance of the report of the Commission on Higher Education.  I hope the House will have a full debate when the report appears.  There is one thing certain to me, and I am sure most of us will agree on this, that the best interests of our country depend on the best from our two universities.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, on the topic of the cost of university education, let me correct two misunderstandings about Trinity College.  I thought some years ago that they were past but I have met them again recently in the Press.  One concerns the taxpayers.  The taxpayers will pay TCD something like £827,000 this year, a considerable share of the amount spent on university education. Now, it has been said that a good deal of this money is being wasted on educating students from outside our country.  Let us glance at the figures for a moment or two.  The total number of students in Dublin University, Trinity College, is in round figures, 3,400.  Of those approximately, in round figures, 1,100 are from overseas and 762 are from Northern Ireland.  If one does a simple arithmetical sum one finds that we, the taxpayers&mdash;we are taxpayers as well as legislators&mdash;contribute about £250 for each student in Trinity College, Dublin, whether he comes from Malaya, Nigeria, USA, South America or elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some people will say that that is a regrettable loss, a loss which should be stopped.  Let us consider it for a moment or two.  I am quite certain that each of these students from overseas spends at least £350 a year, probably more, in this country.  As I see it, the net profit to the State is £100 per student.  For every £250 we spend on one of these students £350 is brought into the country.  I am not an expert <Col N="403" /> on those things but, fortunately, the sums are fairly simple in this case. That looks to me like a return of 40 per cent per annum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but he is bringing into the country currency from outside to the value of £350. Surely that is what the tourist trade is doing.  They are trying to bring in money from outside.  The citizens of Dublin are getting something like £350 to £400 per student.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have to think that out.  The Minister will have an opportunity to refute what I am saying later on.  As I see it, if the money we spend on the various&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>Should I, indeed? Let me continue for a little while anyway.  As I see it, there is something like £400 per student coming into the city of Dublin.  That might be an argument for putting more of the cost of Trinity College on the rates of the city of Dublin since most of the money is spent in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>That would not be popular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be popular.  But the expenditure is not a total loss in any sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Besides, there is something more than money at stake here.  Approximately 800 students come from Northern Ireland to the city of Dublin and this is of inestimable value.  They are living in Dublin: they see that we are reasonable people in this part of the country.  Some of them do not believe this until they come here.  They have to be taught.  Trinity College is doing a task of reunification in that way.  We spend money on ambassadors and subsidise various bodies who come here <Col N="404" /> to see how Ireland is developing. Should we grudge this money which is spent in another way?</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise another misunderstanding.  More than two-thirds of the students in the college are from Ireland, and the Government very wisely think that we should receive students from the Six Counties on equal terms.  Connected with this misunderstanding is something which is almost a slander and I must meet it resolutely.  It is the statement that Trinity College encourages a large proportion of students from overseas, that we have a deliberate policy of accepting approximately two-thirds of the students from outside the country.  This is entirely untrue.  I speak as a member of the University body and I know it is untrue.</P>
    <P>Here I welcome the fact that Fine Gael in their recent, admirable statement on their educational policy recognised the state of affairs.  They see that it is the result of a situation which is outside the control of the college.  The simple fact is that there is an ecclesiastical ban which prevents Catholic students coming to Trinity College.  We in the college have no power to alter this.  The aim of the college is to have 90 per cent Irish students.  We could reasonably have ten per cent of students from abroad partly because it is good for the university and partly because we have a duty to various undeveloped nations to give them an opportunity of coming to Ireland to learn what we can teach them intellectually and by way of civilisation.  That would be our desire.  Any suggestion outside that the college wishes to increase the number of overseas students is entirely untrue. In fact what we in the college have imposed on us is a policy of religious apartheid&mdash;a policy which seriously divides our nation.  Such a policy divides our nation.  Need I say that if the very able Minister at present with us could persuade the Government to remove that division and that source of loss of money in our country at present by bringing about a cessation of this ecclesiastical ban, the college would heartily welcome it.  We would be prepared to answer any reasonable questions in relation to possible <Col N="405" /> religious dangers that might exist.  If the Government could deal with this division, they would be doing a very good thing.  It would be ecumenical in the true sense of that word.</P>
    <P>In fact the present proportion of Catholics in Trinity College is 20 per cent.  A large proportion of these come from Britain where, apparently, there is no objection whatever to Catholic students going to Trinity College.  In Ireland there are historical reasons we all know.  But surely these historical reasons should have diminished by 1966.  We are conscious in Trinity College that the taxpayers are partly paying for us.  We know we have a duty.  We want to make it clear, however, owing to external disabilities we cannot fully meet the national demand. We are prohibited from doing so.</P>
    <P>In relation to secondary education, everyone approves of the proposals put forward by the Government recently.  I hope the Government will also take into account the Fine Gael statement.  I should like to make two observations here.  The first is that the primary need in secondary education is for teachers, not for buildings.  I know many of our buildings are out of date.  I heard some of them described as positively Dickensian.  But it is the supply of high quality teachers that will matter.  We many finance buildings but if we do not get the teachers, we are wasting time.  I know that in Leinster House there is strong pressure and demand for more and more buildings, demands for pulling down this building and putting up that one.  I only wish there was an equally strong lobby for the human factor in education.  My appeal is that we should think less in terms of material structures than in terms of teachers.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I may speak through the Minister here to the Minister for Education and say that there are two things we must do.  We must have proper inducements to persuade young students to turn to teaching in this country, not as a last refuge, but as a well-paid vocation.  We should also have more inducements to bring Irish teachers and Irish people generally back from abroad.  It is particularly difficult at present for them to come <Col N="406" /> back.  I speak on this with some emphasis because my son who wanted to come back found it too difficult here and he has gone back again to teach in Britain.  There are hundreds of parents in the same situation.</P>

      <P>As the Chair suggests, I shall pass to another point. The rest of my remarks will be based on three exhibits.  Here I have two pubcations&mdash;there is no need for alarm; they are neither censored nor censorable. The other exhibit is a small collection of Irish postage stamps.  Both of these two publications, one <i>Ireland of the Welcomes</i> and the other the publication of the Office of Public Works <i>Oibre</i>, are a credit to our country. They are finely produced.  Their illustrations are excellent.  The material in them is excellent.  I have praised <i>Ireland of the Welcomes</i> in this House before: I am very happy to praise it again.  It is one of the admirable things that our tourist board have done. I may say, for the interest of Senators, that in this issue of July-August, 1966, we have a very good article on how <Col N="407" /> we got our Irish coinage, which is one of the finest coinages, I think, in existence: it goes back to a Commission of which a Member of this House was Chairman, the late Senator W. B. Yeats.  Similarly, with <i>Oibre</i>, there are wide-ranging articles including one, I notice with great pleasure, on Georgian ceilings, beautifully illustrated and well expressed.  But here we come to a strange contradiction in policy.  In their official publications, the Office of Public Works are praising our beautiful Georgian work.  I note, too, that the Arts Council, which deserves the highest praise for its work, especially in Kilkenny, has been praising and highly valuing our Georgian architecture.  Yet, at this very moment, the Parliamentary Secretary is perhaps making plans for destroying one of the finest areas of Georgian architecutre in our city.  We may, within a few months, see St. Stephen's Green multilated under the auspices of these very people who are producing this splendid and admirable production.  Is that not a lamentable state of affairs?</P>
      <P>Even more lamentable and more destructive to the morale of this country&mdash;we need to preserve our morale as well as any other nation&mdash;is the fact that on this very matter of the threatened destruction of Georgian houses in St. Stephen's Green, the Parliamentary Secretary apparently thought it significant to say and to say it falsely, that those who value Georgian architecture are mostly people with double-barrelled names.  Is it not pitiful, in the year 1966, that that kind of thing should be said, especially when it is blatantly and absolutely untrue?  What has happened is that a group of people, many of them with impeccable Irish names, as they rightly pointed out in the public Press, are trying to defend the beauty and elegance of our capital city which has been threatened with obliteration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the reason for this tragedy? Partly sheer commercial greed.  It will pay a great many builders, architects and others if houses are pulled down and others are put up.  Another source is historical prejudice.  I am sorry to say, against people with double-barrelled <Col N="408" /> names and aliens.  Luckily, Cromwell could not be brought into this particular case, as it would be anachronistic.</P>
    <P>Another of the causes is confusion in Government policy.  I say it is confused policy to praise the beauties of Georgian architecture and Georgian art in an official journal and not to try to protect it, where the Government can, being owners, directly protect it. I shall not emphasise that further.  I could say a great deal.  I feel very deeply about it.  Many people in Ireland do, not from any ex-Ascendancy loyalty because art experts from all over the world, who have no connection with ex-Ascendency people in this country, are prepared to say what I am saying, that many of these are priceless treasures which are being wantonly wasted.  Many of our best statues have been blown to bits by vandals&mdash;the Gough monument in the Phoenix Park, monuments in St. Stephen's Green, the Nelson Pillar.  Our city is being made more commonplace and less historical by the operations of these vandals. Would it not be much worse if Government confusion on policy were to help to this reduction of our fine city to a mere collection of concrete boxes such as one can find in any city from Beiruit to Las Vegas?</P>
    <P>My third exhibit is a collection of Irish postage stamps.  Here again we have every reason to be proud in many ways of what we produce.  There have been some deporable ones: I will give them to anybody who likes to see them &mdash;I have got some here.  Particularly bad, I regret to say, is the one of Leinster House&mdash;a disgracefully drab, badly-designed picture of this Parliament House in honour of the declaration of the Republic, issued, I think, about 1937.  It is one of the worst stamps and we have reason to be cross about this.  But there has been a very great improvement, and I hear welcome rumours that there will be a further radical improvement in the near future in our Irish stamps.  Now I have a special collection of stamps here.  All of the persons were members of Trinity College, Dublin, persons commemorated on Irish postage stamps, and in <Col N="409" /> one case on a Bulgarian postage stamp, oddly enough, because he did himself great honour in the Balkans during the wars there.  All these were members of the college to which I have the honour to belong&mdash;a sorrowful honour in some ways because again and again we have to endure misunderstandings and slanders.  Let me delay the Seanad on this, while I call this honourable roll call&mdash;Wolfe Tone, Thomas Moore, John Redmond, William Rowan Hamilton, Douglas Hyde, Robert Emmet and Thomas Davis.  Next year, I am happy to say, I shall be able to add another name to this list, the name of Dean Swift, whose tercentenary will be celebrated in 1967. I also have here a stamp to commemorate the Gaelic League whose first president was a graduate of our college. In fact other graduates of Dublin University were early supporters of the Gaelic League.  Also I have a stamp here to commemorate the Royal Dublin Society which was founded by some graduates of Dublin University.  I am very happy that our stamps are gradually approaching to the pitch of perfection of our coins.  I am very happy that the future here will soon be even brighter.</P>
    <P>Finally I want to refer, now to one of our most recent stamps, the stamp of Ballintubber Abbey, a beautiful stamp, beautifully designed.  As I look at it, I think of these great abbeys right through our country whose names are like poems&mdash;Athassel, Dunbrody, Holy Cross, Mellifont&mdash;wonderful buildings with wonderful names like a poem now derelict ruins&mdash;why?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>Partly.  These are the very factors which are operating to pull down our Georgian buildings today.  I ask the Seanad to consider <Col N="410" /> that perhaps 200 or 300 years from now, historians may say that in the middle of the 20th century, Dublin, once one of the fine capitals of Europe, began pulling down its historic buildings as the abbeys were pulled down in the 16th century.  If they ask for the reasons, they will find the same reasons and they will deplore them.  It will not be argued then in terms of double-barrelled names or single-barrelled names; it will be argued in terms of people who value our national heritage. I plead with the Government from the sadness of my heart when I look at these ruined abbeys and from a consciousness that I and people like me have to share some of the blame, not quite fairly, for these ruined abbeys&mdash;would our leaders today like to have similar blame attached to their great-great-grandchildren 200 years from now?  I do not think they would.</P>
      <P>There it is.  I see a Europe in which the Turks in Istanbul are busily uncovering with the greatest care those marvellous Christian mosaics in the churches which the Mohammedans hate, because they know they are national treasures.  I hear of the Russians preserving the splendours of the Tzars and of their hated regime. I know that in Greece the Crusader Castles, memorials of conquerors, are being preserved with scrupulous care, and we as tourists are taken to them and proudly told of their history.  And then I see in my own city our own treasures being destroyed.  I appeal to the Minister, by that handsome Ballintubber stamp and by the ideals which I think we all share for our country, not to allow that kind of thing to happen any longer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardMcGlinchey" hpid="Mr. McGlinchey Mr. McGlinchey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week, Senator Garret FitzGerald told us that in his recent visit to Brussels he was surprised to learn that officials there could quote Oireachtas Reports verbatim. I trust that the Senator and the Leader of his Party explained to these officials that the irresponsible statements and speeches made recently by Fine Gael depicting gloom and despondency in this country were insincere and that they were made merely to appeal to the Irish electorate.  I trust <Col N="411" /> the Senator explained to these officials that they should ignore speeches made by the former Leader of Fine Gael and some of his colleagues and that when they speak of this country being bust, they do so merely because they have nothing constructive to say.</P>
      <P>I am not concerned with the destructive speeches that Fine Gael have been making which are for home consumption only.  The Irish people are too well used to them and pay little attention to them, as the results of the by-elections show.  I feel that Fine Gael have a very important part to play in the new Ireland.  They must try to satisfy the officials in Brussels that they can prove themselves an efficient and constructive Opposition capable of taking over the reins of Government, should the whim of the electorate decide.</P>
      <P>It is very important in any country that there should be a strong Opposition but Fine Gael have a lot to learn before they can establish themselves as such and, if they cannot, possibly they should accept the advice given to them in Dáil Éireann last week by a Fianna Fáil Deputy.</P>
      <P>This has been a difficult year for Ireland.  However, when the history of 1966 is written, posterity will judge us by the manner in which the situation was handled.  Ever mindful of the national interest, Fianna Fáil, in the earlier part of this year, took unpopular action in order to stimulate the economy.  Government expenditure was restricted and a serious credit squeeze affected the private sector. Britain's economic difficulties resulted in less money being sent home by Irish people there and, of course, less Irish cattle being bought by the British farmer.  We must not get the impression that this is the only country that has suffered in this way.  The growth rate of western Europe dropped two per cent last year compared with the year before and it is expected that Britain's growth rate this year will be the lowest of any country in western Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish people have demonstrated on two occasions recently their confidence in the Government.  The success <Col N="412" /> of the recent National Loan indicated clearly the people's belief in the future of this country.  One would have imagined that had a by-election occurred in recent months, Fianna Fáil would have been sent to their political limbo.  The people of Waterford and Kerry, however, proved conclusively their admiration for the courageous stand which Fianna Fáil took this year and they, no doubt, compared the situation this year with the situation which arose in the winter of 1956 when we had a similar recession.  They no doubt, admired the stand that Fianna Fáil took and recalled the failure of the Coalition Government in those days to face up to their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>In the spring of 1957, the Coalition Government had an opportunity of introducing something that would alleviate the position but rather than risk becoming unpopular with the electorate, rather than face up to their responsibilities, they resigned.  They deserted the ship of State and in a subsequent election, the people gave them the treatment they deserved.</P>
    <P>The chief occupation of Fine Gael in recent times has been the formulation of new policies and in order to achieve that, they have that so-called economist, Senator Garret FitzGerald, working overtime.</P>

      <P>In so describing Senator FitzGerald, I should, of course, have pointed out that I was not expressing my own opinion but merely quoting from the records of this House &mdash;column 1420 of the Official Report of 23rd March, 1961.  Speaking on that occasion on the Central Fund Bill, Senator O'Quigley had this to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Carter derives great consolation, and indeed illumination, from reading what he refers to as a &ldquo;well-known economist&rdquo;.  The gentleman concerned may be well known but I do not think it is well known that he is not an economist: that he purports to be such.  I should <Col N="413" /> have thought that an economist was somebody like Senator O'Brien or Senator O'Donovan who had a minimum of an M.A. degree or was a Doctor of Economic Science.  That is my conception of an economist. I do not consider a man to be an economist who has got only a B.A. degree in history and Spanish.... That is the sum total of Mr. Garret FitzGerald's qualifications... If somebody is put up as being a specialist, I think it is well that we should enlighten the public as Senator Carter has asked us to do and point out that this man is equivalent to a mercenary soldier, as far as economics is concerned&mdash;a mercenary intellectual.</P>
    <P>I am sorry if, describing Senator FitzGerald as I did, I gave the impression that I was expressing my own viewpoint. I was merely expressing the views of Senator O'Quigley on 23rd March, 1961.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that, for the last year or so, Fine Gael have presented Senator FitzGerald as their leading economist.  He played a prominent part in formulating the &ldquo;Just Society&rdquo;.  He played, I think, a prominent part in their educational plan and they sent him to Brussels.  Buried in the records of this House, however, we find that some of his own colleagues do not hold his qualifications in such high esteem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order.  Did the Senator ever hear of post-graduate experience or experience even in ordinary life?  A course of six years can change the standing of any one of us, including Senator McGlinchey.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not deny that.  Possibly, since 1961, Senator O'Quigley's opinion of Senator FitzGerald has changed.  In recent months, however, we have heard stories about the cloak and dagger in Fianna Fáil, the knives and the tomahawks.  I foresee&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>About nine years ago I attended a public meeting at home, a meeting which launched the NFA in my county. I was very pleased then that at long last the farmers had a strong organisation to look after their interests.  I believed this new body would make agriculture a more rewarding business by encouraging economic production and efficient selling.  I believed the purpose in forming the NFA was to encourage farmers to use their initiative and stimulate agricultural productivity.</P>
      <P>I submit now that the NFA have failed to grasp the golden opportunity that was presented to them.  Their only contribution to Irish agriculture has been to criticise, to moan at and belittle the efforts of the Government to help the Irish farmer.  It is high time the rank and file of the NFA realised that their leaders could play a more effective role than they are playing in Irish agriculture and I am convinced that the main reason why the protest marches have taken place was in order to camouflage the inactivity of the leaders of the NFA and to give members the impression that they were acting in their interests.  One has only to study the personnel of the NFA leaders in Donegal to realise that their interests are far removed from the interests of the small farmer.  A study of the list of participants in the march from Donegal to Dublin reads like a New Year's Honours List.  Not since Red Hugh O'Donnell marched to Kinsale to teach the Corkment how to fight did so many soldiers march out of Donegal at the one time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>I was a little before their time.  I can never understand why so many members of the NFA are prepared to listen to farmers preaching, farmers who are not able to run their own farms.  I think of the Secretary of the NFA at home, who never fails to grasp an opportunity <Col N="415" /> to criticise the Government; for years and years he has been letting the greater part of his farm.  I submit the Land Commission have failed in their duty in not taking over that farm years ago and giving it to someone who is prepared to work it.</P>
      <P>The Chairman of the NFA in Donegal may be an expert on Papal Encyclicals but any farmer who stands up publicly, as he did in my presence, and claimed that he could only make £3 per acre on potatoes should be compelled, in my opinion, to go to an agricultural college.</P>
      <P>While I disagree with the approach of the NFA, I cannot deny that the problems of the small farmers in the west and north-west are very serious indeed.  I do not think this Government, or any Government, can possibly find a satisfactory solution to their problems.  The decentralisation of agricultural administration may be a little help.  The Government should be encouraged by the success of the BTE offices in the various counties. There is a number of pilot schemes in the west and experiments will continue, through trial and error, until some day some form of solution will be found.</P>
      <P>I should like to see an experiment along the following lines: a farmers' co-operative with a reasonable State subsidy invested in a model farm somewhere in the west.  This would encourage better farming and provide pedigree stock.  Possibly officials of the Department of Agriculture could be housed in the area.  Above all, a pool of agricultural machinery should be formed for the benefit of small farmers in the district.  Small farmers of 30, 35 and 40 acres are crippled by their investment in agricultural machinery, some of which is used for only a few weeks in the year.  Some system should be devised whereby small farmers would be discouraged from investing money in tractors and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Quigley should not test me on this.  I knew what was going on in this House on 23rd March, 1961.  I should like to say a few words about milk, a subject which has been topical during the last few months.  Should Ireland and England enter the European Economic Community in 1970 the dairy farmers will have a golden opportunity and milk will be in great demand.  In the last 20 years the British and Six County farmers have been heavily subsidised in regard to milk production. I recall that 15 years ago when the British farmers were receiving 4/-a gallon for milk they were not satisfied. It is generally believed that when these subsidies are withdrawn the bottom will fall out of the dairy industry in Britain and this country, if it is geared for it, should then come into its own as far as the dairy industry is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In England payment for milk is on a gallonage basis plus premiums for quality and good buyers <i>et cetera,</i> but the minimum requirement is three per cent butter fat content and 8.5 solid set fat.  Anyone whose milk is under this is liable to prosecution.  In this country the farmer is paid on a butter fat basis, apart from the milk that goes into the creamery butter industry, and the remainder is channelled to <Col N="417" /> manufacturers.  The milk that is bought at 4.5 per cent butter fat has to be standardised with skim or brought back to three per cent for manufacturing purposes.  This is an uneconomic way of dealing with it because paying for butter fat means, in the winter time especially, more intensive feeding.  Therefore, I should like to see the Department of Agriculture reviewing the payment method for milk in relation to butter fat and comparing it with the system which is in operation in England so that when we do enter the Common Market the farmers may be able to compete, as I feel they will be, very successfully with the British dairy industry.  Senator McDonald referred to farmers' income and on a number of occasions recently the NFA have claimed that on average this is £5 per week.  I maintain that their method of calculation was completely wrong.  I claim that they selected the income for the entire agricultural population and that instead of keeping to the farmer or householder himself they divided the figure by the father, mother and all the children and their average figure then was £5 per head.  This does not represent the income of the farmer himself but is a division between his entire family.</P>

      <P>The new plan for education has been welcomed throughout the country and I should like to say a few words about one aspect of it, the vocational schools.  It is the intention of the Minister for Education that the character of the vocational schools should be maintained but I feel that with the new emphasis being placed on secondary education, secondary school authorities will attempt to push out many of the vocational schools. In my own county I have evidence of secondary school authorities discouraging the spread of vocational <Col N="418" /> schools.  It is very important that for the next few years vocational committees should be maintained in each county to protect the interests of these technical schools.</P>

      <P>The position is that the Chair has suggested that there would be a more fruitful debate on the question of education when the motion is taken in the New Year and when the Minister for Education is present.

      <P>The easiest way out is not to talk about it at all.  I was disappointed that the White Paper on Health did not include any reference to a restriction on the use of private beds in county hospitals.  I do not know if this situation applies in every county, I know that the problem exists in some county hospitals, but in my county a new county hospital was opened about six years ago and specialists were paid a reasonable salary and four private beds per specialist were thrown in. Private beds in local authority institutions <Col N="419" /> should be done away with and specialists should be paid a sufficient salary to avoid this, let it be £5,000 or £7,500; if they are working pay them. The position at the moment is that higher income group patients can be told that a local authority institution is under no obligation to have them treated, that the hospital has been provided for the lower income and middle income groups.  That is the position on paper but does not apply in practice.  I have had evidence on many occasions that middle and lower income group patients suffer simply because they cannot afford to pay, or are not prepared to pay, as private patients.  If one of them wishes to have an operation he is told that if he will become a private patient and is prepared to pay the specialist fees he will be admitted immediately and that otherwise he will have to await his turn.  I have had evidence on many occasions that people anxious to go to the clinic to see a specialist eventually ended up by going to his private rooms as private patients because they were not prepared to wait.  If specialists of this kind wish to treat private patients they should provide their own nursing homes.  It is not right that tax and ratepayers should provide rooms in county hospitals and pay nursing staff to look after patients who are paying these specialists from 30 to 50 guineas each.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to say a few words on the small industries plan announced by the Minister for Industry and Commerce last week.  Unfortunately, at present it applies only to a number of counties where a certain amount of industry already exists.  On many occasions I have advocated greater encouragement for small businessmen in the west and north-west and, I suppose, in any part of rural Ireland.  Development associations, and chambers of commerce tend to lay too much emphasis on the attraction of large industries to rural Ireland.  While their objective may be desirable it is very difficult to persuade large industrialists to come to counties such as mine.  The only alternative for the <Col N="420" /> workers there is to emigrate.  Any businessman who can employ two, three, five or six more people should get financial assistance to do so.  Up to now targets have been to get employment for 50, 100 or 150 but particularly on the western seaboard or in the small towns and villages, if efforts were made to entice just a few, progress could be made.</P>
    <P>Two years ago the county development teams were formed in different parts of Ireland.  These consist of the county manager, the county engineer, the chairman of the county council, the county CEO, county MOH.  As Chairman of Donegal County Council I have been a member of the Donegal development team for some time. There is a full-time secretary who is doing excellent work carrying out surveys and researches, etc.  But when these surveys are completed and the research work over, that development team, I feel, will be banging its head against a stone wall unless some provision is made and there is some allocation of moneys to these teams so that they can use this to encourage people to go into business that will give employment. There is no reason why the development team could not have a small, experimental fund and have the power to go to business people in their county and say to them: &ldquo;You are employing three people at present.  If we give you a grant of £500 to buy certain machinery you might be able to employ two more.  We shall give you that grant and see what happens.&rdquo; These development teams will fail unless they get some incentive in this direction because the provision of industry in remote parts will be very difficult.  The secretary of the development team has a golden opportunity to show the counties in the west that he can do something however small to help employment there.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach, in his recent statement, said that our economy has shown an improvement and that our adverse trade balance would be greatly improved at the end of 1966.  It is gratifying to know that and I am sure it pleases everybody that <Col N="421" /> our country is sound economically but it is disturbing to read some statistics and learn that while we exported many more cattle up to August, 1966, their value was £1 million less than in the corresponding period last year.  We all know that if people had any luck on their side they had it by getting out of their cattle before August because it was since August that the big fall in the value of cattle took place.  I am quite sure that at the end of December the loss, compared with the corresponding period of 1965, will run into at least £2 million even though the number of cattle exported may be higher.</P>
      <P>This has been the cause of the agitation by the NFA.  My view of the NFA is that it is a well-organised body. They have leaders and branches; they have good contact with each other and I believe a Minister of State should meet that organisation and treat it just as the Minister for Industry and Commerce has to deal with trade unions.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="423" /> Anyone who has an idea of economics will agree that increases in wages should follow increases in production. We have been told that time and again. The Taoiseach told us that no demands should be made for an increase in wages until the increase in production came.  Here in Ireland, what happens? Nothing is done to control the cost of living.  Since the tenth round was paid, various items have been increased, for instance, bacon and flour.  Although the Government have made an Order that there is to be no increase in the price of bread and flour, the shops are already charging the increase for bread and the millers are refusing to give flour to the shopkeepers.</P>
    <P>On my way to Dublin this morning, I went to a shopkeeper and there was a traveller there from one of the big flour companies.  He refused to sell flour at the old price.  If someone came to Leinster House today with a placard protesting against the increase in the price of bacon or in the price of bread, he would find himself in the Bridewell in a few moments.  In spite of the Order that has been made by the Government, the millers have their travellers on the road refusing to sell flour to the shopkeepers unless they pay the increased price.  I was a witness to that happening this morning; yet we do not find the millers on their way to prison.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>There should be only one type of citizen in this country, the citizen who obeys the law, and anybody who disobeys the law should get his trip to Mountjoy.  The shopkeepers have jumped in and put up the price of bread.  We have a Prices Advisory Body and it is a laughing stock.  When they came into being, the first thing they said was: &ldquo;We must reduce the price of bread by 1d or 2d; we must reduce the pint by 1d.&rdquo;  They sat down for a few days and then said: &ldquo;No; we made a mistake.  Put them up again.&rdquo;  That is the only thing I ever saw the Prices Advisory Body doing since they came into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="424" /> They have taken no action as regards the price of bacon which went up 2d a 1b. recently.  They should take action in such cases.</P>
    <P>There has also been the increase in electricity charges.  The ESB can pay big dividends; yet they put up our charges.  When they came into the rural areas to give us electricity, their canvass was: &ldquo;The more who take electricity the cheaper it will be,&rdquo; whereas the opposite has happened. I agree they have done good work through rural electrification, but if it is a company that is paying well, it should not increase the cost to the consumer, thus sparking off an eleventh round of wage increases.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party were very glad to see the appointment of a Minister for Labour.  We hope that in the near future as a result of having a Department of Labour we shall have better industrial relations than we have had during the past year.  I hope the new Minister will make management realise that they have their duties as well as their rights, that they should change their tactics and show a sense of responsibility.  There are cases in our own county of employers who have refused point blank to meet the officials of the Labour Court.  There are other cases in our county where they have refused to implement the recommendations of the Labour Court, and nothing has been done about it.  As long as we have employers with that mentality, we shall always have industrial difficulties and strikes.  Strikes are bad and no one suffers more from them than the worker.  No one wants strikes less than the worker and management has been as much at fault and more at fault than the workers during the past few years.</P>
    <P>The Government must take action to try to reduce the causes of industrial unrest.  I am sure that every good trade unionist would welcome reforms in our trade union law so that the workers would lose less time, lose less money and would not be forced to take action which is detrimental to themselves and their families.  If the Minister is about to introduce a new <Col N="425" /> code of trade union law, I would advise him strongly to get in touch with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and to draw up his reforms in full agreement with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Federated Union of Employers.  If he is reasonable something may be done to obviate much of the industrial unrest we have had in the past.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of talk about our entry into the EEC.  Because of the Taoiseach's visit to London, I have decided to make no reference to it.</P>
    <P>Our rate of progress in housing has been absolutely deplorable.  It is almost impossible for local authorities to get plans through and to secure finance to build houses.  The recent housing survey in Westmeath was the subject of a Dáil Question by Deputy Crinion and also of a leading article in the <i>Westmeath Examiner</i>.  The Minister's reply was that the survey showed there were in Westmeath 554 dwellings unfit for human habitation.  Of these 458 were incapable of being made fit for habitation at a reasonable cost, and 96 were capable of repair.  Of that 458, a total of 326 families were regarded as being eligible for rehousing by the local authority.  The survey, which was made by officials of Westmeath County Council, was compiled with care.  It showed that the weekly income of 69 families living in these houses&mdash;and, as the leading article says, one hesitates to use the word &ldquo;living&rdquo;&mdash;was less than £3.  If people with such incomes are to be rehoused, they cannot be charged more than 1/- a week for these houses.  The other day we had four new rural houses opened in Tyrrells-pass. The rent for a person with an income of £4 a week is 10/- and for a person with an income of £15 a week 69/-.  That is our position in Westmeath, and I am sure it is more or less the same in every other county.</P>
    <P>In our county at present there is no money to pay supplementary grants, no money for reconstruction, for new houses, for water and sewerage.  Up to a few days ago there was no money for SDA loans.  Westmeath County Council committed themselves to the <Col N="426" /> extent of £4,000 for reconstruction work.  They approached the bank for a loan for this amount but were refused. Today someone was given the definition of a creditworthy farmer.  If he asks for the definition of a creditworthy council, it is a council that does not need a loan.</P>
    <P>No one was surprised that the recent National Loan was fully subscribed. If you looked for another £25 million in the morning at a rate of 7½ per cent, it would be fully subscribed again. The people with money are delighted to get a gilt-edged security at 7½ per cent, but the people looking for SDA loans will not have one penny in such a loan.  In a few days' time the rate for SDA loans will definitely exceed eight per cent.  When that happens, I can see a closing down of all private house building.  The average family could not afford a loan of a couple of thousand pounds at eight per cent.  The people who build houses are usually people thinking of getting married or who are newly married.  There are difficulties about loan repayments in many counties at present, even though the rate is one per cent cheaper than what it will be next year.</P>
    <P>Last year we spent two or three days debating health services and we were assured there would be an improvement in the near future.  But the Minister was changed to Education, and he has everyone talking education now.  I am afraid it will be a vicious circle.  When they get tired talking about education, he will be changed to Local Government and he will bring them all back to housing. There is general disappointment at the lack of progress in improving the Health Act.  I hope the new Minister will do something effective.  In general, we agree with what is in the White Paper, but we want to see it implemented. There is no attempt to do so at present.</P>
    <P>We will be coming into a difficult period after Christmas.  With free education for all, the new Budget is bound to bring shocks.  I suppose the old sources of revenue&mdash;beer, spirits and tobacco&mdash;will just go up again. I predict also there will be an increase <Col N="427" /> in the turnover tax, and this will affect the people seriously.  There is also the indirect taxation the Minister spoke about.  It is alarming to read of the number of fines being collected for parking offences at present.  It is most unjust to impose these fines in the conditions we have in Dublin today.  No provision has been made for proper parking.  We have St. Stephen's Green, Mountjoy Square and Fitzwilliam Square.  If the Government were really serious about creating space for parking, they would bulldoze all of these out of it and provide parking.  It is absolutely necessary that parking be provided in the city.  There is no use creating it out in the Phoenix Park.</P>

      <P>First of all, I should like to turn to agriculture.  Perhaps, it would be no harm at the start to express my opinion on the more publicised part of the NFA controversy with the Government&mdash;the affair in Merrion Street.  It has happened.  I do not think it should have happened.  I shall content myself with saying that.  I am <Col N="429" /> quite prepared to admit that there were considerable faults on both sides.  I hope that from all sides, that of the Government, the NFA and any other farmers' organisation, we shall not have any repetition of such an affair.  I do not think it does anybody any good. There must be some other way of dealing with such matters.</P>
      <P>The tragedy of the whole affair&mdash;and I do not think the Government realise it&mdash;is that 90 per cent of the farmers realised then and realise now that there is no immediate relief or way of overcoming the recent drop in cattle prices. I do not think nor does any farmer expect that the Government could have overcome the sudden drop in cattle prices in the last three, four or five months.  What they want to see are plans for a more steady income in the future.  I am sure exaggerated demands were made at that time and are still being made possibly by both sides again.  I think something should be done as to long term plans for agriculture in future.  Not knowing what you are going to get two or three months ahead for cattle will create very great uncertainty not alone among small farmers but big farmers, too.</P>
      <P>A few years ago on this Bill I remember suggesting that a strong case could be made for a two-tier price for pigs&mdash;that the first so many pigs a farmer brought to the factory should be registered and that he should get a higher price for them.  That was directed towards making some improvement in the lot of the small farmer.  At that time, if not later, I think I said that I saw no future at all for the very small farmer of 25 or 20 acres and very little future for farmers with even larger farms, particularly in relation to poorish land unless something like the two-tier price system were put into operation.  We will have to ask ourselves if it is nationally economic to have these small farms at all or whether it is simply a socioeconomic exercise to keep them there. In the present position I know that it takes a very comfortable little farm to produce anything like the wages of a roadworker&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>And that is not much. That does not mean 5½ or 5 days a week.  It means seven days.  Personally, I think he has a better life but it takes a lot of doing to persuade a small farmer with a very small income that he has a better life than a man in Dublin or elsewhere with £20 or £25 a week.  However, we shall have to make up our minds whether we can do this thing and support small farms in some way.  Until industry employs the population possibly we must support them and encourage them in some way on the small farms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Final Stages of the Land Bill were going through I remember saying that in our lifetime and in the political lifetime of the Minister for Lands the size of an economic farm had jumped from 30 to 45 acres as it is supposed to be now.  I have no doubt before a lot of people here leave the political field it will have gone up to 100 acres.  Is there not a terrific amount of waste at present or is it a socioeconomic exercise we should carry on until some time in the future?  It is a very big problem and I think the farmers themselves should be taken in on such a survey or examination.  There would seem to be, all the time, subsidies to farmers or some subvention to carry them over the present difficulty but it is a difficulty when you see, as I have seen, a small farmer bringing out cattle and getting £10 and £12 less than he got for those same cattle this time last year.  It is probably happening to the larger farmer also. He has had to face an increase in wages, divided in two parts, over the past 12 months.  I remember often reading that when an increase in wages was given by the British farmer, an offset was given to him: perhaps a fraction more per barrel for wheat or barley, a fractional increase in the fixed price of cattle, or the subsidy on cattle, and various things all down along the line but there was no increase, I could see, to compensate the farmer here in any way for having to pay increased wages.  I admit those wages are not too high but there was no corresponding <Col N="431" /> increase in the farmers' incomes.  Hence it is not an encouragement to the farmer to keep his men on the land.</P>
    <P>People may say the farmer is always looking for a subsidy or grant for this, that or the other.  I would point out that when the British Government put a levy on the industrial produce from this country some 12 months or so ago, the Government here and, I think, the people generally faced up to that fact and met them in no small way.  I do not know what was the amount but they did pay up to half the amount of that levy on goods being exported to England.  I should like to know&mdash;perhaps the Minister could tell us&mdash;how much that amounted to.  But that was given to industry and, on the whole, when the cost of living has gone up, the Government have fairly and reasonably met the wage-earner by a ninth, tenth or other round wage increase. On the whole, the wage-earner has been met reasonably, considering our economic position, but have the farmers had that reasonable treatment other branches have had?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>That was just one point I was coming to.  I have been in cattle marts myself and I should like an explanation of it because, when the ordinary farmer went to his cattle mart &mdash;even though he was only a spectator&mdash;from July to December, he could not decide for himself from the the prices at these cattle marts when the subsidy had gone on or when it had come off.  If you can show me, even on the Dublin cattle mart, that there was any spectacular rise in prices when the subsidy increased&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>Those cattle have to be fed.  That is the position as the ordinary farmer sees it throughout this country.</P>
      <P>On that point, I should like to tell the House of an answer the Northern Ireland Minister for Agriculture, Mr. West, gave to a query in the Northern Commons.  A speaker there was asking what would be the position of their, I think, three meat exporting factories&mdash;I suppose, on the hoof&mdash;if those three factories had been in the Republic. Apparently he had the figures and said they would have got a subsidy for the meat they sent out over the past six months, of £141,000, had they been in the Republic, but, he said, up in Northern Ireland that £141,000 has been distributed to the producers of the cattle that went into those factories&mdash; those same cattle.  That is what the ordinary farmer here cannot follow at all.  This subsidy has gone to factories and the farmers feel they have not got the advantage of it.  We have had this big increase in the dead meat trade this year&mdash;and no doubt very substantial amounts have gone to those plants in subsidies&mdash;but the farmer feels it has not come to him.  If we had a system whereby anything like that was paid direct to the farmer, as opposed to paying it to someone between the farmer and the market, it would be a much more satisfactory position.</P>
      <P>I do not think the country as a whole would object to greater support for the small farmers if that has to be, as they did not object to substantial grants to assist industry in its times of trouble.  In that respect, I should like to quote a proverb I heard an Indian use at one time&mdash;that the whole body bends to take a thorn from a foot.  The whole country would have supported, and would support, assistance to the small farmers in any way possible to make their lot a little easier.</P>

      <P>The difficulty they are in at the present time&mdash;lack of money.</P>
      <P>There is another point also&mdash;the farmer feels that agricultural produce is not marketed properly when it goes across the water, at least, the meat side of it.  I should like to check with the Minister that the subsidy paid&mdash;it does not matter where the money came from&mdash;on carcase beef going out of the country had no regard for quality at all?</P>

In other words, it pays me to produce top quality beef, if I can.  It is judged on the hoof.  It is very important, when our beef is being exported on the hook, to have it carefully graded and stamped, if possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>No; it has to be graded elsewhere on the hoof.  Cattle which go out on the hook should be carefully graded and stamped so that the butchers in England will know that if we say it is A1, or whatever it may be, it is first-class.  The image of Irish meat in England is bad because we have not succeeded in grading to that extent.  I have heard reports at various times that butchers in England were told that certain beef was Irish beef, <Col N="434" /> and that it was not good.  Sometimes it is good and sometimes it is bad.  People in the cattle trade have told me&mdash;and I can only take their word for it&mdash;that first-class Irish bullocks and heifers are shipped across to Scotland, are killed there immediately, and sent to Smith-field as prime Scottish beef.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>We could get a far better price, and get a far better image of our beef put across on the English market with a little more care.  Possibly the Government, the exporters and the farmers should look into the whole matter.  Possibly the first step should be a Government White Paper or statement on their long-term policy in these matters.  After some time had elapsed to allow it to be discussed and examined by the various organisations of farmers and exporters, meetings should be held to explain the long-term view on getting the produce properly marketed and getting a reasonably steady price.  If a farmer could know within reason what he would get for a ten cwt. beast at any time of the year, he would be a lot safer and would feel a lot more secure on his land.</P>
      <P>It must have been difficult for the previous Minister for Agriculture, and it must be difficult for the present Minister for Agriculture, to have two farming organisations in this country. If the leaders of those organisations cannot get together and produce a generally approved plan of their own, the rank and file of the organisations should see to it that a meeting is held, and present to the Minister and the country one organisation speaking for the farmers.  It is a great loss to the farmers that they cannot speak with one mind to the Government or to anyone else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have now sent a deputation from the Department to the USA to purchase <Col N="435" /> some Aberdeen Angus bulls and females. I am sorry that they did not bring some breeders from this country with them as part of that deputation in order to make the breeders an official part of it.  The breeders have a fair idea of the type of cattle they want. I know the Department think they have too.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope they will avail of them.  Some of the older men in the Department now admit that they themselves ruined the Aberdeen Angus breed in this country some years ago by insisting on a small thin-boned animal.  That was the only type of animal that could get a premium from the Department.  That is many years ago now but, in any case, it took many years for them to recover from that policy of the Department.  I am sure that will not happen in future.</P>
      <P>I should like now to deal with an important point which is completely divorced from agriculture.  Over the past few years, grants towards the expenses of delegates to Europe and other places have become very important in our annual expenditure, particularly delegates to the Council of Europe meetings.  In future, we hope they will be going to EEC meetings. It is very important that we should play our part in these negotiations, and particularly at meetings of the Consultative Assembly.  For several reasons we should be regularly and well represented at these meetings. This is important, first of all, because we would be one of the smallest nations probably, financially and numerically, and as far as the others there are concerned, we are a predominantly agricultural country.  We would have transport problems which would not arise in the case of most of the other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a great many sides to the work of the Council of Europe and it is growing very fast and growing very detailed.  A great many of the matters are purely secretarial ones, carried out by a secretariat staff both <Col N="436" /> here and in Europe, but there are a great many things which the elected representatives of the people should be in on and take an active part in.  I am sure the administrative and advisory work is done by a secretariat, but originating work and proposals for the first time would probably come from the elected representatives of the various member countries.</P>
    <P>In that respect I should like to quote a short passage from a small book which all of us got.  It is called <i>Man in a European Society</i>.  On page 9 it is stated:</P>
    <P>Within the limits of the Statute, the Assembly will hence in future be much more closely associated in a parliamentary manner with the intergovernmental work of the Council, and the direct knowledge and experience of the needs of the people of Europe, which is characteristic of elected representatives in Parliament, will be drawn upon more fully in dealing with the practical problems which present themselves to man in a European Society.</P>
    <P>It is very important that people who are sent as delegates should be fully conversant with the work&mdash;and it is no light matter&mdash;and give their full time to that work.</P>
    <P>It will be very difficult to achieve that for a Dáil Member or even a Seanad Member, but particularly for a Member of the Dáil who would be taking on perhaps every year the most troublesome work at meetings in Strasbourg or wherever they may be and&mdash;this being the most difficult point &mdash;neglecting the small, day-to-day, petty but probably vote-catching details of his constituency.  What is the position of such a Dáil Member to be? He has no security there.  He may feel: &ldquo;I must not spend my time too much in Europe; I have a constituency to look after.&rdquo;  He will not know when the next election may be&mdash;in a week, a month, a year or five years&mdash;and he will be appointed always with the threat that if he looks after his European interests, he may neglect his work at home, may neglect his own <Col N="437" /> constituency with the risk that he will lose his seat at the next election; and the Party and the Government here will lose a person whom they might consider a very good man.</P>
    <P>I wonder is there a case&mdash;it is a matter that will have to be examined in the future, if not in the near future for appointing parliamentary delegates to the Council of Europe for a longer term than the life of a Government in this country.  They might be appointed for eight years or ten years or whatever it may be and, provided they have the confidence of their own Parties year after year, in some way they might retain their seats in their own Parliament during that time in much the same way as the Ceann Comhairle does now.  Some form of tenure of that kind should be studied.  It would be a constitutional matter and when we are considering changes in the Constitution, some loophole for some such change in membership of delegates to the European Assembly should be left in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I should like to express support for what Senator Garret FitzGerald said about Members of the Dáil and Ministers from the point of view of payment. I agree they are not sufficiently paid &mdash;either Ministers or ordinary Members of the Dáil&mdash;for the time they have to spend not alone in the city but in various parts of the country to the neglect of their professions or businesses.  I advocated before and do so again that Dáil Members and Ministers should be better remunerated.</P>

      <P>We are here discussing a Bill which was introduced on the &ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;day of December, 1966&rdquo;. Obviously there were some queer circumstances surrounding the birth of this Bill because the date of its introduction does not appear on it.  I have never seen it happen before and it highlights for me the failure of the Government to give to this House the proper chance, as has happened repeatedly, to discuss legislation of this kind.  We were promised here last spring or early summer that the new changes in the ordering of the financial business of the Dáil would be such as to enable this House to discuss it <Col N="438" /> at some length without being confined by time or other circumstances.</P>
      <P>As in the case of other promises made in respect of legislation, like the Local Elections Bill, the Government have failed to redeem the promises and I protest most vigorously against that failure of the Government.  Of course I know quite well that the Minister for Finance has no regard whatever for what this House&mdash;I or any other Member of this House&mdash; may say.  He has displayed that same attitude on several occasions and I shall have something later on to say about the disrespect which Members of the Government have for institutions of this State, for law and order.  If the Minister for Finance thinks that conduct of that kind, this sort of jackeen attitude, is all right in the Houses of Parliament, there are very few people, even in his own Party, who admire him for it.</P>
      <P>I wish to say something about the administration of Government, which this Appropriation Bill entitles me to say.  It is infrequently that we have an opportunity of passing any kind of judgment on the general conduct of Government administration.  During the past number of years, the conduct of the Government leaves a great deal to be desired.  The conduct of the Government should be beyond reproach: a Government should set the example and the standard so that every Minister of the Government and the Government as a whole should be paragons of all the political virtues which we are entitled to expect.</P>

      <P>If the chief heckler of the Fianna Fáil Party in the Seanad wishes, I shall deal with that.  If you want to talk about factories in this country I can point out that when the Industrial Development Authority was established in this House Deputy Lemass, who was then Shadow Minister for Industry and Commerce, said that if he ever got back to Government he would repeal the Act which established that Authority.  He also said he would repeal the Industrial Grants Act.  This is reported in volume 166, columns 94, 95 and 96 of the Official Report.  He said that if he ever got back and became a member of the Government he would repeal that Act too.  He said the same about the Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1956 which first gave income tax exemption in relation to industries.  He said he would repeal that Act as well. Those are three Acts which foreign economists, about whose standard there is no question, point to as being the Acts responsible for the big thrive in industrial exports from this country.</P>

      <P>The Industrial Grants Act was passed in 1956 and its effects became apparent in 1957, 1958 and 1959.  When those Acts are gone the Government have nothing to put in their place.  I do not know of any single piece of legislation which the Government have passed in the last ten years <Col N="442" /> which would continue what was given in any of those Acts.  The three Acts I have mentioned were of great advantage. If the Senator wants to continue looking over his shoulder like Lot's wife I do not mind because I can point out what was achieved in the days of the inter-Party Government.  I can point to the fact that we wiped out TB which was a dreaded scourge in the 1940s.  We did this when Dr. Browne took office.  When people in this country could not get a bed in a hospital in Ireland the Fianna Fáil Government were prepared to fly Constellations across the Atlantic.</P>

      <P>There is great perturbation and great agitation on the other side.  There is great perturbation among the people of this country about the standards of morality that are developing in Government circles. When I speak about this I speak with due deliberation and after great investigation. I have checked and sifted out what I have been told.  I place great reliance on the people who told me this but I cannot disclose who they are.  I cannot disclose the confidence which was given to me in regard to the matter to which I shall now refer. But the new standard of morality of Government Ministers in this country is that if you want to get the particular grants, or the loan of the quota, you have got to pay for it.  What is happening now, a Leas-Chathaoirleach, is a profound scandal which it would be very difficult to expose because the person who gives equally with the person who takes falls guilty, but Fianna Fáil supporters have told me, and I have no reason to doubt it&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are, in modern legislation, quite a number of statutes which give powers to Ministers. We have all deplored from time to time the fact that more and more of the powers which ought to reside in the courts, or which are properly to be exercised by persons of an independent standing, are being vested in Ministers of State.  The draft framers of the Constitution were alive to the possibilities of the misappropriation of Government funds when, in the Constitution, they provided for the creation of an officer called the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The people of this country, in enacting the Constitution and in continuing it in its present form recognise the frailty of human nature. recognise that, in a parliamentary democracy such as ours, there are opportunities for misappropriation of public funds, either wilfully or through neglect.  We in this country have recently seen the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General pointing out the misappropriation of public moneys, and that is something which we must all deplore.  There are other malpractices in government that may arise for which the Constitution as at present drafted provides no effective defence or remedy and the rules of this House prevent me from dealing with these any further.</P>
      <P>Another of the characteristics which I would expect to find in a Government is that they would be fair and equitable in their treatment of all citizens and it is, of course, provided in our Constitution that all citizens as human persons shall be equal before the law, but I find from my own experience, and it is an experience shared by a great number of people in this country that equitable treatment is not meted out by the present Government to all citizens and again it comes down to this, that if you know somebody or if you know somebody who knows somebody, you can get what you want but if you do not, you are left out in the cold and deprived of your statutory and constitutional rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The mentality is developing in this country, and we must absolutely deplore it, that you cannot get anything <Col N="446" /> nowadays, whether from a local authority or the central government authority unless you know somebody. That feeling is widespread and it is a feeling which is engendered in the members of the public and public corporations and private companies by members of the present Government and you have spurious applications and quite unnecessary applications being made to Government Departments and Government Ministers by members of the public for the purpose of obtaining grants to which people are entitled, sent up so as to make the people seeking the grants believe that because they know somebody in the Government Party and because they are friendly with them, they can get it and therefore these people subsequently feel under an obligation to Deputies and Senators and county councillors of the Government Party for getting things which they are entitled in law to obtain.</P>
    <P>That is a system which is being fostered by the present Government and it is to be found in all its legislation. The prospect of people feeling that they must kowtow to members of the Government Party in order to get their legal rights is one which appals me, especially when we consider in this year of the fiftieth anniversary of the 1916 revolution that the men who went into the GPO and suffered subsequently up to 1922 fought so that we could all be free in a truly free Ireland. That is not the position at the present time.  One has only, at election times, to travel in the aftermath of the Fianna Fáil Party machine to meet quite intelligent people who believe that if they vote against Fianna Fáil they will be able to find out about it and they will lose their pensions, their unemployment relief or will not get the work on the roads.  That is as common today as unemployed and social welfare recipients are common in this State of ours and it is not something which the Fianna Fáil Party should be proud of or which the Fianna Fáil Party should try to laugh off in this Chamber.</P>

If one wants the written proof of that lack of respect which the Fianna Fáil Government have for the ordinary people, one can find it in many of their pieces of legislation. In the present Criminal Justice Bill, we have one of the latest instances of it.  We find that what we deplore in South Africa and in the totalitarian States is in a Bill in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>So much for the sins of the present Government.  It will take a great deal of contrition and a firm purpose of amendment on their part to wipe them out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want now to turn to another aspect <Col N="450" /> of the Government's administration. One of the outstanding features of the Government and their immediate predecessors, the Government under the late Taoiseach, Deputy Seán Lemass, and his predecessor, is that they have abandoned the power of government to the civil servants.  Effective decisions are being taken not by Ministers but by civil servants.  These decisions are not the decisions that would be taken if we had Ministers who were properly applying such intelligence and experience as they have to the problems with which the country is confronted. Notwithstanding all the gadding about, all the inspections of opening pits, all the presentations of prizes and the like, the Ministers of the Government are out of touch with public opinion.  They cannot read the signs and I have no intention of interpreting them for them.</P>
    <P>They are out of touch with public opinion.  One has only to look at the allegedly brilliant Succession Bill brought in by the present Minister for Finance when he was Minister for Justice, with which no one agreed, not even the Members of his own Party, which was finally ditched and another Bill introduced.  What is to be said of a Minister who, in 1965, says it is wrong for a man to be enabled by law to leave all his property to his widow? That is what the first Succession Bill said; a man would not be allowed, even if he were possessed of only £900, to leave all his property to his widow. That is what the present Minister for Finance said.  Quite clearly, he was either gravely wrong in his judgment or he had never read the Bill properly. He can take his pick.</P>
    <P>Recently we had a call by the Fine Gael Party to put an end to foreign speculation in agricultural land.  The Party introduced a Private Member's Bill.  It was defeated.  There was no problem.  There was no need to inquire into what was happening.  The Land Bill of 1965 was introduced and an amendment was tabled to that Bill. That amendment was thrown out. When the Bill reached Report Stage, provisions were introduced to prevent speculation in land.  We had tried to remedy the position on Committee <Col N="451" /> Stage.  We were defeated.  Within a matter of months, the Government changed their minds.  It is very difficult to know where the Government stand in practically everything.  This illustrates my contention that they have abandoned power to the civil servants. In the Finance Bill, 1965, the Government broke faith with everyone who had taken out a Married Woman's Property or status Act policy.  They introduced penal provisions without precedent in the history of death duty legislation.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier some of the characteristics I should like to find in a Government and the political virtues a Government ought to possess.  In addition to respect for individuals, there should be respect for minorities.  The Government profess respect and, in order to catch votes, they will make the appropriate grants at the appropriate time.  When, however, it comes to dealing with the NFA, they point out, as they have pointed out, to farmers all over the country the names of the members.  They ask: &ldquo;Will you look at the names?  The Montgomerys, the Chances&rdquo; and so on.  These are the names borne by the Protestant minority.  The people are told: &ldquo;These are the buckos in the NFA.&rdquo;  That shows the real respect the Fianna Fáil Party have, despite their protestations, for the religious minority.</P>
    <P>The same thing was evidenced in the disgraceful proceedings in the Mansion House.  I was glad to have the first-hand evidence of Senator Sheehy Skeffington on this, whose integrity nobody in this House will dare to challenge.</P>

      <P>Naturally, I may <Col N="452" /> have disagreed with his views and I shall probably disagree with his views in future on a number of matters; but I have never had any doubt about his integrity.  We have now on the records of this House first-hand evidence.  I accept that evidence.  We have had the Government, through their spokesman, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, Deputy Carty, saying that we might perhaps have legislation to prevent gatherings of the kind that took place in the Mansion House, to prevent people expressing an opinion contrary to what is contained, according to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, in the Constitution.  If that were the evolution, then one could never have any change in the Constitution and a minority could never grow into a majority because that minority could always be prevented from expressing its views.  That is the kind of inequitable treatment the Government hand out to the people.  I deplore tactics of that kind.  It was most indiscreet, to say the least of it, of Deputy Carty, the Parliamentary Secretary, to make that statement.  So far, there has been no repudiation as there was when he condemned the Commission on Higher Education.</P>
      <P>The Commission on Higher Education is constituted of a body of independent people who cannot be pushed about.  They, of course, made appropriate representations to the Taoiseach, I take it, dealing with their continued existence as a Commission and it became necessary therefore for the Taoiseach to repudiate his Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Carty.</P>
      <P>We have had the great promiser, the Minister for Education, making statements about a constituent college of the National University, University College, Galway.  That had promptly to be withdrawn by the Minister for Education.  We had the same situation in relation to free education.  It is difficult to know where the country stands in regard to the latter at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>And that is partly responsible for the improvement in our vote in both Waterford and Kerry.  If Senator Dolan likes to laugh hollowly at that, I shall not deprive him of the opportunity.  I suggest, however, that we must now get away from the feeling that one has to know someone in order to get one's rights.  Having identified the atmosphere, I now propose a remedy.  It would be an excellent idea if civil servants would take a tour around the country from time to time to study the reactions of the people to the problems with which the people are confronted.  It would be a good idea if the Minister for Agriculture, the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Health sent a selected official of the rank of higher executive down to the different counties of Mayo, Galway, Roscommon, Leitrim, Cavan&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;into the different towns, preferably on fair days, advertising that they will be in attendance to explain to the people what the people's rights are.  An official of the Department of Local Government would be available to tell people to what grants they are entitled; an official of the Department of Agriculture would be available on such a day to tell people to what grants they are entitled and to tell them what Government policy is in relation to different matters.  That would be giving a service to the people and in a certain sense providing an <i>ad hoc</i> decentralisation of central government.  At the same time it would give the civil servant who does not have contact with the people some idea of how people think, how they react to the reforms presented to them, how they interpret things, what their fears are and what their ignorance is in regard to Government proposals.  That would be an effective way of making the Civil Service more alive to the problems with which they <Col N="454" /> are trying to deal every day and it would get away from the idea that you must know somebody in order to get what you are entitled to.</P>
      <P>I am sure we are all glad the Minister for Finance has taken tentative steps towards improving the image of the Civil Service.  The body which he has established might not meet with the approval, because of the type of person that is on it, of all of us but at any rate it is a first step towards examining the kind of problems with which the Civil Service is confronted and the various deficiencies from which our Civil Service suffers.  I hope that Commission will report at regular intervals upon different aspects and that the reforms suggested will be carried through with a minimum of delay.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to something with which the Minister for Finance is immediately concerned, that is, the revival of Irish.  I said before, and I repeat, that the Minister for Finance is not the proper member of the Government to be charged with the responsibility of supervising the programme for the restoration of Irish, such as it is, which the Government have outlined.  The Minister for Finance is too busy with financial policy looking after the economy, dealing with economic policy and with the European Economic Community, to have sufficient time to devote to the urgent problem of retrieving Irish from its present position, keeping what little of it there is alive and at the same time, promoting its wider use in the public service and in the country generally.  Again, I see in the appointment of the Minister for Finance something that is basic to the whole problem of the revival of Irish, that is, that the Minister for Finance is the only member of the Government, apart from the Taoiseach, who can put the screws on other Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has the power of sanction all the time.  The Minister for Finance is in control of the Civil Service.  The Minister for Education cannot tell the Department of Finance what they are to do and neither can the Minister for the Gaeltacht. <Col N="455" /> Because of this, they have appointed the Minister for Finance in charge of Irish.  This is vital to the whole problem of reviving Irish because here again is the mailed fist that must be used, in the view of the Fianna Fáil Government, if Irish is to progress.  That is why the Minister for Finance was selected.  Only he can enforce his will.  Of course, once the question of compulsion, whether in the public service or elsewhere, arises, then the revival of the language is doomed to failure.  After 40 years experience, that should have been brought home to us.</P>
    <P>I do not hesitate to say that in 1925 and 1926 it was a Fine Gael Government who inaugurated some of the things which we are now criticising and complaining about, but these things which were then done were the things that were considered best in those times.  However, they have failed and the Government fail to realise that.  I deplore the fact that the Minister for Finance, busy as he ought to be with so many other things affecting the life of the country, should be charged with the progress of Irish.  I have read the report which was published recently; I could have written it myself in advance.  It contains the usual platitudes, pious hopes and aspirations of the committees established to deal with this and that.</P>
    <P>Until such time as something is done by the Government&mdash;I do not think that the Department of Finance is ever likely to engender enthusiasm for Irish or anything else&mdash;to create a climate in which an interest in, not to speak of a love of, Irish can take root, the language is doomed to die.  That, in my view, is a fundamental fact and proposition and one which the Government ought to realise immediately.  I cannot see anything in the report issued recently by the Minister which suggests that the Government are aware of the necessity for creating the climate in which people will firstly begin to take an interest in the language and thereafter develop a love for the language.</P>
    <P>In the 1961 general election, we had <Col N="456" /> the Taoiseach saying that we would never lower our sights as regards the Irish language.  We have had Deputy Colley, now Minister for Industry and Commerce, saying that the object was, in a bilingual community such as ours, to replace English with Irish.  Of course, when you set impossible tasks such as that before the people, they just will not offer to take the fence at all, let alone take it.  Then we had Deputy Lemass, then Taoiseach, during the Presidential election going one step further than Pádraig Pearse.  He wanted to have not only a united Ireland but an Ireland that was united and Gaelic-speaking as well.  That was going one step further than Pádraig Pearse in this sense that Pearse never knew Ian Paisley.  Imagine Paisley and his followers being compelled to speak Irish! Imagine holding that prospect out to Ian Paisley and the Reverend Mr. Wylie.  It reduces the whole problem of the language and the whole concept of the revival of the language to an absurdity, a laughable absurdity, in the eyes of many.</P>

      <P>If that is the level of the Senator's intelligence I have not time to deal with him.  There are many things I should like to say about education but I want to urge the Minister for Finance, as we shall not have him here for the education motion, to realise that mentally and physically handicapped children have equal rights with the healthy members of the community to a full education fitted to their capacity.  It is not right to have the parents of mentally handicapped children, who have enough to do already looking after their children, going around organising dances, or going on deputations to Ministers to look for a miserable grant which in law and under the Constitution, they are entitled to.  As Minister for Finance, he should supply adequate funds to provide suitable education for every mentally handicapped child.  It is deplorable that the parents should have to go around organising dances and bazaars in order to get some kind of education for their children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="457" /> Some Senators referred to the problem of health and here again we have quite clearly exposed another of the spurious promises of the Government. The great Deputy O'Malley, when Minister for Education, produced his White Paper on Health.  This was a form of &ldquo;instant O'Malley&rdquo; beloved of certain political correspondents but there was just a slight postponement of his Bill and now, in the declining days of 1966, no Bill has yet emerged.  The reason is that when Deputy O'Malley produced his White Paper, he knew, and it was known to the Government, that there was no possibility of a Bill being introduced because there would not be funds available to finance the promised scheme.</P>

We costed our scheme and gave sources from which the revenue could be derived.</P>

      <P>Not buoyancy; buoyancy cannot be used in every case.  We said not a word about buoyancy: we are consistent and know what we are about.  We said it should be financed by insurance and the former Taoiseach went around and said: &ldquo;They are now proposing to impose a poll tax.&rdquo;  But it cannot be said that we did not say what we were going to do.  If the Government were in touch with public sentiment and knew what was going on, they would know that the population are quite prepared to find the necessary money to finance a proper health scheme by insurance contributions to be paid on the recognised social welfare basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the tests of an individual is how he treats his relations and the test of a community is how it treats its old people.  When I go around the city of Dublin, or through Mayo or Kerry or <Col N="458" /> Waterford, and see the old people who are living in dirt, in fear, who do not know their rights under the health services and who are afraid to call in the doctor because they do not know what will happen, I feel that we, as a community, judged by the test of how we look after our old people, cannot be proud of ourselves.  It is an urgent necessity that we should increase the number of domiciliary aids in the form of district nurses who look after these people because, due to the rate of emigration, some of them have no relation within miles.  It is time the lonely old man on a crutch or the lonely old woman with a bad heart who is not sleeping at night because she is afraid she will die, and all people of that kind, got some kind of treatment and that somebody should unfailingly come along to give them some words of encouragement and bring the doctor when necessary.</P>
    <P>The way we treat our old people is a sad business and a national disgrace. One has only to consider the number who, in their old age, take their own lives through despair.  One sees that every week, and yet nothing is done about it.  The health services such as they are, should&mdash;everybody will agree &mdash;be operated properly within their limitations.  It has come to my notice&mdash; of course, again, the Minister and his colleagues will laugh it off because they have no care&mdash;that there are dispensary doctors&mdash;I do not know what they are paid&mdash;who have said to people who have widows or orphans cards or who are old age pensioners, that they will not take their cards, that they require money, that the card will not buy breakfast for their children. These social welfare recipients who have the blue cards have had to pay out money, or else have a row with their doctors.  To my mind, that is a grave abuse and scandal.  I do not ask the Minister to inquire into it; he does not think that kind of thing can happen, but it does happen.</P>

      <P>They should know it.  Let me say that the present Minister for Health is to be congratulated upon the reasonable manner in which he conducted his discussion on Telefís Éireann last weekend.  I propose that the Minister for Health should direct &mdash;and if he cannot do it, he should find ways of doing it&mdash;every health authority to write to every person who is the holder of a medical card telling him what his rights are and send a copy of that letter to every dispensary doctor, couched in sufficiently discreet terms not to offend the majority who are doing their duty, but in such a way that it would bring to the notice of these other people that inquiries will be made, and should be made, by a Government alert to the frailties of human nature.  That is another disgrace we suffer because of a minority who abuse the power they have, one might say, if not over life and death, certainly over health and life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many other matters with which I should like to deal but I was never one, nor was my Party, to walk out on an agreement already concluded. I want to refer to the administration of the Town Planning Acts. While these were going through the Oireachtas, we knew that they would be a fruitful source of the kind of thing I am not permitted to mention under the rules of the House.  Very strange things are happening and there is grave public disquiet about things that have been done to get permissions, to succeed in appeals and so on, if you know the right people.  We hear about them every day.  I can refer to one extraordinary example which is public knowledge.  There is a certain town in Monaghan where the planning authorities were asked to approve of the erection of a broiler house in a residential area and, with due regard for the feelings of the citizens and in the <Col N="460" /> interests of good town planning, they refused permission.  The matter was appealed to the Minister who duly granted permission for the erection of the broiler house in the middle of a residential area.  He did not even trouble to get any medical evidence on this undesirable project.</P>
    <P>What was the upshot?  The residents had to apply to the High Court, because of the dereliction of duty on the part of the Minister, for an injunction to restrain the owner of the property, notwithstanding the permission granted by the Minister, to eliminate offensive noise and odours and effluvia.  An injunction was consented to in those terms by the owner of this building.  When that sort of thing can happen, one is bound to have a good look at human nature and ask: what went wrong?  as the Taoiseach asked about the Budget of 1965.  What went wrong in that particular case where a planning permission was of such a character and given with such disregard for the rights of others that the owner of the building afterwards consented to a High Court injunction restraining him from doing the very things which those who objected to planning permission, objected to when it was first sought?  I leave it to the imagination of the House, and it will not require great stimulation, to answer the question.  What was wrong when that happened?</P>
    <P>I observed from the newspapers that the Taoiseach met the National Farmers Association, together with the new Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  I always thought it was regrettable that the Minister for Finance, when he was Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and when he saw these farmers gathering upon Dublin, did not fulfil the promise he had previously given them that he would go to meet them.  When the mountain came to Mahomet, Mahomet should have said in advance: &ldquo;I shall be ready on such-and-such a day to meet you.&rdquo;  That would have avoided all the pain, suffering and unnecessary misery, and all would not have been lost.  Any Minister who was concerned about a problem would probably have done that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="461" /> I should like to draw the attention of the Minister for Finance to the Agricultural Credit Corporation, for whose activities I think he is in part responsible.  When the credit squeeze came in 1965, there were many people who had committed themselves to buying extra land, farms, on the basis that they had made application to the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  These applications had been approved, and in consequence of that, they paid their deposits.  It so happened that there was a clause in the agreement that if the loan was not taken up within three months, it should be deemed to be abandoned.  When the credit squeeze came, all those who had relied upon the good faith of the Agricultural Credit Corporation found themselves referred to clause 19, or whatever it was that contained this stipulation, and in some cases I believe they forfeited their deposits because the money had not come through.</P>
    <P>That was a mean way in which to operate the powers which they had vested in them, and what is more, it was illegal.  I had to deal with the Agricultural Credit Corporation on that basis and to point out to them some law of which they were well aware, and the loan was granted in the case about which I made representations. However, it is deplorable that farmers who relied upon the face value of a document should lose or be put in peril of losing hundreds of pounds which they had paid in deposits for the purchase of farms.  I would ask the Minister for Finance, now that money seems to be somewhat more readily available, to ask the Corporation to review these cases and see what can be done, if anything can be done at this late stage.</P>
    <P>Anybody who spends any time at all thinking about the future must be depressed at the apparent lack of readiness of this country to take on the rigours that membership of the European Economic Community will impose upon us.  We had the Minister for External Affairs here last July, and twice he referred to the EEC as the Council of Europe, which showed how familiar he was with <Col N="462" /> this new concept which is daily becoming a reality for us.  Senator O'Reilly disputed that and said he had used &ldquo;Council of Europe&rdquo; mistakenly twice.  The reports indicate otherwise.</P>
    <P>I know of no activity, certainly of a published character, in Government circles to prepare the farmers, the industrialists or the population generally for the kind of problems with which we shall have to deal.  It is fairly well accepted now that Britain, subject to the attitude of the French Government, may well be in the EEC by 1970.  I think it is now accepted by the Taoiseach, after his visit to Mr. Wilson&mdash;and if not, it ought to be&mdash;that we should begin our negotiations with the Commission in Brussels in order to present to them the kind of problems with which we are faced before the decision on the British application will be reached which could not be revoked once we begin to make our final bid for membership.</P>
    <P>I know of no Government activity to do the kind of things we ought to be doing as a matter of urgency at the present time, save the few reports published by the CIO, and I do not know if they have been acted upon to any great extent except that I have a recollection of complaints by Government Ministers about the failure of industrialists to take up adaptation grants.  What we are concerned with here is the livelihood of thousands of our fellow citizens.  I cannot see any evidence of concern about what is going to happen to those, but I do know what will be happening in Brussels when we begin negotiations. We shall be going along with the Irish lament that we are not ready, that we are late in the industrial race, that we are only a young nation, and all that kind of thing and looking for and probably only getting five or six years as an interim period in which to have ourselves ready to take on the full obligations of membership.</P>
    <P>We have three or four years now in hand and we ought to be making urgent use of that time.  I cannot see any evidence of a sense of urgency in any of our Departments of State.  I do <Col N="463" /> not know, for instance, what regulations will apply to the importation of cattle or sheep into a variety of countries.  I do know that the Confederation of British Industries has got all the instruments that will apply to its industries and are examining them one by one to see how they will be affected and how they will be able to meet the various instruments that have been made by the Commission.  I do not know whether anything of that kind is going on in this country.  I should be glad if the Minister, when replying, would deal with that and try to communicate to the population generally the sense of urgency which is involved.  One can only deplore the remark made by a certain Minister on Mr. Cosgrave's going abroad to acquaint himself with what is going on in Europe, that it was &ldquo;playing the Government in exile.&rdquo;  Fancy that from a Fianna Fáil Minister when we had an Irish Ambassador from the Republic of Ireland in France up to 1927 at a time when Mr. de Valera's Party was the Government in exile.</P>
    <P>There is a provision in the Treaty of Rome in respect of the principle of equal pay for equal work.  I have not heard any Government Minister say how that principle is to be applied here.  That is the kind of thing we ought to be dealing with.</P>
    <P>There are many other things with which I should like to deal but time does not permit.  We have had a busy year on the political front.  We had the recent by-elections from which the Government Party derive unmerited and unwarranted comfort.  So be it.  I do not wish in this season of goodwill to upset their dreams.  Then we had the Presidential election.  I suppose many of us on this side of the House greatly regret the abuse of power that was displayed during the whole course of the Presidential election campaign by the chief organiser of the Presidential election campaign in arranging all those visits of one kind and another to enable the Fianna Fáil Presidential election candidate to attend and be displayed on television.  That was an abuse of power.  It was a great mistake, <Col N="464" /> and a great disservice performed by the Fianna Fáil Party to the office of President, to have thrown an outgoing President into the political arena as was done.  The President of this country, once he leaves active politics, should not ever be seen to be, nor should any suggestion ever be made, that he is in any way connected with a political Party.</P>

      <P>No; I am not allowed even under the Constitution to do that.  But I think we could give a great build-up to the Presidency in the eyes of the people if some kind of functions could be organised in which a member of the Oireachtas, the President, was seen to associate with members of all political Parties.  That, more than anything else, would help to emphasise in the minds of the people the non-political character of the Presidency.  So far, it has never been my privilege from 1957 to 1961&mdash;from 1961 we have this gap which so rejoices the heart of the Minister for Finance, the <i>dies non</i> of my political life&mdash;and from 1965 to the present, it has never been my lot to associate with the President in a way which would emphasise the non-political character of the Presidency.  That ought to be done so that the true character of the President as President of the nation would be firmly embedded in the minds of the people.</P>

      <P>Since this debate was adjourned on the last occasion, very important events for us have taken place, in the meeting between our Taoiseach and the Prime Minister of Britain.  If Senator O'Quigley can confuse <Col N="465" /> the Taoiseach and Mr. Wilson, I think the Minister for External Affairs will be forgiven for letting his tongue slip in confusion between the Council of Europe and the EEC.  It appears quite evident now that there will be in the very foreseeable future a new initiative by Britain towards entry into EEC.  Happily for us, it appears from the meeting between the Taoiseach and Mr. Wilson that we will be kept in close communication with the developments in these negotiations as far as they affect us.  It has become evident from recent statements by members of the European Commission and by responsible and influential Ministers of the Member States that, not only are they prepared to have Britain as a member of the Community but, even more important, that they look forward to the occasion when Britain will join them in their association.</P>
      <P>To this extent I feel we probably reach the essence of the difference between the Government's attitude to negotiations with the EEC and that of the Fine Gael Party, as suggested by Senator FitzGerald in the House and as indicated to the public by the Leader of the Fine Gael Party on his return, in company with Senator FitzGerald, from Brussels.  I am not suggesting that the Fine Gael Party are not anxious to keep in close communication with the British negotiations. However, they would apparently suggest&mdash;I am not sure whether it is impressions, facts or ideas conveyed it to them&mdash;that we might at this time undertake our own negotiations in advance of the British application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald, Deputy Cos-grave or any member of the Oireachtas will no doubt be afforded the opportunity of canvassing the views of and discussing their various views with members of the Commission.  It may well be that some members of the Commission will have this viewpoint. On the other hand&mdash;Senator FitzGerald has already referred to his experience, and a year ago my impression, as a member of a delegation to the Commission's headquarters, was that the only concern the members of the Commission appeared to have then was <Col N="466" /> whether or not at that time Britain could fill the void which might be left by the secession of France from the Community.  Conscious though they were of the facts that we were an Irish delegation, concerned with informing ourselves of the workings of the Community, my impression was&mdash;one gets many impressions at the European Commission&mdash;that their major concern was not whether or not Ireland would some time become a member of the Community but whether or not Britain could fill that void.</P>
    <P>My personal views and those of other members were canvassed on this important aspect of affairs.  They did appreciate at that time that Ireland's entry into the Community could balance the entry of Britain on that occasion.  The point I make is this: to come home from a short visit to the Commission's headquarters and give suggestions that may have been proposed by one or other members of the staff as positive and valid suggestions towards our definite entry into EEC is less than reasonable.</P>
    <P>In the past year, it has been evident from time to time that there is quite a difference of opinion, to say the least, between the thinking of the members of the Commission's staff and that of the Ministers of the Member States.  We must approach our negotiations as being plenary negotiations, Minister to Minister, Prime Minister to Prime Minister and, of course, at the same time, keep ourselves informed of developments in Brussels.  One sees in the British reactivation of interest that they are more concerned with the reaction of the various Ministers and Governments than they are on the occasion of their previous application, when one was justly left with the impression that they rather concentrated too much on the reaction of the Commission in Brussels without due regard to what the obvious reaction of Member States might have been on that occasion.</P>
    <P>We must approach this in a realistic fashion.  Now that we have appointed a full-time Minister to the Commission, we should be in a position to keep ourselves informed of developments <Col N="467" /> and we should use every opportunity to keep ourselves so informed. At the same time, it would be less than realistic to suggest that any negotiations for entry could be conducted except between the responsible Ministers and Prime Ministers.  If Fine Gael are suggesting this as a real line of negotiation, they should indicate how it can best accomplish our early entry into EEC.  If not, they should withdraw it as being, as it appears to be, a mere impression.</P>
    <P>In order to see the steps which we are taking towards the EEC and how we are gearing ourselves to survive and compete in a European community one just looks to the programme which the Government have themselves been initiating and promoting over the last number of years and not least of all to a programme which was announced only last week, that is the programme for special development of small industries throughout the country.  I was rather surprised on reading the survey of the Irish Management Institute that of approximately 3,000 manufacturing industries in Ireland in 1964 only one and a half per cent of them&mdash;something over 50&mdash;would actually come into the category of large industries by generally accepted definitions, that of the Small Business Administration Group in the United States and I would say equally so, that of the general acceptance of the term &ldquo;small industry&rdquo; in the European community.  So that, in fact, when we come to gear ourselves for membership of the European community we must do so in the knowledge that 98 per cent of our industries are small industries in the internationally accepted sense of the word.</P>
    <P>It is for this reason that I feel that this new scheme which is a regionalised scheme of development is a very good one.  As it is announced we will have three pilot areas, one in Sligo-Leitrim-Roscommon, one in Carlow-Kilkenny and one in Clare-Limerick.  The very attractive part of this new programme is that for the first time liaison officers and technicians of one sort or another will be available locally, at first hand, at base, to assist with the problems of <Col N="468" /> small industries in their particular areas and to advise the management and staff of these various industries on the problems which immediately affect them.</P>
    <P>One of the matters which, in many ways, handicap development of our industrial activity here is the lack of liaison between industrialists themselves, particularly the smaller ones, and the various promotional government bodies.  When one looks at the drive and urgency which gives rise to a small industry in the first place it is an opportunity which a particular individual sees in a particular outlet. He takes that opportunity and he exploits that outlet as best he can and then he finds that the services and the industry which he manages expand and this expansion in its time creates expansion problems.  On many occasions he finds that some of those problems are more than he can cope with.  He lacks the services at that time of specialised advice which should be immediately available to him in the area, to gear these new developments to the best interests of the industry. In this connection this new regionalised programme will fulfil what I think is a very definite need in our industrial programme here at present because it appears evident even in the matter of applying for loans that many smaller industries here in Ireland either feel a lack of confidence in or a lack of liaison with the members of some of the State-sponsored bodies which have been set up to assist development of these industries.</P>
    <P>In relation to the general picture of industries throughout the country I would say that the ones that will feel the greatest draught in a European community or indeed even in an advanced economic society, will not be the smaller ones employing less than 30, craft industries of that sort, but the ones that have experienced the growing pains and are experiencing the ordinary problems of expansion and personnel and general problems of management.  It is quite significant that many of those industries which employ approximately 200 to 300 people around the country have failed <Col N="469" /> to create the impact on our society that one would have expected from them.  Many of them have, many have not.  This probably arises from the very real and reasonable difficulty which they experience when they get to a certain stage of growth.  &ldquo;Do we go forward, do we stay put or, in fact, do we just die moribund&rdquo;.  It is at this stage of expansion&mdash;remember many of our industries are family industries&mdash;that we must offer them the incentive, the assistance they so urgently need.</P>
    <P>One of the incentives I would recommend to many of those industries is that they would use more fully the resources available to them by way of the professional knowledge and advice of various graduate bodies and professionally qualified men.  It occurs to me that many of our boards of directors throughout the country have adopted a rather conservative attitude in relation to the composition of their boards.  Many of them have good and what appears to them to be sufficient reasons but I would say that if new life and urgency were injected into those boards by the addition of highly qualified young men, of progressive men in various fields, these industries would not find themselves in such a moribund, doubtful state but they would be propelled by the very urgency which is being created by the promotional activity of the new members of their boards.</P>
    <P>The same thing would apply to the principle of profit-sharing with the members of their staff, a principle which, I am glad to say, has been accepted in some instances here and has, in fact, proved to be one of the greatest safeguards against personnel problems in industry.</P>
    <P>It was suggested here at one stage that we are faced with an ever-increasing problem of mass exodus from the land.  I think the same speaker did agree that this is only another instance of a pattern which, in fact, is evident throughout Europe and, indeed, throughout the world.  It appears almost inevitable that this pattern will continue and is not something we should cry about.  It is an <Col N="470" /> economic fact at present.  While we must preserve as much as possible the social environment of rural Ireland, in so far as there are certain factors operating at present we must face reality and I would suggest that these new industries should concentrate largely on the type of production which is geared most closely to agriculture. They should concentrate on the type of production which will offer a production base&mdash;market gardening, meat-processing and so on.  It is in those that we will eventually realise our greatest potential if we are to become members of the wider European community.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that everything is not being done towards promoting the industrial activity of Ireland.  In fact, it is very obvious over the past ten years that everything has been done and a lot has been achieved.  I am merely saying, in an objective fashion, that in this new programme which we are pronouncing we should have every consideration to assist not just the small industries but all industries in Ireland which at present in many cases need this assistance.</P>
    <P>As usual, in this debate certain ideas are expressed and attitudes come to mind which might be better left unsaid in this House or, indeed, in any House. In the first instance, I might say one is concerned somewhat at the whole general trend recently of lack of support and lack of confidence, particularly in our police force.  One heard a little of it again in the House during this debate.  One always hears of the isolated incident.  I do not question the right of any Member of the House to bring these matters to attention but I should like, once in a while, to hear the members of the Garda Síochána&mdash; who are, in fact, the servants of the public, as exemplified by their name&mdash; commended for much of the good work they do.  Anyone who is closely associated with social work or voluntary activities throughout Ireland will see that many of them are doing an immense amount of good work.  I will instance some of it so that we may, in this House, let them see they do enjoy our confidence and respect, and restore that confidence which is due to them <Col N="471" /> from the public and, particularly, from the Members of Oireachtas Éireann.</P>
    <P>Over the weekend, one must have seen announcements in connection with the establishment of boys' clubs for two or three centres, clubs which were established and promoted&mdash;and will continue to be promoted&mdash;by members of the Garda Síochána.  I think there are approximately 300 of these clubs in the country at present and in more than 70 per cent of these cases&mdash;I had the figure up to yesterday but it is my impression that in more than 70 per cent of these cases&mdash;the clubs are either actively established or promoted by members of the Garda Síochána in their off-duty hours.  This is a fact that might be borne in mind by all of us who tend to so readily criticise and be scandalised.  We are very easily scandalised&mdash;as was exemplified by Senator O'Quigley here this evening&mdash;by certain isolated incidents in the conduct of a few members of the Garda.</P>
    <P>This voluntary activity of the Garda is another example of the effective work, this very definite social work, work that does more in the country areas of Ireland and, indeed, in the city to combat crime by eradicating the source than we could ever do by any other additional reform we could introduce at a later stage.  The same is being done in the case of the juvenile liaison officers who live in very close association with the offenders&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>And established by me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and established by the Minister.  But I think the whole programme of enlightenment we have seen from the Department in connection with reforms of this sort in recent times should not be lightly left aside. These juvenile liaison officers keep in close touch with the domestic environment of the young wayward ones who have not, as yet, come fully into the grip of active crime.  Anyone who has anything to do with them will readily admit they are doing a great service, doing it with a full understanding of human problems and with a great sense of duty and sacrifice.  One of the <Col N="472" /> things which impress me most is to see the sense of sacrifice which those officers have and also to see the extremely keen competition amongst the members of the Force for entry into that particular service, service which, in fact, demands the very highest standards of patience, understanding and integrity, and nobody can suggest that those standards are not being met.</P>
      <P>I would further say&mdash;in relation to suggestions that our country is being ruled, and ruthlessly so on occasions, by the strong hand of the Garda Síochána&mdash;that from my experience and practice in courts over a certain area of this country I have found the members of the Garda Síochána very sympathetic and most anxious, where possible at all, to meet the needs of the family from which the young offender may come.  I have found them more than anxious and fair in recommending leniency to the courts in cases where the ones to suffer would be the family who were penalised by the offence of the young offender.  On many occasions, they do this even in the case of what are, in fact, serious and, in many cases, dastardly offences&mdash;ones which certainly do not recommend themselves to any members of the Garda Síochána.  They do that in the interests of the family environment and many young men&mdash;when you look at the courts every day&mdash;are given the chance to prove their ability to merge properly into society.</P>
      <P>Mark you, I am the first to concede that our care of these young wayward ones is not nearly as advanced as we would like it to be.  I think the Minister for Justice would agree with me in this.  A scheme is under consideration for, possibly, a hostel in the city of Dublin for these young men who, while serving detention for one crime or another, would be allowed to come and go from their work and report back to this hostel&mdash;not to the environment of a prison but to the environment, if not of a home, at least that of a boarding school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with this particular topic one should not ignore the great results of the corrective training unit in Mountjoy.  This unit was established <Col N="473" /> more or less to ease the break which the hardened criminal would have before coming back to adjust himself to modern society.  Many of those long-term prisoners in the latter years, or latter months, certainly, before their release are transferred to this unit, and allowed out to employment in Dublin and report back to the unit in the evening.  In fact, they really have no other association with the prison except during their sleeping hours.  It has been found that this is a very effective way of easing them back into society.  Again, the records show that since 1962 or 1963 &mdash; whenever this unit was established&mdash;and again probably in the time of the enlightened Minister in the House this evening over 80 per cent of those people&mdash;and many of them are long-term and hardened criminals who have served some time in this corrective unit &mdash; have, up to now, found themselves able to adjust to society. Mark you, I am not saying that in the years to come many of them will be able to continue constantly that way but, at least, it does show the enlightened approach and the happy results which have come from that enlightened approach.</P>

      <P>This evening, I think objective Members of this House &mdash;if any of us can be objective&mdash;will not have been particularly happy to have listened to the Leader of the Fine Gael Party introduce &ldquo;corruption,&rdquo;&ldquo;bribery,&rdquo; even &ldquo;political jobbery&rdquo; and terms of that sort into a debate such as this.  All of us appreciate that we would prefer to see many problems, at present handled by Deputies and Members of this House, handled by competent social workers but to suggest it is the prerogative of any one side of this House&mdash;as Senator O'Quigley does, with a very definite indication towards this side&mdash;to provide for the needs, or what he might suggest, the apparent needs of the people throughout the country; to fool them into the impression that only I can get it for you; to leave them with the impression that unless you vote for me you will not get it; and to leave them with the impression that that is the prerogative <Col N="474" /> of the Government Party is quite untrue.  He probably knows that many of the great poll-pullers of his own Party are, in fact, those who initiated that particular technique.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go any further on that particular line but one is entitled to expect more in this House from the Leader of the Fine Gael Party.  Were I Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries or Minister for Finance, I doubt if I would have the patience to listen to the various charges levelled at the Government, ranging from the by-elections to concern only for Fianna Fáil supporters.  The amusing aspect of this, in my experience&mdash;and all public men will tell you the same&mdash; is that many people in the area in which I live in North Tipperary suggest that it is only Opposition supporters who are able to get from the Government what only Government supporters should get.  If Senator O'Quigley had a little more experience of direct contact with people throughout the country, he would not come here with such naive and, may I say, such slanderous, suggestions as he put before the House this evening.</P>
      <P>In relation to these social welfare activities, one can point with some satisfaction, and, indeed, even with hope, to the great work being done by voluntary bodies throughout the country and, may I say, in particular by the Social Welfare Conference in Kilkenny which more or less initiated this programme of voluntary social welfare activities on a professional basis, professional in its skill, if not in its remuneration.  This was undertaken by the Irish Sisters of Charity, with the aid of the Bishop of Ossory. As we know, Kilkenny has almost become a complex of social welfare activities.  It has engendered in people a sense of social responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gather from discussions with members of the Conference that the one thing they feel most lacking in is the trained assistance of the skilled social welfare worker.  There is no lack in the volume of assistance: all the community in Kilkenny take their part. I would say this applies to every town, but Kilkenny might be regarded as <Col N="475" /> the pilot scheme.  They find their great lack is the unavailability of trained social workers.  In this connection I want to point to a contradiction.  Many of our graduates in social science appear to find difficulty in getting gainful employment which would allow them to use their training to the best advantage, while, at the same time, voluntary bodies such as this are most anxious to have the assistance of such trained graduates.</P>
    <P>It is my suggestion that the Government should at least keep in mind and consider the possibility of appointing regional social workers throughout the country, workers who will fulfil the various needs and bring to bear on their activities the understanding and sympathy which of its very nature, those concerned with the administration of social welfare from the bureaucratic point of view cannot engender. There could be a great new possibility here in that at present we have so many of these voluntary organisations functioning so effectively.  What they need in many cases is direction.  Direction can come only from fulltime trained social workers.</P>
    <P>I know that the former Minister for Health and the present Minister for Health are very closely in touch with this whole programme of social welfare, particularly as it relates to voluntary social activities.  They have given every assistance and offered every inducement&mdash;and those concerned would be the first to admit it&mdash;to these social welfare conferences.  I suggest that they should also now consider the possibility of appointing these fulltime trained personnel to direct the affairs of these conferences.</P>
    <P>I know that we are precluded in this debate&mdash;perhaps happily because of the time&mdash;from discussing education. I would say in relation to this topic to which I have referred that we should engender an atmosphere and a climate in Ireland where it will be accepted that social workers, doctors, nurses, and teachers will be properly rewarded for the very important work they do, and that at least they will earn salaries commensurate with those of beauticians, <Col N="476" /> hairdressers and people who appear to do work that is better remunerated but scarcely as important. When the debate on education comes, I shall make a strong plea for more adequate remuneration for men and women engaged in such vitally important work.</P>
    <P>I am now making the same plea for improved conditions and improved salaries&mdash;and again the former Minister for Health set a great headline here&mdash;for people such as nurses and doctors and social welfare workers.  It appals me when I meet nurses here in Dublin to find that by comparison with young girls or women engaged in other activities, their lives have become such that they are not allowed the same opportunity&mdash;and the demands on their time are such that they do not have the same opportunity&mdash;for ordinary social activities as beauticians and hostesses and what have you, with greater remuneration. If we are to set a standard for our young people, we must make it clear that we are most concerned with the most important things and the most important jobs, and we should at least raise the level of their salaries and conditions.  I know the Minister and the former Minister are aware of this and we should put it as a first priority on our programme.</P>
    <P>Finally&mdash;and I hope unlike the previous speaker who continued for 20 minutes after &ldquo;finally&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;personnel relations in industry.  The term would have occurred more readily to my tongue this time last year when it occurred in almost every second line in every newspaper. Apparently we have got over this lack of liaison between management <Col N="477" /> and employees which was very much in evidence last year.  It is only fair to commend both the employers' organisations and the trade union organisations in particular&mdash;because, after all, they have to deal with a wider and probably less concentrated area&mdash; for the recent improvement in management-employee relations in Ireland. Again, this is evidenced in the advance which the country has been continuing to make in recent times over the past year.</P>
      <P>Last year in this debate, we had to face the fact that steps were necessary to maintain the economic balance of this nation.  We had to do that in anticipation of many other countries because the pattern was one which occurred from Italy to Sweden, and particularly in the case of our near neighbour Britain.  We had it in face of suggestions that the Government were bankrupt and that it was being done too late.  If it was too late, clearly it was done effectively.  The signs are there that the Government had the foresight to see the indications and were ahead of our great neighbour, England.  The difference was that the restrictions we imposed were like a tea party by comparison with what was done in England.  I welcome the fact that now again we are continuing the expansion which has been so evident during the past number of years.</P>

      <P>At this time of night, it is rather difficult to develop and elaborate as one would like in a major debate of this sort.  I regret very much that it has been decided to close the debate tonight and that we could not continue tomorrow morning and so give an opportunity to many of us, who have put long hours of study and thought into this, an opportunity of giving our views and our findings. I had better begin with the setting of the Government's declared policy of joining the EEC and the steps we are taking, or should be taking, to have our country in readiness for entry to that Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first and obvious thing about the EEC is that it is a scientific community. With America, it is the most advanced technological group in the <Col N="478" /> world, away ahead of all others. Therefore, if we are to succeed in it, we shall do so solely by the way in which we can use science in competition with the others.  We shall be in a scientific race and, consequently, we must look to the first line of our attack&mdash;the universities and their products. We must, once and for all, disabuse our minds of the idea, all too current, at present, that somehow or other the university is a seat of privilege, that it is a type of ornament which you can afford to spend money on when the country is going along nicely in an expansionist economy but which, when we get into difficulties, must be the first to bear the brunt.</P>
    <P>That is totally wrong when considered in the background of our efforts to join the EEC.  This idea of privilege in the university is a manifestation of our history.  It is the slave mind coming out in our people.  That is quite natural after seven centuries of oppression; and it is only 40 years since ordinary Irish people began to have any hope of ever seeing their children go through the university. Consequently, as a defence mechanism, the people took up this slave attitude to the university as being a seat of privilege.  Out with that if we are ever to join the EEC.  We must begin to realise at once that the university system here must be tailored to the needs of a modern scientific State where the skills of our people are developed to the utmost.  It is from this high level that technological inspiration comes.  It is this that produces the teachers for all our complex educational establishments.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the university must be treated properly as a No. 1 priority. Having said that, I turn the attention of the Seanad, the Government and the Minister for Finance to some figures.  If we want comparisons we do not have to look outside our own island.  Surely when we speak about joining the EEC and about uniting our country, which will be done, <i>de facto</i>, in any case when we are in the EEC, we must aim at equalisation of standards as between here and Northern Ireland.  Without apology, I <Col N="479" /> bring to the notice of the House, as I have done on several other occasions, the standards in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Let us take the most recent Statistical Abstract and examine the figures and reports on Northern Ireland at page 368.  The number of students catered for in Northern Ireland is 4,400 and the university there had a total income of almost £2 million&mdash; £1,860,000&mdash;of which three-quarters came from the Government.  Whatever the figure is in the current year, in the previous three years it increased 50 per cent.  In the absence of figures to the contrary, we may assume that in the three years since 1963 the increase has not been less than 25 per cent, which means that the income of the university there is £2.25 million for 4,400 students.  This in turn means that the average available per student is something more than £500.  That is for teaching alone.</P>
    <P>We come to the situation in our universities and we were given some revealing figures by my colleague, Senator Stanford, in respect of TCD. He told us that the Government grant at the moment equals £250 per student. I do not think he was right because I think he included some capital expenditure for a new library which, for comparison purposes, should have been excluded.  There is also a serious question in respect of the breakdown of TCD students&mdash;1,500 from here, 760 from Northern Ireland and 1,100 from outside the country.  As far as I know, all students from outside are charged an increased fee of 50 per cent, which is only right and proper.</P>
    <P>On these figures, compared with the figure I quoted for Queen's, TCD has about £1.1 million available for current running of 3,300 students which is a figure of only £340 per student compared with Queen's £500, though the facilities at TCD are not nearly as good as at Queen's.  Then we come to the poor relation of our system, the National University, and I know the figures there.  I can cite my own college and I think the figures are pretty well the same in Galway as in UCD.  The total income this year in respect of my <Col N="480" /> college is £600,000 for 2,700 students&mdash; £225 per student.  I challenge anyone to disprove those figures.  The figure is £500 per student in Queen's&mdash;at the other end of Ireland 100 miles from here&mdash;£340 in TCD and £225 per student in the National University.</P>
    <P>Those figures show the appalling condition in which the National University finds itself today.  Even to bring it up to the modest level of endowment available in Trinity would need an increase of more than £100 per student or an increase of £1 million in the total grant to the National University. I do not know how this has been allowed to slide so badly into arrears in that way.  Perhaps in the National University we have not been making our case sufficiently insistently: perhaps the three Presidents may have to take their sleeping bags and sleep outside the Department of Education or the Department of Finance until adjustment is brought about.  Is there any industry in the Twenty-Six Counties of which we can say that it is producing a product at less than half what it costs to produce the same product in Northern Ireland and, of course, in England and elsewhere?  If we could find such an industry, we would indeed be very happy.  It does not exist.  If anyone visits any of our university colleges, particularly Cork, he can see where we keep on pushing in 200 and 300 extra students every year into halls, which are already overcrowded to the point of being a danger to health and safety.  You find students there sitting on the windowsills and also in what is supposed to be a passageway to get out in case of fire or some such hazard. One must see those students to realise those conditions.</P>
    <P>As well as that, we have all sorts of night classes and everything else trying to make up the classes.  I am proud to be able to say that so far the products of our university compare more than favourably with the products of Queen's University in Belfast or any of the English universities.  That is a tribute to the calibre of our students and, I might say, to their dedication to hard work.  Those students come from ordinary homes all over the country.  They know the sacrifice their <Col N="481" /> parents, their brothers and sisters, are making to put them through the university. Consequently, our students, as a body, work harder than students anywhere else.  Likewise, the same holds for our staff.  Of course, they cannot be pushed too far and we are getting very near the point of breakdown.</P>
    <P>Our authorities are very alarmed about this matter.  I ask the Government and the Minister to come and see for themselves.  We welcome visitors at any time.  If we want to prepare our first line&mdash;I do not know whether it is of defence or attack&mdash; in joining the Common Market, please come and help us to reach a situation in which our facilities are moderately in order.  We are not asking that the grant should be doubled overnight, because that would involve us in an equally great problem of trying to recruit staff at a rate which could not be done at the present time.  If it is the Government's thinking to join the EEC in five years' time, let us have a plan, whereby our university facilities catch up with the facilities available in Queen's University, Belfast.  At the same time, we have a right to ask, where we are being required to take increased numbers of students, due to the endeavour to make more secondary education available, and so on, that we get a part of the grant especially tied to the increase in our student body.</P>
    <P>I want to ask if there is any factory in this country which last year produced 2,400 of something, and this year produced 2,700, and was not given anything for expenses?  Indeed, I should not take one year.  Let us go back to 1956 or 1957, at the start of this period.  At that time we had 1,000 students.  Now we have 2,700 students. Can you imagine what all that means? The only addition made in all that period was that about £20,000 was spent in putting a top on an existing two-storey building.</P>

      <P>We look forward to seeing that.  There are one or two other figures which I ask you to take and think over during the recess.  They are in no way connected with &ldquo;Investment in Education.&rdquo;  They relate to the allocation of money as given in the Book of Estimates.  You will find in the Book of Estimates that the amount allocated to veterinary students, under the Department of Agriculture is: Veterinary College, £93,000; UCD, £112,000; and TCD, £61,000, making a total of £266,000.  It costs £4,500 to produce a veterinary surgeon.  I worked out those figures and it ranges from a cost of £800 to TCD and £4,000 to UCD.  This high figure is due to an effort to conform to international standards.</P>
      <P>Now, let us look at the dentistry figures.  The grant given under Subhead H is £118,000.  This figure turned out about 30 graduates.  Again, that is about £4,000 per dentist.  When you look at all those figures, you find that it costs £850 to produce a doctor in National University and it costs £4,000 to produce a veterinary surgeon.  Have our priorities gone topsy-turvy altogether when it costs £4,000 to produce a man to deal with animals and only £850 when it is a man to deal with health, one-sixth the amount?  I leave you to think over that figure in the hope that the Minister for Health will give it great consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While on this subject, I cannot refrain from commenting on the recent television programme on health. It was most informative and enlightening. It was a programme which did a great deal to raise the image of the politician in this country and to bring home to the people, the viewers, the very small marginal difference between <Col N="483" /> the different people on that programme. I might also say that the Minister concerned emerged with great honour and as a man who was prepared to listen and who was not prepared to try to score political points.  His image was excellent.  He complained about the scarcity of doctors and of dentists and I hope the figures I have given will convey to him the real reason for this.  If the Minister in charge of veterinary surgeons can succeed in doing so well to bring that profession up to international standards, then I appeal to the Minister for Health, through the Minister for Finance, to take steps to see that doctors are brought into line.</P>
    <P>We had also on that programme something which we should guard against, that is, this type of closed-mind mentality.  This is something which was evident on that programme and also since the publication of <i>The Just Society,</i> which has been so much discussed.  When a Government present a Bill, they expect criticism. Indeed, they get criticism from both Houses of Parliament.  The hope is that the end product will show the effect of these contributions and that it will be all the better for that.  Both of the Opposition Parties, Labour and Fine Gael, when they present documents like that, outlining their ideas on education or some other facet of our community, do a valuable service by putting much thinking and long hours of research into preparing those documents.  They have not got the resources of a Government when they set out to prepare those documents.  It is then all the more reason why the documents should be presented as documents for discussion between all the interests involved.  It should be a feather in the cap of any one of those Parties to say that was their policy 12 months ago but that discussions since then had caused it to be changed.  That is a sign of progress. The attitude of going back to what was said 10 years ago and trying to suggest that you could not change your <Col N="484" /> mind since then is a totally nonscientific, moronic attitude and it should be disposed of whenever it shows its ugly head.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn very briefly to some of the problems confronting agriculture, and begin by saying that in recent years&mdash;over the past 25 to 30 years&mdash;we had two Ministers for Agriculture who possessed the enthusiasm, the vigour and the capacity for the hard work that might produce a dramatic change in our agriculture. Both of these men shared the view that all was not well.  They felt that the statistics which showed an increase of 1 to 1½ per cent per annum was wrong.  There was something wrong with the system.  We were not getting from it the production of which it was capable and the production we saw our competitors were capable of getting.  Those two men were Deputy Dillon and the Minister here tonight. They both had drive and enthusiasm and they went in to their work with determination to achieve a complete revolution.  They were both anxious to co-operate with the farming organisations concerned.  They recognised, as was recognised in other progressive agricultural countries, that theirs was the only sound basis for progress but both were beaten, badly beaten by the system.</P>
    <P>In neither case were the men concerned able to do what their former counterpart and their present counterpart in the United States, Mr. Freeman, who brought in a forward line with him, did.  He selected at least 20 or 30 members or more.  He took them from key positions in the country. These were people who were known for their ability and performance in agriculture and most of them had little or no connection with politics. In fact, very often they were not of the same Party as the Minister, or perhaps they did not belong to a Party at all.  They shared with the Minister the view of outsiders, that what was done by the previous administration could be improved upon. They were forward-looking and they got results.  In other words, they knew how things could be done and they <Col N="485" /> had a valuable function in being able to discount the pitfalls in a programme. You cannot expect the same team to be forward-looking and backward at the same time.  They are not the source from which new dynamic ideas can emerge.  That, to my way of thinking, is why we have not got better results from our agriculture.</P>
    <P>The present conflict with the National Farmers Association is the same kind of conflict with which other professional organisations have to deal. The educational bodies are not satisfied with consultations they have had with other departments.  We can take various other bodies and discussion with them will reveal that the type of consultation that goes on is outmoded.</P>
    <P>We must recognise the fact that outside the Civil Service we have many talented and highly successful people in the various organisations.  They must be brought in and given an opportunity of making a real contribution to our development.  That applies probably more to the Department of Agriculture than to any other Departments at present.</P>
    <P>I notice that £200 is provided for the farm apprenticeship scheme.  There is an increase of £40 since last year. I think back over ten years, 1955-65, when we spent nights and days arguing, planning and thinking about farm apprenticeship and the great concept that would enable every young man who wanted to work on the land to aspire some day to owning his own farm.  This was the carrot that drew him to work on the land.  I find that at the end of all our endeavours, the bursts of enthusiasm from Deputy Childers and everyone, the great work of General Costello, Dan Duffy and the late Canon Hayes and others on that scheme, what is passed up as a farm apprenticeship scheme is 20 scholarships at £30 each and the amount spent this year is £200.  Surely there was never a greater example than this of the mountain labouring and producing a mouse.  This is the end of the great ideals that were developed through genuine enthusiasm and whittled down by Civil Service Departments. <Col N="486" /> The end result is a sheer waste of time as far as farm apprenticeship schemes are concerned.</P>
    <P>Again, we have the question of a great deal of publicity, and so on, about the fact that we have two farming organisations.  Will you show me anything that we do not have two of? How many trade unions have we?  In fact, we even have two busmen's unions for one section of workers.  While it would probably make things easier if we had only one, let us recognise the fact that two is not a mighty number and that we should thank God we have two and not six, as we have in many other fields.</P>
    <P>About the brightest feature of the Vote for the Department of Agriculture is the continued expansion of the Agricultural Institute and its research work. I think a great deal of this is due to the dynamism of the Director and his ability to get money for projects that are so badly needed.  I wish we had somebody in the university who could work the same magic with the Department of Finance to produce results such as the Director of the Agricultural Institute has produced, and for which the country is the better.</P>
    <P>On the question of agriculture and of adaptation for entry into the European Economic Community, we find no provision for the real problem, that is, the education of those at present engaged in agriculture.  We had the winter schools but much more needs to be done.  Indeed, I think we badly need a crash programme in that respect.  We also need a programme that will bring the amenities of the modern age to the farmer.  I am not referring now to running water, electricity, and so on, which we have got, but to the right to a little leisure.  That leisure is of the type that if the farmer is sick, he does not have to struggle out in the morning to milk the cows, but can call in a relief worker from the co-op.  If he wants a night off, he can make arrangements to have a relief worker, or if he wants a week off he can make similar arrangements.  If he is so old that he can no longer cope with the dairying job, he can let it on contract to the co-op.  In other words, what we need, if we are to face the <Col N="487" /> EEC with confidence in our agricultural capacity and in its development, is a very rapid and dramatic development of the co-operative movement&mdash;the co-operative movement that provides the relief work services, that provides the machinery on contract or sharing with the people in its district and, in general, that makes life tolerable for those working in that area.  I think that is the most essential requirement in adapting agriculture for the Common Market.</P>
    <P>I had intended to go quite a long way on another adaptation.  I can make only a few references to it now. I refer to the adaptation of the Civil Service to meet the challenge of the Common Market.  Nobody can be happy at the moment with our system as it is.  Granted we have unimpeachable integrity and hard work from the top officials but the system simply defeats itself.  We can see that they are quite worried about this system in Britain.  On the Continent there is far more flexibility in their civil service than there is in ours.  There, they have developed the means of getting the technical contribution.  In other words, the fact that a man has a degree in Science or is qualified as a specialist in some line, does not, as it appears to do here, exclude him from posts of policy-making and high administrative posts.  I think it all comes back to the closed shop and the restrictive practices that we deplore in many other fields.  There is nowhere in this country where the closed shop and restrictive practices are more rampant than in our Civil Service&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;No, not in the universities, as I shall prove.  In the Civil Service, once a young man is recruited at 18, that almost ends the Civil Service recruitment.  It is almost the parallel of the religious Orders in Italy where they have come under fire for getting their postulants at 11 years of age and keeping them shut away from the world from that time onwards.  In a world where higher education is more and more important and where more and more <Col N="488" /> people are able to study for a degree, the aim should be to recruit more and more degree holders into the Civil Service.  Select at a later age.  The only later selection we have at the moment is for Administrative Officers.  We shall have to go much higher than that. Why not have open competitions for assistant principals and principal officers? Some of our best men have gone abroad and won their spurs in concerns outside this country.  Why not give those people an opportunity to come home and to compete for these top posts in our community?</P>
      <P>In answer to Senator Murphy, I might point out that the university would not dream of closing its posts to a selection based on the age of 21, much less 18.  Indeed, all the posts are fully open at all levels and invariably in my experience, the best men have got the posts there.  I might say that the proof of that is that on our staffs today, we have men who can occupy similar or higher posts under any university system anywhere in the world.  In fact, they are constantly being enticed away from us.  Of course, we also have our black sheep, but what profession has not?  That is the price we pay for freedom.  That is the price we pay for allowing the individual to be in a position to work 60 or 70 hours a week, while on the other side, we have to cater for the fellow who will work only 20 hours a week.</P>
      <P>I suggest that we should liberalise our whole Civil Service system.  I should like to see the present leaders of the Civil Service, men for whom I would have a very high regard, relieved of their responsibilities for six months or a year every five or six years and allowed to go abroad to study for a year, be it becoming part of a research team in America, Britain or elsewhere or going into a university, say, as research workers, visiting professors or what not.  The same goes for Ministers, if we could in any way ensure this policy.  That is the price we have to pay for originality.  In the modern scientific age, it is by originality we expand and make our mark as a nation, not by knowing why things cannot be done, as has been the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="489" /> If my suggestion ever comes about, we in UCC will be very delighted to welcome many people.  I should dearly love to put the distinguished Secretary of the Department of Finance into UCC as a visiting professor of economics for a year.  When he would return, even if his sojourn were only 160 miles from the capital, it would have a tremendous revitalising effect. It would be a wonderful experience for anyone to get away from the grind. Indeed, in the university we regard it as absolutely essential.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, certainly, the same as any department anywhere can do with being revitalised.  It is only by going abroad and seeing how others do things that we can achieve that. By all means, give the recruits to the Civil Service system coming in as executive officers at the age of 18, the opportunity to earn a degree, if you think they are that good, but then let them go back in full competition with other graduates who have come up in other ways for the posts that are available.  It is only by having full competition that we can get out of our present straitjacket.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings me to the last item, that is, the recent very severe criticisms of our departments by Lieutenant-General Costello.  I am not taking sides, but these criticisms have been made by a person of undoubted standing in our community, a man who over the past 20 years has contributed more to the advance of the country than any other single person.  Consequently, when such charges have been made, they should be taken seriously, even if the end result is that they are totally disproved. I ask the Leas-Chathaoirleach to see if he can get a Seanad inquiry into that matter.  I suggest that a commission should be set up here of members of the Seanad under the chairmanship of the Leas-Chathaoirleach, to act as a proper commission, take evidence and issue a report.  If the Government feel that the statement has been completely wrong, they have nothing to <Col N="490" /> fear in such a commission.  We would do a wonderful service to the country in this Christmas week if, as a result of staying here tonight, we set up such a commission.  I formally ask the Leas-Chathaoirleach to see what he can do about that, because, as the House knows, the Leas-Chathaoirleach is chairman of all sub-Committees set up by the Seanad.</P>
    <P>We have to break new ground and we have to move on.  That brings me to the type of public inquiry we have got, not the one that I am proposing now, but, for instance, the inquiry proceeding at the moment in Limerick. I do not want to say anything about that: it is <i>sub judice</i>.  I want the House to realise that the situation is that there is a charge made against a local educational body.  That charge may involve the Department of Education. Indeed, the published evidence would seem to suggest that it does. Yet, the chairman is assistant secretary of the Department of Education. Where are all the judges gone or where are all the other people outside those bodies that one could not be put in as independent chairman of that inquiry?  Certainly, as it is at present, it is a practice that should be deplored.  We should ask the Government not to set up what purports to be a public inquiry, unless they can produce a chairman who is demonstrably neutral in the matter.  I am not reflecting on the competence of the individual concerned but I have shown the House that his connection with one of the bodies is much too close.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to issue a challenge to the Minister, who, incidentally, I have praised, that he faces the biggest task of his career in getting the Civil Service moulded into the dynamic instrument it should be, if we are to succeed in the European Common Market.  He can take courage and confidence from the fact that he is assisted by the one civil servant known to everybody as a person of outstanding ability and for his outstanding work, Dr. Whitaker, and it is high time that others of our civil servants should be become better known to the public.  We have a team <Col N="491" /> that can do this job and on their success depends our success in the Common Market, if we get there.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other speakers and I think I will conclude, like Senator O'Kennedy, with a few final figures I want the House to think over during the vacation.  I have asked the House to think on the university and on its central role.  In other words, we live by science and we will live by it increasingly in future.  I want the House also to consider that when an educational system expands, be it by way of the secondary school or the vocational school or the university, if we increase our capacity by 300 students, that represents 300 persons taken off the labour market here permanently.  It is the same as if we had a factory there that had 300 employees.  Indeed, in a sense you can regard those as workers producing a product, because if the system were working producing colour television sets outside, they would be engaged in an industry and those sets would be bought by members of the community and so the industry would be a sound one.</P>
    <P>In the case of education, the students and the staff are working together on a common enterprise.  That common enterprise is paid for, mainly by the parents of the students, at the rate of about £350 per annum per student.  The students are the end product.  Still, that end product contains a very large deferred production element because not alone are they producing an article that is being bought by somebody at that time but their contribution in future to the State is greatly increased, due to the training they have got.</P>

I ask the Minister, the secretary and all Members here if at any time <Col N="492" /> they want to see what real overcrowding and real slum conditions in education are, to come down to us and see for themselves and see what must we do so that we can play our proper part in the education of our young men and women to face the challenge of the Common Market.</P>

      <P>In view of the amount that has already been said on general Government policy, and the time, and the fact that there are at least two Senators still waiting to speak, I shall not make any effort, as I had intended to, to deal with Government policy generally and, in particular, with the various allegations made by speakers opposite about Government policy. I shall confine myself to making one completely non-political appeal to the Minister.  It is an appeal arising out of a very disturbing and annual report issued recently by An Comhairle Ealaíon.  In the report Father O'Sullivan, the Director, points out in the introduction that over the past few years the amount spent on music has been steadily increasing and he has come to the view that this increase&mdash; it is now about 50 per cent of the total expenditure of the Council&mdash;is unduly depressing the amount available for the visual arts, such as architecture, sculpture, painting, design and so on.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>Be that as it may, he has come to this conclusion.  According to him, it will be necessary in future to reduce the amount spent on music.  This is very serious from the point of view of Irish music, and particularly from the point of view of Irish music in the provinces.  By far the greater number of grants made by the Arts Council relate to activities outside Dublin.  I do not worry so much about Dublin because there are other sources, perhaps, to which Dublin musical organisations may apply for help, if the Arts Council is unable to continue to give them suport.  Certainly there is a greater tradition of music in Dublin and, from that point of view, it is easer to get an audience in Dublin.  If one takes all the music <Col N="493" /> over the year in Dublin, only a very small proportion is helped by the Arts Council.</P>
      <P>The provinces are a different matter. It is not untrue to say that until recently in the smaller towns and rural areas, Ireland was a musical desert.  It is only in recent years that the smaller towns and some of the larger ones, such as Limerick&mdash;I will not mention Cork&mdash;and Waterford and Wexford have begun to engage in musical activities.  The list given here in the report of grants made last year in the 12 months ending 31st March shows the type of activity which has been helped by the Council.  There were ten performances of opera in different country towns.  This is a very valuable institution.  There was grand opera in Waterford.  There was help given to the opera society in Kilrush, Clare.  There is a very excellent grand opera society in Ballinrobe.  That has been very successful in the past few years.  It is a town which never before had anything like that.  There were concert recitals in secondary schools in Waterford, Cork and Limerick. There was a performance of <i>The Messiah</i> in Limerick and another performance by the Sligo Celtic Singers. There were ten concerts in country towns by the Irish Chamber Orchestra, another excellent institution which has unfortunately died, for reasons into which we need not go now.  There was the schools choral festival in Castleblaney and Féile na Scoileanna in Kilkenny.  These valuable activities would never have taken place without help from the Arts Council and, if the Arts Council does have to cut down on its grants, many of these activities will cease and there will be no further extension, the sort of extension we would all hope for in music in rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The answer to the problem is, of course, more money.  I know the Minister is interested in music.  I have no knowledge of the Arts Council, beyond its own report.  I do not know if they have applied for more money but I assume that, like everybody else at this time of year, they probably have. The present grant is £40,000.  That is <Col N="494" /> very small compared with the money devoted to cultural activities in other countries and much smaller than the amount available to a similar body in Northern Ireland.  It is smaller than the amount in any other small country on the Continent about which I know.  Relatively speaking, the amount needed is a drop in the bucket.  I know that, if you have enough drops in the bucket, you eventually fill it.</P>

      <P>A thousand here and a thousand there soon add up to a million.  This is a case in which a relatively small sum of money&mdash; £5,000 or £10,000&mdash;would make a very great difference, particularly in rural Ireland.  Cultural activies in areas outside of the bigger cities are worthy of help, and I hope when the Minister gets, as I assume he will, the annual request from the Arts Council for a larger grant, he will on this occasion find it possible to give something more.  Otherwise, I can see a very serious situation arising outside of Dublin where music is concerned and that situation could set back for years the very valuable progress which has been taking place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Labour Party spokesman, and having got in somewhat belatedly, it might, I suppose, be appropriate to remind the Seanad of some of the unpleasant facts in the present situation.  We are now in Christmas week and we are, I suppose, fairly well circumstanced.  We should not, I think, forget the situation of many of our fellow-citizens.  There are about 500,000 among us who are dependent upon social welfare&mdash;old age pensioners, widows, orphans, the unemployed, and so on.  They are depending upon a rather miserable standard of living, if one can call it living.  That is not, however, the whole picture.  We have some 40,000 farm workers.  In answer to a question in the Dáil recently, it was disclosed that the average wage of an agricultural labourer, after the tenth round, is £9 0s 6d a week.  If one adds in their dependants, one possibly gets about <Col N="495" /> £12.  There are thousands of what are commonly referred to as road workers, local authority employees, who have not very much more than the agricultural average of £9 0s 6d a week. There are thousands of what are called lower paid workers, mainly women, many of whom are paid less than £10 per week.</P>
      <P>These are rather unpleasant facts of which to remind the House in Christmas week, but they are facts and we, in the Labour Party, remind ourselves always, and everybody else, that we are our brother's keeper.  This, again, is not the whole picture.  I referred to the number dependent upon social welfare.  Of these, 50,000 are unemployed, and it is unfortunately true that the number of unemployed is tending to grow week by week.  We see the figures.  We have difficulty in following them since their presentation was changed, but that is roughly the situation; it is true that, unfortunately, they are tending to increase.  We all know that the overall number in employment has dropped this year and a further drop is expected next year. That is in relation to overall employment, industrial employment and agricultural employment.</P>
      <P>We will be told that the flight from the land is not peculiar to Ireland, and this is true, it is common in most western European countries and in America.  Here, however, we are failing to provide alternative employment in industry.  It is true that in recent years the numbers employed in industry have grown but only in odd years has the growth been sufficient to take up the employment loss in agriculture. In the past six months there has been no growth in industrial employment. This failure to expand employment in industry will have its side effects.  No doubt when the Minister comes to prepare his Budget he will find that there is no great buoyancy in revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While taxation is not a subject for debate under this measure it might be no harm if we reminded ourselves that this Minister and the Government are tied to and believe in a policy of indirect taxation rather than direct taxation. In other words, we are now <Col N="496" /> saying that the people to whom we have been referring, people on the breadline, possibly one out of every four of the population, must have further taxation levied on them rather than on the people with the greater ability to pay.  No doubt we will hear more about this and I can promise the Minister that the Labour Party will be fighting him strenuously over the application of this policy. The economic position that we have at the moment is the result of a deflationary policy deliberately introduced to deal with the balance of payments problem.  Last year the adverse balance was about £53 million.  I am not criticising the introduction of a deflationary policy to deal with the situation, it was necessary, but I am suggesting that the policy adopted was too strong and while we have corrected the balance of payments problem we are in danger, so to speak, of killing the patient.  While the adverse balance was £53 million last year the Department of Finance earlier this year envisaged an adverse balance of payments of £28 million this year.  The implication was that that would be a satisfactory situation.  In fact, it looks now as if it will be less than £20 million.  In other words, the steps taken have been too successful.  This is not offered as a criticism because every Government has to try to deal with such a situation. It is a matter of judgment as to how far you go and you have largely to guess.</P>
    <P>This was a pretty successful guess but now we are stuck in a deflationary situation and the suspicion is that the Government do not know how to get out of that situation.  The Labour Party and the trade union movement are worried that the Government do not know how to get out of the situation, that the measures taken have gone further than expected, that at present we have no expansion of our economy and that the situation is in danger of worsening.  The economy will not simply stand still and if we do not get it moving again it will go into a decline. I was interested to hear Senator O'Kennedy's speech.  It was a very good speech, indeed, but I was rather puzzled <Col N="497" /> when he was talking about the expansion of the economy because the impression left with us is that it is static at present and that there is every danger that if things cannot be got moving again it will go into a decline. Here I come to a criticism.  More and more we are left with the impression that while we have in Government a collection of very able and slick politicians, we have, in fact, a very poor Cabinet.  There is no clear indication of where they, as a Cabinet, want to go, except to stay in power, which is understandable.  There is no indication that they have been trying to get their priorities right.</P>
    <P>Last year we had the situation in which the Minister for Health produced a White Paper and he told us that legislation to implement the policy in the White Paper would be brought in in November but apparently that was burned by the economic blowlamp and we do not know what is happening about this policy.  The same Minister, as Minister for Education, has been promising free education and threatening that if it is not implemented next September he is going to resign.  The former Minister for Social Welfare said he would like to improve benefits if he could get the money.  We never found that Minister very forthcoming in the Seanad but I am prepared to accept from what I know of the situation that he is a man who is prepared to fight to the best of his ability for his particular responsibility and as Minister for Social Welfare he was prepared to do his best to obtain more money and benefits for social welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>Out of all this, however, we are not clear where the Government are going or what is their order of priority.  We know that we cannot have all these together. We cannot do away with the problems of the people on low incomes who are struggling to exist, and overnight we cannot have all the benefits proposed in relation to health or education, but which is going to get priority?  What will the Government do or have they made up their minds? Where are they going or are they simply going to continue to produce White Papers or build bridges when there is an election in the offing?  As I <Col N="498" /> said, we have a collection of very able and very slick politicians but we deserve and need something more than able politicians.  We want a Government and a Cabinet who are planning ahead to see how the economy can be kept developing at the fastest possible rate and how the benefits and improvements in the economy will be shared out.  There is no indication that the Government have made up their minds or that they will give leadership in regard to sharing the money.  Criticism was expressed in the Dáil about the lack of leadership or decision on the part of the Government in regard to an incomes policy.  The NIEC produced a report, or a number of them, and after that seems to have drifted away. Nothing seems to happen.  The Government, not the NIEC, have the responsibility and many of us are left with no idea or impression that the Cabinet, in fact, are in control of the situation. Perhaps they have been reshuffled too often or have not been able to get down to the job.  There is less inclination on their part to try to co-ordinate policy. I think there is no real Cabinet leadership, and this in my criticism, not what has not been done because there is no point in complaining about that.  I am not a good politician and do not want to score political points but I am looking at the situation and I see the problems. I want to know what is the Government's order of priority.  It is all very well to have White Papers and promises&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; and to be told that these will be implemented next September and that everything in the garden will be lovely.  The people will not be codded by this.  The Government are very successful in codding them at by-elections but we must really begin growing up.  We expect the Government in power to have policies, an order of priorities, and to tell the people where we are going and say: &ldquo;Let us get on with the job.&rdquo;  There is too much living from day to day, political opportunism &mdash;at which they are very good&mdash;but there is very little effort, in my opinion, <Col N="499" /> to work out the order of priorities.</P>
      <P>I want to be brief but there is another matter to which I must refer.  Unfortunately, it is another criticism.  There is an increasing tendency for Ministers and the Government to disregard the law.  This is not a charge that they are involved in illegal activities but that they are doing things which are not provided for in the law as laid down by the Oireachtas.  We had a recent case which I raised on the Adjournment here, where the Minister for Transport and Power was doing something which I argued he was not entitled to do under existing legislation. Without entering into further argument as to whether this thing was good or bad&mdash;it concerned allowing Northern Ireland lorries to operate for reward in the Republic&mdash;I am complaining that when I, as a member of a delegation from Congress, saw the Minister about this and when he told us what he was proposing to do and when I asked for the legislative authority for it, he was unable to refer me to it.  I know that in fact some civil servant probably had his holidays cancelled and was sent chasing statutes trying to find provisions in Acts which allowed the Minister to do what he had already decided to do, and he then came up with a mixture from two Acts which, quite frankly, does not meet the situation at all.  But he argued that he was entitled to do as he did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a case which the Minister knows about.  Again, strangely enough, it involved the Minister for Transport and Power when he was Minister for Lands, in relation to allowing Northern Ireland trawlers to fish in the territorial waters of the Republic.  Without entering into the argument, I insist that there was no legislative authority for doing so.  The Minister had no authority under an Act of Parliament to do what he did.  I had correspondence with the present Minister when he was Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and again he could not point to legislative authority for doing this. He says it was an administrative act. As a democrat and member of a democratic assembly I must argue that it is the Oireachtas which makes the law <Col N="500" /> and it is for the Minister to apply it and he should not go outside it.  If the law needs amendment the Minister should come to the Dáil and Seanad, have an amendment enacted and then apply it.</P>
    <P>Increasingly there is the tendency in this Government to go outside the law in such respects.  I know other instances&mdash;again, I am not pleading that this is outside the law but I think it is unfortunate and I would ask the Minister to try to rectify it&mdash;such as the situation in regard to planning. The local authorities consider applications for buildings or development work; they make up their minds and I suggest they are the best judges of the local situation.  They turn down an application for what they consider a good reason and an applicant may appeal to the Minister.  Invariably, if the Minister grants the appeal and overrules the local authority there is suspicion that this arises because of political pull, pressure or representation. We all recognise that this sort of political representation is bound to be no matter what Government is in power&mdash;I am not criticising that&mdash;to have an application granted.  That is not a good arrangement in the long run because I find that the people responsible for dealing with these situations, the planning authorities, are becoming thoroughly discouraged. In too many instances applications that they turn down for good reasons are granted and they are overruled by a Minister in Dublin, the Minister for Local Government.  This will play &ldquo;old harry&rdquo; with the idea of planning and development and preserving amenities, as we would all wish.  I do not like to see provision for appeal to the Minister.  It should be left to the planning authorities.  The local authorities are the best judges.  A least the people are elected to local authorities and you can make representations and have the position investigated and you can raise a row if a wrong decision is made.  I shall conclude on that note.  I hope I have not delayed other speakers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMolone" hpid="Mr. Malone Mr. Malone">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Malone</NameTxt>
      <P>I have about two minutes in which to put to the Minister <Col N="501" /> two requests.  One concerns the grant-in-aid to local authorities last year under which they received a 100 per cent grant towards the health services. I request that should continue in the coming year.  Local authorities are now preparing their estimates for next year and have not yet received notification, to my knowledge, that they will receive the 100 per cent grant as they did last year.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I want to ask the Minister to use his good offices to see that the inequities in the system employed by the ESB, whereby they borrow money from people who want to get connections to new houses and pay them back at no rate of interest within a year, provided they have the money, should be stopped as soon as possible. The ESB are in very good standing with the public who have money to lend and would, I am sure, get sufficient funds to carry out their necessary and desirable work for people building houses or requiring connections.</P>
      <P>I should have liked to deal with the rather vexed question of agriculture. The Minister knows as well as I do exactly what is wrong with agriculture. Now that he holds the purse-strings, I would hope that at the very earliest opportunity he would use that office to bring about the true spirit of this week, Christmas week, so that that spirit may be extended throughout the year. If he can take the farmers into his confidence and bring about stability in that industry as, indeed, in all others, he would surely have the spirit of Christmas pervading everywhere, peace on earth and goodwill to all men, which is my wish to the Minister and his colleagues as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrosnahan" hpid="Mr. Brosnahan Mr. Brosnahan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnahan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I intervene for half a minute to make one point in support of something Senator Sheehy Skeffington said earlier in relation to public service pensioners?  They have been claiming parity of pensions, as a general principle, in other words, that their pensions should be based on current salary.  They are, however, prepared to take something less than that.  At the present time they are <Col N="502" /> basing their scheme on the recommendation of a committee established by a previous Minister for Finance. They are asking that compensation should be given to them for the rise in the cost of living between February, 1964, and August, 1966.</P>
      <P>These men and women have made a significant contribution to the prosperity of the country since the time of the Treaty, and I doubt if any generation of people will make a more significant contribution.  They have no conciliation and arbitration machinery. They have no power to engage in industrial action.  They have to rely mainly upon the public conscience, and the granting of justice all around is the norm which we should all seek as a just society.  If we as people in service seek justice, we should also ensure that those who are out of service will get justice.</P>
      <P>We would ask the Minister to consider the implementation of the recommendations of the committee set up under the Department of Finance and also the recommendation made by Senator Dr. Ryan when as Minister for Finance he said in this House that he was prepared to consider the keeping of pensions abreast of the cost of living.  It is an indictment of our society if we allow so many old people to end their days in disillusionment, embitterment and anger.  It behoves us all as people who are members of the Legislature to ensure that justice is done to the people who developed this State and made it as prosperous as it is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>There is something familiar about the setting of this debate.  Once again we find ourselves with the Dáil adjourned and the Seanad debating one of the Finance Bills.  This is something with which, unfortunately, we are only too familiar. On the corresponding day of last year, what we might call the last day of term before the Christmas holidays, this House was also discussing a finance Bill, the Central Fund (Permanent Provisions) Bill.  On that occasion the Taoiseach, who was then the Minister for Finance, stated that he was aware the Bill was coming <Col N="503" /> before the House in such a fashion but he hoped that as a result of the passing of the Bill, the Seanad would never again have to debate important financial Bills on the last day of term.</P>
      <P>That worked once.  Before we broke up last July, in spite of the fact that there were two Finance Bills, the Seanad was able to dispose of both of them and then devote two full days to a consideration of legislation and the debating of a motion on the EEC. After that one example of living up to what was hoped for from this Central Fund (Permanent Provisions) Bill, those responsible for the arrangement of Government business seem to have fallen back into their old habits.</P>
      <P>I do not want to dwell on this matter, but I do want to say it is a pity there should be any limitation on debates as important as the Finance debates are for the Seanad.  This is one debate in which we have to traverse all the material that is debated for weeks and months on the Estimates in the Dáil.  It is a pity, as I say, there is any limitation on the debate.  It is a pity there is even a sense of limitation on the debate of such an important measure.</P>
      <P>The Appropriation Bill before us is a Bill which gives this House an opportunity, firstly, of reviewing the administration of the past year, and, secondly, of discussing any new plans which may have been announced by Ministers in introducing their Estimates in the Dáil.  It is always a widely ranging debate, as is the nature of all Finance debates, but it is one of the key debates of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since I came into the Seanad, this was a debate to which I always listened with great pleasure.  Indeed I always listened with particular pleasure to the ministerial reply because we were always treated to an excellent performance by the then Minister, Senator Dr. Ryan.  It was a pleasure to listen to the manner in which he meticulously answered questions that had never been asked, the way in which he trenchantly rebutted arguments that had never been put forward and, in all, gave a performance of amiable semi-relevancy which <Col N="504" /> was in the best traditions of parliamentary debate.  I have no doubt that when it comes to his turn to reply, the Minister will do his best to live up to that high standard.</P>
    <P>If we review the year that has passed, if we look back on the administration of the various Government services during that year and on the performance of the Government as a whole, what do we find?  Looking back on 1966, I think we will all agree it was an eventful year in the narrow political sense.  However, if we look beyond elections and Party affairs, was it such a significant year from the point of view of Government performance?  We end this year with not very much significant legislation.  We end the year with not much real administrative reform which is so badly needed, and we end the year with not as much economic progress as we had in previous years.</P>
    <P>If we look at the Estimates which are scheduled in this Appropriation Bill and if we as Opposition Senators ask ourselves what do we think of them, what can we conclude?  There is, of course, no question of our dividing against this Bill, but the fact that we do not intend to vote against the Bill does not mean we can be taken as approving in any way the administration which this Bill serves to finance.</P>
    <P>Of course, there are items in the Book to which we give an unqualified welcome.  Foremost among these is Vote 50, which provides £38,600 for the expense of the Department of Labour. This is indeed a welcome development. There is, as a result of the establishment of this Department and of this Ministry, a real chance to move forward in a direction in which we have been deplorably weak.  There is at last a real chance to move forward towards a manpower policy which will be worthy of the name.  It is particularly welcome to Senators on these benches that, as a result of the setting up of that Ministry, the placement offices are now being taken from the Department of Social Welfare and placed under the Manpower Agency.  So often and so vehemently did I and some of my colleagues criticise the Government's <Col N="505" /> failure to do this earlier that the Cathaoirleach was constrained to point out that I was guilty of repetition in this matter.  It is indeed very welcome that such repetition will be no longer necessary.</P>
    <P>Even if the Government have remedied their mistake in this regard the Government have now come round to the point of view we advocated so often in the debate on manpower in this House&mdash;there does not seem to be even yet a realisation by the Government of the key importance of manpower if we are to have economic progress in the future.  Although the Government have now remedied this one mistake, they seem to be making others.  We have had from the Minister for Education, in introducing his Estimate in the Dáil, an outline of a policy and a new departure in education. This is something foreshadowed in September and finally introduced within the past month.  In spite of the detail in which the Minister has outlined it, one looks in vain in the Minister's statement for his realisation of the importance of manpower in this particular new development.  One looks in vain for plans in the Minister's policy for education for the provision of the teachers who alone will make an expansion in our educational policy possible.  We apparently have from the Government no proposals in regard to the manning of the new educational system other than the very meagre references in the Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</P>
    <P>One could go through the individual Estimates and point out similar inconsistencies and similar examples of the Government taking half a step where one whole firm step was necessary.  There is not time to go into these in detail tonight but that does not mean we do not think they exist.  There are many similar points.  The fact that we tonight will agree to Vote No. 8 of over £8 million for the Office of Public Works does not mean that we, as Opposition Senators, are satisfied that the Board of Works are carrying out their public duty in failing to prevent the desecration of Dublin city at present.  The fact that we agree to <Col N="506" /> the Vote for the Department of Local Government does not mean that we are satisfied that even the present powers of planning control have been properly exercised in regard to this same matter.</P>
    <P>If we agree to Vote No. 28 for the Minister for Education, this does not mean we agree with the Government in condemning Deputy Carty for his criticism of the long delays that have resulted in the report of the Commission on Higher Education not yet being in the hands of the Government and of Parliament, while education in this country is being stultified as a result of the long term this Commission is taking to do its job.  This Commission was set up to do a job which was needed in this country as in many others.  In Britain a committee was set up after ours was set up.  Ours was set up in 1960; the Robins Committee was set up in 1961.  It reported in 1963, and we are still waiting.</P>
    <P>During the past summer I had the advantage of seeing from the inside the Australian university system.  It shows a great flowering and a great development which has many lessons for us.  This development is taking place as a result of the report of the Murray Committee on Australian Universities.  This committee was set up one January and reported, not merely to the Government but to Parliament, in the following November. As a result of the long delays which have occurred in this country, the universities are being told they cannot plan ahead.  It is public knowledge that University College, Cork, has been told it cannot plan for more than 1,500 students until the Commission reports.  Meanwhile, UCC has to accept the extra 1,000 students which now come to it for education.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that if we look back on the past year we see that there has been very little action in moves of administrative and structural reform. It is a truism, which must nevertheless be repeated, that adaptation is the key to survival.  It is the key to survival no less in economic and in international affairs as it is biologically. In times of rapid change, rapid adaptation is necessary if we are <Col N="507" /> to survive.  In this country we must have, as an integral part of our economic planning, structural reform of all types.  There have been certain moves in this direction, but they have not been nearly enough.</P>
    <P>We had during the Estimate debates in the Dáil the interesting sight&mdash;or perhaps sound would be more correct &mdash;of the Minister for Local Government taking several hours to introduce his Estimate and several hours to reply to the Estimate debate.  But throughout all this there was no reference to local government structure, to the autonomy of local government or to the essentials of local government finance.  Nevertheless, we see every year some new regional structure introduced into this country.  Some years we see more than one.  These regional divisions come one after the other.  One agency after the other, one Ministry after another, come along, take a map of Ireland and carve it up into regions.  All of these have been proposed in regard to tourism, health and many other things without regard to the local government structure.</P>
    <P>The continual postponement of the local government elections gave an opportunity for this matter to be dealt with.  But now we find that the elections are to be held next June and apparently there is not even a thought of adapting the structure of local government to the new needs.  The 1967 local elections will be held on the basis of a framework of local authorities which we inherited from the 19th century and the Minister has nothing to say about all this.  Of course, it may be that the Minister is waiting until the Fine Gael Party have completed their policy on local government because it seems there is nothing like the issuing of Fine Gael policy statements in order to provoke the Government into action.</P>

      <P>There we have the <Col N="508" /> reaction of Fianna Fáil to the Opposition doing their job in the proper manner.  We are told there is never a Fine Gael policy unless there is a by-election. We had Senator Dolan telling us that Fine Gael policies were nothing but rabbits out of hats.  We have been told that the Fine Gael policy on education is something that was produced overnight just because there was a by-election.  Nothing could be more conclusive proof that those who are talking have not read the policy they are talking about.  It may be that the Fine Gael policy on education is open to criticism.  It may be that it is open to amendment.  It may be that it does not give the correct answer to the many pressing problems of education but no man can read it and really believe that it was produced overnight or within the 14 days in which the by-election was fought.  The Fine Gael policy on education took six months, and six months of very hard work, to draw up and the Fine Gael policies which have been produced in this matter, and in particular, this particular rabbit that Senator Dolan was talking about, can compare with the policies produced by the Fianna Fáil Party with the full resources of Government behind them.  The Fine Gael policy on education goes into more detail, deals with more aspects of education than does the much heralded statement of the Minister for Education which he made when introducing his Estimate.</P>

      <P>The position is that in regard to education as in regard to other matters, the Fine Gael Party have been in Opposition with all the limitations and have produced policy statements that can stand comparison with what Fianna Fáil are able to produce in Government and this is a tough thing for it to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we really took the right comparison, we would compare what Fine <Col N="509" /> Gael are now doing in Opposition with what Fianna Fáil did in Opposition. Let us contrast the policies that Fine Gael can produce with what Fianna Fáil produced when they were in Opposition.  All they could produce in Opposition was an announcement made in Clery's Ballroom that they had a policy for 100,000 new jobs, and how well was this costed?  How well were the taxes which were going to support this designated?  How thorough was this?  How much of a white rabbit was this particular announcement? There was some costing; a little bit of simple multiplication that 100,000 new jobs could be produced on a capital expenditure of £100 million.  This is what Fianna Fáil could produce in Opposition and they think that Fine Gael are doing no more.</P>
    <P>The fact is that they do not read the Fine Gael policy statements before they decry them.  We recently had on television a Minister who made a statement that something was not in the Fine Gael policy statement on the Just Society.  When it was pointed out to him that he appeared to be quoting from the summary rather than the full document, he made a remark to the effect that, having read the summary, he did not feel like reading the full document.  If Ministers and other members of the Fianna Fáil Party wish to contradict, if they wish to argue about our policy, for goodness' sake let them read it.  Fine Gael will not be intimidated in this matter. They will not stop the work they have started because of any such sneers or jibes.  Fine Gael will continue to produce policy statements and will continue to study the various aspects of Government and produce policy statements based on their considerations. Fine Gael in this matter have got faith in the rising generation of this country who wish for something more than political beliefs based on emotions. We believe in putting forward alternative policies before those who are prepared to read the contrasting policies and make up their minds.  It is on this that we are pinning our hopes, perhaps foolishly, but this is what we intend to do.</P>
    <P>If we look back on this debate what <Col N="510" /> do we find?  Following the Minister's formal introduction of the debate, the debate was opened by Senator FitzGerald. In his speech he talked of the economic position of this country.  He talked of our relations with the EEC and he raised a number of minor points, notably the role of the Civil Service and of senior civil servants in these times of economic development. His speech was replied to on behalf of Fianna Fáil by Senator Dolan supported by interruptions by the Minister. What were the answers to what Senator FitzGerald put forward?  Senator FitzGerald stated, and I think this is an uncontested fact, that during 1965 economic growth in this country was about 2½ per cent.  He put forward a reasonable estimate that in the year 1966 economic growth in this country would not be much above one half per cent.  Senator Dolan's reply was that this story of gloom, as he called it, was easily disproved because the yardstick was the result of the by-elections and as a result of the vote in South Kerry and Waterford Senator Dolan was able to get up here in the House and announce that emigration had now fallen to 12,000 per year despite the fact that all the figures available indicate that emigration is now running at about 30,000 per year. All this on a majority of 700 votes in each constituency.  If the Fianna Fáil majority had been 2,000 what could Senator Dolan not have done?  By the use of this yardstick, he might, indeed, have been able to reduce emigration to 5,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that in these by-elections a Fianna Fáil majority of 2,000 in each case was whittled down to 700 but it allows Senator Dolan to contradict the statistics brought forward by Senator FitzGerald.  I wish he would be just a <Col N="511" /> little more quantitative.  I wish he would just tell us what sort of a majority it takes to increase the growth rate of the country to one per cent.  If we only knew this we could then go out and fight by-elections and know that in this way we might be able to get back towards the target of a four per cent growth rate.</P>
      <P>The position is, of course, that Senator FitzGerald was not discussing in this debate the political results of the by-elections.  He was discussing the state of the economy.  He was discussing the extent to which the Government had realised during the past year the targets which they themselves had put forward in the Second Programme for Economic Expansion, the same targets as every country, democratic or non-democratic, puts before itself in these modern times, the targets of economic growth, of reasonably full employment, of stable prices and a fair measure of balance of payments.  These are the targets we face this year, and every year, in this country and it is no answer to the criticism&mdash;indeed not criticism but a mere factual recitation of the fact that we are not attaining them&mdash;to produce by-election figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anyway what were these by-election results which have caused cock crows to rise from the Fianna Fáil benches throughout the debate on the Appropriation Bill?  The position is that in two constituencies in which Fianna Fáil had majorities of 2,000 at the last general election and at the Presidential election, Fianna Fáil now have majorities of 700.  Fianna Fáil, in these recent by-elections, did worse than in the last general election when they failed to secure an overall majority in the country.  All that Senator Dolan may say about the plain people of Ireland not being deceived by Senator FitzGerald and other Fine Gael speakers will not wipe out those facts or the fact that even the plain people of Cavan, as Senator Dolan knows, did not give Fianna Fáil an overall majority in 1965.  The position is that last June the Fianna Fáil Presidential candidate had a majority of 10,000 <Col N="512" /> over the whole country&mdash;4,000 I would say in Kerry and Waterford and that has been whittled down to 1,400.</P>

      <P>Many times in this debate a nice atmosphere existed which, perhaps, is appropriate to Christmas time.  There has been a remembrance of things past that has been almost Dickensian.  We had this looking back which happens all over the city of Dublin during this week when friends gather and talk to one another about Christmas times.  We had it, too, here in the House&mdash;this remembrance of things past, so much so that one would almost expect, at the conclusion of the debate, that the Cathaoirleach might lead us in the singing of &ldquo;Auld Lang Syne&rdquo; except, perhaps, that the lyric would have to be a bit altered to go something like this:</P>
      <P>Should old quotations be forgot and never used to rile;</P>
      <P>Should old statistics be forgot or used for one last jibe.</P>

      <P>Many pleasant pictures were painted in the course of the debate and I should like to place on record how much I enjoyed the thesis put forward by Senator Dr. Ryan that the NFA of 1966 were none other than the very same persons who comprised the United Irish League in 1918.  I had an immediate mental picture of those people who were tremendously active in the United Irish League at that period acting as pacemakers on the march to Dublin. It may be, of course, that the thesis which he put forward was genealogical rather than personal, and perhaps we should interpret it in this way.</P>

      <P>The second point which Senator FitzGerald discussed, and which came into the debate from time to time, was the question of our relations with the EEC.  He mentioned in this regard&mdash;it was, perhaps, a commentary, perhaps not&mdash;that the copies of the Treaty of Rome were not available in the Sales Office maintained by the Stationery Office, whereupon the Minister indicated that he thought by now everybody knew the Treaty of Rome backwards.  Well, it became quite evident in the course of the debate that whatever about knowing the Treaty of Rome backwards, several of the Fianna Fáil Senators certainly knew the Fine Gael attitude to EEC backwards, because that is exactly how they expressed it.  Senator Dolan said that Fine Gael wanted to go into the EEC without Britain, and Fine Gael, of course, have never advocated any such policy.  What Fine Gael have advocated is that it would be prudent that early discussions should take place between Ireland and officials in Brussels and that we should not necessarily wait until discussions and negotiations with Britain had concluded before we started our own discussion. That is the Fine Gael attitude which has been clearly expressed on many occasions.</P>
      <P>In the course of his speech, Senator Dolan said that, of course, on all matters the Fianna Fáil policy was clearly known but the Fianna Fáil policy on this matter has not been clearly known until very recently and I am not so sure that it is quite precisely known even at the moment. There was no indication from Fianna Fáil, until a few days ago, that there was any merit in the Fine Gael proposal that discussions should take place in Brussels, not necessarily full negotiations but discussions of some type, before the British really came to grips with the Commission in their full negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The members of the Fianna Fáil Party and others, who read the <i>Irish Press</i>, were able to read in Monday's <i>Irish Press</i> that the Government had decided to follow up the Brussels visit, irrespective of the recent British initiative. <Col N="514" /> This was an indication that Fianna Fáil were now following the Fine Gael attitude but apparently some people who had misunderstood the Fine Gael approach were similarly misunderstanding the statement of the Taoiseach and it was necessary for the Taoiseach to state that there had been loose interpretation of what he had said and that the position would become clearer after Mr. Wilson and Mr. Brown had paid their mid-February visits to the various European capitals. I must say that it is still not tremendously clear precisely what is the Fianna Fáil attitude.  They apparently now believe in some discussions prior to British negotiations but it would appear they do not believe in having any discussions until Mr. Wilson and Mr. Brown have been round the European capitals and until the Taoiseach has again discussed the matter with Mr. Wilson.</P>
    <P>There were many other points which came up in this debate&mdash;many points made from this side of the House which I should like to underline and many points from the far side I should like to rebut.  There was just one other point I should like to talk about.  That is the one raised by Senator FitzGerald in regard to the role of the Civil Service in relation to policy and the announcement of policy.  It must immediately be said that senior civil servants and secretaries of Departments are in a real dilemma in this matter because it is necessary, if we are to progress, that Civil Service Departments should shake off many of their traditional attitudes and procedures. We are thankful to Deputy Lemass for the phrase he used many years ago of Civil Service Departments becoming development corporations.  Now there is a real difficulty here for the senior officials of these Departments to convert their traditional Civil Service Departments into development corporations without stepping beyond the bounds of prudence in regard to open public discussion by them of what is result of political decisions.  There have been instances recently where these essentially political policy made as a <Col N="515" /> bounds of prudence have been overstepped. It is, I think, understandable in the circumstances but, nevertheless, it is regrettable and, while we from this side of the House do say it is regrettable, we do understand how such a matter can arise and, indeed, we would be prepared to accept this as perhaps, an initial cost of trying to transform the individual Government Departments.  If initial moves in this direction do show some lack of prudence, at least they also show some movement.</P>
    <P>We have had during the past year a lack of real planning, a lack of integrated planning, a lack of involvement of subsidiary bodies in planning, that has hampered our economic progress. However, I hope the House will have an opportunity to discuss this matter in further detail when the Government have revised the Second Programme for Economic Expansion.  In this respect I should like to ask the Minister the specific question, when he hopes to be able to publish this revised programme.</P>
    <P>It is difficult for those of us who are attempting to follow the progress of the Second Programme&mdash;indeed, it is difficult for us in Fine Gael who are trying to formulate alternative policies&mdash;to be working against the background of a document which is now so badly out of date.  It is no harm to point out here in the House many of the divergencies between the Second Programme as carried out and the Second Programme as planned.  We pointed out the dangers when the Programme was discussed in this House.</P>
    <P>I indicated here in March, 1964, when discussing the Second Programme that I considered the employment targets too optimistic, and that the assumptions in regard to capital inflow were also too optimistic. Above all, the criticism which I made at that time was that there seemed to be too little provision for adjusting the Programme to the deviations that might arise.  I argued this at some length on the Central Fund Bill of that year.  It would appear from what we have seen, and it appears from a reading of the Progress Reports which <Col N="516" /> have issued, that the reaction to the deviations of the Programme has been sluggish.  There was no built-in control mechanism which would automatically bring the Programme back on target in the event of unforeseen developments occurring.  I hope to discuss this matter in greater detail in the future, but it is something which I think should be mentioned in a review of the past year.</P>
    <P>There has been a lack of adaptation in many respects.  Above all, there has been a lack of structural reform in the public service and also, of course, in the private sector.  The Government have shown in the past year an exaggerated idea of their own importance and their own powers.  They are deluding themselves into thinking that because the results of the Kerry and Waterford by-elections have given them a majority in the House, that is a clear indication of majority approval for them all over the country for what they have done during the past year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel a little guilty at taking up the time of the House at this late hour. For that reason, I may not deal as fully with the debate as I would have done if we were concluding at a more reasonable time.</P>
      <P>Let me deal first of all with the complaint which some Senators have made about the lateness of the time at which this Appropriation Bill has come before the House.  It has been suggested that it is so late, in fact, that it rules out any realistic consideration of Government expenditure this year.  I want to remind the Seanad that this comes about because, in an endeavour to facilitate a fuller discussion of our financial business, we made considerable changes in the statutory arrangements governing financing.  Because of the passing of the Central Fund (Permanent Provisions) Act, 1965, we no longer need a Vote on Account and an annual Central Fund Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This permanent Act now provides that up to four-fifths of the amount appropriated for a particular service in the previous year's Appropriation Act is available in the coming year. <Col N="517" /> Of course, the amount which may be issued under this provision is adjusted as each Estimate is passed by the Dáil.  I want to remind the House that these provisions were introduced to take the pressure off this debate and to enable a fuller discussion in the Dáil, certainly, of the various Estimates and indeed of the Finance Bill itself.</P>
    <P>When Senators criticise the fact that this Appropriation Bill has come here in the month of December only, it must be remembered that my predecessor when introducing the permanent Act did indicate that the four-fifths was intended to carry us through until about December.  So it was certainly visualised that the Appropriation Bill might not be passed before the month of December.</P>
    <P>Senator McQuillan made the point that, in his opinion, the Seanad is now really only doing the work of the Public Accounts Committee, without the ability to call the Accounting Officers before it to answer questions. Of course that is not a valid comparison. The Seanad still has all its ability and capacity to discuss policy in detail.  The Public Accounts Committee is concerned exclusively with administration.  Senators, I suppose, will always feel a little aggrieved over the financial business, but I do not think there is any way out.  After all, the Dáil is the House which has the ultimate and real control over the financial business and public expenditure. In this regard we are in the hands of the Dáil.  Until the Dáil gives us the Estimates, we cannot get the Appropriation Bill.</P>
    <P>We may not get the Appropriation Bill to the Seanad for a variety of reasons.  There were two principal reasons this year.  One was the extra Budget, and the other was that there was a change of Government which involved lengthy discussions in the Dáil.  For those two principal reasons, and others, the debate on the Estimates in the Dáil this year were very protracted and resulted in our getting the Appropriation Bill to the Seanad at this time only.  I will certainly undertake to endeavour to bring the <Col N="518" /> Appropriation Bill here as early as possible.  I should like to give Senators the opportunity of discussing it in less straitened circumstances than this year.  I cannot do any more than promise to use my best endeavours in that regard.</P>
    <P>This debate ranged over a very wide field.  Fine Gael and Labour speakers seem to me to have covered themselves in a variety of contradictions in dealing with it.  I want to say at the outset that I will ignore what I consider to be Senator O'Quigley's scandalous contribution to the debate.  Senator O'Quigley has the temerity to talk about morality and upbraid myself and other Ministers for not treating this House with due deference, while at the same time he attempts to use the Seanad as a platform for what I can only regard as a scandalous purpose.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald works hard at conveying our impression of omniscience. His diagnosis is always the correct one, his prescription always the right one.  Everybody else is either ignorant or incompetent.  I find this rather trying.  Indeed, when I went to look at his contribution carefully, I came across some obvious contradictions. On the one hand, the Government were accused of being too deflationary in their approach and on the other hand, accused of excessive expenditure.  He indicated that it was not strictly necessary to have exact balancing of the Budget while at the same time he demanded that the Government should borrow less, without apparently adverting to the fact that, if we have a Budget deficit, we must borrow to meet it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>These are some of the discrepancies that appeared in his contribution.  He asked some specific questions which I should like to deal with.  The first was when he asked about the NIEC Report No. 11 in which the Council dealt with the question of an incomes policy in the context of their review of the situation in <Col N="519" /> 1965.  The position is that this report raised many issues which called for either action or further examination by the Government and these matters have all been the subject, for some time, of examination and consideration by the Departments concerned.  As a result of that examination and consideration, it has been decided to bring the whole report on the incomes policy back to the Council for further discussion in the light of Departmental comments, and a memorandum incorporating Departmental comments has been circulated to the general purposes committee of the Council.</P>
      <P>Senator FitzGerald was also concerned to know about the demographic forecast.  The position is that this is in fact done for the Development Division of my Department and the NIEC by the Central Statistics Office.  In regard to the revision of the targets in the Second Programme, I can only suggest that he wait until we publish the results of our examination and review. As to Senator Dooge's question on the same matter, I cannot give any specific reply except to say there will not be any unnecessary delay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would hope so.  In any economy, of course, the balance of payments position is a crucial factor. This is particularly important in our economy where such a high proportion of our national product is related to external trade.  About 60 per cent is our figure compared with 35 per cent in the United Kingdom and an average of less than 40 per cent for the EEC countries.  In view of this, it is only natural that attention during the past year or so should be specifically focussed on the balance of payments position and the problems which arose as a result of developments in that sector.  The sequence of events which took place in 1965 and formed trends for 1966 are fairly well known and can be summarised briefly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first development to which I shall advert is the serious deterioration <Col N="520" /> in our balance of payments position in the first half of 1965.  It will be remembered that exports fell substantially below the level of the year before, while imports were continuing to rise, and all the indications were that unless some corrective action were taken, we would end the year with a deficit of £50 million.  That, in 1965, compared with a deficit of £30 million odd in 1964 and £22 million in 1963. This serious situation was particularly underlined by the fact that between December, 1964, and July, 1965, there was a fall in our external reserves of £39 million.</P>
    <P>The Government, during a period of some months, took a series of measures to bring this situation under control.  The measures we took were reinforced by the credit policy of the Central Bank.  In the second half of 1965, as those measures began to take effect, the balance of payments and the reserves position improved.  However, for the year as a whole we finished with a deficit of £42 million and our external reserves fell by £18 million.  This was a considerable improvement on what looked like happening about July of 1965, but it was still a very serious situation with which to finish a year.  It meant it was necessary to continue to watch the balance of payments situation during 1966 and to ensure there would be no premature relaxation of control which would operate to disimprove the situation again and allow it to deteriorate.</P>
    <P>In fact, as it turned out, the trend of our external payments in 1966 was satisfactory.  In the first ten months, merchandise exports rose by 7½ per cent while our merchandise imports fell by £5½ million, or two per cent&mdash; a net improvement in our trading position of £19½ million in regard to import excess.  When you add to that an improvement in the net receipts from invisible items, it further reduces the balance of payments deficit in 1966 to something below £20 million.  I cannot see the validity of the Opposition's criticism of that picture.  This shows that the Government handled the situation with delicacy and skill, that in fact <Col N="521" /> they applied just the right degree of corrective measures and that they were successful in a classic way.  The copybook way of solving a balance of payments situation is to increase exports and if possible, decrease imports.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt Senator FitzGerald.  When I mentioned this figure of £20 million as a deficit on our balance of payments situation, I should have said it looks like the deficit we will have for the calendar year.  It corresponds with £42 million in 1965, £31 million in 1964 and £22 million in 1963.  While the contribution which our reduced imports&mdash;£5½ million or two per cent&mdash;was very useful in bettering our external trading position, undoubtedly the most encouraging feature in the situation was the increase in exports, when one thinks that during 1966 we had to face a situation in which cattle prices fell pretty disastrously in our main market, in which our very lucrative market in the EEC countries was virtually closed to us, in which we still had the levy in the United Kingdom, again our principal market, on industrial products and in which there was a slump in the UK economy to contend with.  When you take all those factors into account, a rise of 7½ per cent in our exports is a very remarkable achievement indeed.</P>
      <P>There has been some discussion about capital inflow and our external reserves.  Here I must confess that I am a little puzzled about what Senator Dooge said at the conclusion of his remarks because the Second Programme, if I remember the figures offhand, envisaged a capital inflow of only £16 million.  In fact, even in the worst year so far, we have not fallen far short of that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senators know, in the year 1965 the capital inflow was about £25 million which is considerably in excess of the £16 million which the Second Programme envisaged.  I am not arguing the statistics of this. I am just saying that I was a little puzzled when Senator Dooge suggested we were not, in fact, throughout the Programme, reaching the capital inflow that had been envisaged. In this regard I mentioned that 1964 was exceptionally high when we got in about £36 million.  Of course, since then the situation has been adversely affected by developments abroad, particularly in the two great capital exporting countries&mdash;the United Kingdom and the US.  Those countries, for their own reasons, have imposed restrictions of one sort or another. That has had the effect of reducing the capital inflow into this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This, as I said, was bound to have a very positive effect on our situation. The voluntary capital inflow during 1966 has, of course, been supplemented by direct Government borrowing abroad which amounted to £22 million.  Of that we got £8 million from the International Monetary Fund.  Here again the Fine Gael criticism does not seem to me to be valid or acceptable. We were able to maintain Government expenditure at the level we thought was necessary and desirable because we did this.  I do not think it is logical for Fine Gael, on the one hand, to criticise the Government for going abroad to borrow capital so that we could keep our capital expenditure at the level we wished, and at the same time, to criticise the Government for <Col N="523" /> not having a sufficiently large capital expenditure programme.  All the criticism from the Opposition in the Dáil, certainly, and to a very considerable extent, in the Seanad, has been that the Government have cut back on their capital expenditure and that they have not been making capital available for all the things some of them desire.  At the same time, they criticise the Government for attempting to keep the capital expenditure up to the level of their targets by borrowing abroad.</P>

      <P>Maybe Senator FitzGerald is not guilty but we cannot so readily absolve all the members of his Party.  I gathered from Senator FitzGerald's remarks that he was criticising us for not reflating as quickly as he would like.  If we had not, by means of this borrowing at home and abroad, kept our capital programme up to the level we considered desirable we would not be able to reflate anything like as quickly as we hope to be able to.  In fact, not alone have we kept up our capital programme to the targets we had decided on, but during the year we actually added £1,500,000 expenditure to the housing sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the situation of our reserves at present, it is difficult to make an assessment because of the aftermath of the bank strike and so on. However, there are indications that a very substantial recovery did take place in our reserves in 1966.  In November, the net external reserves of the Central Bank amounted to £240 million, which represented an increase of £16,500,000 on those at the same time a year ago.  Now to come to the Exchequer position.  From the point of view of Government financing, there has been a significant improvement in 1966 as compared with 1965.  In 1965, the three main influences which affected the economy were the growth in Government current expenditure and capital expenditure, the growth in incomes and increases in credit. Difficulties arose in financing the <Col N="524" /> Exchequer requirements in both the Current and Capital account.  Because we were left with a deficit of £8 million on current account during 1965, the Government found it necessary to take very positive measures to cut back the upsurge taking place in capital expenditure which was rapidly outrunning the normal resources available. As it happens, to finance the public capital programme and the current deficit in 1965, we had to have recourse to the banks for £31,500,000 and to external borrowing for an extra £15 million.  However, in the current financial year we hope to do a great deal better than that.</P>
    <P>The Budget which was introduced in March was very carefully drawn up and was designed to achieve a balance between current revenue and current expenditure.  When it became clear in June that is was necessary to increase farm incomes and also because of developments in the pay factors, we introduced a second Budget.  People seem to forget at this stage that the Government, in a positive way, went about increasing farm incomes by £5½ million a year last June.  When we introduced a second Budget, it shows more than anything else we were, as a Government, resolutely prepared to face up to the necessity of keeping the public finances in good order.  We did not hesitate, when it became necessary to do, to go to the people with a second Budget and to ask them for additional revenue in the form of taxation.  As a result of this determination and as a result of this resolute action I think we will finish up this year in balance.  It is impossible to say, at this stage, with any degree of certainty, but there is every hope that we will be able to do so.  On the capital side, of course, the outstanding success of the National Loan ensures that we will have no difficulty in fulfilling our capital requirements during this financial year either.</P>
    <P>I mentioned two other factors which affected the economy in 1965, in addition to the growth in Government expenditure. They were an increase in incomes and an increase in credit. Controls which we initiated in 1965 <Col N="525" /> on Bank credit have been effective and have been useful in controlling the situation from that point of view while at the same time they allowed for increased credit facilities when necessary. Senator Garret FitzGerald in an argument, which I could not quite fully understand, seemed to suggest that there should be an exact relationship between increasing Bank credit and increasing Gross National Product.  He seemed to criticise the levels in 1963 and 1964 on that basis.  I cannot see why there should be any necessary correlation between GNP and Bank credit.</P>
    <P>Take the situation at the present moment.  We are proposing to increase Bank credit by about 11 per cent.  We cannot possibly speculate on what corresponding increase that increase in credit will bring about in GNP but certainly we would expect that some increase in GNP would follow.  There is no reason, I think, why there should be any exact correlation between these two.</P>
    <P>The third factor affecting us in 1965 was of course a rise in incomes.  While it was more moderate than in 1964, it was still large by reference to the trend in national production.  This question of income growth is a development which we must always keep under review.  It is vital to us from many points of view, particularly from our competitiveness abroad.  That is something we must have particular regard to because, as Senators know, the British Government have taken very severe steps to limit any form of income growth and, in that situation, there is a possibility that, if we had any excess growth in incomes here, we would do our competitiveness in our main exporting market, that is Britain, very serious damage indeed.</P>
    <P>I want to contradict Senator FitzGerald when he says that last March the Government promised 3¾ per cent rise in GNP.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>They did not promise.  &ldquo;Projected&rdquo; was the word used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Promised, projected, or whatever word you want.  We said that provided a moderate increase in <Col N="526" /> incomes and comparative industrial peace could be expected, then we could expect an increase in GNP.  As these conditions were not realised, we did not, and will not, reach the 3¾ per cent projection in growth.</P>
      <P>The considerable improvement in the balance of payments position which we have been able to achieve has of course only been achieved at the expense of a temporary reduction in our growth rate.  It is one of the facts of life that action to correct adverse balance of payments trends nearly always results in some reduction in growth rate.  It is difficult at this stage to estimate what the growth rate for 1966 will be.  There is no doubt that industrial production in the first half of 1966 showed very little change in relation to the corresponding period in 1965.  Output in manufacturing industry fell by a half per cent but there was a corresponding increase in output of transportable goods industries.  In addition to our own slowing down of business activity, there were unfavourable conditions in our external environment and this also had an effect in slowing down production for export markets.  The relatively sad history of industrial disputes which we had took its inevitable toll.  We have no figures yet for the third quarter of 1966 but a number of indications point to considerable activity during the quarter.  The retail trade in the sales index showed a rise of five per cent in value terms over the third quarter of 1965.  If we are to take account of price changes, the rise in volume terms was about one and a half per cent compared with a fall of four per cent in the second quarter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the two months August and September there was an increase in volume terms of five per cent.  There are various trade figures which show that industrial output in the third quarter will show a big improvement on the first half.  A recent survey by the Economic Research Institute indicates that businessmen visualised a moderate rise in industrial production in that quarter.  The figures which have just come to hand indicate that the economy is beginning to move forward <Col N="527" /> again.  Exports and imports are up by about £5 million each and this clearly indicates a considerable revival in economic activity.</P>
    <P>As Senators know, however, the main impetus to economic growth has been in the industrial sector in recent times.  The sluggishness in 1966 combined with the static position in agricultural output suggests that the overall increase in the volume of national production will be very small.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald, as I mentioned earlier, suggested that we have not done enough, or anything, to reflate the economy.  I suggest we have.  We have been moving prudently in this regard.  As I mentioned already, we increased the public capital expenditure programme by £1¼ million to the housing sector during the year.  We took off the hire purchase restrictions. Bank credit increased by November by £37 million in actual terms and the Central Bank has now indicated to the commercial banks that an increase in credit to the amount of £10 million would be in order.</P>
    <P>An improvement in our external accounts has made it possible to carefully initiate relaxations on credit measures that had to be taken in 1965.  The import levy on certain finished import goods was removed at the end of September this year.</P>
    <P>I could go on at some greater length on the general economic situation but I do not want to delay the House unduly.  We hope fairly soon to complete our examination of the capital programme for next year and to publish it early in the New Year so that everybody concerned&mdash;Government Departments, State bodies and local authorities&mdash;will know what the programme is and what their allocations are, and they can make their plans on that basis.  In 1967, therefore, having surveyed the whole scene, I think we can look forward, now that the deficit in our external account has been reduced to manageable proportions, to a resumption in the economy of the fairly steady pattern of growth of the years before 1965 and <Col N="528" /> before we ran into the difficulties of that year.</P>
    <P>Our external situation is still not too favourable.  The economy of the United Kingdom, our main market, is unlikely to experience more than a marginal rate of growth during the coming year, if indeed there is any growth at all. In that situation, it will be necessary for our manufacturers and others to make particularly vigorous efforts to expand our exports.  In particular, special attention will be necessary on the part of both management and employees to keep our goods competitive, both in price and quality. It is not necessary for me, I think, to emphasise that it is on greater exports that we must continue to rely to keep our house in order and to achieve the rate of expansion and development which we require.</P>
    <P>To achieve a balanced Budget this year, the Government had to call on the people to bear a fairly heavy burden of taxation.  As I have said already, this in itself does not guarantee that we shall not have a deficit.  I think the indications are that, if we continue to watch expenditure carefully, we should finish up, at the end of the year, with expenditure and revenue in line.  This does not mean that we can afford to relax in the coming year, because all the public services are continuing to cost more.  There are many demands for new services, all very desirable.  We have undertaken a considerable new additional expenditure burden in regard to education and all of this means that we shall have to continue to keep a very tight rein on expenditure on current account during the coming year.</P>
    <P>There has been a fair amount of facile talk about buoyancy of revenue. We can have buoyancy of revenue only if we have an expanding economy. It would be foolish to embark on any new expenditures on the basis that they would be met exclusively by buoyancy of revenue.  We hope there will be more buoyancy of revenue as the economy gets moving forward again but this does not mean that we can count on it unduly to solve any <Col N="529" /> major problems during the coming year.</P>
    <P>I had hoped to say a word to the Seanad tonight about a very complex and difficult problem with which we shall be faced and about which we shall have to take a decision very soon: I refer to the question of the decimalisation of our currency.  Unfortunately, time does not permit me to deal with this problem at any length now but it is a matter about which we must all think very seriously.  The decision of the British Government, as announced last Monday, to go ahead with the change-over and to adopt a £, new penny and new halfpenny system is one that poses very real problems for us.  It is a matter to which Senators might perhaps turn their minds during the Christmas Recess. The sooner we get public discussion initiated on it and come to firm conclusions, the better.</P>
    <P>There is no need to attempt to disguise the fact that the British decision to adopt the £ basis is not the ideal one from our point of view.  I think that, strictly on merits, there would be fairly wide general agreement that a 10/-, cent and half-cent system would be preferable.  We have got to have regard to the close proximity of the United Kingdom and the considerable degree of integration that exists between our two financial systems.  Undoubtedly, for us to attempt to adopt a 10/- system here while the British were adopting a £ system would pose very real and complicated problems.  This is something the Government have under active consideration at the moment and about which decisions will have to be taken very soon.  If we decide to adopt a 10/- unit, then we shall be faced with the problem of deciding on a name for our new Irish 10/- unit of currency.  I have no doubt that the imagination of the Seanad would be particularly suitable to apply itself to that particular problem.</P>
    <P>I did hope to deal at some length with the problem of the role of the Civil Service because I think it is a very important one.  I deplore a great deal of what has been happening and <Col N="530" /> what has been said in this regard in recent times.  I am quite clear on what the situation is and on what it should be.  The Government and the Ministers of the Government make policy.  The role of the civil servant is, to the best of his ability, to advise the Government and Ministers in the formulation of policy and then, when policy has been decided on, faithfully to carry it out.  I believe that the earnest wish of our Civil Service is to do exactly that.</P>
    <P>I deplore the suggestion that civil servants, senior or otherwise, want to make policy.  There may be, somewhere in the vast labyrinth of the Civil Service, some such people, but I have never met them and I have experience now of three Departments.  I am firmly convinced of the absolute rectitude of our civil servants in this regard.  Their only desire at any level, is to furnish their Ministers and the Government with the best advice they can and then, when policy is decided upon, to carry it out faithfully.</P>
    <P>We are very lucky to have a dedicated Civil Service who are always prepared to measure up to the very highest and best traditions of public service.  As some Senator mentioned, there will sometimes be areas of difficulty. One particular area of difficulty I know about is the situation where a Minister is scheduled to attend a meeting on some particular subject and deliver an address of some sort. He finds, at the last minute, that, for some reason or another, he just cannot fulfil the engagement.  He cannot possibly contemplate letting the matter go by default.  As often as not, he will try to get a colleague, a fellow Minister or Parliamentary Secretary, to stand in for him but there will be the time when, through nobody's fault, he will have to ask one of his officers to attend the function on his behalf and deliver the address for him.  This does involve difficulties because I think it is very difficult indeed for anybody, listening to a man, to dissociate the individual from what is being said. For that reason, I think we would all agree that this sort of thing should happen only in an emergency and <Col N="531" /> should be kept to a minimum.  Subject to that, I think there should be an intelligent realisation by all concerned that when an official is deputed by a Minister to do a job of this sort, he is simply doing his duty as a good official.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, is the Minister suggesting that that is what happened in the case of the press conference which was given by the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that.  In the case of the Department of Agriculture, I want to accept full responsibility for what happened on that occasion.  I decided that it was necessary, for the record, that the situation in regard to the developments in the Department and, particularly, certain documents, should be made public and I asked some members of the press to come to the Department on a particular evening just to produce these documents to them.  In fact, there was no intention to have a press conference as such.  I found that unavoidably, at the last moment, I just could not keep the appointment and I asked some of the senior officials to do the job for me, to meet the press, show them the documents and explain in a strictly factual fashion what the developments had been.  Unfortunately, I was not at the conference.  I do not know what transpired.  But that is all that was intended and, as I say, if anything went wrong and if pressmen, being pressmen and anxious to do their job as fully and as comprehensively as possible, may have succeeded in asking questions and deflecting the meeting from a strictly factual presentation&mdash;if that happened, then it is entirely my responsibility and I have no hesitation whatever in exonerating the officials concerned from any suggestion that they were in any way guilty of a breach of the highest professional conduct as officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree, in the light of what actually happened&mdash;one accepts his explanation <Col N="532" /> entirely&mdash;that it may be unwise to allow this kind of delegation when the matter concerned is very controversial?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully accept that, yes.  In fact, as a result of my experience on that particular occasion, as I say, I would be very reluctant to have a repeat of that experience and because, again, as I say, it is very difficult in that public sort of situation for an official to be completely dissociated from what he is saying and doing and whatever documents he may be making available to the newspapers.</P>
      <P>Finally, I want to say, a Chathaoirligh, that I shuddered when I heard Senator Dooge&mdash;I do not know whether you would call it confessing or not&mdash;that Fine Gael are going to shower us with still further policies.</P>
