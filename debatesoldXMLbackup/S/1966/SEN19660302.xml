      <P>On the Second Stage of the Bill I made reference to this particular matter.  I must admit that I may be arguing slightly against myself at the moment in one way.  I thought the ease of reading this particular Bill was not the first consideration.  The first consideration was that it should say what it meant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; they are cognate. However, as I trust it may be possible to persuade the Minister to amend the Bill in another way, I felt I should also bring up the matter of the clarification of section 2 by a slight change of wording. I do not know that I need to argue very much at the moment.  The point is that my suggested way of wording the section would make it easier to read: it does not make any difference at all to the sense of it.  I would not move this amendment only that I trust the Bill may be amended in another way and, when that is being done, we might as well tidy up section 2 as well.</P>

      <P>While I appreciate the desire of the Senator to amend the section in order to make it more easily read, I do not think it is so important that we should amend it as he suggests. In fact, I do not think it has any real effect.  I certainly admire the Senator's interest in this Bill.  By reason of his chairmanship of the Select Committee on Statutory Instruments, he would be expected to have a special interest in it and I also admire his clarity of thought and diction but, when it comes to draftsmanship, I prefer to put myself in the hands of the Parliamentary draftsman in this respect.  As the Senator admits himself, it does not alter the substance or sense of the section and, <Col N="1594" /> while there may be something in his contention that it might make it more easily read, that is a matter of opinion too.  In so far as it does nothing for the Bill except, in the opinion of Senator Sheldon, to make it sound sweeter in his ears, I do not think there is any case for the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2) (a), to delete subparagraph (ii).</P>
      <P>It is clear from the way in which subsection (2), paragraph (a) of this Bill is drafted that there is a clear distinction between, on the one hand, any statute for the government of a university or constituent College thereof and, on the other hand, all other types of Statutory Instruments which are the subject of this Bill.  I think this is right and proper.  There is a very clear distinction between the effect of this Bill on the statutes of universities or Colleges and its effect on any other type of Statutory Instrument.  The principal difference is that in the case of an ordinary Statutory Instrument, as soon as the instrument is signed, anybody is entitled to act under that instrument, is empowered to carry on even while the instrument lies on the Tables of the Houses of the Oireachtas. If it should happen that the Statutory Instrument is subsequently annulled, disallowed, in whole or in part, then the position is that nothing which has been done up to that date is affected by the annulment.  The only effect is on what can be done from that time forth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, in the case of the university statutes it is quite clear from the wording of the Irish Universities Act, 1908, that no action can be taken under a university statute <Col N="1595" /> until the time has elapsed and the appropriate section of the 1908 Act, section 5, says that the annulment of a university statute is without prejudice to any subsequent statute.  There is absolutely no reference to its being without prejudice to anything that may have been done under the statute. Therefore, the very necessary time which elapses in order to allow Parliament to review a Statutory Instrument has a very different effect in the case of university and college statutes than it has in regard to other Statutory Instruments.</P>
    <P>In the case of an ordinary Statutory Instrument there is no need for any delay in carrying out the intention of the instrument.  On the other hand, in the case of a university statute there must be a delay and the statute cannot be acted upon until such time has elapsed.  This has represented in the past and it represents at present a very great inconvenience and disadvantage for the administration of the university.  In this connection I think it is well that we should be careful as to the advisability of in any way imposing further inconvenience and further disadvantage which might hamper the university.</P>
    <P>My submission is that there is adequate and more than adequate protection for review under the law as it stands and that, even though the effect of including university statutes in this Bill might be slight, no further burden however slight should be placed upon the universities and the colleges in this regard.  As we know, the Commission on Higher Education is in being at the moment.  As least, we presume it is still in being though it is not showing externally very many signs of life.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Commission reports it is almost certain that there will be legislation arising from its deliberations.  I propose in this amendment that we should leave the position in regard to university and College statutes at least as it is and not make it worse, pending consideration <Col N="1596" /> of the whole matter when we come to deal with the legislation arising from the Report of the Commission on Higher Education.</P>
      <P>I consider that the safeguards which are already there are adequate and more than adequate for this day and age.  The Irish Universities Act was passed in 1908.  Under that Act it was necessary that any university statute which it made would have to be subject to two limitations.  The first was that it had to be laid for 40 days exclusive of any period of prorogation before both Houses of Parliament during which time either House could present an address praying His Majesty to disallow the statute.  In addition, it was necessary that notice of the statute should be given in the <i>Dublin Gazette</i> and anyone affected was entitled to present an address to the Lord Lieutenant who was bound to refer the matter to a body known as the Irish Universities Committee and, having heard their report, the Lord Lieutenant could disallow the statute.</P>
      <P>Now in the course of adaptation, university statutes are still presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas in accordance with the first of those limitations but the limitation is even stricter in the case of university statutes than in the case of other Statutory Instruments.  One of the main reasons why this Bill was introduced was that the old provision of 40 days&mdash;less any period of prorogation&mdash;tended in the absence of any prorogation or anything that exactly corresponded to it to mean 40 days whether or not the Houses were sitting.  Indeed, it is probable that if it were not for these particular circumstances arising this Bill might not have been brought in. That does not apply to the university statutes because by statutory order introduced in 1942 the university statutes are subject to the limitation that the 40 days&mdash;exclusive of prorogation&mdash;mentioned in the 1908 Act is interpreted in the case of the universities as 40 days minus any period of more than 21 days in which Dáil Éireann has not sat.  Therefore, the limitating period existing here in regard to the universities is quite severe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1597" /> The difficulty that there was nothing to correspond with prorogation has been overcome by the fact that the period of non-sitting for more than 21 days is now interpreted as corresponding to prorogation and, accordingly, the present position is precisely the position intended in 1908.  There has been no loosening of Parliamentary control due to the difficulties of adaptation because substantial adaptation has been made in regard to the universities by the Statutory Order of 1942.  I am not quite sure if the other limitation still exists and I should like to ask the Minister if he knows whether such a body as the Irish Universities Committee exist today; if it does exist in what way it has been set up; and if it does not exist where is the section stating that it had been repealed; and if it has not been repealed why this body which is a mandatory body under the 1908 Act has not been set up.</P>
    <P>I have talked a great deal about university statutes.  I think I should indicate for the benefit of Members of the House who might not be aware of what precisely is involved in a university statute.  I have with me two statutes which I took at random from the Library to indicate what the statutes are which are subject to such close control.  The first one I took is a statute for my own college.  It has several chapters and 90 per cent of them deal with appointments.  There is, for example, a chapter setting up a lectureship in Medicine at £1,250 a year increasing by annual increments of £37 10s. to a maximum of £1,400. The position is that if University College, Cork wishes to set up such a lectureship it has to get the permission of the National University of Ireland. When that has been done, it is laid on the Table of the Houses.  University College, Cork, can do nothing in regard to the final appointment and the National University of Ireland can do nothing in regard to the final appointment until a certain statutory period has elapsed.  This is a grave disadvantage at this time when there are difficulties in recruiting staff.  This may have been a requirement which did not interfere with the working of the universities in 1908 but it certainly <Col N="1598" /> does interfere with them severely now.</P>
    <P>The position is that if a new job is to be created, if the terms of appointment of the previous job are to be altered by one  or one title a procedure must be gone through which is liable to take 12 months in all.  This, I think, is completely out of harmony with what should be the freedom of the universities of the present time in order to make their own appointments and to make them swiftly.  At the time that the Act was passed in 1908, the provisions which now apply to the National University applied equally to the University of Dublin and applied to Queen's University, Belfast, and to most of the universities in Britain.  In the case of the University of Dublin, the relief from the necessity of having to ask the King to legislate for it was granted by the King's letter of 1911 and the position is that Trinity College, Dublin, and the University of Dublin can now legislate for themselves since 1911.  The position is that the power of Queen's University, Belfast, to legislate for itself has now been given to the Senate of the University for many years past.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to make a case here and now for the complete abolition of the laying of university statutes before the Houses of the Oireachtas because it would not be appropriate to this Bill and also because I do not think we should anticipate the Commission on Higher Education in this regard but I do think that nothing whatsoever should be done to worsen the position of university Colleges.  Accordingly, I am proposing that all reference to university statutes shall be omitted from this Bill.</P>
    <P>If it happens, as a result of the Report of the Commission on Higher Education, that the Government consider that university statutes should be dealt with in the same way as other Statutory Instruments in regard to time and still be viewed differently in regard to the power to act under them, then the Government could easily under the legislation which would arise, apply this Bill to university statutes.  However, pending that time, I do not think that this Bill should be applied to university statutes and nothing should <Col N="1599" /> be done to hamper the National University of Ireland and its constituent Colleges on matters which are essentially domestic affairs of the university.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJessop" hpid="Professor Jessop Professor Jessop">
      <NameTxt>Professor Jessop</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Dooge in this, particularly from the point of view of the absolute necessity these days of being able to act as readily as possible in the making of appointments.  We in this country are already trying to make appointments in adverse conditions. We cannot offer as large salaries as are offered in England and very often we cannot offer as good conditions for people to work in.  This is particularly true in the physical sciences and in some of the professions.  Inevitably, in these circumstances, when a post has to be filled, we have to shop around to find somebody who would be suitable to take this post and whom we might be able to persuade to come.  Having done all that, if we must now wait a matter of even days, sometimes, you find that somebody has come in and made a better offer and you have to start all over again.  If you have to wait for weeks, it becomes inevitable and I should hate to think of what the position would be if you had to wait for months.  Therefore, I support Senator Dooge in trying to make the operation of any university as free as possible from all such restrictions but in this particular case I see the point very clearly in relation to the circumstances he has mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support this amendment very strongly and I appeal to the Minister to act upon it because it is a most reasonable provision and, as Senator Jessop has put it so well, it is absolutely necessary in the modern day to enable us to make appointments or at least not to encumber the making of appointments still further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment, we are saddled with an appointments system that is far too cumbersome and too time-consuming for this modern day and age.  We hope and expect that the Commission on Higher Education will succeed in <Col N="1600" /> modernising that but, in the meantime, I appeal to the Minister and to the Government not to make a difficult case more difficult still.  Just about the scarcest commodity in the modern world today is highly trained scientific talent.  In the university, we are competing on very unfavourable terms with outside universities, especially in England, America and even Australia. In fact, I might give a personal example to the Minister: he knows our own college quite well.  I can tell him that, out of a staff of four who are in one department at the moment, no less than two have been taken away, bought away, by other institutions&mdash; one institution in Australia and another somewhat nearer home.  However, that is the situation.</P>
    <P>I think the case is obvious.  There is no need to delay the House in regard to it.  I appeal to the Minister, as a first step, to remove this.  University College, Dublin, have been criticised for bypassing this whole procedure by the extensive appointment of college lecturers and assistant college lecturers. I have the greatest sympathy with them in their dilemma.  I think they acted wisely in all the circumstances and the Government acted wisely also by, in effect, giving that power, which was not in the Charter, to the university to continue with those appointments pending the report of the Commission on Higher Education.  Therefore, I am asking the Minister not to make it more difficult for us in the smaller colleges who are fighting a wearying battle to try to maintain standards and to try to attract some of our good students back and ensure that they are held for the country and the college. Undoubtedly, the case is evident.  I rely on the good sense and the commonsense approach of the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a great deal of sympathy with the case made but I do not see what it has to do with the point.  I should have thought that removing the reference to the universities would not have made the slightest difference to the present position.  I understood from Senator Dooge that the difficulty was the present position.  This is about four weeks.  It <Col N="1601" /> comes into operation only if the four sitting week is longer than the period obtaining.  As I understand it, there will be a shorter period.  I think it is inevitable that it should be shorter in the present position.  While it is useful that the opinion should be voiced here, I cannot see that the amendment will help matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two possibilities&mdash;one, that the four week period never governs and the other, that it does at some time or other govern.  If the four weeks will never govern, then there is no point in applying the Bill to the universities since it is completely unnecessary.  If there is the slightest possibility that the four weeks should ever govern, I think it is appropriate to make the case that this further burden should not be added.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my desire in any way to hamper the administration of the university, particularly in relation to appointments to be made to professorships or lectureships.  It ought to be possible for universities so to arrange their appointments as to ensure that they are made at a time that the Bill, as we now propose it as far as the laying of documents is concerned, would have no adverse effect on the taking up of appointments by whoever would be appointed.  I shall not go into the merits of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>May I interrupt for a moment, please?  The Minister mentioned the taking up of appointments. That is not relevant.  The appointment cannot be made until the statutory time has elapsed.  They cannot make the final appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It refers to the ultimate taking up of appointments. The making of an appointment obviously refers to the engaging of a professor or a lecturer.  I shall not go into the merits of the system adopted, to use no more derogatory or laudatory expression, in the appointment of college lecturers over a period of years in University College, Dublin.  As a result of the appointment of a Visitor there, certain objections were made and ultimately the matter had to be <Col N="1602" /> brought to the Oireachtas.  The Government did decide to give whatever authority was required for the continuation of the appointment made in this respect.</P>
      <P>I think the House will realise that more and more university appointments are becoming matters that the taxpayer will have more and more regard to.  When an appointment is made in the public service provision has to be made for that appointment by way of passing a particular vote and any appointment made is subject to questioning and review, if necessary, by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is only by the way.  Nevertheless, the fact remains that by reason of the laying procedure the House will have some say in these appointments and I think that it should have.  As Senator Sheldon has pointed out, there is a laying procedure already, and this procedure which we now propose to adopt in relation to university statutes in most circumstances, except in the case where appointments are sought to be made towards the end of a university or a Parliamentary session, can be made and taken up more expeditiously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my submission to exclude the universities or university statutes from the scope of this Bill would be putting the universities in a special position. Speaking of a special position, I would like to refer to the suggestion made by Senator Dooge that universities are in a unique position in this respect in that any of the statutes made under the 1908 Act are inoperative until the laying period has passed.  They are not unique in this respect.  As I have said, if there was some difficulty about the laying procedure it is a matter that could be settled in amendment to the 1908 Act.  I do not think that Senator Dooge adverted to that suggestion here today, but he was kind enough to let me have a short memorandum on the reasons for putting down this amendment and he referred to it in that.  He said that any amendment might be held to be <i>ultra vires</i> the 1908 Act. An Act, of course, could be <i>ultra vires</i> the Constitution but I do not think that one Act can be <i>ultra vires</i> another since it is within the power of Parliament to change an Act at any time <Col N="1603" /> as long as it is not <i>ultra vires</i> the Constitution of the country.</P>
    <P>On the point he made that university statutes were in a unique position in that they could not take effect until a long period had passed, there are other instruments made, for example, under the General Prisons Act, 1877 which cannot come into operation until a long period has passed.</P>

      <P>I am surprised that erudite people such as university professors and distinguished barristers should be making smart cracks and points out of an argument that university statutes are not in a unique position in this respect.  I am pointing out examples to prove that that they are not unique.  There are other cases, too, where statutory instruments must be laid in draft form before the Oireachtas before coming into effect. What the amendment seeks to do would put them in a completely unique position.  We propose to enact the Bill here, as Senator Sheldon has pointed out, for the convenience of the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Members elected to them.  I do not think it is creating any great inconvenience for the universities to oblige them to conform to the same procedure as far as the laying of instruments is concerned as people who are bound by other Acts of Parliament.  For that reason and others I have mentioned, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I must confess that I am somewhat surprised at the line the Minister adopts in this case.  In the legislation we enact in modern times we ought to take a modern approach to this situation.  Two kinds of statutory orders are made.  First, you have the kind of regulations made in draft&mdash;you find them in the Social Welfare Act, 1952&mdash;that will not come into operation until a resolution authorising the making of them is passed by each House of the Oireachtas.  That is a speedy enough <Col N="1604" /> procedure and does not involve any great delay.  It can go through both Houses in one week if necessary.  The other is the ordinary kind of regulation made that takes effect immediately and there is an indemnity, contained in the section authorising the making of the regulations and obliging them to be laid before each House, indemnifying in advance any things done in pursuance of the regulations.</P>
      <P>Here we are dealing with what ought to be a matter of some concern to the Government&mdash;the modernisation and up-to-dateness of the universities.  I am quite certain that when the 1908 Act was being drawn up there would not have been great concern in the minds of the Ministers who drew it up for the British Government and of the Parliamentary draftsman as to what ought to be done.  There would not be a great concern about the welfare of the Irish people.  I should think that that Act was reluctantly drawn up by the British Government at that time.  Be that as it may, it is clear that it is out of date because the committee that Senator Dooge referred to, to which certain things are to be submitted in the event of disputes about the statutes&mdash;the Lord Lieutenant and the Privy Council &mdash;no longer exists.  As far as I know, there never has been any adaptation of this particular Act, when powers were taken in the early days of the establishment of this State for adapting enactments, to provide for the implementation of this Act by an Irish Government.</P>
      <P>When one looks at that section it is quite clear that the 1908 Act is long since out of date, and we ought not to be tied to precedents of that kind and precedents such as the General Prisons Act, 1877.  I must say that I thought it was with a sense of humour that the Minister introduced that particular comparison, but apparently that was not so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that the Minister will pardon us if when talking about universities his first comparison is one relating to general prisons.  The universities, indeed, are in a prison <Col N="1605" /> of their own in the statutes and one might quite properly say that they are bound hand and foot by this antediluvian form of legislation.  The Minister says that the universities are in a special position and the taxpayer is interested in what is going on in appointments being made there.</P>
      <P>One would imagine that the Minister had never heard of the Act establishing Córas Iompair Éireann, or the Acts setting up Bord Fáilte, the ESB and every one of the other semi-State bodies given block grants every year and power to make any appointments they like.  When a Minister is asked in the Dáil a question in relation to appointments made by one of them he will declaim in a lordly fashion: &ldquo;This is a matter of day to day management and I have no concern in the matter&rdquo;.  We cannot trust the Irish universities in 1966 to do the same kind of things which an enlightened Minister for Industry and Commerce permitted the ESB to do in 1927 and which subsequent Ministers and statutes have enabled other State bodies to do.  The Minister says that this is an excuse for keeping the universities tied hand and foot.  That does not seem to me to denote a progressive outlook in relation to education or anything else.  It seems that this amendment is quite well justified, especially having regard to other much quicker procedures which are not named by the Minister.</P>
      <P>Queen's University, Belfast, has had this restriction long since alleviated, if my information is correct.  I do not think Trinity College suffers from that kind of restriction.  That was lifted some time in the 1900s.  That is a much more apt comparison than the General Prisons Act of 1877.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It never struck me that this amendment could give rise to the kind of attitude adopted by the Minister.  First of all, I was slightly horrified by what he said at the beginning.  I was unable to make head or tail of it.  What he seemed to be hinting at was that the universities can make appointments without consultations. The Minister seems to forget that a post cannot be filled until it is created and it cannot be created until it is laid <Col N="1606" /> on the Table of the House.  I do not know what the Minister had in mind, whether it was that an illegality could be perpetrated.  He referred to what happened in University College, Dublin, as regards college lectureships but the account he gave was singularly incomplete.</P>
      <P>He failed to refer to the fact that legislation was introduced by the Government to deal with the situation and was then allowed to lapse by the failure of the Government and the Minister, the Bill having been put through the Dáil and the Seanad, to implement their own Act.  The Minister then told University College that it did not really matter, that they could go ahead and make the appointments, thereby making nonsense of the Act.  As a result, there is complete confusion in the university as regards appointments now.  That was an incompetent and misleading action.</P>
      <P>He then went on with the horrifying statement that because of the assistance given to the university, the Dáil and Seanad should have an interest in the appointments and that the freedom in regard to the universities, which is a principle of university affairs and life, acknowledged in the case of Dublin University in 1911 by his Majesty, George the Fifth, cannot 55 years later be given to the National University of Ireland.</P>
      <P>This is a horrifying statement.  I do not believe the Minister gave it a lot of thought.  I should hope it is not the considered opinion of the Government and I think, on reflection, the Minister might perhaps be prepared to say that he did not intend to go so far.</P>

      <P>That we should react cynically in regard to the analogy of prisons in a manner in which we would not react to any other analogy is not surprising.  This amendment is designed not to worsen an absurd position in the universities.  You cannot create a position or fill it without going through the enormously complicated procedure introduced by the British Government 58 years ago in order to prevent, as some ill-disposed <Col N="1607" /> members of the British Parliament felt, appointments being made here in an unsuitable manner.  They had in mind that the Irish could not be trusted. While it is not unreasonable that that attitude might have prevailed in a British Bill in 1908, that it should be endorsed by a Minister here in 1966&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I hope we can now move away from this matter to consider on its merits the amendment which is designed simply not to worsen an intolerable position created by a combination of ill-disposed attitudes of a British Parliament in 1908 and an act of a Minister two or three years ago.  The position is bad enough as it is but let us not make it worse when we are on the eve of reforming the whole system with a view to modernising and devising a more suitable and appropriate method of appointment, following on the report of the Committee which has been in existence for a number of years, the report which has been promised for later this year.</P>

The case has been made that CIE, Bord na Móna and other semi-State bodies are not subject to the type of restriction contained in this Bill.  One of the things which most Members of this House will agree with is that the State and semi-State bodies, over the years, had too much freedom with regard to appointments and their mode of conduct.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>We believe that the people who are elected to both Houses should have a say, on behalf of the public, as to how public enterprise is run.  After all, the public are paying and surely they are entitled to a say, through their elected representatives, as to the conduct on a broad basis of the particular companies with regard to policy and so on.</P>
      <P>Let us take another example.  The voluntary hospitals over the years adopted the attitude that they should be free from any supervision or control by public representatives, although, in fact, a large proportion of their revenue comes from the public purse.  When the public purse is paying for the debts of those groups, I maintain that we should have a right to intervene. Various Ministers have, in recent years, realised that it is essential to intervene where public moneys are concerned.</P>
      <P>The case has also been made that the measure, as it stands, will hold up the modernisation and the streamlining of our universities.  I wonder will it? I have a recollection when I was a Member of the other House&mdash;if necessary, I will get the documents now in the Library&mdash;of dealing in great detail with the visitors report on UCD. In that report, if the Senators recall, we had the actions of people who were responsible to nobody and were it not for the fact that a number of alert Deputies read that report, none of the actions which had been carried out would have come to light.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to dwell at length on what took place but I am satisfied that some provision is necessary to ensure that this House and the Dáil will have an opportunity of observing for a period what is in the minds of the authorities.  I think that is what the Bill amounts to.  I do not accept the idea that the universities should be completely exempt from supervision by this House.  I do not think it is taking away from their autonomy to have this <Col N="1609" /> limited observation carried out on their activities.</P>
    <P>Let me put this very important point.  The public are paying for the universities: they are paying the lecturers and the professors; they are paying for the running of the universities to a great extent.  Is it unreasonable to suggest that both Houses of the Oireachtas should be entitled to listen in and observe in the matter of appointments created or filled?  I do not see anything outrageous in the suggestion in this Bill at all.  I support the Minister's view as far as the amendment is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit that I have, perhaps, used rather loosely the phrases &ldquo;university appointments&rdquo; and &ldquo;creation of posts&rdquo;.  I do not think that is terribly important in the context of what we are saying.  If I used the words &ldquo;university appointments&rdquo; when I should have used the words &ldquo;creation of posts&rdquo;, then I am guilty of imprecision.  As I said already, at the present time there is a procedure whereby, under the 1908 Act, the statutes made by a university must be laid before the Houses.  That was amended, as Senator Dooge has pointed out, by a Statutory Instrument in 1941, I think.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, they are obliged to lay their Statutory Instruments&mdash;and these university statutes are no more than Statutory Instruments&mdash;and care was taken in the drafting of this Bill to point that out. But they are Statutory Instruments and are laid before the Houses already. What I am saying is that there are other Statutory Instruments which cannot take effect until, and unless, they have lain their statutory period before the Houses of the Oireachtas. University professors are noted for scientific argument, and I was answering the point made by Senator Dooge when he suggested that universities were unique in so far as their statutes could not take effect until a long time had passed.  That was why <Col N="1610" /> I referred to the Act of 1908, and there were other Acts as well to which I could have referred.  However, I think I have made it sufficiently clear that they are not unique in that respect.  The purpose of this Bill is to simplify and clarify the procedure whereby certain instruments made under existing Acts of Parliament must be laid before Houses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Because there is a definition&mdash;I think Senator Sheehy Skeffington drew attention to it&mdash;of &ldquo;statute&rdquo; in the first section as:</P>
      <P>an Act of the Oireachtas,</P>
      <P>an Act of the Oireachtas of Saorstát Éireann,</P>
      <P>an Act of the Parliament of the former United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, or</P>
      <P>an Act of a Parliament sitting in Ireland at any time before the coming into force of the Union with Ireland Act, 1800.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;in effect, all Acts passed by Parliament which are still in force in Ireland. But there are also things called statutes which are passed by the University Senate, or by whatever body is in authority to do so under the Irish Universities Act of 1908.  These are statutes so named but they are not statutes, as we understand them.  They are Statutory Instruments made by the appropriate authorities in the universities which cannot have effect under the 1908 Act until the statutory period for laying on the Tables of the Houses has passed without objection. That is the reason they are specifically mentioned, but, in any event, I think the main point was that the 1908 Act was passed in times when we had not our own Government, when alien rule may not have been sufficiently well disposed to our institutions to give them that kind of freedom of action we would like them to have.  That being so, I am all in favour of <Col N="1611" /> amending the 1908 Act in accordance with our present conditions and our present-day requirements.  As long as the Act is in force and until such time as it has been amended, then I think we ought to apply the same obligations made under that Act as any instrument made under any other Act.</P>

      <P>I am very disappointed by the appreciation and knowledge of the university which has been shown here, particularly by Senator McQuillan and, to a lesser extent, by the Minister.  The discussion has centred on the universities.  I understand the universities, in our context here, to mean both Trinity College, Dublin, and the National University. This does not apply to Trinity College, Dublin.  Therefore, it applies only to the National University.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are denying to the National University something which was given to Trinity College, Dublin, and to Queen's University in Belfast over 50 years ago.  Secondly, we are denying it not to the National University as a whole so much as the administration of its two small parts &mdash;Galway and Cork&mdash;because already the Government have made a special exception for University College, Dublin, which enabled them to speed up the matter of appointments.  Even if the legislation has lapsed, it is still accepted that University College, Dublin, are proceeding under that Act but we in the other universities cannot and dare not even use the terminology of that Act.  This makes our position far worse compared with the largest university in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been loose talk on the question of what is in the statutes.  The statutes are not appointments.  All they set out is that a new office is being created, or a professorship&mdash;the most recent one was a professorship of <Col N="1612" /> Medieval History, the one which Telefís Bhlá Cliath did not hear about yet but which was created just a year ago, or that a change may be made in the conditions of the holding of an office, but that is all.  The appointment is made by the Senate of the National University.  There is no question of either the Dáil or Seanad having a say in such an appointment.  On the other hand, the position of the universities is unique in that there is so much public representation at every level, both in the drafting of those statutes and in the making of the subsequent appointment. In the drafting of the statutes, the statute power rests in the Finance Committee of the College and the Chairman of that Finance Committee is, traditionally, a Government nominee on the Governing Body of the College. It is so in Cork, anyway.</P>

      <P>Then the Governing Body itself has representatives from either the county councils or, in the case of UCD, the general manager of the county councils.  At the same time, the Senate of the University is enacting concurrent legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Senate has representatives, nominated by the Government, on it.  Consequently, at all stages, outside public opinion and Government opinion have a much closer contact than in any university system outside of the Soviet Union. It is recognised in modern times that you can proceed on that basis.  England, which gave us the statutes based on its own experience of 50 years ago, has departed radically from that position ever since.  Now they recognise that these appointments have to be made in a relatively short time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All we are asking here is that the present position should not be worsened until the Commission on Higher Education reports.  I agree with the Minister that it might be worth considering <Col N="1613" /> amending the 1908 Act if the Report of the Commission were not so close but, that Report being imminent, I do not think it is worth while to make that amendment when other amendments will have to be made also. Consequently, I do not see why in these circumstances the Minister cannot accede to our very simple request not to make matters worse for the National University of Ireland and, above all, not to make matters worse for the neglected Colleges in Galway and Cork.</P>

        <i>(Longford):</i> I have not read it and I do not intend to. Anything I know about it I learned from Senator Sheldon.  Without having read the Bill, I think one aspect emerges and that is the old question of a collision between an executive authority and Parliament.  I suppose that Members of Parliament who have no vested interest in an executive will always support Parliamentary control. This may put an end to this discussion. I have noticed that it was a collision between an executive authority and Parliament that led to the situation in which Charles I lost his head.  I have a clear recollection of Senator Quinlan making a case for privilege, power and control by Parliament using the well-known phrase&mdash;I do not know who first said it&mdash;that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.  I think as much power as possible should be preserved by Parliament.  I have sat on both sides of the House and I noticed that no matter what Government were in office when some executive body sought power the Government tried to give them as little power as possible&mdash;just enough power to do the particular job that had to be done.  It appears that is an eternal struggle.  There is an uneasy balance in that matter at all times.  I am inclined to think that the Minister is right.  The university authority being an establishment or an executive seem to want to get as much power as possible and the Government take the opposite view.  I think the executive should be given as much power as is necessary and if a situation emerges in which more power is needed to deal <Col N="1615" /> expeditiously with any matter Parliament can mend its hand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two points which I should like to answer.  There was a great deal of sympathy for the universities but very little readiness to help them in this regard. I still think that this Bill could in certain years increase the burdens on the universities.  The Minister has said the universities should be able at the beginning of the year so to order their business and calculate the timing of their meetings as to be able to foretell exactly when Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann would rise in July.  Even the Taoiseach finds it very difficult to forecast that in the middle of July.  It is ridiculous to say that it should be possible for the Senate of the National University of Ireland so as to order its meetings with beautiful and exact timing as to get these things through in a particular manner.  The Senate of the National University of Ireland consists of representatives of the Government, the Colleges and the graduates who come together five times a year to transact business.  The times at which they come together are largely circumscribed by the times of terms and examinations because the university is the ultimate authority in granting degrees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1616" /> The meetings of the Senate must be held after the summer, autumn and winter examinations.  They are not free to meet except within those relatively narrow periods.  They met in 1965 on July 8th.  By the time the statutes passed would have been drawn up properly and printed, it was probably close to 1st August before they could be presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Under present conditions forty days then elapse and that would bring us to the middle of September. If we allowed for four sitting weeks for the Seanad this period would end on 15th November which was three weeks after the next meeting of the University Senate on October 28th.  The position is that a statute dealt with when the Senate of the National University of Ireland met on July 8th, 1965, could not be given its final reading by the Senate until December 2nd.  This Act would have imposed a delay of six months on these statutes in that particular year.</P>
    <P>Now, a great deal has been said here to the effect that the House should not be robbed of its power of reviewing what the universities are doing.  The amendment does nothing of the sort. The power which the House had prior to the introduction of the Bill to review these is still left intact.  I think if there were as much diligence shown in examining these statutes as there has been in trying to argue against what the university representatives are looking for today there might be a better case against the amendment.</P>
    <P>We have been told it is necessary for Parliament to review these.  What is the actual position?  They have been laid on the Table of the Houses year after year since 1908.  I do not know how many times these were debated in the Houses.  My own memory is that on only one occasion I know of&mdash;I am open to correction on this&mdash;was there a debate on a university statute, and that was on the occasion to which Senator McQuillan referred when the presentation of a university statute was made the occasion of a full-scale debate on University College, Dublin&mdash; and then it was not a debate on the merits of the statute itself but on the position in University College, Dublin. <Col N="1617" /> Apart from that, legislators have shown no interest in these statutes.  There appears to be no real benefit to Parliament because Parliament never makes use of its powers.  The inconvenience to the university which, in 1965, would have meant a delay of six months, is not counterbalanced by any Parliamentary advantage.</P>
    <P>I understand that so little regard is had to the Parliamentary control of university statutes that they are not even circulated to the Statutory Instruments Committee of this House.  They are not considered as Statutory Instruments in the ordinary sense of the word.  All other Statutory Instruments are circulated to the Statutory Instruments Committee in order that they can be reviewed but not university statutes.  The watchdog Committee which this House has set up in order to review Statutory Instruments is not interested in university statutes.  So that this illusory Parliamentary control may be maintained the argument is made against the amendment that this is a good thing, that this is something that must be preserved at all costs and if this results in inconvenience for the universities well, then, it is just too bad. Parliamentary control is sacred and, like many sacred things in this country, it gets lip service but very little devotion in practice.  I do not think the Minister has done himself justice in the way he has dealt with this particular matter.  He said that the House should have some say in the procedures of the universities.  Yes, let the Houses set up <Col N="1618" /> the overall procedure&mdash;but that the House should have some say in the precise terms of the appointment of a lecturer in medicine in University College, Cork, is, in this day and age, I think absolutely ridiculous.  I do not think the Minister did himself justice in preparing for this debate in the House.  There is one particular point on which I have to correct him. The Minister said that in a memorandum I wrote for the benefit of the Registrar of the University on this matter&mdash;of which I gave the Minister a copy&mdash;that I had indicated that a Bill brought in to amend the 1908 Act might have been <i>ultra vires</i> in regard to that Bill.  I thought the Minister might have better regard for my ability than to think I would say anything as stupid as that.  I said that to do this by general statute&mdash;meaning a general university statute, in attempting to set this in order&mdash;would have been <i>ultra vires</i> the 1908 Act.  Throughout that memorandum, I was using the word &ldquo;statute&rdquo; in the sense of the university statute.</P>
    <P>The only way to cure this matter is for a revision of the 1908 Act which I think is long overdue in this as in other respects.  However, I do appeal to the Minister meanwhile not to make things worse.  I would ask him not to make matters worse in approaching university affairs in, I think, the rather careless way he approached them here today.</P>

      <Col N="1619" /> SECTION 4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>Before section 4 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;For the removal of doubt it is hereby declared that the power conferred by section 35 of the Registry of Deeds (Ireland) Act, 1832 to establish, reduce, alter or vary fees shall be exercised, and shall be deemed always to have been exercisable, only by order.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am proposing now to come down from the exalted heights of university education to mundane affairs.  I would like at first to make clear what I am trying to do and what I am not trying to do.  I am not trying to show that there is, in fact, no statutory provision for the laying before the House of any Order regarding the establishment, introduction or alteration of fees in the 1832 Act.  What I do hope to show is that there is a reasonable doubt as to whether or not such a provision exists. How I got to this point was arising out of what I said on the Second Stage of this Bill when I was querying the use of the word &ldquo;only&rdquo; in subsection (1) of section 4.  At this stage I should like to say that I regret very much, indeed, that I was not here for the Minister's reply to the debate.  I was at a meeting of a joint committee on a Private Bill and was thus unable to be here, but I have read what the Minister said and I must confess that it did not make me very much the wiser.  I have another amendment dealing with that point, and I only refer to it now as the point of entry into my examination of this legislation and the result of it.</P>
      <P>In going back to find out if it would be possible under the Act of 1832 to make an order with reference to fees I found what I think is something much worse.  In section 35 of the Registry of Deeds (Ireland) Act, 1832, the Lord High Treasurer is given power:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>to reduce, alter, or vary any of the fees, regulations, orders, or directions established or at any time hereafter <Col N="1620" /> to be established in the said register office, and to establish any other fees, regulations, orders, or directions: provided always, that every regulation, order, or direction so made or given by the said Lord High Treasurer or Commissioners aforesaid under this Act shall be forthwith laid before both Houses of Parliament...</P>
    <P>The point to which I want to draw attention is that in the proviso which regulates the laying before the two Houses of Parliament there is no reference to fees.  Twice fees are referred to in the quotation I have given, but in the proviso itself dealing with the laying of documents fees are not mentioned.  It could be argued, and very likely will be, that if the Lord High Treasurer and the Commissioners were doing anything to fees&mdash;establishing, varying or altering them&mdash;they would do it by order.  Is this necessarily so?  Could they do it in some way which was not mentioned in the Act? I think they could.  They could prescribe fees.  In one of the last Bills we had before the Seanad, the Diseases of Animals Bill, there was such a doubt about the validity of the word &ldquo;prescribed&rdquo; that it was defined as meaning &ldquo;prescribed by order&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If those gentlemen prescribed fees I think they would have escaped the proviso about laying before both Houses.  I am quite sure it would be very unwise to underestimate the ingenuity of the Lord High Treasury in finding some way, if they did not want to bring a particular matter before the Houses.  Section 4 of the Bill has a reference to the Land Transfer (Ireland) Act, 1848 in which there is a very specific thing laid down in regard to fees.  They are prescribed by order and it is stated&mdash;the expression is very carefully employed&mdash;&ldquo;By order under their hands to alter and vary the fees&rdquo;. They were very careful in this connection in 1848.  That is only a few years after the 1832 Act to make it quite clear that any alteration or variation in the fees under the 1848 Act would be done by order under the Commissioner's hand.  If that expression had turned up in the 1832 Act none of this would have happened.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1621" /> Another thing which should be taken into consideration in relation to the 1832 Act is the time and the circumstances. Up to then the Registrar was a fee-paid officer.  I do not know whether he prescribed his fee but he certainly collected it and paid himself. The main function of the 1832 Act was to bring that office into line with what we consider modern Civil Service practice whereby officials are paid by salary and do not just collect fees and reimburse themselves from the fees.</P>
    <P>The main function of the 1832 Act was to do this.  In the First Schedule the salary of the Registrar and other officers is laid down and in the Second Schedule the fees are laid down.  The Act prescribes that the fees should be such, and only such, as will pay those salaries and any balance used to make the office more convenient for the public.  I am glad to say that is still more or less the position because the fees collected at the moment by the Registry of Deeds, certainly the estimate of them in the current Estimates, cover a great deal more than salaries. I do not know whether the balance is used to make the office more convenient for the public.  That is somebody else's headache, not mine.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the fact that fees are not referred to in the proviso in the 1832 Act, that great care was taken in the 1848 Act to prescribe that the fees should be by order under the Commissioner's hand and that at the time, 1832, it is more than doubtful whether anyone thought that the precise Parliamentary control of the Registry of Deeds was something that was desirable, it was very much a treasury matter.</P>
    <P>Now we come to section 9 of the Land Transfer (Ireland) Act, 1848, which also comes into the provisions of section 4 of the Bill.  I am afraid it does not do anything to dispel my doubts.  Let me quote:</P>
    <P>The several Fees specified in the Schedule to this Act annexed, which Schedule, and all directions therein contained, shall be taken to be part of this Act; and it shall be lawful for the said Commissioners of Her <Col N="1622" /> Majesty's Treasury, or any three of them, by Order under their Hands, from time to time to alter and vary the Fees specified in the said Schedule, and to substitute other Fees therefor.</P>
    <P>As I say, there is a tightening up here but as far as getting Parliamentary control into it there is none, because there is no provision in the 1848 Act for anything to be laid before Parliament, either orders, declarations or anything else.  There is no question that anything done under the 1848 Act will be laid before Parliament so the doubt, I think, still remains.</P>
    <P>The Registry of Deeds (Ireland) Act, 1875, is the next one with which we are concerned.  It varies the time for Parliamentary action laid down in the 1832 Act.  This, I think, is the kernel of the matter.  The preamble to the 1875 Act does not refer to the making of fees by order.  Unfortunately, the preamble has not any legal force.  If they had got this reference to the making of fees by order into the first sections, which they might easily have done, things would have been clear.  As it is, I understand, with deference to my legal brethren, that a preamble is only taken into account by a court to clarify some doubt.  Certainly, I am quite sure it could not be taken to establish something which was not established earlier in the Act.  The Act does not even mention fees as such.  I quote:</P>
    <P>Provided no regulation, order or direction mentioned in section 35 of the above revised Act.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The above revised Act&rdquo; is the Act of 1832, so the 1875 Act certainly does not clarify anything that was wrong in the 1832 Act.  It may have been, at this stage, that the error, if there is, in fact, an error, crept in.  In the 1860's the whole system of Parliamentary control went into a completely different gear.  The office of Comptroller and Auditor General was set up.  Parliamentary control was tightened up very much and it is quite reasonable to assume that in 1875 the parliamentary draftsmen may have assumed rather too much.  With strict Parliamentary control at the time, it may have <Col N="1623" /> assumed that this went much further back.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier I am not always prepared to accept that Parliamentary draftsmen cannot err.  I think this is where the trouble arose.  There are endless other odd bits involved but they are not very germane to the main argument.  I will not refer to them now unless I have to.  I have searched everything I could since 1875 and I cannot find anything that sheds any further light on the matter.  It is on this I rest my case.  I think there is a doubt as to whether the 1832 Act did, in fact, provide that fees should be laid before Parliament, that fees were, in fact, prescribed by schedule.  We do not normally do that now.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to involve the Minister in this.  He and his Department have no function in regard to those fees at all.  There is an Adaptation Order No. 256 in relation to the 1832 Act which was transferred to the Minister for Justice and under another order, No. 280, all powers of the treasury in relation to the Land Transfer Act, 1848, were also transferred to the Minister for Justice.  This was done when the scale of fees could be changed and it was, in fact, changed by an order.  I may say that, looking at those orders, things are not too clear; they appear to me to purport to do things which they are not entitled to do.  I refer to the one prescribing a new schedule of fees.  However, that is probably a matter for another day and another place.  In the Building Societies Act of 1874, a fee of 2/6 is prescribed. There is no power in the Act to vary it or do anything to it.  This order prescribing the new fees is the Fees Order SI No. 287 of 1956 which actually gives this fee in the list of fees.  I cannot understand how it got into the order, considering that it was a statutory fee laid down in an Act with no power to vary or how it got into an Act of 1956 unless the parliamentary draftsman lauded it.  In the meantime all I want to stress is that orders made in relation to fees are certainly not statutory instruments.  All I want to do is to suggest that there is a very <Col N="1624" /> reasonable doubt as to how anything which happened in 1832 could be regarded as a Statutory Instrument where it referred to fees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot help but comment on the very careful and analytical examination of these old Acts done by Senator Sheldon.  I should like to say, in connection with section 4 as a whole, that the Minister for Justice voluntarily brought himself within the scope of this Bill.  There was no obligation on him to do so and he did so mainly for the purpose of removing doubt as to the date of coming into force of Orders prescribing, altering or otherwise dealing with Land Registry fees.  There was, I understand, some doubt as to what the 40 sitting days prescribed in the Act of 1875 meant.  It was for the purpose of certainty as far as that was concerned and also for the purpose of ensuring that fees which would be prescribed by order of the Minister for Justice would come into operation as of a specified day that he asked to be brought within the scope of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Senator Sheldon is quite right when he says that section 35 of the Registry of Deeds Act of 1832 did not indicate the manner in which the fees were to be prescribed.  It did lay down, of course, that any order made could not come into effect until the end of the session of Parliament during which the Order was laid.  That was amended, as the Senator pointed out, by section I of the Registry of Deeds Act of 1875, which said:</P>
      <P>... no order ... shall be in force until the same shall have been laid forty days before both Houses of Parliament while in session, and if either House within that period resolve that the whole or any part of such... order ought not to be in force, the same shall not have any force, without prejudice nevertheless to the making of any other ... order ... in its place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator actually has unearthed something not adverted to in the brief I have in so far as the 1848 Act is concerned.  The 1848 Act is silent, as he says, on the question of laying.  I <Col N="1625" /> do not think his amendment would cure what he seeks to cure.  The amendment reads:</P>
    <P>For the removal of doubt it is hereby declared that the power conferred by section 35 of the Registry of Deeds (Ireland) Act, 1832 to establish, reduce, alter et cetera shall be deemed always to have been exercisable, only by order.</P>
    <P>In fact any power exercised under that section has been exercised only by order.  As I read the Senator's amendment, it would not affect any future act of the Minister.  It seems to me, from my reading of the amendment, that he seeks to rectify what, in fact, does not need rectification.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I also said: &ldquo;shall be exercised&rdquo;.  It is an added safeguard.</P>

      <P>Yes; I am sorry. Before Senator Sheldon drew attention to the particular provision in the 1848 Act, I was much better equipped to deal with his amendment.  I would ask him to bear with me until Report Stage and I shall examine the points he has made.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), line 49, to delete &ldquo;only&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am still puzzled about this use of the word &ldquo;only&rdquo;.  The Minister said it was desired that the section should apply only to orders applicable to fees. With that, I can partly agree, but I think that putting the word &ldquo;only&rdquo; in creates other difficulties.  If you say relates &ldquo;only&rdquo; to fees, you bring in a difficulty because if an order related to fees and something else, it would not then come under the subsection.  I think the use of the word &ldquo;only&rdquo; is completely wrong.  I cannot see any use for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that section 4 is intended to apply only to fees.  As I said, the Minister for Justice brought himself voluntarily within the provisions of this Bill in order to ensure that <Col N="1626" /> the public, and particularly the legal profession who would have an interest in the making of the fees and the amount of fees prescribed for Registry of Deeds purposes, would know exactly the date on which the order comes into force.  Therefore, section 4 was designed to ensure that the Minister could, in relation to any order dealing only with fees, specify a date three months hence on which the order would come into force, without affecting the laying provision. The suggestion I made in relation to the last amendment is valid here, too. In the context of the previous amendment it would also be desirable to have a look at the effect of the 1848 Act in connection with this amendment as well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this legislation is to facilitate the proposed transfer to a new Irish company, the National Bank of Ireland Limited, of the Irish business of the National Bank and to provide for certain exemptions from stamp duty on the transactions.</P>
      <P>These two companies signed an agreement on 20th January, 1966 providing for the sale to the new Irish company as a going concern as from 31st December, 1965 of all of the undertaking attributable to the business carried on in 135 branches in the State and in Northern Ireland comprising about two-thirds of the bank's total business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Bank was established in 1835 by Daniel O'Connell, its first governor, to provide a banking network in Ireland.  In 1854 an office was opened in London to provide the <Col N="1627" /> bank with direct access to the London money market and membership of the London Clearing House.  This office became the head office and registered office in 1882 when the company was incorporated under English Companies Acts.  Other branches were opened in England and Wales mainly in centres where customers of Irish birth and descent could be served.</P>
    <P>The National Bank is essentially an Irish Bank but its legal status is that of an English company.  In recent years it had become apparent to the bank that this situation was becoming increasingly difficult to reconcile with present day requirements.  The bank, as a London clearing bank, is obliged to maintain liquidity ratios laid down by the British authorities which are not necessarily appropriate to its business in this country.  The differences between financial and business conditions here and in Britain also affect the bank's day-to-day business.  The development of the Irish economy in recent years also makes it increasingly desirable that banking business within the State should be more directly under Irish control.  For these reasons the Dublin and London boards of the bank had for some time been exploring ways and means of bringing about a division of the bank, so that separate organisations for the two sections could be formed.</P>
    <P>The arrangements provide for the purchase by the Bank of Ireland of all the share capital of the new Irish company after the business has been transferred to it and the acquisition by the National Commercial Bank of Scotland of the share capital of the reconstituted National Bank which will retain the business in England and Wales.  Agreements to this effect have been entered into by the banks concerned. The new Irish company will continue as a separate entity but will be a member of the Bank of Ireland group.  The consideration for the acquisition by the Bank of Ireland of the share capital of this company is £12.2 million, that is, £6.2 million in cash and £6 million in a new issue of Bank of Ireland loan stock.  The <Col N="1628" /> Scottish Bank will pay £4.75 million for the share capital of the reconstituted National Bank.  Total payments to the bank's existing shareholders will thus be £16.95 million. Nearly two-thirds of this amount will be paid to residents of the State.</P>
    <P>An internationally known firm of Chartered Accountants, Messrs Cooper Brothers &amp; Company of London, were retained at the request of the boards of the three banks concerned to place a value on the shares.  For this purpose the firm were given access to the accounts, and all other information required by them, including details of earnings, assets and all reserves together with an up-to-date valuation of the bank's premises made by Messrs Jones, Lang, Wootten, chartered surveyors of London and Dublin.  Messrs Cooper Brothers considered that a price of 56s. 6d. for each share of 10/-was fair and reasonable.  Their valuation was made available to the joint Irish and English auditors of the National Bank and they, in turn, considered the price fair and reasonable.</P>
    <P>The scheme of arrangement, prepared under the English Companies Acts, was approved by over 90 per cent of the shareholders at a general meeting of the company held in London on 24th February, 1966.  An order of the High Court in London sanctioning the scheme will be necessary before it becomes effective.  The scheme is also expressly conditional on the enactment of legislation in this country, substantially in the form of the Bill now before the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The Government support the proposal to transfer control of a significant part of Irish banking business from Britain to this country.  This change is in the public interest.  The implementation of official credit policy to suit the requirements of this country will be facilitated.  The proposals should also help in the rationalisation of Irish banking and lead to a more economic and efficient service for the community.  Finally, the Irish Exchequer will benefit because profits formerly assessed to tax in Britain will in future be assessed to tax here.</P>
    <P>Since the early 1960s the rapid rate <Col N="1629" /> of growth in the economy and the increase in external trade has encouraged foreign bankers to take a more active interest in the country. Some overseas banks have opened offices in Dublin.  The Northern Bank has been taken over by the Midland Bank and a number of merchant banks are now operating here.  The Central Bank, in its report for 1964-65, drew attention to this extension by external banks and other financial institutions of their activities to this country and to the undesirability of any substantial growth of external participation and control of Irish banking activities.  The transfer of the control of the Irish business of the National Bank is a welcome reversal of this trend.</P>
    <P>In the course of the Dáil debates on the Bill, some Deputies appeared to have doubts as to the need for the new banking company in this country. This is, of course, necessary if the Irish part of the undertaking is to become a separate entity registered under Irish law and subject to Irish control.  Without the new company the proposed acquisition by the Bank of Ireland of the transferred Irish business would have to be effected by a direct merger with the Bank of Ireland and the National Bank business in this country would then lose its separate identity.  The position is entirely different in Britain because the National Bank will continue to operate there, as at present, without any change in its legal status.  The company will lose its Irish business and its share capital will be acquired by the National Commercial Bank of Scotland but these changes alone do not require legislation in Britain.</P>
    <P>An alternative possibility considered by the bank was the establishment of a wholly-owned Irish subsidiary company controlled from London but this was rejected by the bank as impracticable and inadequate.  While such an arrangement would have some of the advantages of the proposed scheme and would solve some of the problems inherent in the present situation, it would not have been favoured by the Government because of the provision for the maintenance of control from London.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1630" /> The Bill provides, among other things, for the transfer from the National Bank to the National Bank of Ireland of accounts of customers, of securities held by the bank for loans and advances as well as securities held for safe keeping.  It also provides for the transfer of staff and the continuity of their pension rights.  The main problem relates to the transfer of secured accounts without disturbing existing priorities where, for example, securities are shared by different parties.  In the case of overdrawn accounts it would be necessary, in the absence of legislation, to obtain the consent of individual customers to the transfer of accounts and also agreements or letters of consent to the transfer of any securities so as to make them available to cover advances by the new bank.</P>
    <P>A stamp duty liability would arise in an artificial way on the arrangement to transfer credit and debit accounts. There is no provision for setting one off against the other.  In the circumstances, the charging of duty on the gross amount of loans and advances would not be justified and provision for the exemption is included in the Bill. These considerations do not apply to conveyances of real property and a duty estimated at over £100,000 will be charged on such conveyances.  This is based on a valuation of £3½ million for the Irish premises of the bank.</P>
    <P>At the final stage in the Dáil, I was asked to clarify in the Seanad the position in regard to the transfer of the appropriate share of the existing pensions funds.  The amount of the assets to be transferred will be calculated on an actuarial basis.  As far as can be estimated at this stage the new Irish pensions funds will receive about £1.8 million from the existing pension funds amounting to £2.6 million, that is nearly 70 per cent of these funds.</P>
    <P>The Bill, if enacted, will not become effective until an order is made by me. This procedure is necessary so as to ensure that the Act will not come into operation unless the scheme of arrangement, which has been approved by the shareholders, is sanctioned by the High Court in London.  The petition to the <Col N="1631" /> court to sanction the scheme will be heard on the 14th of this month and it has been represented to me that, since the scheme is expressed to be conditional on the enactment of legislation in this country, the court may well decide to defer consideration of the application unless the legislation has been passed by that date.  I have also been advised that, because of certain provisions in the British Finance Act, 1965, relating to corporation profits tax, due to come into operation on 6th April, 1966, it is essential, if the scheme is to be implemented, that the transfer of the business be completed by the end of the month.  This requires that the scheme be sanctioned by the court and the legislation enacted at a very early date.  It these circumstances, it was necessary to proceed with this enabling legislation in advance of the shareholders' meeting and of the British High Court decision on the application.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say I am somewhat unhappy about this Bill, and have been so since I first saw it (1) because the reasons given for the Government's support to this merger are so unconvincing; (2) because the structure of Irish banking that emerges from this transaction appears somewhat unbalanced; and (3) because this take-over has been carried out without the shareholders concerned knowing the value of what they are selling.  The Minister has said that the take-over originates from a feeling on the part of the National Bank that its position, bridging the two countries, was becoming unsatisfactory, that it was obliged to maintain liquidity ratios laid down by the British authorities which are not necessarily appropriate to its business in this country and from a feeling that the banking business within this State should more directly be under Irish control.  Because of this, the Dublin and London Boards of the National Bank have for some time been exploring ways and means of bringing about a division of the bank so that separate organisations for the two sections could be formed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That seems eminently reasonable. <Col N="1632" /> One would expect it to be followed by the steps the Board of the bank thought of taking with a view to securing the necessary division of the bank but, instead, there follows the quite irrelevant statement by the Minister:</P>
    <P>The arrangements provide for the purchase by the Bank of Ireland of all the share capital of the new Irish company...</P>
    <P>This is a complete <i>non sequitur</i>.  I can see good reasons for dividing the National Bank&mdash;and there are many ways in which it could be done&mdash;but that it could divide itself up suggests a poverty of imagination which I do not feel does credit to the intelligence of the directors of the National Bank.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave four reasons for Government support for this measure, the first being that it involves a transfer of control of a significant part of Irish banking business from Britain to this country.  The transfer of control of the Irish section of the National Bank could be achieved in a number of ways. It could be achieved&mdash;and this was done in relation to a large company not long ago&mdash;by transferring the head offices of the company to this country. There may be complications and difficulties about this but it is not impossible. When two-thirds of the shareholders are Irish, the company could become an Irish one.  There may be difficulties of which I am not aware, but it is a theoretical possibility.  There is the possibility of establishing a wholly-owned subsidiary.  These the Minister dismisses on the grounds of not being statutory and of still having London control.  I am not quite clear what kind of control the Minister is worrying about.</P>
    <P>There is one detailed reference to the unsatisfactory character of the present situation, the liquidity ratios.  If the bank cannot be divided up in this way, then the transfer of liquidity ratios in the two countries could be solved without difficulty.  The Dublin Board of the National Bank has, subject to that difficulty, been able to run the affairs of the National Bank in Ireland in the interests of this country without any difficulty over the years, even though there has been control in <Col N="1633" /> London.  A sub-division of the bank, therefore, would have got over this difficulty about liquidity ratios and the theoretical control in London and if their shareholders are Irish and their Dublin Board has shown itself well able to look after the interests of this country as far as the affairs of the National Bank are concerned, that could have been achieved.</P>
    <P>It is not clear that it is necessary to sell the Irish half of the bank to somebody to secure this objective.  The bank could have sold the Irish section of the bank to its own shareholders in some form.  This type of transaction has been carried out before when companies are divided.  It could simply have divided the bank into two sections. Many methods could have been adopted.  The implied suggestion that the only way the National Bank could be divided was by selling the great majority of the bank to somebody else is extremely naive and unconvincing. I do not think the Minister can expect us to take it at its face value.</P>
    <P>The Minister said, in the second place, that it would facilitate the implementation of a credit policy.  This would have been achieved if the National Bank divided itself up and sold the Irish business to its Irish shareholders and taken action of that kind.  In order to achieve the implementation of a credit policy here, it is in no way necessary to sell Irish business to another Irish bank.</P>
    <P>The third reason given must surely be tongue in cheek, in view of what the Minister said subsequently.  He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The proposals should also help in the rationalisation of Irish banking and lead to a more economic and efficient service for the community&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is a very fine concept.  A very good case for the rationalisation of Irish banking was made in 1958 by the Secretary of the Minister's Department as we can see at paragraph 15 (3), Chapter 3, of <i>Economic Development</i>, 1958, when he said:</P>
    <P>While a 30 per cent ratio is a minimum with banking organised as at present, there may be some scope for lowering the ratio and freeing additional resources for domestic <Col N="1634" /> development by the strengthening of banking organisation through bank amalgamations.</P>
    <P>He went on to say &ldquo;amalgamations should be followed by rationalisations as they would tend in any event towards lowering bank lending rates as a result of the elimination of redundant branches and the reduction of overhead costs generally&rdquo;.  That policy was advocated by the Secretary of the Minister's Department in paragraph 15 (3) of Chapter III of <i>Economic Development</i> in 1958.  It is an eminently logical policy.  There may be certain objections to it but it makes sense.  This particular banking amalgamation that is taking place is one which, according to the Minister in the Dáil debate in columns 181 and 182, involves complete security of employment for existing employees, no redundancy for anyone, and much greater opportunities for promotion, and he assured the Dáil that there was an intention to maintain existing branches of each one of them.</P>
    <P>If that is rationalisation it is a new meaning of the word which I have never come across before and directly contrary to the complete rationalisation suggestion in the economic development document.  It is, in fact, almost derationalisation.  That this is the settled policy of Irish banks in regard to amalgamation is already evidenced by past experience.  The Bank of Ireland took over, eight years ago, the Hibernian Bank.  There was no question there of rationalisation. Far from closing branches anywhere, even where there were two beside each other, the policy adopted by the Bank of Ireland was, rather astonishingly, to expand the Hibernian Bank more rapidly than the Bank of Ireland.  They opened more branches of the Hibernian Bank than they did of the Bank of Ireland.  The reason suggested for that has been that it was thought necessary to preserve the morale of the staff of the Hibernian Bank and to assure them that the Bank of Ireland would have no effect on the expansion of their bank.  The Bank of Ireland's concentration on the expansion of the Hibernian Bank is positive derationalisation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1635" /> No doubt the same policy will be adopted here.  There may be good reasons for this, among them to provide security for the staffs, but for the Minister to talk about this as rationalisation and increased efficiency carries no conviction whatsoever. Unless he is in a position to tell us that there is some other secret form of rationalisation going to take place other than the ones he has specifically excluded we do not need to take this very seriously.</P>
    <P>This whole problem of overbanking here is a serious one, as Mr. Whitaker pointed out.  You can justify a competitive banking system if there is competition, but there is of course no competition in lending rates&mdash;even less than in Britain where there is some competition and some advantages of the competitive system.  I am not aware of anybody who secures a better rate from one Irish bank than from another.  The operation of the cartel is maintained to a perfect degree.  Therefore, you do not have in practice competition, but you do have a duplication of branches on a very extensive scale because of the fact that, owing to the lack of competition in advance rates, profits can be maintained at such a level that it leads to an excessive expansion of bank premises.  This is a common economic principle applied also to airlines in their competitive services across the Atlantic where they agree to fix rates and there is no control over capacity. They put on more and more services until the load factor falls to an uneconomic level.  You have here, too, the essentially undesirable feature of fixed rates and no control over capacity.  I wonder what are the circumstances in which it was thought desirable that competition, which in other areas is governed by the Fair Trade Commission, should not apply at all in this area in view of the evident disadvantages of lack of competition in banking to which the Secretary of the Minister's Department has drawn attention.</P>
    <P>You can have a case for competition <Col N="1636" /> between independent banking groups perhaps even with fixed interest rates, because it gives people a choice of banks.  Even if you do not have competitive rates there is some case for having a number of different banks, giving people a choice.  But there is no case for a system in which you eliminate choice of banks effectively by permitting amalgamation of a number into one but get no rationalisation out of it and you still have a system of fixed advanced rates.  You have the elimination of choice of North of Ireland bank customers, who have now to turn over to a bank with which a number of them, for perhaps very good reasons, did not want to do business previously.  They are given no choice in the matter.  There are many benefits by way of rationalisation, but the Minister assured us that there was no thought of any form of economic rationalisation or applying a certain type of economies even though he used the word &ldquo;rationalisation&rdquo; in his opening remarks.</P>
    <P>The only good reason I could find, and one which naturally would appeal to the Minister, for what is being done is that the profits could be taxed here. This seems to be the real reason for the Government's support, on a short term basis without any thought of a Government banking policy, which they do not seem to have.  As far as I can estimate it, what the Minister can get in taxation in this year might exceed £1 million, and one can understand the Minister, particularly on the eve of the Ides of March, licking his lips at the prospect of an extra million pounds.  But it is not essential for the Irish section of the National Bank to be sold to another bank in order that the Minister could get his hands on this million pounds.  There are other ways in which this could have been done.</P>
    <P>The Minister's arguments are, therefor, very unconvincing.  There may be good arguments for this&mdash;I do not rule that out.  I am only probing at this stage, but it seems extraordinary that the Minister should put forward such weak arguments.  If there are good ones we should like to hear them.  The one thing running through all this matter <Col N="1637" /> is that the Government has no policy about banking.  It seems to have faced this situation as it happened and said &ldquo;there is a million quid coming in this, so this is our policy&rdquo;.  Surely the Government ought to have a policy on banking.  It could believe in the rationalisation of the banking system as recommended by the Secretary of the Department eight years ago, or, alternatively, could take the view that this would be undesirable and that the present system should be preserved, or that some limited rationalisation should take place.  What is the Government's view on the position of banking in Ireland?  We have no statement of policy on this other than the purely <i>ad hoc</i> statement that it welcomes these developments for reasons most of which seem very unconvincing.</P>
    <P>If rationalisation is needed and if that were the Government's policy, which does not appear from the Minister's statement, is this, in fact, the best possible rationalisation?  Looking at the structure of Irish banking, one might well wonder about that.  This measure will put four banks together into one group and as far as I calculate it they will represent 42 per cent of Irish banking taking account of the English business of the National Bank which is being hived off and which will not remain a part of our banking structure as hitherto.  Twenty-four per cent of banking will be in the hands of two northern banks each of which in turn is owned by English banks.  Therefore, all that remains against this massive group will be three smaller banks between them accounting for 34 per cent&mdash;the remaining independent Irish banks.  Is this the best possible structure for banking in Ireland&mdash;a quarter controlled from outside either from the north or from England, 42 per cent controlled by one massive group, and the remaining 34 per cent divided between three banks, the largest of which is quite a substantial bank?  I would have thought that if the Government had a policy on banking, which it never had, it might have considered that the proper policy would be to have fewer banks but to have a number of strong banking groups competing with each other to provide some <Col N="1638" /> competition.  We do not need nine banks.  We could do with fewer, but we would need at least three strong groups in the Republic, led by the Bank of Ireland, the National Bank and the Munster and Leinster Bank.  The possibility of that reasonably rational structure of three banks about the same size with some others already taken over by the Bank of Ireland and one or two others which may well be taken over would give you three groups in a rationally strong structure and maintain some element of competition.  But in the absence of any Government policy something different has happened and appears to be welcomed by the Government without much thought as to whether it is the best method, but simply because of the million pounds extra taxation they hope to get.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn from that to another matter&mdash;whether, in fact, this transaction is fair to the shareholders who are being bought out.  We have been told that a firm of accountants have examined the business and reported that the price is a fair price. We do not know on what basis they worked.  We do not know whether they were primarily concerned with the exact value or with the returns achieved.  The shareholders do not know.  They have been told that a firm of accountants think this is a good price, without knowing what approach was adopted in relation to the calculation.</P>
    <P>It may be that the figure of £16.2 million paid to the National Bank as a whole by the two purchasing banks represents a fair value of the assets and the actual break-up value of the bank. This is possible.  A recent study of the value of the banks in Ireland and their assets was made on behalf of a firm of Irish stockbrokers with whom I am associated.  They worked on the assumption that the premises of the bank were worth about 2½ times the value of the balance sheets.  That assumption seems now to have been over-conservative in the light of the Minister's figures.</P>
    <P>He told us that the Irish premises of the National Bank are worth £3½ million, whereas the total value of all <Col N="1639" /> premises in Ireland and Britain is £1.9 million on the balance sheet.  If you apply the 2½ times formula, that would give £4½ million for the whole of the premises of the National Bank in both countries.  We know that the Irish premises are worth £3½ million and that leaves only £1 million in respect of the premises in England.  This seems very low indeed.  In other words, this would be an independent, approximate assessment of the assets of the National Bank, which works out at £16.2 million.  Of course, this is an unduly conservative figure for the value of the premises.  However, £16.2 million may not be very far out in relation to the value of the assets.</P>
    <P>There is another way of looking at banks or comprehensive businesses, that is, to consider the earnings. Banks have naturally a monopoly. The fact that no Irish bank has been started in the last century, virtually not since the Munster and Leinster Bank took over the Munster Bank, when it went into liquidation in 1885, shows the strength of that business and that monopoly.  That strength is maintained by the banks who have not encouraged competition from outside. This enables the banks to earn a relatively high return on their capital. We do not know what they earn because the Government, in their wisdom, permit the banks to disclose neither their assets nor their profits. It is rather difficult to assess the returns when you have not got either of those two facts.</P>
    <P>We have, however, something to go on and we can make some rough assessment as to what the profits of the National Bank might be.  Their published profits last year were £456,000, after tax.  While I have not got the exact tax rate applicable today, it is suggested that before tax, the disclosed profits would be from £850,000 to £900,000.  We know that banks' profits, as disclosed, are only a portion of their total profits.  It is believed in various circles in England that the profits of the National Bank have been under-disclosed to a much <Col N="1640" /> greater extent than most other commercial banks.  Several estimates have been made in Britain suggesting that the true profits may be 2.9 times the disclosed profits.  The study carried out here on the Irish banking system, to which I have already referred, arrived, independently, at a figure of 2.85 times.  If those two independent assessments, which seem to arrive at nearly the same figure, are correct, it would mean that the true profits, before tax, would be £2½ million to £2¾ million last year.  That is a pretty good return on £16.2 million.  It is between 15 per cent and 16½ per cent.</P>
    <P>Of course, we do not know if those figures are correct.  They are private assessments made in the absence of any published information.  The shareholders do not know what the true profits are and, therefore, they are not in a position to evaluate the price offered.  This is an unfortunate feature of this transaction.  The two parties who decided ultimately to take this action were the directors of the Bank of Ireland, not the shareholders, who were involved only very indirectly by agreeing to provide additional capital which was then used by the Bank of Ireland, and ultimately the shareholders of the National Bank.  The directors of the Bank of Ireland decided to buy and the shareholders of the National Bank are being asked to sell.  The directors of the Bank of Ireland have a very good idea of the value of what they are buying.  They are bankers.  They know just how their own true accounts relate to the published accounts.  They know, not only their own figures but those of two others, the National City Bank and the Hibernian Bank.  They could make an expert evaluation of the true profits and the true assets of the bank.</P>
    <P>In fact, they would know what they were doing but the other party to the transaction, the shareholders of the National Bank, have no information on and no estimate of what it is worth. They are told, on the word of a firm of accountants, that it a fair price. There could be several different views as to what is a fair price.  One does not always take somebody else's word <Col N="1641" /> of what is a fair price.  One likes to have some knowledge of it.</P>
    <P>It seems most unfortunate that this kind of situation can exist.  There may be many shareholders of the National Bank who believe that the true profits and assets of their bank are incorrect and under-estimate them.  While it is believed in financial circles in London that the real profits are about 2.9 times the disclosed profits, that is not a view held by everybody, although it is held by expert stockbrokers.  There may be shareholders who think that if the profits are twice as big as disclosed, that would be the size of it.  Yet, not knowing what the profits and assets are, those people have been asked on faith to accept a price for their property.</P>
    <P>This seems to be wrong.  It is the function of the State to protect shareholders against this kind of situation. The State does this in other areas outside banking by taking many stringent precautions to ensure that full and true disclosures are made.  In banking, the State connives at the failure of the banks to give any information on the true value of the assets or the true profits.  This system is one that has been open to much criticism in the past.  The minority report of the Jenkinson Committee in Britain recommended that it should be changed.  I know it is a view of banking directors in this city that it serves no useful purpose and is no longer necessary. The directors of the bank who are buying know the true value of what they are taking over but the people who are selling have not the true value of the property they are selling.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that this whole question of disclosures by banks needs to be looked at again.  I raised this matter last July on the debate on the Finance Act and pointed out that there can be no ground for not disclosing the assets of the banks.  I was inclined to the view then that there may have been a case for not disclosing the full hidden assets of the banks.  The case has always been made that if the depositors and the shareholders knew what the hidden assets were, they might find them declared when values were falling <Col N="1642" /> and their confidence would be shaken. That may have been valid a century ago but it is not true today when banks are in a strong position.  I am inclined to the view that the arguments for not disclosing the hidden assets are not substantial now and I believe that in present circumstances, they should be disclosed.</P>
    <P>But there is no case whatever for not disclosing the true profit position. I fail to understand how any depositor in a bank could have his confidence in the security of his money shaken by knowing that the bank's profits were twice as big as he thought they were. He certainly could not feel his money was insecure by knowing that the profits were larger.  There is no case for the non-disclosure of profits.  The continued failure of the Government to introduce amending legislation has left the shareholders of the National Bank open to a take-over bid of a kind which they are not in a position to evaluate. They cannot know.  This is part of a general pattern of lack of information about banking.  The statements of bank chairmen, including that of the National Bank, have not been anything like as informative as they should be. The chairmen take a lot of time to discuss the national economy, on which their views and opinions may be of value, but one feels that it would be much better for their shareholders if they spent at least some of the time talking about banking.  Moreover, when they do refer to banking, the type of information they give is by no means accurate.  I should like to quote a comment by the chairman of one bank in 1963 as to how that bank was doing and to compare it with the actual truth as a shareholder could find out but only by obtaining the reports of all the other banks and comparing them.  This chairman said:</P>
    <P>Resources increased during the year by almost £ ... and the total is a record figure in the history of the bank.  The rate of increase has slackened in comparison with recent years, but it is not out of keeping with the general trend.</P>
    <P>That is, the description by a bank chairman of a rise in profits of his bank in 1963 when that bank's profits in that <Col N="1643" /> year were lower than any other quoted bank.  The shareholders in that bank had no means of knowing that unless they obtained the reports of all the other banks and compared them.  They were misled by the chairman of that bank as to the true position.  Shareholders in banks do not get anything like the information which shareholders in other companies get because the Government do not require that they should have this information.</P>
    <P>We also had the case of a bank last year publishing a balance sheet and accounts, with no comparative figures at all for the previous year, but the excuse given was that they had to consolidate their accounts because of legislative requirements.  So, the shareholders could make no evaluation of how their bank had done for that year as compared with the previous year. The Bank of Ireland, which had always disclosed the basis of valuation of investment in its subsidiary banks, used the Companies Act, 1963&mdash;which was intended to increase disclosure&mdash;to withhold this particular bit of information so that the shareholders now in the Bank of Ireland are unaware of the basis of valuation of investments in its subsidiaries, which they had always had before.  The Bank of Ireland published consolidated accounts which were completely uninterpretable because the transactions are so recorded that nobody could possibly work out the return between the Bank of Ireland and its subsidiaries, although the purpose of consolidation accounts is to enable that to be done.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there are many matters which require attention.  The time has come, after nearly 30 years in fact, for the whole question of banking to be reviewed.  We need another Banking Commission at this stage.  There are also other matters which affect the public interest&mdash;the size of the margin between deposit and bank rates.  We know the profits are much higher than are disclosed.  Should advance rates be fixed?  If in Northern Ireland the question of whether this bank profit margin is too high is being examined by a committee, is this not something we, <Col N="1644" /> too, should look at?  I think that is what has happened in this case, and the position arrived at when shareholders are being asked to sell something they do not know the value of.  Banking is an extremely difficult and complex business and, of course, there are problems of confidence.  I think the Minister should give serious consideration to the question of another Banking Commission at this stage.  In the meantime, in this particular instance, I think the Government ought to require full disclosure of information before endorsing this transaction of the shareholders and particularly of the Irish shareholders who comprise, I think, 62 per cent of the total.  The Government have an obligation to protect the Irish shareholders here and ensure at least that the Irish shareholders know what they are doing.</P>
    <P>Finally, I think the Government should state its policy on commercial banking, on amalgamations, rationalisation and so on.  There appears to be complete confusion on that; such as the idea that if you put two banks together and do not do anything to make them more efficient&mdash;as in the case of the Hibernian Bank&mdash;they do rationalise for domestic reasons.  The Government should have a policy in relation to this.  Surely it is something on which the Government ought to have a view.  The banking system in Ireland is of enormous importance to us.  They do not seem to know what is best for the benefit of the country.</P>
    <P>I have explained that I am not happy about the Bill.  The Minister has not made a case for it, except in regard to the extra tax he is to get.  The structure of banking in regard to this is unbalanced.  The shareholders' interest has not been protected.  It is the duty of the Legislature so to ensure. This is not good enough and I think the Minister really should give us more information than we have had for the reason for this.  He should turn his attention to the whole question of banking in Ireland and banking policy, which has not been looked at for 30 years, during which time this country has changed a lot and made great progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with the greatest attention to the very compelling speech of Senator FitzGerald.  I had, in fact, noted two of the points in the Minister's opening remarks which seemed to me to call for some kind of criticism or amplification. Both of these have been mentioned by Senator FitzGerald.  The first is the sentence in which the Minister told us the proposals were&mdash;</P>
      <P>For the rationalisation of Irish banking and to lead to a more economic and efficient service for the community.</P>
      <P>As has been very well demonstrated by Senator FitzGerald, we have not been shown that these proposals do in any way either rationalise Irish banking or lead to a more economic and efficient service for the community.</P>
      <P>The question of confidence has been mentioned.  It always strikes me, when we see the palatial head offices of banks or palatial branch offices, that the palatial nature of these buildings is based upon a concept of public confidence which really is a century out of date.  There was a time, I suppose, when you did not feel it was safe to put your money in a bank unless the bank was full of marble, enormous pillars and so on.  This seems to me to be no longer necessary.  Modern society would not have its banks and insurance offices on its main streets.  The object of a main commercial street ought really to be for the purposes of having display.  It seems to me quite wrong to have all our large shops on the main streets but the display of the banks is simply a display of marble, pillars and so on.  You do not even see pound notes in the window tempting you to come in and acquire a few.  In other words, a great deal of the money of our banking system is spent in a wasteful way&mdash;is spent on the display of stone, marble and mortar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, there is, quite clearly, unnecessary duplication of these services, not merely duplication&mdash;that is too mild a word&mdash;but multiplication. The suburb in which I live, Terenure, is the pattern of many a small town in that it has three or four banks, different banks, each one vying with <Col N="1646" /> the other for the purpose of looking big and important.  This would appear to be irrational, uneconomic, and inefficient, from the community point of view, which was the point of view invoked by the Minister in introducing this Bill.  He said:</P>
    <P>The implementation of official credit policy to suit the requirements of this country will be facilitated.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask who, in fact, does really control credit in our country. Have we as a community a major say in the control of credit?  Have the Central Bank, or have the Government? Do we not recognise that in practice, the first obligation of the banks is to the shareholders, and that they issue credit not in terms of the community interest but in terms of the monetary interest which may accrue to their shareholders?  It may well be demonstrably better for them to invest abroad than at home, and to issue credit in a way that might be deleterious to the country.</P>
    <P>I cannot help regretting that the former Senator, Mr. James Hickey, is not still with us in this House, because he would have quite a lot more to say on the question of credit than I.  I would not go so far as he goes, but it seems to me that the banks are, in fact, trading on the national credit, that is the credit of the nation.  It is the whole industrial and commercial process of the nation that gives the banks the control of credit they have. The effective control of our banking and credit forming mechanism is not in Ireland at all, whatever they may be called&mdash;the National Bank, the Bank of Ireland, the National City Bank.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald said that practically no Irish bank was founded in the last century.  There was the National Land Bank which became the National City Bank and was swallowed by the Bank of Ireland.  That appears to be the tendency.  I support what Senator FitzGerald said, that what we really require is not an <i>ad hoc</i> acceptance of a special circumstance, but a much bolder banking policy, something far closer to a control of the use of the credit that is produced by the community <Col N="1647" /> as a whole, or in the phrase used by Senator FitzGerald a &ldquo;thought-out Government banking policy&rdquo;.  As I see it, we have not got that and the Minister does not seem to consider that it is any responsibility of his or of the Government.</P>
    <P>I am afraid I was quite staggered, in my innocence, by the figures mentioned by Senator FitzGerald.  He said quite calmly that the true profits of the banks are something between 2.85 and 2.9 times the disclosed profits.</P>

      <P>The point is that &ldquo;the public&rdquo; apparently includes the people who theoretically are the owners, the capitalists in the banking system, the shareholders.  I do not think the word &ldquo;dishonest&rdquo; is too strong in this matter.  I believe there is a responsibility on the Government not only to underline this fact, but also to do something about it.  Therefore, I support what the Senator has said about there being a far greater degree of Government responsibility in the matter of banking policy and banking investment than has been displayed so far by any Government policy.  I should like to see something more than a mere <i>ad hoc</i> Bill which suits the convenience of an individual set of circumstances.</P>

      <P>The more one hears and reads about this Bill, the more curious and interesting the Bill becomes.  The Minister's speech today contains a number of remarkable statements with which I will deal later. One of the first things that amazed me was that here we have a transaction taking place between two private concerns, the National Bank of Ireland Ltd., and the Bank of Ireland, and the old National Bank with its headquarters in London.  I do not understand how it is that if they want to effect certain things by means of legislation, they did not have to introduce a Private Bill in the same way as other institutions which have effected changes in their constitutions have introduced Bills here from time to time.  It may well be that they could not give themselves the exemption from stamp duty that is provided in this Bill, and that that is part of the reason why it is necessary for the Minister for Finance to introduce this Bill.  I do not understand why the Minister takes upon himself the burden of introducing this Bill.  Indeed, one wonders why it is necessary at all considering that a fairly substantial firm like Messrs Guinness divided themselves into two companies.  They have an Irish head office and are registered as an Irish company.</P>

      <P>They are registered here as well as I understand the position. However, that is an aspect which the Minister might clarify for us.  I look at this Bill from the viewpoint of the public.  I am not a shareholder of the National Bank or any other bank.  I am not connected with banking of any kind except coping with my overdraft.</P>
      <P>This business of increasing takeovers and mergers is growing to such an extent that thinking members of the public are beginning to wonder where it will all end.  Private businesses are being taken over daily.  The Government are lending themselves to this merger.  I am wondering whether the Government have lost sight of the Constitution which they themselves were instrumental in enacting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1649" /> There are contained in the Constitution&mdash;and it is no harm to call attention to them from time to time&mdash; what are called directive principles of social policy which are laid down for the observance and guidance of the Legislature.  Article 45 of the Constitution provides that the principles of social policy set forth are intended for the general guidance of the Oireachtas.  Some people may think that this was a kind of pious catchpenny phrase to get the electorate to pass the Constitution, and some people may think that it still has a certain validity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the break, I was calling the attention of the House to the directive policies on social policy contained in the Constitution. They are very relevant to a consideration of this Bill.  In particular, I want to refer to paragraph (2) of Article 45, which provides:</P>
      <P>2.  The State shall, in particular, direct its policy towards securing</P>
      <P>(ii)  That the ownership and control of the material resources of the community may be so distributed amongst private individuals and the various classes as best to subserve the common good.</P>
      <P>Sub-paragraph (iii) goes on to provide:</P>
      <P>That, especially, the operation of free competition shall not be allowed so to develop as to result in the concentration of the ownership or control of essential commodities in a few individuals to the common detriment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that if we take these two paragraphs of Article 45, this particular Bill is orientated in the opposite <Col N="1650" /> direction to that which is pointed out by these directive principles.</P>
    <P>There is no question here of trying to distribute property amongst private individuals.  The State, in fact, in this Bill, is lending itself to a monopoly and the creation of a monopoly.  The question this House and the country have to ask is: At what stage are we going to stop in the creation of these monopolies?  It is very apt, at this particular juncture, to point out the danger which exists in relation to the growth of monopolies as a result of these takeovers that are going on in banks and in business.  Eventually, of course, what it will mean is that there will be no competition.  The facade of the National Bank of Ireland operating as a separate entity when, in reality, it is being controlled by the Bank of Ireland is a fraud which is being perpetrated on the public by the agency of this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is extremely regrettable that the Government should lend themselves to something that is quite in conflict with the idea of a widespread distribution of property among as many people as possible and to the creation of a monopoly of this kind.  As I understand the Bill, the shareholders who now own the National Bank in so far as it is located in this country will get their money and be gone.  They will have no more interest in this form of asset which up to now was theirs as shareholders. Of course, the warning that has been given is being given in time. It is like the warning the Fine Gael Party gave about the buying up of land in this country by foreigners. There was a private Bill introduced in the Dáil to deal with this problem which was rejected by the Minister for Lands.  There was a section introduced in the early part of the discussion of the Land Bill of unhappy memory which is the present Land Act of 1965 dealing with the control of buying of land by the Government, and that was rejected.  When it came to the Report Stage the Government had had a change of heart and introduced amendments broadly along the lines of what had already been rejected on the Committee Stage of the Land Bill.  Eventually, <Col N="1651" /> I suppose, they will stumble upon the idea that this particular type of monopolistic transaction is not good for the country, but a great deal of water will have flown under the bridges and a great deal of harm will have been done before, if they are allowed to continue very much longer in Government, the appropriate remedies are taken.</P>
    <P>That is to me the fundamental objection to this Bill, but there are a number of queer things which the Bill is seeking to do and a number of strange observations have been made by the Minister for Finance in his Second Reading speech today.  We have had complaints recently about advertisements for getting British experts to advise on Irish firms here. We have had somebody recently looking for a personnel consultant and they had to go to Britain for it.  Here in this country we have lots and lots of competent auctioneers.  Yet we find that when it comes to the valuation of the fixed assets of the National Bank, lo and behold we have the firm of Messrs.  Jones, Lang and Wootten, chartered surveyors of London and, it is added, of Dublin.  I would love to know how many people here in this House know of the firm of Messrs Jones, Lang and Wootten as chartered surveyors or as persons competent in the valuation of Irish property.</P>
    <P>I am certain I have never seen, in the casual way one looks through auctioneering advertisements in the Saturday papers, the name of Messrs Jones, Lang and Wootten.  The Irish shareholders in the National Bank are to be content with the valuation made by people who, in fact, know nothing at all about Irish property values.  That is what is being foisted on the shareholders of the Bank of Ireland.  I am quite certain that &ldquo;and Dublin&rdquo; has been added in to give it an Irish flavour.  It is like the kind of thing Americans do on St. Patrick's Day with various dishes.  They colour them green to give them an Irish appearance.  This is very curious thing and I should like the Minister, when replying, to tell us what experience <Col N="1652" /> those people have and what are their qualifications with regard to the valuation of Irish property.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that it will not come into operation until an order is made by the Minister.  The Minister, with remarkable frankness, indicates that the reason he has taken this power is that we have to await the decision of the High Court in London. That is a form of self-abnegation that I never thought a Republican Party would be guilty of or that any Irish Government would be guilty of.  If it is necessary for this English-based bank to apply under the Companies Act, or whatever Acts they are applying under, to an English court for their approval, I should have thought that the English High Court would make this order and that it would not hold up the proceedings until such time as the national Parliament of a neighbouring State had passed a statute.  That certainly is a new one for this House and we ought to appreciate what we are doing. Not alone that, but there is a time limit imposed, namely the 31st March, by which the Parliament of this country must pass an Act in order to facilitate a business transaction, which is to be the subject of approval by an English High Court judge.</P>
    <P>That is not a proper assertion of our national sovereignty.  It is derogatory of this assembly and of the Dáil that we, as a national Parliament, should be put in a position in which we must enact legislation to suit a business transaction between the directors of the National Bank in London and the Bank of Ireland in this country.  It is a remarkable admission by the Minister for Finance.  Not only have we gone that far but we then, in a queer kind of way, turn upon the English Government and say to them: &ldquo;You may have enacted your Finance Acts dealing with corporation profits tax but if we can do it we will cheat you out of the income tax that you are entitled to.&rdquo;  The Minister tells us that he has been advised, because of certain provisions in the Finance Act, 1965, relating to corporation profits tax due to come into operation on the 6th April, 1966, it is essential, if the scheme is to be implemented, that the <Col N="1653" /> transfer of the business be completed before the end of the month.</P>
    <P>This Parliament is being asked &mdash; we better be quite clear about what we are being asked to do &mdash; to rush through a piece of legislation for the purpose of ensuring that the corporation profits tax, properly payable under British law to the Inland Revenue Commissioners in England, will not be paid.  That may be all right as a business deal between two firms but I would have thought that the comity of nations would require that this Legislature would not lend itself to that kind of activity.  We would be very critical of a British Government that enacted legislation to deprive our Exchequer of what was their lawful due under existing income tax law.  It seems to me to be a remarkable thing that a Government can lend itself to that kind of deal, which I can only describe as being shady.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance referred to the fact that the bank, as it stood, before this proposed change-over, as a London clearing bank, was required to maintain liquidity ratios laid down by the British authorities which were not necessarily appropriate to its business in this country.  That is an interesting observation because Fine Gael, in the last election in its document &ldquo;Towards a Just Society&rdquo; laid down, as one of the things which were necessary for the development of our economy, that there should be some control over the liquidity ratios maintained by our banks.</P>
    <P>When that document was published the Taoiseach somewhere in Mayo&mdash;I have a distinct recollection it was in Mayo the speech was made&mdash;said that Fine Gael in their Just Society document were threatening to steal the deposits of the Irish farmers in the Irish banks.  It seems now that what was being argued at that time, that the Government should have some say in regard to the liquidity ratios to be maintained by Irish banks, has penetrated and that our Central Bank has now some hand in that.  Again, it looks as if the Government, in the encircling gloom in which we now live, stumble upon some aspects of a banking policy, as, indeed, they have stumbled on some <Col N="1654" /> aspects of an incomes policy which, of course, was rejected by the Taoiseach during the last election, and which he has now grappled to his soul with hoops of steel.</P>
    <P>There is one final matter with which I should like to concern myself.  I am sure members of the Labour panel who represent Labour interests will be concerned with it.  I have some experience on the matter and I would like to satisfy myself about it.  I refer to the section which deals with the transfer of staff.  We had this before in relation to the transfer of staff from, first of all, the companies that operated independently of the Great Southern Railway, which was constituted by the 1926 Railway Act, and later on under the 1944 Transport Act and the 1950 and 1958 Great Northern Railway Act.  In all those cases where the Legislature interfered with the existing contracts of people there were adequate provisions made to ensure that existing staff were transferred.  The concern has always been that they would have the same conditions of service as those obtaining in their former employment.</P>
    <P>Section 6 deals with this aspect of the merger.  I am not altogether satisfied that there are as ample provisions contained here as were contained in the Railway Act, the Electricity Supply Act and a number of other Acts where the Legislature interfered with contractual rights.  This section merely says:</P>
    <P>Any officer, clerk or servant in the service or employment of the transferor in the State shall on the transfer date be transferred from the service or employment of the transferor to and become an officer, clerk or servant (as the case may be) of the transferee with the same rights and subject to the same obligations.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With the same rights&rdquo; is probably a phrase which is equivalent to the same terms and conditions of service.  I should prefer to see the phrase which has been used in other legislation used in this because somebody may say that the Legislature was aware of what it was doing and used a different phrase in this Bill for a good reason.  I should prefer that the same terms and conditions <Col N="1655" /> of service be repeated in this Bill.  When I was reading this originally it occurred to me that, while if this bank was to be taken over, presumably for the purpose of rationalising banking, there was bound to be redundancy. Apparently from what Senator FitzGerald, and indeed from what the Minister, says there will be no such thing as rationalisation.  But I should like an assurance that if there is redundancy the same rights clause in this Bill will not entitle the Bank of Ireland&mdash;which will become the new employers of these people&mdash;to say: &ldquo;Under your old system you were liable to be dismissed at a month's notice; now we find we are closing down a branch here and a branch there, there is nothing in the Act to prevent us, you are redundant and out you go&rdquo;.  I think it is desirable in case some of the staff of the National Bank do become redundant that they should be retired upon redundancy terms which would be no less favourable than those which have hitherto been granted by the Legislature, on numerous occasions, to transport employees.</P>
    <P>These are two matters with which I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to deal because they may well affect the lives and well-being of a number of individuals.  I should be very sorry to think that, in addition to having lent ourselves to these unacceptable principles, we should also have created hardship for individual employees of the present National Bank.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to speak on this Bill without following some of the previous speakers up the various by-ways they have taken us.  Senator O'Quigley asked us to consider this Bill against the background of the Constitution and Senator FitzGerald gave us a very interesting dissertation on the banking system.  Whatever are the merits of these views and whatever are the merits of Senator FitzGerald's view on the banking system, I do not think this is the time to consider them, to go into them at any great length; although it might <Col N="1656" /> make an interesting debate on some future occasion.</P>
      <P>The principal point which has been raised in this debate is the valuation of the assets of the bank, the proper valuation of the shares.  We have been told that chartered surveyors gave their estimate of the valuation of the property and, for Senator O'Quigley's benefit, I might say that I am aware that Jones, Lang and Wootten have been operating in Dublin for some time past; their Dublin address is more than merely a nominal one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, they are a reputable firm who have given a valuation but you also have a very reputable firm at the request of the three boards giving an estimate of the valuation of the assets of the bank. Presumably these chartered accountants&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Did they give an estimate of the assets or valuation of the bank, or an opinion as to whether the purchase price was correct? The shareholders were given no information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not mean anything to the ordinary shareholder. The important thing is that these chartered accountants, who have expert knowledge, gave their opinion presumably, having taken everything into consideration, as to the value, the value of the assets and everything connected with the bank.  As far as the average shareholder is concerned, that is much more important to him than to be told what the value of the assets is.  It would not mean very much to him to know exactly what they are.  The board of directors of the three companies asked for this, were given it and recommended it.  After all, it is all very well to talk about the shareholders and to assume that the shareholders are in some way completely divorced or separated from the directors but the directors are the people whom the shareholders elected to look after their interests.  When the board of <Col N="1657" /> directors of the companies recommended&mdash;the board of directors of the National Bank in this case&mdash;the transfer should take place that cannot be dismissed as valueless.  The shareholders have placed their trust in the directors for years and, subsequent to this agreement, they showed their approval of what had been done by a very large majority.  Although that may not be conclusive proof that what the directors did was right, it is certainly a very good indication that the shareholders are satisfied with what was done on their behalf.</P>
      <P>The shareholders are made up&mdash; roughly speaking&mdash;of two different categories.  There is the man in the street who merely buys shares, knows very little about banking business or knows little about business generally. He holds the shares, they give him a good yield and he is quite satisfied with them.  No matter what information he had, it would not be of any use to him.  The second class of shareholder of the bank&mdash;the second main class&mdash; would be institutions of various kinds and, in many cases, they would be in a position to assess, certainly with some knowledge, the value of the shares, the value of the business, what it is worth, what the shares should be worth, what the assets should be worth, and so on. I am quite sure they made their own investigations and are quite satisfied that this agreement was a good one. The fact that 90 per cent of the shareholders, which must include a very large proportion of both institutional holders and men in the street, approved is an indication that they were quite satisfied with what had been done.</P>
      <P>The fact of the matter is that most people who hold shares are not particularly interested in what the assets are. They are not particularly interested&mdash; to a considerable extent&mdash;with what the exact profits are.  What they are interested in is the yield, and that is 90 per cent of the interest of a shareholder or of a person who is buying shares or disposing of them.  He is interested in what yield he gets out of the particular share.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>How does <Col N="1658" /> the Senator define the word &ldquo;yield&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yield is what he gets, as compared with what he pays for the share.  If he pays £100 for so many shares and gets six per cent, that is the yield.  He is interested in the assets of the company merely to the extent of whether they are substantial and satisfactory.  He is interested in the profits of the company merely to the extent that he can be satisfied they are good profits regularly made, and otherwise that the shares are safe shares upon which he can depend.</P>
      <P>Consequently, having satisfied himself, as any shareholder of the National Bank could satisfy himself without much difficulty and without any more information than is available at the moment, he is only interested then in the yield.  The valuation of these shares from the point of view of the yield was very satisfactory.  He could base his decision on whether he approves of this to a very large extent on the yield, and on that basis he is satisfied with this agreement.  When Senator FitzGerald bewails the fact that the ordinary shareholder could not get all the information he wanted, I think it was an unreal criticism and an unreal complaint.  This did not in any way prevent the shareholders from making up their minds as to whether they were satisfied with this agreement.</P>
      <P>The second point mentioned in this debate was the question of rationalisation. We were told by Senator O'Quigley on the one hand, so far as I understood him, that he was in favour of rationalisation, and that he was concerned with the fact that possibly not enough was done about it. On the other hand, he went on to deal with the question of monopolies and was concerned with the situation created by this Bill, and with the fact that the take-over of this bank would lead to a monopoly.  Of course, you cannot have it both ways.  If you are in favour of rationalisation in a particular industry, the question of whether it will eventually become a complete monopoly is another matter.  Certainly the more rationalisation you have, the nearer you get to monopoly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1659" />
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The trouble in this case is that the more monopoly we get, the nearer we do not get to rationalisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another matter.  In this case if people are in favour of rationalising the banks, cutting down the number of branches and the overheads, and getting a better service for the public, each step in that direction brings us nearer to monopoly. As Senator FitzGerald said, the element of lack of competition in the banks has been very pronounced for many years, and consequently although it is a problem, and something which may be deplored, and possibly a matter about which something should be done, it is not a problem which has been made substantially worse by this Bill. We cannot say that this is the occasion when we should call a halt, that it is the last straw.</P>
      <P>Senator FitzGerald criticised the fact that the Government have not done far more to show in what way the banks should be rationalised.  He said that the Government had not laid down guidelines, or programmes, or patterns, to show how the banks should be rationalised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no reason at all why the Government should do something in regard to the banks that they have not done in regard to other industries.  On more than one occasion, the Government have indicated the necessity for rationalisation in industry generally.  They have offered to facilitate the rationalisation of industry so as to encourage a merger of the smaller firms that are not able to compete, and enable the bigger firms to export, and so on, but in no case have they done more than encourage them.  Certainly in the footwear industry, there has been considerable rationalisation and to a lesser extent there has been rationalisation in a number of other industries. This has been done by the industries themselves.  The Government have not stepped in and told the industries how they should do it.  Indeed, I think there would be great resentment on the part <Col N="1660" /> of the industries concerned, and no doubt considerable complaints in both Houses of the Oireachtas, if the Government stepped in and tried to tell these industries their business, to tell them in what way exactly they should go about rationalisation.  That being so, it appears to me that there is no case for the Government to step in and tell the banks exactly how they should rationalise their business, how many branches they should have in a particular town, or any other of the detailed mechanics of rationalisation.</P>
      <P>The banking industry being of particular interest to the country, and because the banking system has been something of a monopoly up to now and one bank has not competed with another to any great extent, it may be that the time will come when the Government will have to do more than give encouragement towards rationalisation. It cannot be said that the position is so bad at this stage that it is necessary for the Government to step in and do something in this industry which it was not found necessary to do in any other industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a very constructive and probing debate in the contributions made by Senator FitzGerald and the last speaker.  There are just a few points to which I should like to advert.  I should like to begin first with the title of the new company. It is to be the National Bank of Ireland.  I should have thought that on this occasion the nation and the Government would have availed of the opportunity to honour one of the greatest Irishmen of all times&mdash;Daniel O'Connell, who founded this bank.  If it is not too late, I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to see whether it might be possible to ensure that Daniel O'Connell's contribution in this regard would be honoured, and also his contribution to Irish history and to the freedom we have here today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the issues raised here are of rather general concern to us.  On the question of monopoly, we find that already the banking system is the largest one in the country.  It will now have 42 per cent of the business of the State.  I think that is a bit dangerous, <Col N="1661" /> and certainly getting to the point of giving credence to the saying that the banks and not the Government rule the country.  I think it would have been far better if this bank had been kept separate, or alternatively, if it had been split in some way between the existing banks and not added to the one which is the largest in the country.</P>
    <P>Again, of course, we must have a look at the aim held up by the Minister here, that is, that of rationalisation. We can all see that there is quite a place and a need for this in banking in this country.  When you go to a small town, in respect of which you are debating whether or not it can afford schools, at the same time very often it carries two banks.  That, obviously, is a luxury and a legacy from the past and something that calls for rationalisation.  The Government promise it here but, like Senator FitzGerald, I cannot see the slightest approach to rationalisation in what is recommended here.</P>
    <P>It is specifically stated that this will operate separate from the parent bank and also that staff conditions and other facilities will be improved. In fact, the Minister went so far as to say that promotion prospects would be improved.  That is de-rationalisation with a vengeance and undoubtedly is a flat contradiction of the statement quoted so effectively by Senator FitzGerald from the <i>First Programme for Economic Expansion</i>.  I cannot see that this is justified today.  In the present case, a bold policy of rationalisation should have been undertaken and that policy of rationalisation could have been undertaken by making adequate compensation to the staff, without in any way impairing the urge and the drive to rationalisation.  Modern banking requires so many mechanical devices, and so on, that it makes sense that these should be concentrated together in a small town or town units.</P>
    <P>Then we come to the question of the price paid per share, and so on.  I find myself much more agreeing with Senator E. Ryan on this.  After all, the last report from the National Bank, dated 31st December, 1965, shows <Col N="1662" /> that the dividend paid last year consisted of an interim dividend of 7½ per cent and a final dividend of 8½ per cent, making a 16 per cent dividend on the 10/- basic share.  Surely the market value of such a share&mdash;a share bringing in a yield of 16 per cent&mdash;would, at most, be 3 times the share value.  In other words, these shares should have been around 30/- to 35/-, based on that yield.  Yet, they are bought at 56/6d, almost twice that amount.  In other words, due to the amalgamation, the shareholders have made a real kill in this, just like the shareholders in any other of those take-over companies are making.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall come to that in a few minutes.  The amount is made up of the yield that was being produced which justified 35/- and the reserves that were being accumulated in the banking system which, if broken up, would have produced that.  However, I suggest that this idea of breakup and it all belongs to the shareholders is a very antediluvian concept. The shareholders, by and large, when they get a fair dividend of 6 per cent, or so, should consider that most of the undisclosed profit is discharged. The undisclosed profit is every bit as much the property of the staff who have been working on it and the property of the people as a whole.  I believe that a good deal of that could have been used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That applies to all the take-overs but it is illustrated here that a good deal of the mark-up could be used to ensure that the staff did not suffer by the rearrangement that has taken place. I believe they have a moral as well as a just and right claim on the asset that had been created just as well as the shareholders but it raises the whole question that we see every week, day in day out, in those take-over bids. We see the city of Cork taken over right along its main street.  It is the same in Dublin.  It is all for the same purpose.  In other words, you have this break-up.  You have shares jumping in value and you have shareholders <Col N="1663" /> effectively getting what they could not realise without a breakup.  Hence the incentive to shareholders to get out on a merger.  Just consider how much the banking system, which is being bought for £16 million, was yielding at that rate.  Dividends were paid on £480,000 in the last year.  That meant that the effective yield was only 16 per cent on the shares as they stood at that period. Now these have to be replaced.  The bank has put in its own money and now £16 million is going in and the bank will expect to have that remunerated at 6 per cent at least which means that the amount that will have to go out under the heading of remuneration for capital will be double what was going out to the shareholders who formerly were running this.  Again, therefore, it poses a problem&mdash;certainly the ability of the bank to create assets and to add to its assets will be greatly lessened by this amount and certainly its shares cannot be as attractive as they have been in the past.</P>
    <P>We cannot take this question of banking and monopolies without noting that the State has given every assistance to the present take-over and contrasting that with the attitude of the State to the Post Office Savings Bank where they are prevented, by legislation, from paying more than 2½ per cent, something that is absolutely unfair to the small investors who constitute the clientele of the Savings Bank.  How that can be justified and left to drag on from year to year is something I cannot understand.  It has been condemned again and again by very prominent people such as the Most Rev. Dr. Lucey and the Most Rev. Dr. Purdue has recently joined in.</P>
    <P>I again appeal to the Minister to consider this and to ensure that the growth in inequity is removed.  I would appeal, in closing, that the name of Daniel O'Connell be given some mention in the title of the new bank.</P>

Nobody should object to the proposition to take it over and put it under Irish control when it will mean a considerable asset to this country and earn considerable extra revenue.  One most extraordinary statement I heard was made by Senator Quinlan, who objects to Irishmen getting good value.  It would be like going to a fair and objecting to a <Col N="1665" /> man getting a higher price for his cow than he could get.  It did not make any sense at all.  There is a practical guarantee that the employees of this bank will be cared for, and I am certain that they will.  I believe that this is a step in the right direction in making us masters of our own affairs in the banking world, something that we must support, and something which in the long run will be a bargain and a substantial profit for us, a thing on which we should back the Government without any question at all.</P>

The Minister is making provision to hand over £1½ million, which is increasing at a quick rate, and will probably, assuming <Col N="1667" /> that the number of sets will increase almost 50 per cent within the next five years, reach over £2½ million. Surely when you are dealing with sums like that it is reasonable and proper that the House should ask the Minister to use his authority to see that the miserable £170,000 got from advertising the sale of alcoholic liquor will not be taken in future, that the Authority will be asked to desist from this as it poses a very great threat to our youth. At the age of 6 or 7 it impresses on the minds of children the jingle and the like about these various beers, and all this can have a very bad effect.</P>

I did not agree that we could have any particular advertising precluded from one medium while various <Col N="1668" /> other media were allowed to advertise the same things.  It covers a much bigger question than that of television alone.  I cannot make any further statement than that at the moment. There is a code to which all advertising must conform, and drink is included.

They prefer to get co-operation which, up to now, they have been getting quite freely.  We are trying to insist that all electric motors and ignition apparatus should not cause interference.  When they are turned out new at the present time they are all fitted with the necessary suppressors. Quite frequently it is our experience that it is not outside interference from engines of mopeds which cause interruption in the service but interference from some of the gadgets, if I may use the word, within the household. People are usually advised to check their own electrical equipment and such things before they make complaints.  When I say no prosecutions have been recommended, I want to add that the Minister can prosecute if the Authority so recommends.  Due to the fact that sufficient co-operation has been forthcoming at all stages, they have been able to do very useful work so far without prosecution by getting the full co-operation of the owners of those vehicles and devices which are likely to cause interference.</P>

      <P>I want to apologise to the House for my absence.  I am <Col N="1670" /> sure the House will appreciate that I was engaged on other urgent business. Therefore, I am sorry I was not able to hear the bulk of the debate.  I did not anticipate that the debate would carry into the part of the evening after tea.  Nevertheless, some notes have been taken for me.</P>
      <P>If I may start at the beginning and reiterate that this is an enabling Bill, a Bill which facilitates rather than creates the transfer of the shares of the National Bank to the National Bank of Ireland.  Under ordinary companies legislation, the directors of these three banks, the Bank of Ireland, the National Bank and the National Commercial Bank of Scotland, were perfectly free to arrange this transfer.  The directors, acting on behalf of their shareholders, are empowered to negotiate such transfer of property but difficulty would have been created, not so much to effect the transfer, but to make it much more difficult in that all the securities, mortgages and whatever other instruments which had to be executed for the purpose of extending overdraft accommodation by the National Bank would have to be re-registered in the Land Registry and in some other institutions, probably, which would cause tremendous difficulty not only for the banks but for the customers of the banks.  As well as that, as I said in my opening statement, the valuation of deposits, of overdrafts, and everything like that, would have been taken into account for the purpose of stamp duty.  I think anybody would agree that it would be inequitable to impose that kind of a penalty on such a transfer when, in fact, the property of the value to be carried by the stamps would not, in fact, be transferred.  So, the purpose of the legislation is to both facilitate the transfer and, subsequently, to avoid taxation and I think inequity should not be involved in such a transfer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, to some extent, irrelevant to go into the general policy of banking in Ireland on this Bill but, in so far as it has been referred to, I feel called upon to say something in reply.  As far as the national development is concerned, I do not think it has ever been our experience that we have been in any <Col N="1671" /> way hindered by the banks, as they exist at the present time, so far as the extension of credit for national development purposes is concerned.  On the contrary, the banks have been cooperative with the Government to the extent the Government has sought their assistance in this respect.  It was true that for many years the Central Bank did not appear to be in a position to exercise control or influence over the credit policies of the commercial banks but this situation, too, has changed, in that now the commercial banks go to the Central Bank for advice in relation to their credit policy.  Such advice was sought last year, was extended, and will again be extended in the coming year.</P>
    <P>Comment was made on the extent to which the shareholders were aware of the value of their property.  It is true that by legislation going back very many years, and renewed in the 1963 Companies Act, the banks are not obliged to publicly disclose all their profits or all their assets.  That has been considered good public policy in the interests of the confidence in the banks. Senator FitzGerald suggested that there may be a good case for nondisclosure to total assets but there did not seem to be the same case for nondisclosure of total profits earned. Nevertheless, that disclosure does not in any way affect the amount of taxes payable by these banks on profits to our Exchequer.  I think he raised it particularly in the context that the shareholders of this company&mdash;the National Bank&mdash;were not in full possession of the facts, or as to whether or not they were getting full value for the transfer of their shares.  I can only say that, as is disclosed in this document which is distributed to all the shareholders entitled &ldquo;National Bank Limited&mdash;Proposals for Acquisition by the Governor and Company of The Bank of Ireland and The National Commercial Bank of Scotland&rdquo;, and as is stated in the body of this document, certain eminent firms of accountants and of valuers certified that the price paid was fair and reasonable.  It is most unlikely that a firm of accountants of the reputation of Cooper <Col N="1672" /> Brothers and Co.,&mdash;who I understand have an international reputation&mdash; would in any way be party to certification of an under value.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will appreciate that I would not suggest such a thing.  The only point I made was that it is a matter of opinion. As to the assets or the profits, the shareholders would not be able to make that decision themselves without knowing the exact position.</P>

      <P>I was not suggesting that the Senator made any reflection.  I am saying this by way of reassurance for the shareholders.  This firm of Cooper Brothers and Co., certify in the body of this document that they had access to all the information they required in order properly to assess the value of the shares and the holdings and whether the price offered was fair and reasonable.  They said they were satisfied that they had full access and that the price paid was indeed fair and reasonable.</P>
      <P>It is true that in the balance sheet the value of the physical assets such as buildings, held by the bank was written in at £1.9 million.  Again, I have been assured that a competent firm of valuers valued the properties of the bank for the purpose of this transfer. That would be in my interest, too, because, as I said in my opening statement, there will be stamp duty forthcoming on the transfer of these physical assets or the real property of the bank to the extent of about £100,000. I was concerned, therefore, that the proper value would be put on the realty involved.  I am told that the up to date value which has been put on it of £3½ million is a realistic valuation of the properties of the bank in the Twenty-Six Counties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that for the purposes of this Bill I am not free to disclose it, but I can assure the House that a fair valuation was assessed in relation to the British properties as well.</P>
      <P>This could have been done in a variety of ways rather than the way in which it was done.  I was at pains to indicate that if there was to be an Irish company based in Ireland, there would have to be a transfer of the ownership of the firm to the National Bank from its present ownership which is a company registered in London.  It is not necessary for a similar transfer to be effective in London because the National Bank as such will continue in England and Wales where it has branches.  Therefore, it was necessary for the purposes of company law to effect a transfer of this nature.  There is no other means of ensuring a transfer to Irish ownership than a system such as the one which has been effected in this case.  It is to facilitate this transfer to an Irish company that this legislation is necessary.  It does not create a transfer in any way.  It does not provide legal means whereby a transfer could be effected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister suggesting that the only way in which the transfer could be effected to an Irish owner was to sell it to another bank?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not suggest that.  I said that to sell it to Irish ownership such a system as this was necessary. The Senator suggested it could have been sold to shareholders.  I do not know whether that possibility was examined but this question does arise. The vendor must have some assets and I do not know whether the shareholders in the National Bank in Ireland would have sufficient assets or would be willing to buy it at the valuation put on it.  I do not know that. In any event, the net result is that this legislation would not be effective at all if the shareholders at the meeting <Col N="1674" /> last week had not voted in accordance with the British company's legislation a 75 per cent majority in favour of the transfer.  That was the first precondition. Secondly, there will now be an obligation to go before the High Court in London for approval of this transfer. There is a certain urgency in this respect in that the taxation laws in Britain will have changed by the end of this month and the transfer would then very likely carry higher British taxes.  Naturally, it is in the interests of both the purchasers and the sellers to avoid incurring this higher taxation.</P>
      <P>Senator FitzGerald hinted at the question of monopoly if he did not mention it specifically.  He also referred to the question of rationalisation.  I admit readily that rationalisation means cutting out unnecessary operations and when two organisations come together they should amalgamate where amalgamation is possible.  In this case, however, rationalisation is not possible immediately, because it is desirable that a person in any part of Ireland should have a choice of bank even though different banks may be in the same ownership.  Ultimately, I believe it will be possible by reason of this merger or amalgamation to create a better service and a more comprehensive service for the Irish customers of the National Bank of Ireland as it will come to be.</P>
      <P>I feel that over a long period the prospects of rationalisation will emerge.  Certainly there will be greater prospects of promotion and of advancement for the Irish servants of the bank.  Its headquarters will be here instead of in England and headquarters is possibly one of the best outlets for the talent that will be unearthed in the course of the ordinary operations throughout the country.</P>

      <P>I would be loath to suggest that.  I am not personally aware of it.  In any event, it is a good thing that if the directors of the National Bank want to dispose of their interest so far as their Irish properties are concerned a native Irish interest should acquire it rather than a foreign interest. There is plenty of evidence that foreign banks are looking at Ireland as a means of expansion.  We have some outside banking interests coming in already and we also have the case of one small Irish bank which was bought out by an English company.  It is better to facilitate the acquisition of banks who wish to sell their interests in Ireland by existing Irish interests rather than permit them to be acquired by an outside interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of monopoly, it is true that the Bank of Ireland has quite a big interest now in banking in Ireland.  The Senator mentioned something in the region of 42 per cent.  He said there were some 34 per cent in ownership of three other banks that are still independent.  I suggest that, in such a divide, there is not room for monopoly.  Even with the existence of all the banks, we did have the situation whereby lending rates were much the same, anyway, but there was this element of competition that a person, having gone to one bank looking for credit and having been refused there, was able to go to another bank.  That opportunity will still be open to most people looking for credit. Naturally, the Government will be careful to ensure that any monopolistic tendencies will not operate to the detriment of our national development whether in the private or the public sectors.</P>
      <P>As I said in the Dáil, I am presenting this Bill to the Oireachtas for the purpose of facilitating this transfer rather than enabling it to take place. It could have taken place without any Act except that it would have been much more difficult, much more expensive, and, therefore, might not have been as profitable either for the vendors or for the purchasers.  We are asking the Dáil and the Seanad to give this facility and if the Seanad feel it ought not to be given then it is a matter for the Seanad.  Like Senator O'Quigley, I have not one shilling in the National Bank or in any other Bank.</P>

      <P>I would appeal to the House to give me all Stages of this Bill.  I should like to facilitate the Seanad if I can.  I think I have given earnest of that by reason of the change <Col N="1678" /> in the financial business I have effected. It is necessary for the purpose of avoiding this extra taxation which is almost certain to fall on dealings of this nature in Britain in the future.  It is also necessary because of the procedures whereby the High Court will be sitting in London which must give its assent to this transfer.  It is a condition of the High Court's consent that the legislation has been enacted. There is a point on the word &ldquo;enacted&rdquo; that, while it will have been enacted as soon as it passes the Seanad, it will be brought into effect only by order made by me.  It is important to have regard to the shortage of time.  The High Court will be sitting in London on the 14th of this month.  It will be very difficult for me to know on next Wednesday what time I can be free and the following week will include St. Patrick's Day.  Therefore, the time will be very short and it will have passed the 14th, in any case.  The Budget debate will very likely occupy a period of about three sitting weeks of the Dáil and it will be very difficult for me to come back.  I should like to give an assurance to Senator O'Quigley that there is nothing in this Bill that in any way prejudices the security of tenure and employment of any existing officer of the National Bank and, not only that, but in any way affects the pension rights of any existing officer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator would keep quiet and facilitate the Minister in the passage of his Bill, it would be more helpful.  My concern is the little man who may be a porter in Castlebar or Belmullet where the National Bank, I do not think, has a branch.  At any rate, there have been provisions in Bills of this kind previously.  The ESB Act, 1927, took over existing gas company works or electricity undertakings and where that was done the employees got definite compensation where they were not taken over on the same conditions of service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, in the Railways Act of 1936 and subsequent legislation&mdash;the Transport Acts of 1944, 1950, 1955 and 1958&mdash;there always has been a provision that where persons are transferred as a result of or consequential on an enactment of the Oireachtas the terms and conditions <Col N="1680" /> of service of those people are secured in the legislation which affects their transfer.  This Bill is, in fact, the document to which employees of the National Bank will have to look when they want to see how their position will be under the new set up as compared with the present set up.  What I was concerned about is that, first of all, we are not transferring them in the same way as these transfers were effected in legislation of exactly the same kind as this.  In the Transport Act the term used was &ldquo;transferred upon the same terms and conditions of service which obtained in the previous employment.&rdquo;  I wonder whether or not when we use the phrase &ldquo;with the same rights&rdquo; we are leading to a situation where people may say that that must be different&mdash;it may be more or less than the same terms and conditions of employment, to use the phrase in previous legislation.  The draftsman must be presumed to have known the old legislation and to have used this phrase for a definite reason. However, the Minister may be able to clarify this, as to whether or not they will get exactly the same rights and continue to get them under the new dispensation as under the old.</P>
    <P>With regard to this rationalisation, I am afraid that the Minister does not know on which foot he stands.  He has been changing from foot to foot with regard to this.  If there is going to be rationalisation of the banking system and that is not to take place from wastage, to use a good Department of Finance expression, it may very well happen that staff will become redundant and it can be said that they are then entitled only to whatever they are entitled to now under their existing contracts in the National Bank because it will be pointed out that they have been transferred with the same rights. An individual may be told &ldquo;if you had become redundant when the National Bank had its headquarters in London you would have been dismissed without compensation&rdquo; but the redundancy in this new situation may and very likely would arise by reason of the fact that, of course, it becomes patently obvious that in a small town we could not have <Col N="1681" /> a Bank of Ireland staff and a National Bank staff, doing exactly the same work.  The directors of the Bank of Ireland in 5, 6 or 7 years time may say &ldquo;this is nonsense&rdquo;, and go to their legal advisers and say that they were transferred with the same rights.  The legal advisers might say that they had no right to redundancy compensation when employed by the National Bank and that, therefore, the Bank of Ireland would be entitled to dismiss them, giving them some small compensation if they liked to sweeten them, and they would be able to trace their redundancy directly to this merger.  If the Minister is in a position to allay that fear which I have and which I think is not at all unlikely I should be glad if he would give an assurance that the governors of the Bank of Ireland will undertake that in the event of people becoming redundant because of rationalisation they will get redundancy compensation analagous to the compensation provided by statute for transport workers of all classes and descriptions under the Transport Acts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points I could make in reply to Senator O'Quigley.  First, there is a superannuation scheme in existence and it will be taken over by the National Bank of Ireland.  That scheme provides for superannuation at the appropriate time &mdash;I think after 40 years' service, or after shorter service unless the person is dismissed other than through misconduct or certain stated misdemeanours. If he is dismissed for other than misconduct&mdash;and I use the word in a very wide sense&mdash;he is entitled under the existing scheme to receive certain compensation and I think a pension as well.</P>
      <P>There is in the agreement between the National Bank Ltd and the National Bank of Ireland Ltd dated 20th January, 1966, provision in clause 8 paragraph D&mdash;and I mention this to include it in the record&mdash;which says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any officer (other than a director or auditor) clerk or servant in the service or employment of the vendor bank in the Republic of Ireland or in Northern Ireland shall on the <Col N="1682" /> appointed day be transferred or deemed to be transferred from the service or employment of the vendor bank to and become an officer, clerk or servant as the case may be of the purchaser bank with the same rights and subject to the same obligations and conditions in respect of such service or employment as he would have had or been subject to as an officer, clerk or servant of the vendor bank provided that for the purpose of ascertaining and calculating the rate of pension or superannuation benefits to which such officer, clerk or servant may be entitled as an officer, clerk or servant in the employment of the vendor bank shall be taken into account as if it were service or employment in the purchaser bank on the transfer date but any service or employment from the vendor to the purchaser bank shall not in itself give rise to any claim to pension or superannuation benefits.</P>
    <P>I think the proviso there needs some comment from me, in that, as I said at the start, the superannuation scheme provides for retirement at the end of a period of, I think, 40 years.  If that retirement is for causes other than enforced retirement due to misconduct, the servant would have been entitled to certain compensation.  Assuming that a servant of the National Bank in Ireland had something like 35 years' service, he could without the proviso claim that he was not being dismissed or his employment did not cease because of misconduct, and, therefore, he could claim a pension by reason of his 35 years' service, and he could then continue in the employment of the new bank and start building up entitlement in the National Bank of Ireland to further superannuation benefits.  The purpose of the proviso, then, is to ensure that there will be continuity of service without a right to claim compensation in respect of superannuation and employment in the National Bank and then claiming compensation for termination of employment when that would arise in the National Bank of Ireland.  I think that in the circumstances of section 6 and in the circumstances <Col N="1683" /> of paragraph 8 of paragraph D of the Agreement of the 20th January, 1966, the interests of the existing servants of the National Bank are well safeguarded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>They appear to be somewhat safeguarded, but I would not say that they are as well, safeguarded as they would have been under the old system.  The provision for an employee whose years will have been shortened as a result of rationalisation of the banking arrangements will be that he will merely get what he is entitled to under the existing pension scheme.  He does not have to thank the directors or anybody else for that because he was going to get it anyway. What he will lose, and it would be of serious consequence to him, is an opportunity of earning from his retirement after, say, 32 years the salary for the eight years in respect of which he will receive no compensation.  It seems to me that unless there is some provision for an increased lump sum where a person is retiring on short service there is no scheme to provide for this situation.</P>
      <P>It would be some small additional compensation if he were to get added years of service as was provided for under the Transport Act.  In the Transport Act, if you had between five and ten years' service you got an extra two years, if you had between 10 and 20 years' service you got an extra five years and if you had between 20 and 30 years' service you got an extra seven years.  That was some kind of compensation for a person who was deprived of the opportunity of going to full retiring age.  The Minister might ease my mind so far as this section is concerned were he to tell me whether the Irish Bank Officials Association have been apprised of this situation and, if so, whether they have expressed themselves satisfied with it.  I think this House, quite apart from the banks, when people are being transferred, should ensure that those people are properly safeguarded.  If the Irish Bank Officials Association are happy with the provisions of section 6 I am satisfied.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That the Seanad would welcome a reconsideration by the Minister for Education of recent changes made by him in the Rules for National Schools.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Senator Sheehy Skeffington.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>It is such a considerable time since we last discussed this motion that we would want to read it again. The motion states:</P>
      <P>That the Seanad would welcome a reconsideration by the Minister for Education of recent changes made by him in the Rules for National Schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That motion is, of course, wide in scope but, in fact, most of the speeches <Col N="1686" /> so far, particularly the contribution by Senator Sheehy Skeffington, related to one subject only.  I was unable to be present when the Senator made his speech but I read it with care.  Anyone reading the speech would certainly get the impression, wittingly or un-wittingly&mdash;I do not know whether he meant it&mdash;that there were relatively few changes made in the Rules and that, in fact, the most important change&mdash; the only change&mdash;was that in relation to corporal punishment.  One would also get the impression that the opportunity of issuing a new set of Rules had been used by the Minister for the purpose of making a retrograde change in relation to corporal punishment.</P>
    <P>In fact, the situation is entirely different.  There are 135 Rules in the new Rule book and there were 126 in the old one.  There is a great number of paragraphs and there are about 1,000 new Rules.  In fact, so many have been changed that we have an almost complete new book of Rules.  Many of these paragraphs have been changed very considerably.  There are completely new paragraphs and there are others which have been very considerably changed.  On the other hand, in some cases, the changes are very small, a matter of a word here and there, although the paragraph may mean exactly what it meant before.  There are cases when it would appear to anyone that the change of one word for another in a particular paragraph is due to no reason at all except that whoever drafted the new Rules happened to prefer one word to another. This is a complete bringing up to date of these old Rules.  It is quite a different position from that which existed in 1946.  The 1946 Rules were essentially the same as those in 1934, I think. There were a few changes here and there but, basically, they were the same Rules.  But that is not the case here.  It seems to me that the new Rules are, in every respect, a considerable advance on the old ones, not merely in the changes which they make but also in their general atmosphere&mdash;the style of writing is better and a great deal of the Victorian undergrowth dating from the earlier years of the <Col N="1687" /> 19th century seems to have disappeared.</P>
    <P>These new Rules are technically not so satisfactory for one reason: there is no index.  There is an index to both previous sets of Rules but no index to this set.  It may be a small point but it does make it a great deal more difficult to find one's way around them.  I hope the Minister&mdash;if he should be re-issuing these Rules at any time, even though he may not be changing them&mdash;would consider having an index inserted in this volume.</P>
    <P>Before I get on to the question of corporal punishment which has been mainly under discussion in this debate, I should like to say a little about a series of Rules&mdash;there are about five or six of them, all of which have been changed in relatively minor respects&mdash; relating to the question of the closing and amalgamation of small schools.  I think this is a suitable occasion to congratulate the Minister on the policy he has been carrying out with regard to these small schools.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>Rules 80, 98, 101, 39 and 40 deal, in one way or another, with the question of these schools.  In fact, this is a far more vital and important question than that which a number of speakers have been discussing. I shall be getting on to it myself in due course but I cannot feel that the rather sentimental speeches we have heard with regard to corporal punishment in schools relate to a matter anything like as important as the question of the type of education which a great many of our national school children get in rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To my mind, this problem of the smaller schools&mdash;the one- and two-teacher schools particularly&mdash;should have been tackled years ago.  It has been obvious for years that these small schools are very unsatisfactory.  Now that we have the great <i>Investment in Education</i> report, it has become obvious not merely that they are unsatisfactory educationally but are extremely expensive both to build and <Col N="1688" /> maintain.  The pupil-teacher ratio, for example, ranges from fewer than 18 pupils to one teacher in the one-teacher schools to somewhere round 45 pupils in the schools with seven or more teachers.  The report has shown that if it were possible to close all those one-and two-teacher schools and redistribute teachers, all classes could be reduced to 40 and there would still be another 1,200 teachers left to reduce them further.</P>

      <P>I appreciate your point, a Leas-Chathaoirleach.  I certainly do not propose to discuss <i>Investment in Education</i>, except in passing, and I shall endeavour to get to what I have said is the least important topic discussed, as soon as possible. I should like, in passing, to mention that this report points out that the heating and cleaning of these small schools is three times as expensive as the average for all schools.  It costs twice as much per pupil to build a one-teacher school as it does to build a three-teacher school. The reasons why, educationally, these small schools are unsatisfactory are quite obvious to anyone.  It is obvious that one teacher cannot possibly be expected to teach seven or eight classes satisfactorily or in the case of the two-teacher school where there are perhaps more, it is almost as unsatisfactory.  I am going through these as quickly as possible&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point which definitely arises out of the Departmental Rules rather than anything said in <i>Investment in Education</i>.  It has been obvious for at least 30 years that the Department recognises that education in these small schools is unsatisfactory. At least as far back as 1934 the Department made geometry and algebra optional, rather than compulsory, subjects in these small schools.</P>

In one- or two-teacher schools there is an option.  They are not normally taught.  It has nothing to do with Irish or English or any other school.  It is a matter of the size of the school.

      <P>I suppose that before discussing the question of corporal punishment one should state one's own views on the subject.  My view is that, on the whole, discipline is better without corporal punishment if it can be dispensed with.  I read Senator Sheehy Skeffington's speech very carefully&mdash;<Col N="1691" /> all 35 columns of it &mdash; and I have listened to a number of speeches on this topic and I am not yet convinced that it is possible to dispense with corporal punishment in our schools.  If I were convinced I would certainly support the motion, but I am not convinced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither the Senator nor anyone else raised that question.  If it were being discussed I would be inclined to put it the other way round and say that I am not at this moment convinced that it is necessary for girls, but I am open to be convinced to the contrary.  I am not convinced in regard to boys at the moment that it is necessary, but I am willing to be convinced to the contrary.  I have not yet been convinced and to tell the truth I am not likely to be by anything Senator Sheehy Skeffington says, because in discussing this topic he gets too worked up about it, and so sentimental about it that when it comes to hard facts and principles one does not get many.  I think he labours under two illusions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>On this topic.  The first is that children can be taught by Rule, in other words, that you can lay down Rules which will decree how the teacher is to run the class.  In my opinion a good teacher does not need any Rules, and a bad teacher, or the type of sadistic teacher that Senator Sheehy Skeffington brandishes before us, will not obey the Rules.  That is the fallacy, that is the first illusion under which Senator Sheehy Skeffington suffers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second is more fundamental. The second illusion is that schoolchildren in Irish national schools need to be protected against excesses by the teachers, that the Rules are the pupils' defence against sadistic teachers.  He mentioned five or six incidents that happened over the past ten years.  I <Col N="1692" /> have no intention of going through them in detail, and there are one or two cases in which I am by no means convinced by his explanation.  Everyone knows there are some bad teachers. Teachers are human beings.  Out of 15,000 teachers there might be some sadistic teachers, but you cannot deal with people like that by Rules.  One has to use the influence of the manager, the parents, the Minister and his officials. Certainly laying down Rules will not deal with those cases.  Dragging cases of that kind through the Seanad in order&mdash;I can think of no other reason &mdash;to pour scorn on the national teachers does not do any good.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington's attitude is reflected in his remarks at column 525 of the Official Report where he complained that the Minister, for some sinister reason apparently, had done away with the rule that these Rules should be hung in the classrooms.  I do not know whether these Rules ever hung in every classroom in the country. I never saw them.  It seems to me that the teachers always had the good sense to see that that was an idiotic rule which should not be obeyed.  The notion of having such Rules hung on the walls of every classroom for the children to peruse when they were annoyed with the teachers was fantastic, and an example of the sort of Victorian Dotheboys Hall atmosphere which hung around the Rules before they were brought up to date.  I cannot conceive any advantage in having these Rules hanging on the walls, and it seems to me that the Senator in wishing to retain that Rule is showing a particularly unrealistic attitude with regard to how the teachers should behave in school, and how the Department should supervise the education system.</P>
    <P>As regards Rule No. 130 on school discipline, I am in no doubt that it is a great improvement on the previous Rules.  Right from the start one sees a change.  In the 1946 Rules there was a horrendous heading: &ldquo;Instructions in regard to the Infliction of Corporal Punishment in National Schools&rdquo;&mdash; and then a string of Rules about how children should be beaten.  The new <Col N="1693" /> Rule is under the heading of &ldquo;School Discipline&rdquo; which seems to show a different attitude straight away, and the Rule is written in a more modern, up-to-date and intelligent way.</P>
    <P>Certainly, I think it is a complete illusion to assume, as Senator Sheehy Skeffington and indeed one or two other speakers have assumed, that these changes are retrograde, that, in some way, they are an attempt by the Minister to widen and increase the amount of beating in national schools. I do not think that is so at all.  The really important point, I think, is subparagraph (iv) which reads:</P>
    <P>Any teacher who inflicts improper or excessive punishment will be regarded as guilty of conduct unbefitting a teacher and will be subject to severe disciplinary action.</P>
    <P>In the Rule which Senator Sheehy Skeffington seeks to retain, that was not there at all.  So long as you did not box the child on its ears or, I think, pull its hair, you could do anything at all.  You could beat a child on the hand as long as you liked.  Of course, I know it is ridiculous.  Quite obviously, no inspector or manager or Minister would stand for it.  But, as far as the bare Rule goes, it is the only thing that interests Senator Sheehy Skeffington.  As far as the bare rule goes, there was no barrier at all to excessive punishment so long as it was done in a certain way.  It does not seem to me to make sense.</P>
    <P>If Senator Sheehy Skeffington would only try to look at this in a sensible, practical way, instead of in the way he has, the sort of extravagant emotional way in which he tends to look into these things&mdash;indeed, the prejudicial way&mdash;I think he would see that the Rule he wishes to see restored was extraordinarily unsatisfactory.  A Rule dealing with corporal punishment which had no safeguard at all against excessive beating does not seem to me to be a protection to anyone.</P>
    <P>An example, of course, of the way in which Senator Sheehy Skeffington makes his case is his misquotation of the Minister.  He claims that the Minister admitted that, under the new <Col N="1694" /> Rules, it would be quite in order to box a child's ears.  The Minister said nothing of the kind.  At column 527 of the Official Report of Seanad Éireann, volume 60, No. 6, Senator Sheehy Skeffington said that, in the Dáil, the Minister was asked whether boxing a boy's ears constituted, under the new Rules, a breach of the regulations and that the Minister was forced to say that in some circumstances it would not.  He said, further, that the Minister admitted that teachers sometimes might be allowed to box a child's ears. When I read that, I thought that this was a very odd thing for a Minister to say and I looked up what he had said.  I found that he had said nothing of the kind.  He did not say anything that, I think, could really genuinely have led Senator Sheehy Skeffington to assume he did say it.  I just cannot understand that statement by Senator Sheehy Skeffington.</P>

      <P>The Minister said quite clearly that boxing a child's ears was in breach of the regulations.

It is quite clearly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On 28th October, 1965, as reported at column 764 of volume 218, No. 4, of the Official Report of Dáil Éireann, Deputy Cluskey asked whether, if a case came to the Minister's attention where it had been proved that a teacher had struck a child, boxed him on the ears or on the head, the Minister would be prepared to take disciplinary action.  The Minister's reply was that he could not give a blanket answer to that.</P>

      <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington confuses a breach of the regulations with disciplinary action.  If a breach of the regulations is involved, does the Senator seriously think that boxing a child on the ears would not come under subparagraph (iv) of Rule 130?  It reads:</P>
      <P>Any teacher who inflicts improper or excessive punishment will be regarded as guilty of conduct unbefitting a teacher and will be subject to severe disciplinary action.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  He said he would hear what the teacher had to say. Earlier on, in the same discussion, the Minister made this comment, as reported at Column 763 of the Official Report of the same date:</P>
      <P>I want to stress that there has been no question of giving licence to teachers to assault and batter children.  They are expected to act in a way a just parent would act and if they fail to do so, they are subject to severe disciplinary action.</P>
      <P>Would a just parent box a child's ears?  I do not think so.</P>

      <P>Further down, in the same column, the Minister was asked by Deputy Corish:</P>
      <P>Is it now permissible to administer punishment on other parts of the body than the hands?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1696" /> and he replied:</P>
    <P>...in certain circumstances it could be.  It would be a very unusual case in which this would be permissible but I can visualise circumstances in which it would happen and they would be circumstances in which a just and wise parent would deal with his own child by administering corporal punishment other than on his hands. However, it would not be a normal case.</P>
    <P>There is no question of anybody boxing anybody on the ears.  You have, on the one hand, a question whether a just parent&mdash;the Minister's quite legitimate comparison&mdash;will box on the ears and we have the answer &ldquo;No&rdquo; and we have the protection of the Rule regarding improper and excessive punishment.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington is obsessed with boxing on the ears. Is that his whole attitude?  The Rule which used to exist and which forbade the pulling of hair and boxing on the ears had nothing in it about kicking the child.  I suppose Senator Sheehy Skeffington could have said, when these Rules came into force, that they allowed a teacher to kick a child.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>The Rule is quite specific.  It says only on the open hand with a light rod or cane.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>Why this business of boxing ears?  You cannot have it both ways.  If it is only the hands, why on earth talk of boxing the ears? The thing becomes meaningless.  I think, too, on the strength of this particular discussion in the Dáil, that to accuse the Minister of saying that he would allow teachers to box children's ears is simply carrying emotion to extremes. The best way to conclude is to quote what the Minister said in this House on the subject of corporal punishment.  I think what he has to say here is a more important safeguard than any number of Rules will be.  As reported at column 595 of the Official Report of Seanad Éireann, volume 60, No. 6, he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>.... I want to make it as clear as I possibly can, that while I believe <Col N="1697" /> that the number of teachers who indulge in excessive punishment is very small, nevertheless, if cases of this kind of conduct come to light I am determined as Minister for Education to ensure that full disciplinary action will be taken against those teachers whether they are lay or clerical, that vicious or excessive punishment by teachers will not be tolerated as far as I am concerned.</P>
    <P>That, to my mind, is the real safeguard that we have with regard to the few cases there may be of excessive punishment in schools.  Rules arguing about technicalities, the commas and dotting the i's in Rules will not deal with these few cases.  It is a matter of firm action by the Minister, firm supervision by the inspectors, supervision by the managers, and complaints by the parents&mdash;and heaven knows parents whose children they feel are beaten unfairly are the first to complain.  These things are far more important than any particular rule.</P>
    <P>I have no brief to defend national teachers at all.  There are good and bad teachers.  I have no particular interest in national teachers or any other teachers but I think it right to ask Senator Sheehy Skeffington to understand that the vast majority of national school teachers are trying to do a decent job.  There may be a few hotheads among them but they are very few, and to suggest, as he has suggested here, that because a Rule says that you cannot box children or does not mention boxing their ears, the teachers are going to go around boxing ears is just fantastic.  It seems to me that he has a completely erroneous view as to how things work in Irish national schools.  I say that as far as a Rule can do anything in a matter of this kind, the new Rule is a great deal better than the previous Rule, and the Rules as a whole are very much more satisfactory.  I congratulate the Minister on bringing them in.</P>

      <P>During the earlier stages of this rather lengthy debate, Senator Stanford said that he thought that my opinion would be some help in the matter of the likelihood of <Col N="1698" /> punishment with a light cane on the open hand being possibly followed by injury to the hand or the cause of injury to the hand.  I think that this is rather unlikely, provided the punishment is light.  It is not impossible, I suppose, but it is certainly unlikely that any gross damage will be done to bones, blood vessels, nerves or anything like that.  But it is interesting that a short time before this question arose we were discussing this subject in a medical context and the suggestion was made&mdash;in fact, it was more than a suggestion&mdash;that repeated punishment, even though light and on the open hand, might cause in sensitive children a certain kind of reaction which causes in later life the hand to become contracted.  We call it Dupuytren's contracture.  It is a very difficult condition to deal with.  I am not saying that this is an established fact, but it has been said that this rather rare condition is due sometimes in sensitive people to their having been punished in this way repeatedly on the open hand while children.  I am not making this an argument for one side or the other.  I am merely answering the question which was raised by Senator Stanford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Alton said that he had consulted doctors interested in child care on the question of corporal punishment. I had an opportunity a while ago of making a study of this among a group of the people who are the usual recipients of this corporal punishment, namely, children aged about 8 to 12 years.  I asked them to discuss their reactions to the whole question of corporal punishment.  It was, in fact, long before this debate was thought of and the motion on it came up, but these questions are always cropping up in various contexts.  I asked them&mdash; and they had a lively discussion on the question&mdash;and they agreed by a considerable majority that it was only fair that if they were bold at school or did not do their lessons, they should be punished.  They did add the proviso that this punishment should be inflicted at once without any talk or palaver on the day and then should be forgotten about and not discussed afterwards. <Col N="1699" /> This again supports Senator Alton's view about the psychological trauma inflicted on a child's mind being probably more important than the actual physical injury that any reasonable punishment inflicts on his body.</P>
    <P>On the more general question, I agree with the majority of Senators who expressed the view that some corporal punishment is probably necessary and may even be beneficial very frequently in the maintenance of discipline and the training of children, but that, of course, excessive amounts of corporal punishment, or corporal punishment wrongly given in wrong circumstances, is bad.  Education is not really a matter of hammering as much information as possible into an unwilling child.  It is a partnership&mdash;or should be&mdash;between the teacher, the parent and the child.  If there is an aspect of this question of corporal punishment that is open to criticism, this comes up quite fairly for discussion. I feel a little disturbed, as I think Senator Alton was, at the emphasis that this subject seems to be getting from time to time.  I wonder whether it has not been over-emphasised and if there is not some fundamental way of avoiding this kind of circumstance.  I am sometimes afraid of being asked when I go elsewhere: &ldquo;Have you left off beating your children?&rdquo;  because we always seem to be discussing questions of corporal punishment in this country.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to say in this regard, could we not refer more directly to the function of the school managers?  Senator McQuillan said that he thought that if we are to deal with this question at all, we should have specific kinds of punishment for specific offences, that definite punishments that could be applied to a child should be laid down.  I am not so certain that I agree with him, because there is an enormous range of sensitivity on the part of children, and the punishment that will be remembered by one child to his horror for many months will be forgotten by another before its infliction is really over Therefore, I think that you must <Col N="1700" /> grade the punishment to the child, and there are only a few types of persons in the environment of the child who know the child's capacity for taking punishment.  There is the parent, the teacher, if he remembers to advert to it in the heat of the moment, and the school manager.  If the parent, having heard and seen the condition of the child, complains to the manager, I think that that should be adequate, and I am rather disturbed to find that we have to spend such a lot of Parliamentary time in discussing a question which I believe should be settled at that level.</P>

Senator Yeats who referred to the word &ldquo;sadistic.&rdquo;  Senator Ó Maoláin also mentioned it.  I never used the word &ldquo;sadistic&rdquo; and I did not accuse any teacher of being a sadist.
