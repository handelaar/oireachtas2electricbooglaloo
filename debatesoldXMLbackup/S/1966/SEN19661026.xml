    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 4 and 2 as on the Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Order of Business is agreed I wish, with your permission, in accordance with Article 26 of Standing Orders, to request leave to move a motion as a matter of urgent public importance in the following terms:</P>
      <P>That this House deplores the action of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries whose refusal to meet a responsible deputation of the farming community has brought about a situation which, if allowed to continue, can be highly detrimental to the national interest, and calls upon the Taoiseach to remove the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries from office with a view to restoring a situation where fruitful negotiation can take place between the Department of Agriculture and the farming community.</P>
      <P>Standing Orders make provision for the House to decide on the Order of Business or on any changes in the Order of Business as printed.  I, therefore, ask for your approval for a discussion on the motion and for its inclusion in the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the Senator's plea to have this matter of grave urgent national importance discussed and to have Standing Orders set aside to facilitate such discussion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall refer to Standing Order 19 which states that every sitting of the Seanad shall be governed by a printed Order Paper, which shall be prepared under the direction of the Cathaoirleach.  The business shall be dealt with in order as printed unless the Seanad shall otherwise order.  That gives discretion to the House to alter the printed Order Paper, particularly when we take into consideration Standing Order 20 which states:</P>
      <P>The Order Paper shall contain the text of all motions, and amendments thereto, to be proposed save such as are allowed by these Standing Orders to be proposed without notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that Standing Orders 19 and 20 govern my point and give absolute authority to the House in its wisdom <Col N="3" /> to decide to discuss matters of urgent public importance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to inform the House that the motion mentioned by Senator McQuillan is being brought in under Standing Order 26.  I wish also to inform the House that I duly received from Senators McQuillan and Fitzgerald a written statement of the subject matter they wish to have discussed.  I have carefully considered it but must rule in accordance with precedent that the motion is not one contemplated by the Standing Order in question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder could we ask you to expand on that point because it appears that a <i>priori</i> this is precisely the kind of matter of definite urgent public importance which is contemplated by this Standing Order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>The urgency, I think, ought to be apparent if we just walk around the corner and see the people who have shown great courage and solidarity and who have not been afforded the courtesy of a hearing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of your ruling, which I take it binds the House at this time, might I refer to the motion put down by some Fine Gael Senators, among them Senators Malone and McDonald, which has not been circulated yet and which calls on the Government and the Minister for Agriculture <Col N="4" /> and Fisheries to discharge their public responsibility and receive representatives of the National Farmers Association?  I think that motion is in order.  In view of the fact that we have not met for three months, that this position has arisen, that it is becoming more acute as time passes, that the House is likely to adjourn at an early hour this evening, that motion should be included on the Order Paper or should be taken on the Adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>May I add my plea in support of what has been said?  This is a matter of public urgency.  We are rather restricted in our debates in this House and we should extend their scope as far as we legitimately can.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand the Standing Orders, the House orders the business.  In view of the urgency of this matter and the time available for a debate, I wonder whether the Deputy Leader of the House would agree that time be set aside this afternoon or this evening for a debate on the motion submitted by Senator McQuillan and Senator Fitzgerald.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no motion on the Order Paper and there is no motion before the House that I am aware of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask for a ruling on my request.  A motion was put down but not circulated.  It seems to me, in view of the fact that we are likely to rise early this evening, that this is a matter which the Seanad ought to discuss, particularly in view of the fact that we have been on holidays for three months.  When this House is convened at public expense it ought to be in a position to discuss the plight of citizens of this country whose health is in danger.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to draw the attention of the Senator to the fact that three to four days notice is required in respect of motions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a House of Parliament and it is not good enough to say that we ought to be bound by out of date precedents which have nothing to do with an unprecedented situation.  The Chair is well aware that there is a provision in Standing Orders to enable them to be suspended in order to discuss this matter.  If this matter cannot be taken because it is not on the Order Paper, then I ask leave to raise it on the Adjournment this evening.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of taking a motion is one for the House and not for the Chair.  It would not be in order for discussion on the Adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, might I remind you and the House that we had this point in regard to the ESB legislation.  The matter did not appear on the Order Paper but still the House agreed that it should be dealt with that day.  I suggest this matter is of equal urgency and importance and even if it is not on the Order Paper the House should agree to take this motion at this meeting today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator McQuillan's motion was handed in before that.  It was handed in yesterday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have ruled that the matter was out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion was submitted yesterday.  It is not my <Col N="6" /> function to put the notices of motion on the Order Paper.  As far as I am concerned there are two ways to deal with this.  Standing Orders allow a matter of urgent public importance to be dealt with without notice.  Standing Order 20 reinforces that by stating:</P>
      <P>The Order Paper shall contain the text of all motions, and amendments thereto, to be proposed save such as are allowed by these Standing Orders to be proposed without notice.</P>
      <P>I proposed this motion, with notice, under Standing Order 26.  I submit again to you that Standing Order 20 allows this House, not you, in its discretion, to alter the business of the House to include the motion which should have been on the Order Paper because it was handed in yesterday evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair understands, and the Chair is satisfied, that this motion handed in by Senator McQuillan was handed in in accordance with Standing Order 26, not as a substantive motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was handed in in accordance with Standing Order 26. It is not my function to put notices of motion on the Order Paper.  The ruling given by you could not be described as democratic in the face of Standing Order 20.  It is not you but the House which has discretion in such matters, especially when it is a matter of urgent public importance. I would appeal to the Members of this House to support the motion which I am now moving that the Order of Business include the motion submitted yesterday.  I think it is necessary that the House should give a decision on that.  I would ask you to allow the House to make a decision itself rather than put yourself in the embarrassing position, at this stage, of deciding something that should be decided by this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Standing Order in its discretion allows this motion to be taken if the House agrees here today on the Order of Business.  I put it to the Leader of the Government Party that we are rejecting the Order of Business.  I disagree with it as outlined by the Leader of the House, unless it is ordered to move the motion put down by Senator Fitzgerald and myself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am now opposing the Order of Business and on that I challenge a division.  My reason for so doing is the failure of the Government Party to allow on the Order of Business a motion which is of absolutely vital importance to the security and wellbeing of the community.  It is a matter of grave urgent importance. The frustration of the farmers is reaching boiling point as a result of the interpretation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Might I mention another matter which arises, I think, appropriately at this stage?  Under Standing Order 25 I want to ask if you in your absolute discretion and in view of the close Vote which has taken place on the amendment to the Order of Business, would permit the motion to be raised on the Adjournment tonight. I know that it should have been in before 3 o'clock yesterday but the Chair will appreciate that the situation which we are dealing with is somewhat akin to the condition of a sick person that one watches from hour to hour and hopes that there will be a change and a turn for the better.  That has not happened in this particular case and, consequently, the motion was not put down in time to comply with Standing Orders.  I would ask you, in view of the closeness of the Vote which has been taken just now, if you would exercise your discretion and allow this matter to be raised on the Adjournment this evening.</P>

    <Title>Exchange Control (Continuance) Bill, 1966: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Exchange Control Act, 1954, is due to expire on 31st December, 1966, and the purpose of the Bill is to continue the Act in operation for a further period of four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before the war, when sterling was freely convertible into any other currency, this country could at all times rely on using sterling to make payments or transfer money to any country.  The imposition of restrictions <Col N="13" /> in 1939 on the convertibility of sterling made it necessary for us, in common with the other countries in the sterling area, to control our payments to and receipts from non-sterling area countries. This control was required to help to safeguard the foreign exchange reserves of the sterling area to which we then had, and still have, access for our requirements of foreign currencies. Foreign exchange has for some years been freely available to Irish residents for all current payments but control of capital transfers is, however, still necessary.</P>
    <P>The emergency legislation which gave power to operate exchange control was replaced in 1954 by the Exchange Control Act.  The Act was expressed to expire on 31st December, 1958, as it was hoped that the need for exchange control would have ceased by that date.  The operation of the Act was, however, extended in 1958 and again in 1962.  The transactions which may be restricted under the Act are: payments to and payments on behalf of persons resident outside the sterling area; dealings in gold and foreign exchange; dealings in and the export of foreign currency securities and unregistered securities; dealings in sterling area securities on behalf of persons resident outside the area; and the export of currency notes. The Act also contains provisions to ensure that exports to countries outside the sterling area will be paid for in an acceptable currency and that foreign exchange will not be hoarded by individuals but made available to the banking system.</P>
    <P>The Act provides for the granting of exemptions by Ministerial regulations from compliance with requirements of the Act and for the giving of general or limited permissions in respect of transactions.  These provisions have been operated so that current transactions have for years past been free and such supervision as is applied to current transactions is directed towards ensuring that they are not used as a cover for unauthorised capital transfers.  The day-to-day administration of the control has been delegated to the Central Bank.  Persons wishing to make payments in foreign <Col N="14" /> currency normally arrange the payments through a bank and the banks have been authorised to deal with a wide range of transactions.  Foreign exchange for travel purposes may be obtained from a bank or travel agent. If the permission of the Central Bank is required for a transaction, the bank or travel agent normally transmits the application to the Central Bank on behalf of the applicant.</P>
    <P>Transfers of capital abroad are not normally allowed.  There are, however, some regular exceptions, for example, emigrants are allowed to bring up to a limit of £5,000 a family; the repayment of approved loans is allowed as is any investment which is shown to be of advantage to the country.  All applications are considered. In general portfolio and direct investment outside the sterling area is not allowed at the official rate of exchange.  Investment currency may be purchased for the purpose of acquiring such securities.  I should say, however, that at present this currency stands at a premium of some 20 per cent over the official exchange rates.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to a misunderstanding that arose from the Dáil debate on the Bill last week in case any Senators have been misled.  It was incorrectly reported in the press that as a condition of our drawing on the International Monetary fund in January, 1966, we agreed not to restrict travel allowances without consultation with the Fund.  No such condition in fact attached to the drawing. We are, however, obliged under the Articles of Agreement of the Fund, which are scheduled to the Bretton Woods Agreement Act, 1957, not to impose restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions unless we have obtained the approval of the Fund.  From 1957 when we joined the Fund until 1961 we, like most other countries, availed of transitional arrangements which permitted the maintenance of some exchange restrictions on current transactions.  In that year we accepted the full obligations of the Agreement not to impose restrictions on current transactions, except with the approval of the Fund. <Col N="15" /> If the circumstances of our external payments were such that it would be advisable for us to restrict travel allowances for places outside the sterling area, I have no doubt that the approval of the Fund would be forthcoming. The Act does not enable restrictions to be placed on travel to Britain or other sterling area countries.</P>
    <P>The reasons for continuing this Act which applied on previous occasions continue to apply.  Exchange control is still necessary to enable us to fulfil our sterling area obligations.  I consider, however, that it is well that the situation should be kept under review and it is for this reason that the Bill proposes once again to set a limit of four years on the extension of the Act.  I recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to raise a couple of points of relative detail on the Bill and on the Minister's statement, first of all on what he said about our obligations to the International Monetary Fund as regards restrictions.  It was not clear to me whether our circumstances in regard to the present limit of £250 is agreed by the Fund.  The Minister said that when we joined the Fund in 1961 there were traditional arrangements which permitted the maintenance of some exchange restrictions on current transactions. However, the Minister said that in 1961 we accepted the full obligations of the Agreement not to impose restrictions on current transactions except with the approval of the Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can I, therefore, take it that we have the approval of the Fund for the £250 restriction and that this is in accordance with our arrangement with the Fund?  Secondly, the Minister made some reference, either here or in the Dáil, to the fact that we have had to take action to ensure that facilities for foreign exchange in this country are not availed of by people in Britain.  I am not clear as to what action we have taken.  Reference was made to communications with Britain.  What form did these communications take?  Was it a matter of creating new restrictions or enforcing restrictions that had been allowed to lapse and what is the <Col N="16" /> mechanism for ensuring against large-scale evasion?  How would the Minister set about ensuring against an Englishman who had friends or relatives in this country asking them, if they did not contemplate foreign travel in the ensuing year, to go in and collect £250 on their passports and transfer it to him?  What control is the Minister to exercise to ensure this does not happen? His statements on this are extremely vague and it is important that we should know how this protection is to be afforded.</P>
    <P>I noted the Minister's reference to the circumstances in which emigrants going can take as much as £5,000 per family.  This will give rise to a hollow laugh in relation to many emigrants who are unlikely to be in possession of such a sum.  However, there may be people emigrating who possess property of that value or the sale of whose land may yield more than that amount.  Accordingly, the decision to limit it to such a figure seems severe: that people should be limited to £5,000 capital per family when they are going away to start a new life seems a severe provision.  Is there provision to modify that if there is an application from somebody who makes a good case or is it to be a rigidly enforced limit without regard to humane considerations that should arise?</P>
    <P>The Minister said in his statement that current transactions have for years past been free and such supervision as is applied to current transactions is directed towards ensuring that they are not used as a cover for unauthorised capital transfers.  I was rather surprised at that because I had heard, and have had it confirmed by what the Minister said, that in relation to certain current purchases from abroad exchange control restrictions have existed even if not enforced. This has been the case in the matter of oil in particular.  Am I wrong in thinking that the possibility of such restrictions has been adverted to and that people purchasing oil have had to run the hazard of getting it through the exchange control mechanism?</P>
    <P>If that is the case the Minister's <Col N="17" /> statement would not appear to be entirely correct.  Of course, I may be misinformed on this.  It may be that for purchases of oil and for other current transactions permission is automatically given and there is no such restriction, though the agreement may be adhered to for other reasons.  I should be glad to receive an assurance that the Minister meant what he said and that there is no question of the power being used to influence transactions of that kind in a way the Government might wish to influence them.</P>
    <P>In the original Act there are two schedules giving a list of authorised dealers and authorised depositors.  The Act provides in section 31 for the appointment of persons in addition to those specified in the Schedules to be authorised dealers and depositors.  Is that power under section 31 of the Principal Act being exercised?  If so, have there been many cases or is it a rare thing to add to this list or is it the position that a reputable banking organisation can automatically secure an addition to this list?  What is the position as regard the exercise of the powers given under section 31 of the Principal Act?</P>
    <P>They are points which seem to arise from the Minister's statement on the original Act and the amending Bill. More broadly, I wonder if the Minister could clarify our relationship with the Sterling Area?  Is it simply that we are an ordinary member of the Sterling Area or do we have a privileged position in view of the very close financial links between ourselves and Britain? Is there a special relationship existing or are we one of the members of the scheduled territories of the Sterling Area and treated by the British authorities on the same basis as everybody else?  Some enlightenment of our position here would be of general interest so that we might better understand where we stand in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>There is one matter of grave importance which I consider is proper to raise on this Bill and that is the decision of the British Government, I think last March, to impose restrictions on the export of capital to Ireland.  This <Col N="18" /> matter has not received as much publicity as it deserves.  It is an important matter of principle and a matter of practice.  As regards the matter of principle, this country has always enjoyed free movement of capital from Britain.  The fact that there is any restriction on the free movement of capital is likely to hurt us more than it will hurt Britain because we get an import of capital to the tune of £30 million a year.</P>
    <P>It seems extraordinary that up to just two years ago this country was an independent trading country.  We had no free trade area status with Britain but we always had free access to the British market for virtually all our goods, without any possibility of the imposition of any tariff or levies of any kind on our goods going in.  We had free movement of capital from Britain to Ireland.  We now enjoy the dubious benefits of this free trade area which has not brought the benefits which the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries thought and promised in regard to the price of cattle.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, all our goods going into Britain will have to bear a levy and the arrangements in regard to the free movement of capital from Britain to Ireland, which has existed for as long as anybody can remember &mdash;there may have been restrictions in the nineteenth century&mdash;has been broken by the action of the British Government.  Through the negligence of the Irish Government and their lack of foresight in this respect free trade with Britain and the establishment of this very close relationship with Britain mean that we are cut off with regard to the flow of capital from that country.</P>
    <P>This is a matter of very considerable importance because our plans for the future development of this country will depend, as the Minister knows better than anybody else, on a very substantial inflow of capital.  If we are to achieve any growth we need this inflow and it will have to be much greater than it is now.  Despite this we are in a position in which the British source of that capital inflow has been cut off by the arbitrary action of the British Government.  We are <Col N="19" /> now in a position in which we are suffering from a close-down of this inflow of capital.</P>
    <P>I am aware that this is quite a serious restriction.  I know there are restrictions on the inflow of capital from the USA but this does not seem to have such a bad effect.  I am equally aware that the inflow of capital from Britain is extremely difficult.  Unless the amount of capital is less than £25,000 permission has to be obtained from the Bank of England.  This means that for the time being, and as far ahead as we can see at the moment, the inflow of capital from Britain to this country is stopped.  We may be in a position to partly get around this by providing small factory space at Shannon.  This may help to some degree so that small industries will be able to come here.</P>
    <P>We are in a very serious position because of this move by Britain which has ensured that the flow of industries into this country has, for the time being, stopped.  The Minister ought to tell the House what action he has taken in regard to this.  He ought to tell the House what assurance he has received from Britain.  I think the British action was an intolerable one to take with regard to a country with which it had always had free movement of capital.  Apparently we are, in this country, to take in British goods with all that entails for our industries here and at the same time the capital which we need to build up our industries here and to set up new industries is to be withheld.</P>
    <P>In a situation in which the British economic position is so disastrously serious as regards their balance of payments that with her enormous resources she cannot afford to allow the odd million or two of capital into this country for industrial purposes, it puzzles me that while our situation is so serious, we do not have any problem in this regard and can permit the outflow of capital.  It seems odd that in relation to such a small undeveloped country as ours that our capital can flow out freely whereas in respect of <Col N="20" /> Britain, one of the greatest industrial powers, British capital cannot be allowed into this country at all.  This seems to be ludicrous.</P>
    <P>The Minister should tell us what he has done about this.  He should tell us what assurance he has received.  As regards the import levy the Government have failed to act with vigour. In both cases we allowed our rights to be whittled away.  In both cases we made inadequate provisions.  In both cases our economy has suffered severely.  I think that this capital inflow matter may be the most serious one but both cases will lead to a restriction of foreign investment in this country.</P>
    <P>We can no longer say as we used to say to foreign firms: &ldquo;You can set up your factory in the full knowledge that your goods can enter Britain freely and no import levy will be imposed on them.&rdquo;  That is no longer true.  When foreign investors come to this country and try to decide where to put their industries, either North or South, they can be told by the Northern Government: &ldquo;We are an integral part of the United Kingdom and you can enjoy the free movement of your goods into Britain but in the Republic that is not so.&rdquo;  There is no restriction of capital movement in Northern Ireland but we have it now.</P>
    <P>The problem of attracting foreign industrialists to this country has been very seriously aggravated.  The seriousness of this problem is not sufficiently understood because the Government have not felt it proper to explain to people how serious those difficulties are.  This is a mistake.  When something of this kind happens people should be told frankly that this is a serious matter.  We have some inflow of German and American capital into this country but the British inflow of capital has been the main source of new industrial activity.  Every year, without exception, more British firms come here to set up industries than either German or American firms.  The inflow of capital for industrial purposes from Britain has been very important to us. This has been effectively stopped by this act on the part of the British <Col N="21" /> Government.  This arrangement which we had and which helped to give great employment and output in this country and which helped our economy and helped to a very high degree foreign industrial development, the biggest single source, has been effectively stopped.  The seriousness of this has not been adverted to by the Government. The whole question of restrictions on capital movement is something we need to consider very seriously.  If Britain is going to impose restrictions of this kind, it would be a great mistake for us to restrict the outflow of capital to Britain because of the reciprocal reaction from the British Government. Our last stand then would be worse than the first.  The force of that argument is not now as strong as it was. We are now in the position in which we have no longer the excuse of refraining from taking action.  The net effect of our taking any action of this kind now would be that it would lead to greater restrictions in the future. Our policy certainly needs to be looked at again in the light of this unfortunate position.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to ask the Minister if he would avail of an appropriate occasion to state fully the Irish position on the world liquidity problem.  If the Minister has, in fact, stated this fully and I have been negligent in reading his speeches, or have not read the right one, perhaps he would draw my attention to a recent full statement on where we are standing in this world complex of world liquidity.  The nearest statement I have had of the Irish position was in a speech by the Secretary of the Minister's Department in Trinity College a year ago.  This was a statement made by a public servant subject to the necessary limitations.  I think we ought to have a Ministerial statement which would explain where we stand as between British, Americans, French and others.  We should get a full explanation of what the Irish Government's policy is, a development of what the Secretary of the Minister's Department stated in Trinity College a year ago, brought up to date and given with the full authority of the <Col N="22" /> Minister as a statement of Irish policy. If the Minister has made the statement he need do no more than direct my attention to the relevant address in which the matter was dealt with.  I do not suggest he should deal with it at length here now but I do suggest the public should be notified and told what our policy is.</P>
    <P>One of the odd things about our foreign policy in any area is that even where we have a foreign policy and where we take a line of different opinion neither the Dáil, the Seanad nor the Irish public are told much about it.  In many cases the line the Government take is one that would be acceptable nationally.  These are not matters of Irish controversy.  Nevertheless, the public are entitled to be told our policy, financial as well as political, and it is desirable that the public should be kept informed, that the Dáil and Seanad should be informed and that public opinion should be brought along with the Government. There is something odd about the Irish Government stating to foreigners what the Irish policy is and trying to get them to understand our policy.  While the rest of the world knows what our policy is we do not know what our policy is or what is being said on our behalf.  There is a failure of communication here.</P>
    <P>This is more generally a matter for the Minister for External Affairs but many Ministers in carrying out the duties of their Departments are involved in international communications and they have to talk.  There are opportunities for the Irish Government to tell the Irish people what is going on.  There are conferences of Ministers, transport, for example, where the Minister for Transport and Power would be involved, FAO where the Minister for Agriculture would be involved and WHO where the Minister for Health would be involved and in the present Minister's case it would be the International Monetary Fund.  I think much more could be said to the Dáil and the Seanad and the Irish people as to what our position is.  This can do nothing but good.  We will not get <Col N="23" /> involved in controversial battles in the Dáil and Seanad over world liquidity problems but the public are entitled to be brought along with the Government in the policies presented in our interests and the interests of the world generally.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister if he has not spoken in full on this matter to choose some appropriate occasion to do so, not necessarily at a dinner; it does not sound like an after-dinner statement, but on some other occasion when an audience would be receptive to it and when the matter would be neither too dull nor too boring.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point I should like to raise.  It is the question of the travel allowance. The Minister has told us, and Senator FitzGerald has questioned him about it, that we agreed not to change the amount that could be carried abroad by a person travelling outside the sterling area from £250.  We agreed not to do that without asking the permission of the International Monetary Fund. The Minister has said, if I understood correctly, that if circumstances warranted it we would ask, and he anticipated we would not be refused.  What surprises me, and Senator FitzGerald has expressed the same surprise, is that we seem to have plenty of sterling to allow our nationals to use a travel allowance of £250 per head while Britain is so seriously short of sterling currency that she has to husband her resources and reduce the travel allowance, as from next month, to £50.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This seems odd to me.  I do not understand how the Minister could say if circumstances warranted it we would ask and that permission would be granted.  Yet, apparently circumstances warrant this severe restriction in Britain but not here.  I should not like the situation to arise where we would suddenly be told that we are far shorter of sterling than we realise and that it now has to be seriously cut down.  I cannot understand how we can allow our nationals to export in travel allowance five times what the United Kingdom nationals are allowed by British <Col N="24" /> Government regulations.  Therefore, I should just like to ask the Minister why do we not ask for permission or is it that we have some mysterious source of sterling which is not available to the United Kingdom?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the point raised by each of the Senators on the question of the £250 allowance.  Senator FitzGerald asked how there can be a figure of £250 and whether the IMF has had to agree to the stating of a figure of that amount, and that certain permission for foreign exchange might not be given to people travelling.  This £250 was there for a long time and the Fund did not have to agree specifically to do it but if we requested a change in that we would then be asked to get the agreement of the Fund to a change in the £250, that is not for one journey but for every journey a person makes. No form is necessary or no form of permission is necessary for a person who wants to take £250 sterling to any country.  If a person wants to take more than that certain formalities are necessary; it must be marked on his passport on account of the amount of money that he gets.  That is to ensure that our own residents are, in fact, drawing these moneys for travel abroad.  It is possible in almost every case to get more than £250.  The check is mainly designed to ensure that these travel allowances are not used for the purpose of capital transactions.</P>

      <P>The Senator can ask the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is my question: The Minister said in his speech:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="25" /> We are, however, obliged under the Articles of Agreement of the Fund, which are scheduled to the Bretton Woods Agreement Act, 1957, not to impose restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions unless we have obtained the approval of the Fund.  From 1957 when we joined the Fund until 1961 we, like most other countries, availed of transitional arrangements which permitted the maintenance of some exchange restrictions on current transactions.  In that year we accepted the full obligations of the Agreement not to impose restrictions on current transactions except with the approval of the Fund.</P>
    <P>Now I understand the Minister as saying that because the £250 is of some antiquity he does not need the approval of the Fund.  I am just asking the Minister to clarify that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>If we want to press for that we would have to seek the approval of the Fund.  Is that clear?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is in contradiction of what the Minister said here that to impose any additional restriction&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>When we went into the Fund we agreed to become members of the Fund and this figure of £250 was there.  We agreed to the limit of £250 at that time and the fact that it was there was accepted.  Anything by way of reduction must be agreed to by the Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not so sure whether Senator Sheehy Skeffington mentioned some misunderstanding that occurred in the Dáil debate.  I referred to it in the course of my speech.  That was a reference to the suggestion that before we could make a drawing on the IMF we had to specifically agree that the £250 limit would not be reduced. I am not sure if Senator Sheehy Skeffington's question was in that form but, as the Senator is aware, the drawings from the International Monetary Fund are limited to member countries to help them overcome balance of payments problems and <Col N="26" /> drawings are made in the form of purchases of foreign currencies from the Fund.  These must be re-purchased over a period of three to five years at certain fixed rates of interest.  In 1965 we went to the Fund to purchase £8 million worth of foreign currencies in order to help us overcome our balance of payments problems.  That transaction, did in fact, help us to overcome those problems to the extent that they do not now exist, certainly not to the point that we would easily get the agreement of the International Monetary Fund to restrict current payments in sterling for foreign transactions. Britain has a much more acute problem in this respect and before Britain could take action in reducing the £250 limit to £50 they had, in fact, to get specific agreement of the Fund for reduction of the limitation.  This, as the Senator observed, comes into force as of next month.  Our position as of now is not the same.  We, with the aid of drawings from the Fund of other currencies have helped ourselves to overcome our balance of payments difficulties. Britain, unfortunately, are far from achieving that position.</P>
    <P>With regard to the assurance against evasion and the methods whereby we establish this assurance against evasion, banks and travel agents usually issue currencies for this purpose.  They have been advised of the need to satisfy themselves that an applicant for currency in excess of £250 is, in fact, a resident of this country.  As Senators are aware, passports are normally marked with the amount that the person draws in excess of £250 in sterling. I must confess that I cannot give a specific answer to the question put by the Senator: &ldquo;What would happen if a friend in Britain asked somebody in Ireland to get an advance of sterling for any purpose in excess of £250 and had it marked on his passport?&rdquo; If that person did not subsequently travel, then I presume he could transfer in some way, whether devious or otherwise, the proceeds of his application. Of course, that could not happen again because the passport of a genuine traveller would have to bear marks other than the amount of drawings he <Col N="27" /> had made for travel.  In other words, they would have to be stamped with immigration officers' marks in the country of his visit.  I am only saying that it is possible that such a person might get away with this once but when he would go to do it again the first offence would be discovered.  I do not know if it is possible to discover it even before that.</P>
    <P>There are no restrictions on foreign currency or sterling payments for the purchase of oil.  This would be contrary to the IMF regulations. There is, as Senators are aware, another measure, the Control of Imports Act, which was before the House about three years ago, which gives power to the Government to restrict by Order the importation of commodities from a particular country.  At the time that legislation was going through even though it did not mention any particular country it was stated to be designed to prevent purchasing from Iron Curtain countries particularly those who take little or nothing from us.  There is, to that extent, a limitation on the freedom of purchase of oil or any other commodity from such countries.  While the Act has never been invoked, the fact is that certain people who wanted to purchase oil from these countries were made aware of it if it was thought that it would be against the public interest.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald also commented on the limit of £5,000 in respect of families going abroad.  He spoke about the amount that families could bring with them.  That is usually found to be sufficient in most cases.  There are very few cases where a family is forced to emigrate who can bring that much but then, of course, some people decide to emigrate from choice, people who would have resources beyond this amount.  Such resources and such amounts above the £5,000 limit can be transferred by selling sterling and I think that kind of sterling would stand at only a very small discount. for such purposes.</P>
    <P>With regard to Senator FitzGerald's query on the sterling area, the arrangements are that we sell our surplus foreign exchange in London and we are <Col N="28" /> entitled to purchase all the foreign exchange we need for current, and if necessary, capital purposes.  The sterling area countries are those that keep a large part of their reserve in sterling. I am afraid I could not go much further; I could not enter into a long discourse as to the exact relationship of our sterling area position but, broadly speaking, what I have just said describes our position.</P>
    <P>With regard to the restrictions placed by the British Government on the free movement of capital between Britain and other countries, this was, of course, announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his last Budget.  The Irish Government were made aware of this announcement very shortly in advance and immediately the Taoiseach made strong representations to the British Prime Minister and I to the Chancellor of the Exchequer.  This was followed up by personal visits of the Head of the Department of Finance but it was explained to us and to the Secretary of the Department of Finance that since we, a non-Commonwealth country, were one of the countries against which restriction was imposed and since a country like New Zealand, which was a full member of the Commonwealth and in which capital movements were roughly of the order of the capital movements in this country; since New Zealand has acquiesced in this voluntary restriction, it would have been impossible for the British to make an exception in our case.  I might add that while I agree with Senator FitzGerald that it is from Britain in the main, or at least in the greatest part, that we have received capital investment for industrial purposes in this country, I am satisfied that so far this measure&mdash;which is a voluntary one by the way; there is no statutory order which prohibits the British finance houses or British firms from investing in this country, it is a convention which has been established now and voluntarily agreed to by these companies&mdash;has not had a serious adverse effect on industrial expansion in this country.</P>
    <P>I might say that these restrictions on investment in this country do not <Col N="29" /> extend to personal investment in stocks and shares, short-term financing, reinvestment by insurance companies or capital transfers by hire purchase companies, where these loans are destined for the purchase of goods manufactured in Britain.  Capital investment in Ireland by United Kingdom firms, though relatively important in itself, is a relatively small component of the total capital investment from that country to this one. I can assure the House that the operation of these restrictions is being watched carefully by the Government, by State Departments, and Statesponsored bodies and other trading and business organisations have been advised to keep in touch with the appropriate Department to ensure that the Government will be aware of any specific restriction, so that adequate representations may be made.  I can say too, that I have been in close personal contact with the British Chancellor of the Exchequer on this matter and I intend to continue to maintain this close personal contact.</P>
    <P>By and large, while we naturally do not like any restriction on the free flow of capital, I am satisfied, so far, it has not made any great impact or any appreciable impact on the expansion of our industrial arm.  In relation to Senator FitzGerald's criticism of the Government action in not writing a provision of this nature into the Free Trade Area Agreement, there is&mdash;in perhaps more general terms&mdash; a provision whereby it is specifically stated that any act by either Government which disturbs the balance of the Agreement is a subject for discussion. As a general rule, as the Senator is aware, discussions of that nature, even though they have not occurred yet specifically as a result of this provision in the Agreement, lead to satisfactory solutions between ourselves and the British.  I might say, too, that the Agreement also specifically provides for action by either Government in the event of balance of payments problems. I cannot remember the exact details of the article or sub-article in which it is contained but certainly, in the event of serious balance of payments <Col N="30" /> problems arising, then either Government can take certain action.</P>
    <P>On the question of liquidity&mdash;I did make reference to the position, naturally, when I was speaking at a recent meeting of the International Monetary Fund in Washington.  I did not refer to it otherwise, I think, than in the Dáil recently, so that for me at any rate, there was not any comprehensive statement on the subject, except to the extent of the suggestions I did make to the Bank when I was speaking on that occasion.  I naturally criticised the Committee, or the substitutes of the Ten&mdash;these are the substitutes of the Finance Ministers of the Ten major finance countries who have been dealing with this problem.  They had no special mandate from the IMF itself but, by reason of their very strong position in world financial matters, they grouped together to see to what extent they could bring about, again, liquidity in the world; in other words, reasonable finance to keep pace with the increasing output of goods and services by the people of the world.  Unfortunately, these currencies had been falling short, I believe at the rate of about six per cent per annum of the growth of economic activity.  That of course, if continued, would mean that economic activity in many countries in the world would grind to a halt.  Certainly, in so far as the developing countries are concerned, it would have a very serious effect.  These countries&mdash;many of them are possibly flattered to be described as developing countries&mdash;rely to a very considerable extent for the advance of their economies on the inflow of capital from abroad, on the inflow of foreign currencies.  If this is restricted, then it would be impossible for those countries to make any worthwhile progress. We, too, to an extent, are affected adversely, as, indeed, are stronger countries than ours by this limitation on liquidity.</P>
    <P>I did make a suggestion in the course of my speech to the IMF and the Senate Commission.  I think I might as well quote it here.  I did <Col N="31" /> say that I referred to the delay, or the slowness of coming to a solution by this Committee of Ten.  I might say now that they have established a regime whereby these Ten will consult with the executive directors of the Bank over the next couple of months to see if they can bring about a solution to this problem.  But I did say:</P>
    <P>We suggest, as an interim measure, that a decision be taken to increase IMF quotas by an average annual amount over the next three years. The consequent increase in drawing rights would automatically supplement reserves.</P>
    <P>In other words countries which are members of the IMF&mdash;I think there are now 104 such countries&mdash; would be obliged to increase their lodgments of their own currencies with the IMF and that would give other member countries a consequential right to draw an increased amount. That I suggested would have been an interim measure at least to get over this problem of limitation which I hope at any rate will have been solved at the end of this year.  I will perhaps take the suggestion of Senator FitzGerald and deal with this point at greater length on another appropriate occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Before <Col N="32" /> agreeing to this section, which will continue the operation of this Bill, I should like to raise two points.  I am sorry that the Minister was unhappy about my interjection but I merely wanted to raise that particular point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I was probably influenced by the performance I saw here earlier.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in competition in that particular league, a Leas-Chathaoirleach.  I should like just to raise this matter a little further. The reason for my interjection was that the Minister's statement, as I read it, is in complete contradiction to his opening statement, and this is a matter of some little concern.  I should like to quote again from his opening statement in which he said:</P>
      <P>We are, however, obliged under the Articles of Agreement of the Fund, which are scheduled to the Bretton Woods Agreement Act, 1957, not to impose restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions unless we have obtained the approval of the Fund.  From 1957 when we joined the Fund until 1961 we, like most other countries, availed of transitional arrangements which permitted the maintenance of some exchange restrictions on current transactions.  In that year we accepted the full obligations of the Agreement not to impose restrictions on current transactions, except with the approval of the Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that anybody listening to that could understand that what that meant was that after 1961 we were permitted to continue existing restrictions but not to impose new ones.  If the Minister is now saying that the position is that after 1961 we were permitted to continue the restrictions which he described as transitional arrangements, then that position is in complete contradiction to his opening statement.  This may be simple inadvertence, that the statement was badly worded, but I think I am justified in asking him for a more detailed explanation and some reconciliation of his statement in his reply to the debate with his opening statement, which cannot <Col N="33" /> be reconciled on the face of it.  It may be that what he meant to say was that in 1961 we accepted the full obligations not to impose additional restrictions.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify the position.</P>
    <P>There is one other point.  I should like to take further this question of British people getting money here.  I am much more worried about this after hearing the Minister, because I had forgotten that it is only when the sum exceeds £250 that a passport is stamped.  If this be the case it is apparently open to any English person to get in touch with a bank or a travel agency here and collect from each his allowance of £250, and if he went to every branch here of a large bank or travel agency he could collect quite a few thousand pounds.  Perhaps I have misunderstood the position, but that is what appears from what the Minister said.  If the procedure were to get some friend in Ireland to have his passport stamped for £250 and the passport were subsequently to be examined, which is never done, then if it transpired that the person never left the country he might never get any more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only in respect of sums exceeding £250 that in addition to having the passport stamped certain other forms would have to be filled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my impression that in recent years the requirement to stamp the passport has not been enforced for sums under £250, and if I am correct is it because of the British restrictions that we are now enforcing this, where it was not previously enforced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that the requirement to stamp sums less than £250 was not insisted upon for some time, but banks and travel agencies have now been advised that they ought to do this henceforth.  With regard to the £250 limit perhaps I may have misstated the position or stated it in such a way that there could be misunderstanding about the position in relation to the IMF.  At the present time we ourselves for our own purposes have this limit of £250 beyond <Col N="34" /> which a person will have to get specific approval.  The IMF is aware of that limit.  We did not have to get their approval for that at any time.  It is only in the event of our introducing a limit that we have to get the approval of the IMF.  It is aware of the £250 limit and that we scrutinise other applications above that.  No approval would be necessary from the Fund for a change in the limit.  Approval would be required if we wished to limit the holiday travel allowance to any specified amount.  If we try to limit it to any specified amount from now on we would have to get approval, but this £250 limit is in existence for so long and the Fund is aware of it. It is the point beyond which we require certain scrutinies.  We do not, in fact, limit it to that £250, and if people ask for more they get it freely, so that £250 has no special sacrosanct position other than that if we now impose a limit&mdash;we have none at the moment, but £250 is the point beyond which people will have to ask for permission to get more&mdash;we would then have to get the approval of the Fund.  I do not know if I have made that very clear yet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand it now, and I thank the Minister for the courtesy of his reply.  If I decided to go to the Carribbean and spend thousands of pounds on a holiday in a couple of months, in that unlikely event I would automatically be given permission as long as I did not try to set up a small business in Bermuda. If I understand the position correctly there is no limit to the amount available for genuine holiday making.</P>

      <P>This is a motion seeking the approval of the House to the making of an Order adding the Church of Ireland Training College as a body specified in the second column of the State Guarantees Act, 1954 and to approve of the sum of £535,000 to be inserted as the sum which the State may guarantee in respect of the Church of Ireland Training College.  This matter arises as a result of the sale by the Church of Ireland authorities of the site of their existing training college which is, and has been, inadequate for their purposes for a number of years. The proceeds of the sale of the site and whatever was saleable on the site were not nearly sufficient to provide the authorities with a new training college. They were unable to procure the necessary loan finance to proceed with the building of the new college without Government guarantee.</P>
      <P>This guarantee is now given in the form of this Order so that the necessary finances may be raised.  I may say, further, that the payment of both principal and interest will be made by the Department of Education in the ordinary way, so long as the college continues to be used for the purpose for which it is being erected&mdash;the training of teachers for national schools in the Church of Ireland.</P>

I think the Church of Ireland Training College has a characteristic which is not shared by other training colleges&mdash;I am subject to correction on this&mdash;in that the people trained there get a University degree at Trinity College after a four years course for that purpose.  That is something which we might hope to extend to the other training colleges as well.  It is a good precedent and a good headline.  We have no difficulty in supporting this measure.</P>

      <P>I should like to welcome this measure because it is a facility being afforded by the Government towards the provision of training colleges for teachers.  With the new outlook so far as education is concerned and the increased measure of education required, it is obvious that as soon as we can do so it will be necessary for us to increase the number of teachers as rapidly as possible.  At present, in many cases classes are for too large because there are not sufficient teachers to ensure that the classes are smaller. It has been found that the standard of education can be raised by reducing the numbers in classes and increasing the numbers of teachers.  Any contribution that can be made towards the training of teachers to make them available as soon as possible should be welcomed.</P>

    <Title>Local Elections Bill, 1966: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="37" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill provides for the postponement until June, 1967, of the local elections which are due to be held during 1966, for the holding of future local elections during the month of June and at quinquennial intervals after 1967 and for some conseqential matters.</P>
      <P>The Government considered that in the circumstances of this year it would have been undesirable to hold the local elections in conjunction with the Presidential election.  It was also considered that the holding of the elections later in the year would not suit the convenience of voters, many of whom would be absent from home on holidays or in migratory employment during the late summer and early autumn months and because of the difficulty of providing adequate heating and lighting in some rural polling stations in winter months.</P>
      <P>In addition, proposals for important changes in the law governing local elections are in course of preparation. A Bill is being drafted to repeal certain disqualifications for membership of local authorities and to set up new legal machinery for questioning local elections by petition.  It is desirable that these changes should, if possible, operate in respect of the next local elections.  Amendment of certain other aspects of the electoral law, including the extension of postal voting facilities, is also under consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill proposes that the date to be fixed for the poll at future local elections shall be in the month of June. Under the existing law it is open to the Minister for Local Government to fix any date he chooses for polling during an election year.  I consider it desirable to limit the period within which such elections may take place and section 4 of the Bill proposes to fix a definite month for the holding of local elections.  The month of June appears to be the most suitable one <Col N="38" /> for the purpose.  This provision, I feel, should commend itself to all persons and bodies either directly or indirectly concerned with local elections.</P>
    <P>Pending the holding of the next local elections under the provisions of the Electoral Act, 1963, it is necessary to make special provision for the holding this year of annual or quarterly meetings by local authorities.  Following the introduction and circulation of the Bill I advised local authorities to arrange to hold these meetings this year during the normal period, 23rd June to 1st July, which is the period specified by the Bill, and it is proposed that anything so done by them in anticipation of the passing of the Bill will be validated.</P>
    <P>The Bill also includes certain consequential provisions concerning the extension of terms of office of existing members of local authorities, appointments of school attendance committees and meetings of vocational education committees.</P>

      <P>This is a Bill to enable the postponement of the local elections for the second time.  One would have imagined that the Minister would have given a little more time to the Seanad in telling us his reasons for this postponement.  When one considers that in the other House the affairs with which the local authorities concern themselves took many days to debate, and that the Minister took some days, shall I say, to reply to that debate, one should imagine that when the Minister seeks power to postpone the local elections he would have more than a speech of just a few minutes for the Seanad.  Perhaps the reasons given by the Minister are sufficient in themselves to enable Senators to make up their minds that the local elections should be postponed again this year but to my mind, at any rate, the Minister is showing scant courtesy to Senators and, if I may use the term, scantier courtesy to the electorate and to the local authorities simply because it is politically expedient for the Minister to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not challenge the Minister when he says he has respect for local authorities. He must have respect for them <Col N="39" /> because his position in the Government must mean that he should have respect for them.  The length of time the debate on his Estimate took this year and his own experience as a member of a local authority must give him some idea of the importance of local councils.  We can, therefore, appreciate that his few short words here this afternoon were not intended in any way to denigrate the local authorities.  On the other hand, we appreciate that all he has done is his routine job.  These elections were postponed from 1965 to 1966 and it has become politically expedient now to postpone them again until next year and the sooner the Minister gets the job over the better.  That has been his attitude here and in the other House.</P>
    <P>Frankly, I admire the Minister who apparently does not give two hoots for the Seanad.  That type of attitude springs from his supreme confidence in his Party.  I must say I admire him for that.  Whether that confidence is justified is another matter.  I am always inclined to give credit where credit is due and quite obviously the Minister has shown here that he has confidence in his Party.</P>
    <P>The manner in which the Minister's Estimate was taken this year shows the enormous importance of local councils. It showed what councils mean to Deputies and incidentally to Senators.  When we consider the importance of these councils side by side with the manner in which, for political expediency, elections to them are postponed from year to year, we must quarrel with the Minister.  It is one thing to admire his political belief in himself and his Party and another to admire what he is doing here this afternoon.</P>
    <P>This casual postponement of the local elections must tend in the eyes of the public to denigrate the importance of local authorities.  That is a bad thing in itself because we expect the people to come out and vote.  No doubt next year the Minister will exhort them by way of public speech and public advertisement, and by every other means possible, to come out and vote in large numbers.  How can he expect them to pay attention to his exhortations when they remember <Col N="40" /> his scant consideration at this time.</P>
    <P>This Bill when it becomes law will give retrospective approval to every action taken by local authorities since last June.  Very often local authorities have unpopular things to do.  One of the most unpopular at the moment, beside the imposition of local taxation, is the refusal to people of planning permission.  I know that in my area&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The people are acting illegally but no more illegally than the councils themselves have been acting since last June.  This Bill will validate the councils' actions and surely when people see this kind of thing they will be inclined to say: &ldquo;We will act illegally as the councils have been doing.&rdquo;  The Minister is giving bad example to the electorate.  By enabling councils, retrospectively, to act illegally he is implying to the electorate by example that they may also do it.  Some of them have done it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fail to see any valid reason why this Bill should seek to postpone the elections beyond next month.  June is a holiday month, a period when people may be away from home on holidays, a time when we attempt to bring in tourists and when farmers and others are at their busiest.  It is a wrong time to hold elections.  I understand and <Col N="41" /> appreciate the Minister's reference to polling stations, to the fact that in winter schools and halls are without light, but surely the most important consideration is to get the highest number of people to vote.  It is wrong that the elections should be postponed to a month when we can anticipate that many of the electorate will be on holidays.  As well, the fact that the Minister seeks again to postpone the elections for political expediency will lead the electorate to think that they are not of very great importance.</P>
    <P>In his statement in the other House &mdash;I could not hear him very well here &mdash;the Minister said that important changes in the law governing local elections are in course of preparation. I suggest that when the Minister comes to consider such important changes he should think of many things.  There have been many abuses.  I do not know if I am entitled to refer to them on a Bill which seeks to postpone the local elections, but there have been many abuses perpetrated by local authorities because of political necessity, because it was politically expedient to do so.</P>
    <P>The Minister today is postponing or seeking power to postpone those elections because it is expedient for him to do so.  When the Minister in many of his speeches criticises local authorities for the dilatory fashion in which they approach some of their duties, he should not leave himself in the situation in his approach to them particularly in regard to elections in which a voice should be raised to say that he is acting from political expediency.  It is obvious on this occasion that the only reason it is necessary to present this Bill is because of political expediency.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister, even at this late stage, if it is essential for his own purpose or for Party purposes, to postpone those elections to next year, he should seek a better month than the month of June.  I suggest the month of October or late September when the holidays are finished.  It is essential, as the Minister will find next year, to issue appeals to people to come out and vote.  The majority of people should be given the opportunity <Col N="42" /> to vote and I do not believe they will be given this opportunity in the month of June.  I do not consider the month of June suitable for farmers or people who have holidays to consider.  I urge the Minister to change the month at this late stage and to postpone the elections, if they must be postponed, to September or early October.</P>

      <P>I found it rather difficult to follow the line of argument pursued by the last speaker.  In one sentence he criticised the Minister for not holding the elections immediately and in another he suggested that they should be postponed until the month of October.</P>

      <P>From what I could hear the Senator seemed to suggest that there was some type of Party political manoeuvring in so far as the postponing of those elections was concerned. He employed, because of that, some words such as &ldquo;political expediency&rdquo; or something to that effect at any rate.  I want to make it quite clear that it was decided to postpone those elections for the reasons set out by the Minister in his statement.  It is very significant that when it was decided to postpone those elections no objections were raised.  There are many people who can be very wise after the event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this Bill, however, because in it the Minister says that some important changes governing local elections will be made and that he is considering drafting a Bill to that effect.  I admit, regarding local elections in general, that members of local authorities are very important people in their locality because they are living locally and they have a fair idea of what is needed in their areas.  It is true that since 1932 those elections have been more or less conducted on a political basis and our Party make no apologies whatever for taking that line.  Indeed, so far as elections are concerned, we have probably given <Col N="43" /> more opportunities to the people, both in Government elections and local elections, than any country in Europe to choose their representatives and to choose them wisely.  I do not believe there is any country in which elections have been held more frequently because whenever our Party felt there was a need in the public interest to hold elections&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I remember only on two occasions, in all those elections, on which they succeeded in getting their Party returned since 1932 and Fine Gael dominated Coalition Governments with disastrous effects to the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the second time that a Bill of this type was introduced.  I agree that in 1965 there was a valid reason for the introduction of a Bill of this kind and the postponement of the local elections. Due to the fact that we had two by-elections and a general election at that time, and on top of that we in the Seanad had the hardest election of all, the Seanad Election, we did not feel like pursuing elections all through 1965.  I am sure, in our hearts, to be <Col N="44" /> quite honest, we felt relieved we were not to have still another election in 1965.</P>
      <P>We looked forward to having the local elections in 1966.  As has been pointed out, I do not think there was any valid reason for not holding the local government elections in 1966. We all feel that the local elections should have been held on the day on which the Presidential election was held.  Excuses were offered as to why we could not have the local elections on the day of the Presidential election but, to my mind, not one valid reason was offered as to why those local elections were not held on that particular day.</P>
      <P>We were told we would confuse the electorate.  I think no compliment was paid to the intelligence of the electorate when the excuse was made that they would not be able to differentiate between the ballot paper on which the Presidential candidates would appear and that upon which would appear the names of county council representatives. I think it was in 1945 that the Presidential election and the local elections were held on the same day and I do not think there was any confusion on that account.  I do not think any reason emerged from those elections as to why we would never again have two elections on the one day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps I might add that the two big political Parties who had candidates in that election might have missed the bus by not having the local elections in 1966.  We shall have to think up a better reason than that of saying that we would confuse the electorate and that they would not be able to mark their ballot papers if the Presidential election and the local elections were held on the same day.  Now the local elections will be postponed until June, 1967, which means we are getting back to the old position we were in some years ago when local elections were held every three years. If nothing happens in 1967 and the local elections are held&mdash;and I am not at all sure we will have the local elections in 1967&mdash;we might have bigger fish to fry than the poor local authorities. If the local elections are held in 1967, three years after we will possibly <Col N="45" /> again have the local elections, or is it the intention of the Bill that if we have a local election in 1967 we will not have another local election until 1972?</P>
    <P>I regret that local authorities and local authority elections have been denigrated.  They have become a chopping block.  It is a simple matter to come to the Seanad and get through a Bill in a matter of hours to postpone local authority elections.  I attach great importance to local authorities but I want to assure the House that I do so not because they happened to put us into Seanad Éireann.  I have been a member of a local authority for 24 years.  I was first elected in 1942 and have been a member of a local authority since.</P>
    <P>I think local authorities do wonderful work.  The local public representatives get down to grass roots.  They live with the people and the people depend on them.  The activities of local authorities affect the life of everyone in a very intimate way.  The role of members of local authorities is most important because of the many things they can do to alleviate hardships or inconvenience that may be caused to any individual.  I feel sad that at the mere drop of a hat we postpone the local elections.  If it does not suit us, then we postpone them again to the year after, always assuming it will suit and that the time will be opportune.</P>
    <P>I regret that we had to discuss a Bill of this type again.  It is unfortunate that it has to be brought in and I hope the Minister in his reply will be able to give a much more cogent reason why he had to introduce this Bill and why the local elections were not held on the day in 1966 when we had the Presidential election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support what has been said by Senator J. Fitzgerald.  It is disappointing to us here to be asked once more to postpone these elections.  A strong case was made for that the last time and it seemed to me even then that there was not any need to postpone the elections.  It is disturbing <Col N="46" /> to find that the only reason now advanced by the Minister for putting them off again is that it would have been awkward to hold them this year during the Presidential election.  Yet, we postponed them to this year while knowing perfectly well that a Presidential election was in the offing.  How is it this was forgotten if it were such a major obstacle?  In a previous Presidential election a referendum was put to the people on the whole system of proportional representation and it was not felt that the two could not be held at the same time.  If it were considered inconvenient to hold the local elections at the same time as the Presidential election, there is no reason why they could not have been arranged for this month.  This would have been a good month to hold them.</P>
      <P>It is obvious to anybody in the country that the very fact that the local elections give an opportunity for testing political opinion is the reason the Government now want at all costs to put them off.  They do not want the feeling of the voter to be tested because there are a number of areas in which the Government know perfectly well that the voter, be the election local or general, is dissatisfied with Government attitudes.  It is not my belief that a major difference exists between the two large Parties in the Oireachtas.  Nevertheless, it seems to me to be obvious that the fear which prompts this Bill today is the fear that the voter might in desperation feel that Fine Gael might not be any worse than Fianna Fáil, which just about sums up the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consequently, I feel that the word &ldquo;expediency&rdquo;, as it was used by Senator McHugh, was justified and that is the reason why we are being asked once more to postpone the local elections which the Government feel are particularly awkward just now.  In other words, they do not want the people to be given an opportunity of expressing their views.  I feel that the Fianna Fáil Party are doing themselves harm by this reluctance, a reluctance to listen to the will of the people.  That is what this Bill amounts <Col N="47" /> to&mdash;a refusal this year and for nearly another year to listen to the will of the people in relation to the policies, both local and general, of the Government.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that this kind of attitude will boomerang on the Party putting the Bill before us.  I intend to vote against the Bill although I think the provision that there should be local elections at regular intervals of five years can be well defended.  I do not think that the postponement for a full year of the local elections that last year we were promised would be held this year can be defended.</P>

      <P>We as a House of the Oireachtas should look at this not really as a political issue but as a democratic issue.  I am a very strong believer in democracy and I think it is an essential part of the maintenance of a democratic organisation here that there should be election of local authorities by adult suffrage at regular intervals.  The Dáil and Seanad have already agreed that local elections should be held every five years. Local elections were due in 1965 in accordance with the decision of Parliament but the Minister used his majority in both Houses to have the local elections postponed in 1965.  It may be that there were good reasons for postponing them to 1966 but it was a postponement to 1966 and not a postponement to 1967, which is now the issue, because we all know, and the Minister better than anybody, that the reason for the postponement is not because of any imaginary confusion that might arise if the electors were asked to vote in a Presidential <Col N="48" /> election and a local election at the one time but rather for Party political interests.  This Government knew that the judgment would be against them and they did not want the judgment of the people.  All of us in politics must face the issue and go before the electorate&mdash;we before our rather limited electorate&mdash;and take the consequences.  I think it is quite undemocratic and I am glad that Members of the House have risen in protest against this undemocratic action in deciding that for Party political purposes the decision which we already made, namely, that the electorate would get a chance in local authority elections in 1966, should be again withheld from them because the Minister thought it was unfavourable to Fianna Fáil at that particular time.</P>
      <P>Even if there was some confusion, even if there was some merit in the argument of confusion in the electorate, which I do not accept, there are many months between June and December. There was a very good September and a very good October for holding local elections.</P>

The Minister was very wise and if I were a Fianna Fáil man I would agree with him that the proper thing was to stampede and push this Bill through the Houses of Parliament but as a democrat I do not agree with it.  I think it is wrong and I think it does injury to the democratic structure of our society that we should flout the electorate in this way and continue to postpone the local elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not a member of a local authority.  I have great admiration for the people who do the very hard work involved in local representation.  But they are representative of the people, they are elected and we have already decided that they should be elected for a period of five years and then go back to the people for a renewal of their authority.  But the people have <Col N="49" /> had withheld from them in 1965 and again in 1966 the right to say who their local representatives should be, who the people should be to govern them locally and to do this very important work.</P>
    <P>I am opposed to this Bill.  I protest most strongly against this idea or this proposal that the local elections should be again postponed because it does not favour the Government now in power. I think it is undemocratic and I protest most strongly against it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Murphy has put very clearly the reason for the Bill before us this evening.  On two occasions the date came up when we should have these local elections.  On each occasion they were postponed.  In 1965 the Dáil election was only over and of course three months after the Dáil the Seanad election must take place so there was a fairly plausible excuse for the postponement that year.</P>
      <P>The Minister now brings in a Bill and beats his breast and says &ldquo;From now on the local elections will be held in the month of June.&rdquo;  He did not say whether they would be held on the 1st day or the last day of June or any particular date or any period in the month of June.  Let us face the fact that when the Minister specifies that June is the date of these local elections in future there may be an occasion when postponement would be fully justified and necessary.  Then we will have the peculiar situation that we will have before us a Bill contradicting the proposal now before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the restriction of elections to June set out in this Bill makes the situation even more ridiculous and shows more clearly the political expediency which prompted Fianna Fáil to postpone these elections last year and this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made a very brief statement relating to this Bill here in the Seanad.  I know that his statement in the Dáil was not so brief.  He afforded an opportunity there for various points to be taken up in the debate <Col N="50" /> which his statement here does not present to the Senators.</P>
    <P>At the end of October the Minister is bringing in a Bill which would enable him to postpone the elections which should have taken place last June.  This is a most peculiar situation. Four months after the month in which the elections should have taken place we have a Bill before us to legalise the situation.  That is what it is, legalising the situation that has existed since last June and the activities of the various county councils all over the country and the various decisions which the councils took in the meantime.</P>
    <P>If Fianna Fáil were honest with the people they would have indicated early this year that it was proposed to postpone these elections.  At the last moment they used their voting strength in the Dáil to prevent people from having an opportunity to elect their county councillors.  They did not have the opportunity last year either.  It is obvious that there would be very great changes in this country if we did have the local elections last June at the same time as the Presidential election. Nobody saw that as clearly as Fianna Fáil.  They knew very well that if they had both elections on the same day that a great change for the better would have resulted from both of those elections.</P>

Remember, when Fianna Fáil wanted to take the power of democratic voting from the people of this country they made sure to have the referendum on the same day as the Presidential election because, on that occasion, they believed they would win the election. They did win but, in the process of winning it, they tried by referendum to take away from the people the democratic system of voting which we have at present and which our people decided to hold on to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  We come back now to the Local Elections Bill.  I was misled, of course, by the opposite side when I was speaking on this before. Perhaps the Minister could clarify the point regarding whether persons aggrieved as a result of decisions by the county councils since last June can challenge the legality of those decisions now, since apparently the legislation legalising the postponement of the 1966 local elections which were to take place in June is only coming before both Houses of the Oireachtas four <Col N="52" /> months later.  There are people who submitted plans for building dwelling-houses, erecting business premises, and other plans which were turned down as a result of the decision since June, and, naturally, those people who were turned down had to change their plans and were at a loss in the enterprises in which they were interested at the time and with which they could not proceed.  The question is whether decisions taken in the meantime must be reversed or whether it is necessary to bring in legislation now to legalise the decisions taken between now and last June, since the county councils apparently were not covered by any local elections law and were not legal after the end of June because this Bill now before us had not been passed before the end of June, 1966.</P>
      <P>The Minister has written into the Bill the pious hope of having elections every five years, having postponed the elections twice for Party political reasons and Party political benefits. When we look back on the very trivial reasons which prompted the postponement of those two elections, perhaps the Party political purposes are not trivial as far as Fianna Fáil are concerned, but there may be circumstances in future when a quinquennial election will not be desirable or practicable.  It may be necessary to have a postponement, which would leave this Bill which we are debating here just a waste of time, because there is no elasticity in it which would permit of a discretion. The wording of this Bill is quite definite.  It is hard to understand why it is definite on this occasion when during the past two years the desirability of having these local elections was ignored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that he proposes to have further legislation brought in relating to local elections at a later stage and that there would not be any time to have those proposals presented to and passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas before next June.  I should like to hear good reasons from the Minister as to why it would not be possible, when we are considering the Local Elections Bill, to have the kind of legislation which the Minister envisages debated at the <Col N="53" /> one time, because this Bill is really brought in by the Government just to mend their hand.  While doing so, they mention that they propose to bring in another Local Elections Bill which will not be effective by next June.  If it is not effective by next June the proposals the Minister has in mind, and which may be desirable to be brought in in this new age, cannot be effective until 1972 which would be the next local government election year.  I should like to know from the Minister whether it would not be possible for him to bring these proposals for modernising the legislation before both Houses of the Oireachtas in time to be effective for the elections next June instead of talking about something that will not be effective until 1972.</P>
    <P>Even as the position stands at the moment, and taking into consideration the result of the election which took place last June, Fianna Fáil are over-represented on all the county councils and corporations and they have been since 1960.  The result is that the policies of the Government, even though they are running against the wishes of the people, are implemented by the numerical strength of the Fianna Fáil Party on the various county councils, which are now completely out of date in relation to the results of the last election.  That could be a very useful power to have.  You could have a situation in which people were clamouring and crying out for houses, and you could have a housing slowdown or stoppage implemented by the county councils through the influence of the Fianna Fáil councillors, taking directions from the Government and from the Department.  They could use the county councils to oppose the wishes of the people in relation to the services which they ought to get these days.</P>
    <P>We need to modernise our health services.  Again, if that issue comes up for debate at a county council meeting the Fianna Fáil Party are over-represented and the result is that the people will not get the services they should have.  One example is the postponement of the swimming <Col N="54" /> pools.  Many county councils decided that swimming pools should be provided and they have been told by the Department since that they are not going to get them for some time to come.  There are also the regional water schemes which are held up for want of finance, and the people in those districts are being kept quiet by the influence of the Fianna Fáil over-representation on the county councils.</P>
    <P>The Minister admitted that if the local elections were held on the same day as the Presidential election the nation would have been saved at least £70,000.  The housing situation is bad and many people are waiting for houses.  If we take the hard figures of the amount of money which will be spent next June, and a lot more with it, on running the local elections, it will cost far more than £70,000, in spite of what the Minister says. Even his own figure of £70,000 would provide small grants for up to 100 houses.  That is a very big consideration these days.  Of course, there are people who think that is not very important or very big, but the people living in unfit dwellings who could improve their houses with the aid of grants certainly feel that a waste of £70,000 in view of our difficult financial situation, is substantial.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Fitzgerald was a member of the county council for 25 years.  I was a member for 14 years so I know what I am talking about when I talk about the work of the county councils, and the work of the various committees.  The public <Col N="55" /> should be aware of the terrific amount of work done by county councils.  The newspaper reporters are allowed in to the public meetings only, and they have not the opportunity of being present at meetings of the working committees. I was on 13 committees of the Dublin County Council in addition to doing council work.  There are other councillors I am sure who have worked on more committees of their own councils than that.</P>
      <P>The public in general do not realise the vast amount of effective administrative work that is done by the county councillors they elect.  They are doing constructive work on all kinds of committees associated with the county councils.  I mention this to draw attention to the importance of county councils and corporations.  They are the organs through which the Government administer their various schemes.  It would be impossible for the Government to administer schemes of public utility and public assistance, grants, scholarships, and other schemes which come right down to the people through the county councils.</P>
      <P>The public do not realise that the county councils are really the Government in their own localities, because it is through the county councils that the Government function in relation to the various schemes in which they are involved. Apart from the Government schemes administered by committees of the county councils, there are, of course, contributions from the rate-payers. Those contributions are also used in connection with the various schemes through the committees on which the councillors sit.  I mention these matters to show how important it is to have the people properly represented on the county councils, and to have the county councils made up of representatives who can express the up-to-date wishes of the people.</P>
      <P>It might be said that seven years is not a long period for a councillor to sit on a county council but it is a long period for the people to be given no oportunity of expressing their views, first of all, regarding policies and, secondly, in relation to their own local representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="56" /> People want to change their representatives. Perhaps Parties may want to change from one candidate to another and they get the opportunity of doing that at local elections which are what might be described as minor general elections.  Very often we had to deplore the fact that Fianna Fáil turned county council elections into political battles.  In years past I took the view that persons independent of Party politics should stand and be elected to local councils but I do not subscribe to that view now.  I think now that representatives from various political Parties, major organisations, standing as candidates is the best way of ensuring that policies will be implemented or opposed at local level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>We can get very effective administration from organised groups who are represented on county councils.  It was a mistake for the Minister, when deciding on the month of June, not to have specified a period within that month during which the elections should take place.  He may argue that in previous legislation the date was not specified.  The usual arrangement was that the local elections should take place throughout the country on one date or another.  There were never more than two dates.  The chairmen of councils and the mayors of towns had to be elected before a certain date in June.  That problem is not specified here.  Only the month is set out.  I submit that the Minister should have been more specific about the date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also submit that the legislation the Minister brought in at this time should contain recognition of the <i>de facto</i> situation.  Instead of the Bill now before us we should have fresh legislation because, if we are to make changes which the Minister and others consider desirable in the light of modern needs, we should have that legislation as soon as possible instead of this stop-gap measure which relates only to June, 1967.  In the years to come apparently we shall have another Bill which will be effective in June, 1972.  The Minister could have brought in this Bill in the <Col N="57" /> spring of this year and have had it debated and passed instead of introducing it at this stage.  I mention that because I feel it is a waste of time debating a Bill of this kind just to fix up a situation that has arisen in relation to elections that did not take place last June.  We should have, instead, the kind of Bill demanded by modern conditions.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister in reply to say if it would be possible for him, even when this Bill has gone through as I suppose it will, to legislate in the future so that the quinquennial period starting in June next will be amended by way of improvements which the Department have in mind in the matter of legislation governing local elections, having regard to the increased number of services administered by the various councils through the Department of Local Government.  It should not be left until 1972 to improve a situation which the Minister now considers should be remedied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is a short one.  As a matter of fact, it is a way of fixing the date for the next local elections which may be changed at any time.  The Minister could come in next week with a similar measure and have the elections held next month but that is not likely in view of what is happening at present.  The Fianna Fáil Party hold more than 400 seats in county councils and that is one of the reasons why the Minister is not anxious to face the electorate.  The position might be changed and that position is very important in the matter of making decisions in county councils.  It has its importance for the Seanad as well because we are more or less sent in here as a result of votes by various county councils.  In my panel alone there are three quotas and the Fianna Fáil Party do not want that situation changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is for these reasons that the Minister has avoided allowing the electorate to make any decision to change the representations on county councils. During the past 18 months there has been great criticism of the Department of Local Government because of the housing shortage.  In <Col N="58" /> spite of that, the Minister stated in Dáil Éireann that a number of councils are to blame for delays in house-building. In that situation, he should give the public who require houses an opportunity of casting their votes and electing people who will do the business of the councils in the way the Minister says he wants it done. We might solve our housing problem if the Minister gave the people that opportunity.</P>
    <P>The Bill fixes the date for June.  I do not know why the Minister picked June.  I have no objection to that month: the days are warm and long for people to go out and canvass. However, it is not always easy to pick candidates to give their services free as councillors and it is quite a job sometimes to get what we consider suitable people to go forward.  That applies to every Party in the House. I see a way out through the picking of June.  Generally speaking, there are two Church holidays in June and I suggest to the Minister that we select these two days on which to hold elections.</P>
    <P>A few years ago people would not say that because there were certain regulations laid down about servile work <i>et cetera,</i> but that no longer exists.  There is an obligation to attend religious service if you belong to a certain denomination but there is no obligation to abstain from servile work. If there were polling booths in each church area you would find that there would be no difficulty at all about getting people to vote and we would cut out the opportunity of the strong Parties having such great representation.  You would have a fairer opinion of the particular candidate which the people would like to select.  This is an idea which could be made use of.  We should have voting on a Church holiday.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that, so far, the Minister has not made a move to give the people an opportunity to vote before 1967.  In Dublin, for example, you have newly built-up areas.  The people living in those areas have <Col N="59" /> probably no local representative. They feel this very much because of the grievances which they have regarding rents, rates and various other matters.  If you ask people in a new housing scheme in Dublin who their local representative is they cannot tell you.</P>
    <P>There are very many people who are anxious to retire as local representatives. Like everyone else, I had to go around the country last year to canvass votes.  I met many people in different parts of the country who wanted to retire.  They cannot do so because there are counties in which if a person resigns for any reason in nine cases out of ten the Fianna Fáil Party take the seat.  We had a representative in the city of Galway and he got a guarantee they would elect a Labour representative in his place.  When they got him out they put in a Fianna Fáil man.</P>
    <P>We have several other counties where the same thing happens.  There should be something in a Bill, if we believe in proportional representation, which would give the various Parties representation on the various committees. If we take the General Council of County Councils and take the Minister's own county, we will find that they have three representatives, Galway have three and County Meath have three and you find that the Fianna Fáil Party have the General Council packed with a majority.</P>
    <P>We have a mental hospital in my county and not a single Labour man from County Meath would be put on the Mental Hospital Committee, whereas nine-tenths of the people in that hospital belong to the working-class. If they did not belong to the working class they would be in homes where they could pay.  It is a disgrace that Labour representatives do not get representation on the various committees. Something should be put in this Bill which would give them a right to have representation on the various committees.</P>
    <P>The Presidential election was mentioned as one of the reasons why the <Col N="60" /> local elections were not held this year. That was an insult to the Department of Education.  It was said that if both elections were held on the same day there would be too many spoiled votes. It is a disgrace after 40 years of native Government to tell somebody over 21 years of age that he could not mark a ballot paper in regard to local elections from one to six or mark a Presidential election ballot paper with X or 1.</P>
    <P>The number of spoiled votes in the Presidential election was colossal. Those spoiled votes were done deliberately. It was an insult to the intelligence of the people after 40 years of self-government to say that they could not mark two ballot papers correctly on the one day.  We marked three ballot papers in one day on a previous occasion.  One of those ballot papers was an intricate one.  It referred to a change in the Constitution in regard to PR.  Despite this, people were able to vote correctly.  In regard to local elections the people know those who are going up by their Christian names so they can easily mark the ballot paper correctly.  With regard to the Presidential election this year there were only two candidates and the people could easily mark opposite T. F. O'Higgins or the President of Ireland whom they wished to vote for. Those names are known to everybody and everybody knew whom they wanted to vote for.  People spoiled their votes deliberately but not because they did not know how to mark the ballot papers correctly.</P>
    <P>It has become more or less a monotonous operation for the Minister to defer the holding of elections.  I should like him to state definitely that he would hold the elections next year no matter what the situation is, even if the price of cattle goes down still further and the farmers sit longer outside the Department of Agriculture.  I should like the Minister to make a statement today on the day that he will hold the local elections.</P>
    <P>The youth of this country are entitled to get an opportunity to go forward for the local elections because nine-tenths of the people who are in Dáil <Col N="61" /> Éireann served their apprenticeship on the local councils.  It would not surprise me in the least when it comes to next June if the Minister found some excuse for not holding the elections then.  The fact of the matter is that last week I got a signal that he may do so because he says he wishes to introduce some amendments so that certain people who are debarred from voting, or debarred from going forward as public representatives, will have an opportunity to go forward.  The Minister also stated that there was no hope of having that legislation before the New Year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, wish to register a protest at the unreasonable and extraordinary delay which the Government have caused in holding local elections.  I feel that they have been most unfair in their treatment of the unselfish body of councillors, both urban councillors and town councillors, throughout the country.  It is difficult to understand why anyone should deliberately set out, two years running, to postpone local elections. There are people up to thirty years of age in the country today who, so far, have not had an opportunity of voting for the councillors whose deliberations, by and large, affect each and every one of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago I was interested in a speech by a Fianna Fáil Senator who forecast the disappearance of the local councils as we know them at present. I certainly would like to make it known to the Minister that I would be totally against regional councils.  The work of the councils at present is successful because it is on a completely local and knowledgeable basis.  I certainly can well imagine the way many of the poorer sections of our community would be treated if they did not personally know one or other of the members of our local councils.  For that reason, it is most undesirable that the present system should be changed. On the contrary, I should like to see more power given back to the members of our local authorities.  At present they are being used as an excuse for the Government in the various ways they have devised to increase the burden of local taxation, so much is done <Col N="62" /> now in the name of local councils and the councillors are completely powerless. In many places their name is invoked but what is done is a managerial function.  The amount of work done voluntarily by these very highly public-spirited ladies and gentlemen certainly gets scant recognition and, more often than not, their considered views are certainly not heeded.  The amount of money spent annually by the local authorities, and I should imagine in the majority of cases wisely spent, should surely mean that the men who are carrying the responsibility should have the responsibility of spending these moneys and not the County Managers Association as at present appears to be the system.</P>
    <P>I was surprised that one of the Minister's excuses for not holding the local elections in the autumn or winter was that there was difficulty in providing adequately heated polling booths.  The vast majority of polling booths throughout rural Ireland are the national schools and surely it is not unreasonable to expect heating, and our children are being taught in heated national schools at present.</P>
    <P>If it is true that the majority of national schools are inadequately heated, surely this is a serious matter and is one which should be immediately looked into.  Every time during the past elections were held in the winter months&mdash;elections that were not forced on the Government.  The last general election was held early in the spring and I think the time was entirely the choice of the Taoiseach and there was nothing wrong with this then, and I still think the local elections should be held as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I also feel that the sooner certain disqualifications are removed and the way cleared to allow in the few remaining sections of the community who are debarred from being members of local authorities the better.  I should like to see a better cross-section of our public as members of local bodies. Perhaps some method could be devised of encouraging at least some representation from the professional people on every council.  I think this is most important.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="63" /> I feel also that when the Minister is considering the legislation he has hinted at today he might include in that some form of training course for new people who will be elected for the first time on local authorities after the next election whenever it is held. I think it is very necessary, and most important, that all the new members on councils, when first elected should be given an opportunity of grasping some of the theories attached to local administration so that they may be better equipped to follow our system of democracy.</P>
    <P>There is not much more I wish to say on this Bill.  Certainly the Minister gave some excuses for not holding these elections when they should have been held last June in conjunction with the Presidential election.  The public are well aware of the fact that the Party reasons for not doing this will cost them a considerable sum next June, or whenever they are held.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Seanad has a particular history in regard to local government election law in this country. I do not want to go into that but in the 1920's and early 1930's the Seanad had certain views about local government electoral law and it expressed this in a very trenchant fashion in rejecting a number of Bills.  It is right and proper here this evening that there should be again a widespread consensus of opinion on this particular Bill introduced by the Minister for Local Government.</P>
      <P>This Bill to my mind is a corrupt Bill.  It has a nasty odour.  It is redolent of Machiavellianism and the Minister asks us to join him in supporting it. We will do nothing of the kind because it is publication in legislative form of the broken promises of the Minister and the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the 1965 Local Government Electoral Bill was enacted the local elections were promised to be held in 1966 and the Minister with that Machiavellian mind which he displays more than any other person in the Cabinet, prevaricating when the elections were to be held, would not answer questions, would not make up his mind.  When the <Col N="64" /> Dáil went into summer recess, within a week he was able to go down to Roscommon and say that the local elections would not be held in June this year.  Later we had on television the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries who said he could not discuss these matters.  He would have to tell the Dáil.  He had first to announce them to the Dáil.  Then the other night the coy Minister for Health, Deputy O'Malley, said it would not be right to give these details which must be given only in the Dáil when Budget proposals are being framed, having announced his great plan for free education up to the intermediate certificate at an Institute of Journalists dinner out in Dún Laoghaire.  This is the kind of cant and nonsense we are forced to put up with.  I am trying to illustrate&mdash;and I am glad you did not call me to order too quickly, Sir&mdash;the Machiavellian approach of the Minister to the local elections.</P>
    <P>The Minister now comes in and gives us a one and a half page speech in which he says that one of the reasons for postponing these elections is that &ldquo;a Bill is being drafted to repeal certain disqualifications for membership of local authorities&rdquo; and&mdash;just listen to this from the Minister&mdash;&ldquo;to set up new legal machinery for questioning local elections by petition&rdquo;.  I am sure that is one of the high priorities in the Department of Local Government&mdash;to set up legal machinery for questioning elections.  It shows a respect for law that I would never have dreamt, if I were dreaming for a thousand years, the Minister for Local Government had.  The Minister by this particular Bill shows that he has no respect for his pledged word enshrined in a statute of the Oireachtas.  That is what this represents, putting into legislative form the fact that the Minister and the Fianna Fáil Government have broken their promise to the people to hold elections in 1966.  Of course, it is not necessary to repeat to this House or to the world outside that we all know it was the credit squeeze, the bad housing conditions, no money for work on roads, no capital for any of the capital schemes run by local authorities, no money for vocational schools&mdash;these <Col N="65" /> were the things that were working in the Minister's mind and in the minds of the Government in postponing the local elections.  It was for the same reason they put up the outgoing President as a candidate in the Presidential election.  They knew the Fianna Fáil Government could not face the people.  We were told that not to put forward the outgoing President would mean retreating from what we had stood for and then, a few months later, the Taoiseach said that our Sean Bhean Bhocht politics are all cod.  This is what is involved here.  Let there be no doubt about this.  It is disgraceful and, of course, we must vote against it in this House.</P>
    <P>I shall not say a whole lot about this Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but what I do want to say is that we must try to make something of it because here again the Minister is leaving himself room for manoeuvre as to when elections can be held as he thinks at some future time that he will be Minister for Local Government.  He says: &ldquo;Now we will nail our hand to the desk and say the month of June.&rdquo;  Will the Minister tell me what will happen if some time in the month of May or the month of June, a Taoiseach declares a general election?  Will we have then, willy-nilly, local elections in the month of June.  It is obvious that that cannot be done and, therefore, the Minister knows well, in stating the month of June, that if it does not suit, after being defeated in a general election in the month of May&mdash;&mdash;</P>

One has only to look at the time they spend opening factories down in Cork and <Col N="66" /> washing garages and that sort of thing. This is all for the Party not the business of Government.</P>
      <P>The Minister in fixing the month of June knows very well that that cannot work in certain circumstances.  He knows that if there happened to be a general election in June in the same year as the quinquennial elections, you cannot have the two at the same time.</P>

The first one is that you must take into consideration the fact that the public may get tired of going out to vote twice in the one year.  It is difficult enough to get voters out for general elections.  I think it would be a bad thing to have a very low poll in local authority elections.  It would be bad for democracy if people were to refuse to exercise their vote, even for a fairly justifiable cause.  That way lies dictatorship and anarchy by minority. The people were entitled to that consideration. There was also the further consideration that politicians are human beings of flesh and blood and that they had put in an intensive campaign for, perhaps, four weeks and some others of them for another four to six weeks after that, for the Oireachtas elections.  A stage is reached where people just cannot, in the interests of their health and their families and of their political Parties, go on. I feel there was an excuse last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to anticipate what the Minister's reply will be.  He said it in the Dáil.  He said that Cumann na nGaedheal, of whom the Fine Gael Party are successors, postponed the elections four times between 1922 and 1932.  I want to ask the Minister whether the country is in the same state of seige as it was between 1922 and 1931.  I do not think, even in present circumstances, that anyone will say <Col N="67" /> that is the position.  There was a general election in 1922, another one in 1923, another in 1927.  That was four in a period of ten years if you want to take it from 1922 to 1932.  If my recollection is correct, there were also elections for the Seanad in that particular period.  I hope that the Minister will not get up and say that the present time remotely resembles the period from 1922 to 1932 when half the country would not recognise the Parliament or would not come into the Parliament. I only know this, that the Mafia of those days is now confined to the Minister's constituency in Donegal and when we have not got a nationwide Mafia, I think it reasonable to say that we are living in normal times and that there is no justification, except political expediency, which I do not admire in the Minister.  I see in this, as I see in a lot of other things the Minister and the Government are doing, serious threats to our democracy, and to the principles and rights of the people.</P>
    <P>The people of this country since 1965 have had a right to change their elected representatives on local authorities and to express their views upon local matters.  That has been denied to them and to say that it is to be denied to them again in 1966 and postponed until 1967 is, to my mind, a denial by the Minister of the ordinary rights of the public.  Of course, we will oppose this Bill.</P>

      <P>I have seldom listened to so much hypocrisy, exaggeration, half truths and nonsense as I have listened to from the members of the Opposition of this House this evening.  The first comment one would make on all this loud-sounding talk is that, of course, as political entities and members of political Parties, they are trying to make the best possible narrow political Party use they can out of this Bill while they may.  The last speaker really took the biscuit, having probably listened to the other speakers to get his inspiration to try to gild what they had probably blundered through.  Yet, of all the speakers.  I consider this particular Member to be the least qualified <Col N="68" /> to speak on matters relating to local authorities because, if my recollection serves me rightly, in the 1960 local government elections&mdash;in this I may be mistaken or I may not be altogether correct, in which case I am sure I will be corrected&mdash;he tried his hand at being elected, with an electorate of about 16,000 in the particular electoral area, and succeeded in getting 182 votes.</P>

      <P>What I should like to deal with is the hypocrisy not only of the last speaker but other speakers as well when they tried to make it appear that the reason for postponing these elections at this stage is other than the reason with which his Party and the Labour Party agreed when the Bill of 1965 was being discussed in this House and in the Dáil.  The reasons then were no different from now, so why the inconsistency from July of 1965 to October of 1966?</P>

In fact, the Seanad should be fully alive to this but they do not seem to be.  They seem to be very ignorant of what was in the last Bill or what is in the present Bill, and, indeed, what the law was up to July of 1965 because, in July of 1965, not only was there agreement in general by the two Opposition Parties that there should be a postponement from 1965 to 1966 but, indeed, that it should be extended right up to the 31st day of December, 1966, if it were thought fit by the Minister for Local Government.  We did not postpone in July 1965 just for a year; we did not postpone as we are proposing to do now.</P>

      <P>If there was no difficulty about drafting, the Senator would not have existed before he got into this House.  But that still does not and will not in any way lead me away from dealing with this hypocrisy.  It is nothing short of hypocrisy and political humbugging for Members to talk <Col N="70" /> in an airy-fairy sort of way about denying to the people the right to change their local representatives.  If they wanted to check the facts, they would know that, short of dying and resigning, there is not a ten per cent change in their local authorities even when these elections are held and that there are members sitting across there who have quoted themselves as being in their local authorities for 24 and 30 years.  Indeed, I know many of them who are 30 and 40 years in the service and their greatest problem today, or at any election, would be to find somebody to go in and do their work to allow them to retire.  This is a fact the Members who are talking well know; they know it as well as I do.</P>

They can have them every year, every ten years, every 20 years or, if they decide by a majority of these Houses, they can wipe out local authorities, if they decide that is the right thing to do.  So, stop talking about this right as if it were a God-given right that somebody was taking away.  These are laws as enacted by the Oireachtas which provide for the administration of local affairs and the Houses of the Oireachtas may as they think fit, by their majority, change the method, change the time of elections, make any other changes they wish, and there is nothing constitutional at stake.</P>

      <P>If the Senator would contain himself sufficiently long, he may know a little more about this particular matter when I have finished speaking than he displayed when he talked himself.  The hypocrisy, again, <Col N="71" /> is shown by the fact that last July when the situation was, politically speaking, such that had there been local elections held at the time the law then dictated they should be held, the Opposition Parties and, particularly Fine Gael, would have been practically annihilated.  Is this not the reason those Parties, in fact, in July of 1965 were so agreeable that they should be put back?  Is that not the true reason and they displayed themselves the very true reason today by saying that the atmosphere has changed politically and that it is politically expedient for Fianna Fáil to have them this year.</P>

Now you may ask: &ldquo;Why, if Fianna Fáil held them on the same day at that time, despite the Fine Gael outcry against such a practice, did we not hold them in 1966?&rdquo; The answer is that we learned something from that election, which answers another question raised here tonight.  This is clearly demonstrated by the result of that double election on the same day, when the number of spoiled votes was five times higher than it is in the case where one ballot paper only is being used by the electorate in the same polling station.</P>

      <P>Senator Murphy, in fact, sounds more Fine Gael than Fine Gael themselves.  I know that he claims he is not, but the fact is that any objective observer listening here tonight would not be able to say, with one exception, of all the speakers who spoke from that side of the House that there was any difference whatsoever in <Col N="73" /> their Party allegiance, and that includes Senator Murphy.  The hypocrisy is being continued, and the exaggeration of the loss to the community is being trotted out and added to by Senators who, as they have admitted, have had an opportunity of knowing what I am likely to say in reply because of the fact that I have answered these things already and they can read what I said. Despite the fact that they were forewarned and forearmed on this, I still have not got from that element in this Seanad tonight any telling reason, any good reason, any sound reason or, indeed, any reasonable reason to make any person change his mind in regard to whether or not this Bill should become an Act.</P>
      <P>I do not see at all, as has been suggested here, that there is anything wrong with the part of the Bill which deals in retrospect with certain things in regard to our local authorities.  In fact, I would say to those who have been making the case that certain action might follow because of this retrospection that they do not quite know what they are talking about and have not read the Bill before coming into the House.  The fact is that they are local authorities not by anything I am proposing to have done in this Bill but by the Act of 1965 which gives them the authority of the law under which they are the legitimate local authorities in every respect up to the 31st December, 1966, and the only thing referred to here in regard to retrospection applies to the purely administrative operations of holding the annual meetings to elect mayors, lord mayors, chairmen and so forth, and this is what is meant by the retrospective clauses in the Bill.  Anybody taking it in any other way, as some people over there have done, certainly does not know what the law is at the moment under which they are doing what they are doing.</P>

      <P>If Senator O'Quigley would wish to have a general debate on this I also would have been delighted that it should have been a general debate, because a few more home truths could be told to the Senators, but this is not a general debate though it has been made so by those who wish to use it as a political platform in the widest sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Getting around to some of the other matters mentioned here which might have more bearing on the actual Bill before us, we have the suggestion about June being the wrong month.  I cannot understand what is wrong about the month of June, and what I would say to the House is that no matter which month was chosen, by whomsoever it may be chosen, that month would be wrong in the estimation of quite a number of people.  There is no possible way in which we can select a month for any election, local or otherwise, that would meet with general approval, not to mention unanimous approval from the public or from Members of this or the other House.  In so far as the next local elections are concerned, then, they are proposed to be held within the month of June, with freedom to the Minister for Local Government to choose a day within that month; and on that point there have been complaints about giving him somewhat more power than he should be allowed to exercise.  At the same time, the same speaker just before that trotted out a contradictory statement wherein he did not feel that we should be confined to the month of June because in many cases it might happen that it would be a bad month for holding elections. Then he comes along and says that the Minister should be confined still further <Col N="75" /> because the provision giving him a choice of fixing the election within a space of 30 days would enable him to manipulate something to his own political advantage.  That is what underlines the Fine Gael attitude about everything.  When they condemn any person, Fianna Fáil or otherwise, in any other Party for doing anything they are merely judging those people as they themselves should be judged, because that is the type of mind they have.</P>
    <P>In regard to this matter of Church holidays and Sundays, this matter of Sunday has been tried out before, and I can assure the House that Sundays are not acceptable to the Church authorities of this country, and likewise that Church holidays have no more attraction to them than have the Sundays.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">

      <P>I have listened to the Senator and I may say that I assume that he has more information of changes than the Church authorities and, in fact, than the present Pope has done during all his deliberations in the last twelve months.  If it is true we will look to him for confirmation, but unless I am assured that it is true I do not intend to accept these changes that are talked about as being things we should have to accept and have written into this Bill.  I still say that Sundays and Church holidays are regarded, by and large, as days on which we might not have those elections.  In so far as Church holidays are concerned I do not suggest that those authorities should change their minds, and indeed I might suggest good reasons why they should, but, in fact, they are days we cannot get people to vote&mdash;Church holidays.  Does not the Senator know, as I know, that the Sundays and Church holidays and any other holidays you like to mention have now in these rather affluent times become days on which there is nobody in his own home district or at least within the area of the local polling station or indeed interested in them?  They are disporting <Col N="76" /> themselves in the various ways that they have now available to them and that they can afford under the Fianna Fáil Party Government that they have been enjoying the fruits of for so many years.

      <P>Senators have been talking about a three-year period or a five-year period between local elections, and saying that extending it to seven years is a denial of the rights of the people, a denial of certain things so far as the local authorities are concerned, a denial of something for everyone except Fianna Fáil. Apparently they think Fianna Fáil gain by this in some peculiar way.  I must get some of these people who see everyone losing by this postponement except Fianna Fáil to tell me about the gain so that we will not miss it.  Let us look at this myth of the three-year period which it is alleged there was between local elections in the past.  Over the past 40 years roughly, since the foundation of the State, we had eight local elections which according to my method of calculation works out not at three years as is talked about as being the gap between elections but at an average of five years.  According to our law at present it should be five years. For reasons of charity towards the Opposition and particularly towards Fine Gael after the victory in the 1965 election there was agreement that we should postpone the local elections.</P>

      <P>It was agreed that they should be postponed for 18 months and those 18 months are not up until 31st December this year.  This year for similar reasons to the reasons which were agreed on last year we are proposing a further six months postponement. We are now saying that these elections will be held not some time in 1967 as dictated and selected by the Minister for Local Government but within the month of June.</P>

      <P>The situation now is that we have not a collapse of the local authorities and we are not likely to have.  There is not any question of abolishing the local authorities as has been suggested.  The local authorities are still functioning and in their own estimation and mine they are continuing to play a very important role in the operation of our local services. It is my hope that they will continue not only after the next election but also after many other elections, to play an even greater role in the provision of services through the local authorities assisted by the Government through the Department of Local Government for the people of the country.  If there should be, as I am sure there will be, a sprinkling of new faces amongst our councillors after this ungodly long period of seven years about which there is so much complaint but which is only half a year longer at most than that which has already been agreed upon&mdash;&mdash;</P>

They cannot square that with the public outside and they cannot square it with their consciences, the possession of which I rather doubt.  Let us be quite clear about this.  The proposal before us is to put the elections back until next June.  The reasons for doing this are no different from the reasons last July 12 months.  I suggest to those two Parties who agreed in July, 1965, to postpone the local elections for 18 months&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If the Senator wishes, it might be 17 months and 28 days instead of 18 months.  If he wants that I am with him because I am not one for splitting hairs.  That is what the Bill stated.  Deputy Clinton said, and I quote:</P>
      <P>We on this side of the House are in general agreement with the proposals in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Therefore, what I am trying to do is to save the Opposition here from the folly committed by their colleagues in the other House.  I am trying to save them from the inconsistency displayed in the other House against an extension of a further six months.  The extension is for the same reasons as existed when they agreed to a postponement for 18 months.  Surely it is reasonable that if people agreed to a postponement for 18 months for a certain reason, they will agree again, when the same reason exists, to a postponement for 6 months. We had this inconsistency in the Dáil which I had hoped would not be displayed in the Upper House.  I had hoped that the Members of the Upper House would realise that the public outside probably expect a little more from the Members of this House than from the Members of the Lower House, particularly as the Members of this House are more remote from the public and, therefore, the public are not so familiar with them and as a result probably think more of them.  I had hoped that the Members of this House would show by their agreement that this is the Upper House and that they are more consistent.</P>
