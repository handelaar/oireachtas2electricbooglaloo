      <P>I have notice from Senator Neville that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs to convey to the interparliamentary conference on East Timor taking place in Portugal Ireland's strong stance against the atrocities continuing to be perpetrated against the people of East Timor and Ireland's support for the self-determination of the Timorese people.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator O'Kennedy of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to establish statutory funding for driving assessment training and advice for people with physical disabilities.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator McGennis of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health to increase the grant aid which is made available to the Irish Wheelchair Association for the provision of <Col N="1378" /> a school for disabled drivers, bearing in mind that the service may have to be discontinued at the end of June due to lack of funds.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Wall of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health to address the concern of the Irish Wheelchair Association for the future of its driving school and give the support and backup services which are needed for its continued operation.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Neville's and Senator O'Kennedy's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. As Senator McGennis' and Senator Wall's matters are on the same topic as Senator O'Kennedy's, I understand they will come to some arrangement as regards sharing time.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business today is items 1 and 16, and motion No. 18.  In addition to the items on the Order Paper, a Motion for Earlier Signature will be circulated in the next ten or 15 minutes and I propose to take it at the end of today's business if that is agreeable to Members.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the practice efficiently and satisfactorily laid down by my predecessor for handling this particular Bill, it is proposed to arrange the discussion on item 1 in the following way: Part 1, sections 1 to 76, will be taken from 10.30 a.m. to 1 p.m.  There will be a sos from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.  Parts 2, 3 and 4, sections 77 to 150, will be taken from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m.; and Parts 5, 6 and 7, sections 151 to 179, will be taken from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m.  If these conclude earlier than arranged, they will continue consecutively from then on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had anticipated that next week we would deal with the Consumer Credit Bill, 1994, but the business for next week will be items 6 and 7 on the Order <Col N="1379" /> Paper &mdash; Second Stage of the Package Holidays and Travel Trade Bill, 1995, and the Minerals Development Bill, 1995.  The debate on Northern Ireland promised for next week will take place next Thursday morning.</P>

      <P>The Leader has obviously done his research.  We agree to the Order of Business.  If recommendations are pushed to a vote, will there be one after each of the two or three hour sections?</P>

      <P>I refer to the dispute at the <i>Irish Press.</i>  Having listened to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Richard Bruton's reply in the Dáil yesterday, I urge the Government &mdash; I know the Leader's commitment to this &mdash; following the talks today and at the weekend to do all in its power to ensure a settlement is reached to ensure the retention of the 600 jobs and that the three titles are back in print again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite clear about what the Leader said on voting.  I agree with the way in which the business is laid out, which is very efficient.  Do I take it that we will be voting section by section rather than having three votes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be a vote on specific issues if votes are required and there may also be a vote at the end of each section <i>in toto.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the issue which I wished to have established.  With regard to the current controversy, I have been very careful not to get involved in any political rows, but I wish to say, on behalf of 40,000 teachers who have been seeking a reasonable response from the Government on the question of seeking a very minor pension after 38 or 40 years of service, that it sticks in the craw of those teachers to see what the Government can do in <Col N="1380" /> other situations for people who are not doing their job properly.  It is absolutely distasteful, in the light of the current controversy, how matters are being dealt with and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Order of Business.  Will we have an opportunity to discuss what happened in the Attorney General's Office?  The Leader of the House said yesterday that the Minister for Health would come in here when the matters in the other House had been dealt with.  Could he ensure that that happens as soon as possible, perhaps next week?  Child abuse is a very urgent matter which we need to discuss here and I would welcome a definite commitment on that.</P>

      <P>It is appropriate this morning that we would issue a very warm welcome to Prince Charles who is arriving in Ireland today.  As a senior member of the British royal family and the heir to the throne, he is very much honoured by the British people, both across the water and those who consider themselves to be British on this island. It is appropriate that we in the Seanad wish him a céad mile fáilte.</P>

      <P>Can the Leader give us an assurance that if there is a resignation today, the Taoiseach will come into this House instead of sending, his proxy in the form of the Minister for Health, as he did the last time which was not sufficient or adequate, and give a full statement to this House and do this House the honour of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I support the requests of Senator Honan and Senator Mulcahy for a further discussion as soon as possible on the events of yesterday and the unfolding of the occurrences in the Attorney General's Office. However, before Official A, Matt Russell, receives his golden handshake, will somebody ask one simple question and bring the answer back to this House and, more importantly, to the people of Ireland?  Will somebody ask him why he did it?  I stated in November, in relation to this matter, that I wanted to know <Col N="1382" /> what kind of a mind set did the kind of things which appeared to have been done in the Attorney General's Office. That one simple question must be answered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting Senator Wright in relation to the support from the Government for a resolution of the problem of the <i>Irish Press</i>, as a shareholder I would like to have it known that I and many shareholders feel no sense of obligation of any kind towards the management.  The shareholders of the <i>Irish Press</i>, either today or previously, find themselves in no way obliged to support the management and their financial interests.  We would certainly be prepared to forfeit the dividends which we never got in the interests of journalists and workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator should call for a general meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make the Government aware that it need not expect any criticism from shareholders such as myself over the fact that it is more concerned about workers, journalists and the reading public than it is about the financial interests of the management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Leader arrange for the Minister for Justice to come to the Seanad for a debate on an urgent matter, that is, the farcical situation where somebody is arrested on a warrant, taken to jail at high expense to the State and let out again?  In one case where a prisoner was taken from Donegal on a warrant, there was no room in the prison for him, he got a lift home and was home before the garda who arrested him, at a cost of hundreds of pounds to the State.  I am sure that all Members of the House share this concern that vast amounts of public money are being wasted on trying to bring people to prison for small debts.  It is not <Col N="1383" /> physically possible to imprison such people if there is no space in the prison. I think that the Minister for Justice would welcome a contribution from the House on this very urgent matter.  Hundreds of pounds are being spent daily on bringing people to prisons where there is no space for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>On the same point but with a different angle, we have discussed here with previous Ministers for Justice the lunacy of the custodial policy of all Governments of locking people up for owing minimal sums of money such as £20, £30, £50 or £100.  We need to look at that and I suggest to the Leader that perhaps it would be appropriate for the House to simply debate the issue of custodial policy rather than the much wider issue of prisons and so on.  For example, if the Government was to allocate another £50 million to build a prison, we would have equally condemnatory remarks on the waste of money and or that the money could be used in a better fashion.  It is high time that the custodial policy of all Governments was looked at in the light of new ways of imposing punishments and attaching salaries to recoup fines imposed by the courts.  It is a daft system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Leader of the House, some time between now and the summer recess, make Government time available for an overall discussion on the interests of emigrants and their welfare? To the best of my knowledge, I do not think that this House has debated the interests, concerns and objectives of the emigrant community, particularly in the United Kingdom, to any great degree.  What has prompted me to request this debate is that the Federation of Irish Societies, which is the umbrella body for all Irish societies operating in the United Kingdom, held its annual general meeting last weekend at which a number of pertinent issues <Col N="1384" /> arose which we on this side of the water could help to progress.  I do not wish to delay the House, but there are a number of issues to which this House could give effect and it would be important from a psychological point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Opposition for agreeing to the arrangements for today's business.  The <i>Irish Press</i> matter is one of great seriousness and there is no doubt that the concern of all sides of this House is for a speedy resolution. This message has gone out loud and clear and the Minister is very aware of it.</P>
      <P>Senator Honan raised the question of the debate on health.  That debate will take place and I am trying to find a slot in the Order Paper as there will be a great deal of legislation over the next couple of weeks.  I am committed to having that debate and I will communicate with Senator Honan on the matter.</P>
      <P>Senator Honan and Senator McGennis asked for a further debate on the events in the Attorney General's office.  I am not sure such a debate would be helpful today or tomorrow. My view is the matter is over.  Other people have a different view.  I suspect that in terms of making a helpful contribution to the debate, it would be better if we wait until next week.  If there are matters outstanding then, we can discuss them in the calm and reflective way characteristic of the Seanad.  I do not have plans for a debate today.</P>
      <P>I join with Senator O'Sullivan in welcoming Prince Charles.  The fact that the visit is taking place in such an uncontroversial way is indicative of how important the peace process is to all of us.  It is a symbolic visit and if it can further the process of peace in Northern Ireland the better will be the relations between our two islands.  It is a welcome sign of maturity all round.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy asked me for categorical assurances.  Under the Constitution, with which I am sure the Senator is very familiar, the only categorical assurances I can give concern myself.  I <Col N="1385" /> cannot give such assurances on behalf of anybody else and I do not intend to resign today or in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">

      <P>Senator Calnan's point on rural development is important and I will try to find time for a debate on it. Senator McGowan and Senator Magner raised a point which is of concern to all of us and we will try to find time to discuss broader custodial policies.</P>
      <P>Senator McGowan raised a point last week to which I did not give a total answer.  He raised the question of the Seanad holding a meeting outside this Chamber.  I said I thought this was not possible under the Constitution. However, Article 15.1.3 states:</P>
      <P>The Houses of the Oireachtas shall sit in or near the City of Dublin or in such other place as they may from time to time determine.</P>
      <P>I have forwarded Senator McGowan's request that the Seanad meet in Lifford, which he has given to me in written form, to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and Senator McGowan can take it up with that committee to see if he can bring it any further.</P>

    <P>I welcome the Minister.  As I said on Second Stage, the process of tax reform which was started in 1989, when there were three income tax rates, and continued until 1992, by which time there were only two rates, 27 per cent and 48 per cent, needs to be put back on the rails.  This country needs a programme of tax reform which could in the life of one Government reduce the standard rate of income tax to 20 per cent and the top rate to 35 per cent and eliminate PRSI.</P>
    <P>This recommendation spells out a two pronged approach to tax reform over a number of years, which would reduce the marginal rate to 40 per cent and increase the amount of income which a single person could earn without reaching the top rate by increasing the bands and reducing the marginal rates of tax.</P>
    <P>All of us have said that unemployment is the most pressing problem facing the Government.  The Culliton report said tax reform is the greatest tool the Government has at its disposal. If we are serious about the level of unemployment we need to tackle this problem and set targets for tax rates. We usually decide how much we are going to spend and then look for the money to do this, which is found in the form of income tax.  Tax on work is far too high and we need to set a target of reducing it.  People are entitled to be told by the Government what it intends to do about taxation over a period of years.  Ministers come and go and perhaps they feel the urgent need is to deal with the problem in a particular year. We need to have a long term view of <Col N="1390" /> the economy if we want to solve the unemployment problem.  We must have a long term view of what we want to do in relation to taxation.  This is the purpose of my recommendation.</P>
    <P>Under the increases in allowances introduced by the Minister, a single person earning below the average industrial wage will begin to pay tax at the higher rate on earnings of £12,340.  They are paid approximately £170 a week into their pocket.  This is a very punitive rate of tax and we must make an effort to reduce it.</P>
    <P>There are many anomalies in the system. We have talked about the integration of the social welfare and taxation systems.  This needs to be addressed quickly because many people who are working and paying taxes feel that they may be thought of as fools and that they would be better off on social welfare.  I would like the Minister to spell out what he intends to do while he is in office rather than giving us rates for this year and saying these rates will apply in subsequent years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>This party is totally in favour of the gradual reduction of personal taxation.  The Minister would be well aware that his predecessor, with whom he is reputed to be a good friend, was on a course of such a gradual reduction.  In fairness, that course, although it was slightly altered and diminished, was carried on this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have to say to Senator Honan that it is too easy to propose sweeping changes in the levels of personal taxation without specifying how the shortfall will be made up.  It is never easy to say what services will be cut or where the shortfall will be made up to pay for reductions.  The movement towards taxation levels pertaining in other countries, particularly in the US and the UK, is something we all desire.  Allied to this is a desire for social services of a fairly egalitarian nature.  Anybody closely examining Thatcherite and post-Thatcherite Britain and Reagan and post-Reagan America would be well able to identify areas where the level of social <Col N="1391" /> support and the intervention by the State for the assistance of the truly needy certainly falls very far short of the mark to which we would aspire.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, it is difficult for us to make a decision on this issue because our party is firmly of the view that the Government and the Minister have not covered themselves in glory in relation to keeping the parameters of public spending under control.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is in touch with the business community and with people who seek to generate wealth in this country. I would be failing in my duty if I did not say that there are many members of the business community who are beginning to lack confidence in the economic policy of the Government. I mean that sincerely.  People are saying the Government seems to have too large and generous a chequebook, that we must control public spending and, in particular, control the levels of public pay.</P>

      <P>I was straying a little, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, but it is not really a useful exercise to comment on a line by line basis on these proposed amendments. They have a certain effect. Unless the Government undertook a level of borrowing for the next three or four years which we do not wish to do, public services would have to be cut.  In those circumstances I respectfully suggest that certain items of this recommendation should not be supported by the House.  Notwithstanding the failure of the Minister for Finance and the Government to have a prudent economic policy, the Fianna Fáil Party will always be responsible and will never try to con people that tax cuts of this order and magnitude can be brought in so quickly without pain and suffering by people in need.</P>

      <P>I understand the genesis of this recommendation coming from the Progressive Democrats.  It has a certain validity in relation to the internal coherence of its argument but it is flawed, because until such time as we got our expenditure commitments committed in a similar manner and we could say with certainty say what our expenditure ceilings would be for the next three years, it would be imprudent to fix one side of the balance and to leave the other side unfixed.  On Committee Stage in the Dáil, when this was debated at some considerable length, the Progressive Democrats spokesperson argued somewhat persuasively that there was a close correlation in his view and in the view of the Progressive Democrats between high levels of personal income tax on single persons, not married persons.  That is a function of the Murphy judgement and the way it has been implemented by successive Administrations, including those in which the Progressive Democrats participated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The thrust of the argument was that the high level of taxation on single workers on below average industrial wage was a disincentive to employment and prevented people from working. That is a presumed judgement.  I have seen no scientific evidence to sustain that.  There is nothing in the labour market figures to suggest people are not taking on work because of the level of taxation.  Certainly, there are strong and substantial costs on employment generally and disproportionate costs on low-paid workers relative to other categories of workers.  Those costs factored themselves through into labour-intensive industries in the traditional sectors which are trying to compete in the United Kingdom.  There is scientific evidence to sustain that particular observation and we have tried to address the validity of it by focusing the tax relief on the lower paid by widening the bands.  In addition, for the first time ever we altered the relief with regards to PRSI payments for those in the open <Col N="1393" /> competitive private sector as distinct from the non-open public sector.  The specific intent is to alleviate in part the distortion for such categories of employment that are clearly at a competitive disadvantage with the UK market.  Furthermore, on the employers side we have also intervened by raising the threshold whereby the full rate of PRSI is reduced by 3 per cent.  I know on Committee Stage we are confined to this particular recommendation but it must be taken in the context of what is being done with taxation policy.  Looking at what we have tried to do altogether, our taxation policy is not to fix ourselves to a statutory commitment over the next three years when we cannot be that certain.  Even if we were to start to fix figures, my preference would be to fix expenditure figures rather than income tax figures so that we would know where we were.</P>
    <P>If I may address the point made by Senator Mulcahy, unlike the previous Administration and the one that preceded it, this is the first Administration that has actually voluntarily taken upon itself a limit on increases in public expenditure.  The increase this year will be less than the increase was last year.  I addressed these comments at some length on Second Stage yesterday evening.  There is some misinformation put out by IBEC and others about the actual increase in terms of figures. Senator O'Kennedy was being misled, or allowed himself to be misled, in relation to the way those figures were being quoted, but I am possibly out of order in addressing what was perhaps an out of order comment.</P>
    <P>We are not prepared to accept this recommendation because it puts the cart before the horse.  Frankly, given the scarcity of resources and the need to intensify employment opportunities within our economy, this is not the best method of approach.  While the argument can be well made in favour of the single worker below the average industrial wage, the consequence of that system, if factored through the entire system, as would be the case, would be to <Col N="1394" /> have exactly the same effect it had in Mrs. Thatcher's Britain and Mr. Reagan's United States.  There would be winners and the real winners would be at the top end of the income scale, which perhaps may be the motivation of the Progressive Democrats.  I do not know.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Senator Mulcahy, the Opposition are not allowed to make any proposals to increase taxation or to widen the tax base.  We cannot even suggest there should be a system of tax credits, which the Progressive Democrats believes would be much fairer than tax allowances.  Everybody would then get the benefit of the same rate rather than people on higher wages and salaries getting greater benefit because they pay tax at the higher rate.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister.  It is essential that we fix expenditure figures.  For instance, any household cannot decide how much they will spend, go looking for the money, borrow the shortfall and try to repay the shortfall in future years. That is not possible.  We need targets in both our expenditure and income.  We need it on both sides.  That is why we need to tell people the targets we have set for ourselves in relation to taxation. Does the Minister intend to fix expenditure over a number of years or to tell us of the increases in expenditure over a number of years so that we could match our taxation take to the same amount?</P>
      <P>I accept and the Progressive Democrats agree with the Minister's argument in relation to the Murphy case.  We should not need to double the allowances of single people for a married couple.  We should not need to follow that through in all the allowances the State gives, because it is less expensive for two people to live together.

    <P>I have had experience of employers who are hoping to employ people starting work in labour intensive industries. They find it extremely difficult to get people who are willing to begin at a low level of pay because of the social welfare <Col N="1395" /> system.  I am constantly contacted by people complaining.  They say there is supposed to be a huge unemployment problem and ask why they find it so difficult. We need to address the problem. We need to get people into the work system.  They would progress through it, but they need to see at the beginning that they will not stay at that low level of pay.  We need to be able to attract them in initially.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to misrepresent what the Minister said but I take it, from what he said in reply to a question a few minutes ago, that he does not believe that the high tax levels are a disincentive to people to work.  The fact is that a huge number of people, especially young highly qualified professional people, are leaving Ireland to avail of opportunities abroad, even though there are opportunities available for them here, because of the high levels of personal taxation.  This fact is borne out by the example of the Shannon industrial estate.  Some highly paid American executives came to establish businesses and then found that, when they set about training people to take over from them, many of these people left the area and went to the United States and other places because of the exorbitant levels of taxation which they were paying here.  I do not want to misrepresent what the Minister was saying but I took it that he was endeavouring to say that levels of taxation were not disincentives to people taking up employment.</P>

      <P>We could get into an extended debate on this issue.  I understood Senator Honan to be making the comment that some people felt they would be better off on the dole than working.  I have yet to find this mythical person who has opted to leave a job to go on to the dole and I have yet to find somebody who wants to be on it after 12 months.  However, that is not to say that there are not many people at work who feel dissatisfied with the amount of pay they are getting or the amount of <Col N="1396" /> tax they have to pay.  I have yet to meet somebody who feels happy with the amount of tax they pay in any jurisdiction. Of the 80 to 85 per cent of the working population who are at work, few would say they are happy with the level of remuneration they get.  Let us separate satisfaction with pay from how the taxation system prevents people being in work or going to work.</P>
      <P>In the context of migration and people moving to other jurisdictions because of the level of taxation, I have to tell Senator Daly that a survey on migration was done during my time in the Department of Labour in the mid-1980s. We found that there were three categories of people who migrated or emigrated: it was migration rather than the kind of historical emigration.  One third went abroad for work experience, even though they had opportunities here &mdash; typically people who graduated from the third level system and deliberately chose to go abroad for experience; I was one of them.  Another third were at work in Ireland and went away to get experience.  Many of them were on career breaks from the Civil Service. The residual third &mdash; we called them one third each but that would not suggest that it was a mathematical third &mdash; were people who went away for genuine employment reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are individual cases where the level of taxation is a disincentive in terms of personal income.  People look at their personal income tax and think it is far less in the United States but many people do not add into the cost of living in the United States the local tax, the state tax and the property tax, if they are renting.  For example, there are three categories of tax in New York City: federal income tax, New York state income tax and New York City income tax.  When people start to compare the actual amount of income tax, they do not compare like with like: they compare federal tax with national tax in Ireland and they exclude the fact that, by and large, there is no property tax here of what we would regard as traditional rates, as is the case in Northern <Col N="1397" /> Ireland and in the rest of the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Returning to the central point made by Senator Honan in this recommendation, the position of the Labour Party and of the tripartite Government in this regard &mdash; and the position of the Fianna Fáil Party when they were in Government &mdash; is not to reduce the rates of taxation, which is the preference of the Progressive Democrats, but to widen the bands and increasingly to have as many people as is possible paying tax at the standard rate of 27 per cent.  If this Finance Bill is enacted, it will result in an increase of approximately 1.5 per cent in the total number of people &mdash; bringing it to 66 per cent of the workforce &mdash; who will be paying at the standard rate.</P>

      <P>In page 15, line 41, after &ldquo;residence&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or was the residence, for the purposes of attending an institution of third-level education, of a student of whom he was the parent or guardian&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This recommendation speaks for itself. It is about the requirements of a person in relation to their residence and third level institutions.  There is no logical reason the Minister should not be prepared to accept this recommendation.  It makes common sense and there is no point in making a lengthy speech about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am familiar with this recommendation and I understand the background to it.  Let me address the reason the section was introduced in the first instance.  There are three categories of people being housed on this island at present: owner-occupiers, local authority tenants and private tenants.  I am leaving aside those in household or institutional arrangements.  Local authority tenants get State support and housing assistance support through the differential rent system, which is income related.  Owner-occupiers, if they are purchasing with the help of a mortgage, get income tax relief State assistance to enable them to purchase their home. We have the highest level of home ownership in Europe and possibly in the world &mdash; New Zealand may have a marginally <Col N="1399" /> higher level &mdash; at approximately 80 per cent.  I have always held the view that people in private rented accommodation got no assistance whatsoever in State support.  There is also a view which I share, based on my constituency experience, that there are may landlords in the black economy who are not reporting the amount of rental income they are getting from private tenants.</P>
      <P>This section attempts to do two things.  First and foremost, it will give private tenants a modest measure of income tax relief, to which they are entitled &mdash; especially people who want to have long term tenancy arrangements and not to be moving around.  In addition, it will have the added beneficial effect of bringing into the compliant tax economy those landlords who are outside it at present.  It is designed to facilitate people who are dependent on private rented accommodation for their housing needs or who have chosen to rent accommodation rather than commit themselves to substantial capital purchases.  That is increasingly the desire of many single people who do not necessarily want to acquire a capital asset, which they cannot take with them after they depart, or who want to live in a particular location.</P>
      <P>To give effect to the Fianna Fáil recommendation would be to give tax relief to students living away from home.  That is the intent of their proposal. The thrust of the section is towards equity in the primary housing market, not providing assistance for students or others living away from their primary residence.  I am therefore not prepared to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the section and the Minister's reply.  Is he prepared to consider giving further tax benefits in the future to people who are prepared to go into private rented accommodation? In the past I strongly urged that people should get every possible assistance to accommodate themselves and, as the Minister said over 80 per cent of Irish people own their accommodation. <Col N="1400" /> However, when I look at the benefits given to financial institutions and the money they make from people who borrow money to purchase accommodation, I wonder whether we are taking the right approach.  The Minister is now giving £1,000 relief to a married couple who are tenants and bringing landlords who were outside the system for many years into the tax net.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister prepared to consider second generation mortgages?  We will now see more people going into private rented accommodation, as happens on the Continent.  In Germany, Belgium and other countries few people buy their own accommodation.  We are now putting the responsibility on young couples in that we are not prepared to give them tax relief on their mortgages, but we will give £1,000 in tax relief when they rent.  Since those tenants will be paying persons or companies acting as landlords, we should ensure the landlords are named before the relief is given.  If the Minister is prepared to broaden this in the future, the financial institutions should be made aware of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said there were three categories but I suggest there are four.  A new development is that people rent houses and get their health board to pay up to £65 in supplementary rent allowance.  This is done in collusion with the tenant in some cases.  The new fund costs the State £48 million.  We have acted out of concern for those who are renting flats, but there is collusion in setting rent.  It will be fixed at £80 but the tenant pays the landlord only £15 while the State pays £65.  The bill for this, which is the fourth category, is escalating.  I hope the Minister recognises this group and includes it in the taxation net.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The section is a step forward. In continental countries most people do not own property; they live in rented accommodation, provided by a landlord or the Government.  The provision will lead us in the right direction. For various reasons some young couples <Col N="1401" /> do not want to own the accommodation where they live.  Many old people would prefer to live in rented accommodation and they will benefit from this provision. I welcome the provision and, like Senator Cregan, ask the Minister to consider including second generation mortgages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the section.  In the recommendation we endeavour to extend relief to students living away from home.  The Minister acknowledges the intention, but he may not appreciate the burden families carry in these cases. Two of my children attend higher level institutions in Limerick.  I know of other families in this position who have become part of the new poor.  They pay tax and work hard but find it almost impossible to meet the expenditure involved.  Not only are there fees and maintenance, but the burden of rental allowances is so heavy that many families almost go to the wall.</P>
      <P>There may be another mechanism by which we can achieve the objective of the recommendation, but we wish to put a formula in place which will relieve the burden on these families.  There is also travel expenditure because many of these students go home at weekends.  It is mainly middle income families who are involved and because the students are not at college for the full year the burden on the Exchequer would not be extraordinary.  We do not anticipate that the allowances would apply for the full year because terms in the colleges are limited, so expenditure for the State would not be as large as for an all year allowance.</P>
      <P>Can the Minister indicate what the cost of the recommendation would be? I do not believe it would be exorbitant but it would relieve the cost of accommodation of students in higher education on families who find it expensive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of points have been raised and I will address them <i>seriatim.</i>  Senator Cregan raised general questions about housing policy. It is some time since I was involved in <Col N="1402" /> housing economics but I can offer a view based on memory and on my experience on Dublin City Council, a position I shared with Senator Mulcahy.</P>
      <P>The pattern in local authorities is that 50 per cent of allocations are to households of two persons and less.  That is a dramatic transformation from my time as a housing design architect, when the typical mix was 75 per cent of an estate was three bedroom, five roomed houses for families of three to four children, 15 per cent was four bedroom houses and 10 per cent was for the elderly.  That mix, which was standard through the 1960s and 1970s, has now been transformed.</P>
      <P>Because of fertility within our families and society, the headship rate in our society is producing a different type of household, the size of which is much smaller and requires smaller accommodation. The economics of providing such accommodation suggests multiple dwellings, because two-roomed, stand alone detached buildings are ludicrously expensive in an urban context.  Individuals with medium incomes cannot finance such activity, so a structure of joint apartment buildings is required, provided by professional landlords.  Such supply has been generated on the Continent because of the demand.</P>
      <P>Abroad, some people want to purchase their dwelling and obtain second generation mortgages.  My understanding of that, which is subject to confirmation, is that it is because the capital costs of such buildings are far in excess of what they would be in Ireland.  Anybody who has inquired as to the cost of property in continental cities relative to the cost of property here will be aware of that phenomenon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is needed is a new economic housing policy, having regard to the changing nature of household formation. There are many single people or people with limited commitments who do not necessarily want to spend 20 years paying a mortgage on a capital asset which they cannot take with them and for which they do not wish to assume responsibility, and they would <Col N="1403" /> prefer to use their disposable income for other purposes.</P>
    <P>It is a more complex issue than the Finance Bill can address in this context. I have already said to my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, that we need a new White Paper on housing or a new outlook on housing over the next ten to 20 years. We have addressed more satisfactorily than most European countries the housing problems we had in the 1960s when there was a housing crisis in Dublin and other cities.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan spoke about collusion. Perhaps the health board in Donegal is more generous in relation to rent allowances.  Senator Mulcahy will agree with me that the maximum rent allowance in our area of south Dublin is £20 to £24 per week on top of what is being paid.  If somebody is getting about £50 per week supplementary rent allowance in Donegal we will be able to talk to the Department of Health about it. There is no reason anything of that order would be justified.</P>
    <P>There have been problems in the past in this regard.  The Programme for Government will transfer responsibility for the allocation of rent allowances from the health boards to the housing authority.  One housing authority will have responsibility.  Thus the potential collusion to which the Senator referred &mdash; I have no evidence of such but I respect his judgement in this matter &mdash; could be minimised.</P>
    <P>In addition, section 14 will give the Government the powers to obtain from the health boards on a legal basis the names and addresses of the landlords in receipt of these allowances.  It seems incredible that the Government was unable to get full co-operation from local authorities as to which landlords were in receipt of rent allowances through their tenants.  Section 14 will now enable us to get that information. Where there is possible abuse or overcharging, or a flow of income not fully reflected in returns to the Revenue <Col N="1404" /> Commissioners, we are taking steps in a later section of the Bill to address that.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly raised the issue of accommodation and income support for students, which is a separate matter of which accommodation is one element.  I do not wish to confuse one with the other; there are other ways of addressing that issue.  I would not disagree with some of the points the Senator made. One could make other observations in the context of support for third level students.  However, it is a separate issue from the question of providing some degree of equality of treatment in relation to a category of people which is growing in numbers because of the change in the demographic structure of society and who do not get any support from the State, and a subcategory of people who traditionally supplied that accommodation.  Reason, anecdotal evidence and 20 or more years of political stomping around Dublin South East would lead me to suspect that many landlords were not revealing to the Revenue Commissioners the full amount of money they were being paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 6 deals with relief on fees paid to private colleges.  The Government has found itself bound to introduce tax allowances for private third level colleges because of the socially regressive policy of the abolition of all university fees.  The abolition of university fees for everybody is not socially equitable.</P>
      <P>Reform of the grants system was needed.  Everybody felt the grants system was being abused and many people in the middle income bracket were not able to avail of the grants system for their children.  It is not acceptable that children of wealthy parents will only have to pay half university fees this year and no fees next year while there are people on social welfare who would qualify for a full grant but are still not in a position to be able to afford to attend college &mdash; although the fees are paid, the maintenance grant is too low.</P>
      <P>The amount of money being devoted to abolishing university fees could have been put to better use in reforming the grants system by giving grants to people in the middle income bracket and increasing the grant for those who, although they would be entitled to a grant, will not go to university because the grant is at such a low level that it is not possible for them to afford it.</P>

I congratulate the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Education and the Government on this measure.</P>

    <P>This section deals with the relief on fees paid to private colleges.  The changes in employment trends have brought about the growth of private colleges. <Col N="1406" /> This section will allow tax relief to be given on the fees charged by the private colleges.

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the provision in this section as a welcome development. Many families have had to go into debt to send their children to colleges and they have not been getting relief up to now.  This is a welcome development which we asked for last year.</P>
      <P>Many of these private colleges are business and innovation oriented and that is to be encouraged.  We have far too few colleges concentrating on training people in business management and organisation.  Some of the private colleges have undertaken extraordinary work.  The HSI college, for example, in Limerick city has been run by Michael McNamara and his mother for over 40 years.  It is an excellent institution which has produced highly trained professionals.</P>
      <P>Many of the parents who sent their children to such schools found they could not get relief on the fees because they did not qualify.  They did not get any tax relief either.  This is a welcome improvement which I support.</P>

      <P>In page 19, line 38, after &ldquo;£150&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or the amount, if lesser, of the service charge actually proven to have been paid&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this section.  In 1984, when local service charges were implemented, it was felt that there should be tax relief on them and that the PAYE sector should benefit.  I argued this point with the then Government and Minister for Finance, Deputy Dukes, but it would have cost the Department of Finance £47 million per year because Dublin was included.</P>
      <P>While I agree with the limit of £150, there is a problem implementing it at local authority level in Cork city.  It does not operate in the same way as mortgage relief in that if a person pays their mortgage they will get a certificate from the local authority which enables them to claim tax free allowances and benefits. This is being implemented differently. Is it possible to simplify it so that it can be implemented at local authority level in the same way as mortgage relief?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Finance has said that because it is awkward to implement, people will not get the benefit. This creates more problems.  It is unacceptable that a son who lives with his retired parents and who works in the PAYE sector could claim tax relief on it.  We do not want an awkward system implemented at local authority level so that arguments will be made by people who do not want to pay.  It is recognised that local authorities must collect <Col N="1408" /> money locally in order to improve their situation.  We should implement a simple system.  People who want to pay their local service charges must now go to the Revenue Commissioners.  Can relief on local service charges be implemented in the same way as mortgage relief in that if a person pays a mortgage to a local authority they will get a certificate which will allow them to claim their tax benefits?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this section because it is crazy to make local authorities go to court before they can recover small amounts for local service charges.  The Government has introduced an allowance of £150 because a decision was made that local authorities had to go to court to encourage people to pay.  It was accepted that these people would probably not pay because they did not have to unless the county council brought them to court.</P>
      <P>We all accept that local authority funding needs to be reformed but successive Governments have failed to address this issue.  It is crazy to introduce one such reform and to involve the bureaucratic system in local authorities by asking it to give people certificates. Local authorities were happy with the money they collected from local service charges because there was a high compliance rate.  As a member of a local authority I know people who were threatened that the services provided by the local authority would be cut off if they did not make an attempt to pay their charges.  It is annoying for local authorities to have to go through this procedure and then to have another bureaucratic system to issue certificates. I cannot support this section.  We should consider reforming local authority funding, but not through the introduction of such silly measures in order to appease Democratic Left.</P>

This section will give tax relief to people who pay local service charges.  Although local authorities must now issue a certificate to a person who pays these charges, there was always an obligation on them to issue a receipt.  I have no sympathy for people who do not pay for services. Water, refuse collection and sewage are essential services which must be paid for.  The Government has taken the right step because a person will either get tax relief if they pay the charges, or, if they cannot pay, they will be able to avail of a waiver system.  That is a fair and equitable arrangement.</P>

Tax relief &mdash; we can address this if it does not happen in Cork, although it would surprise me if that is the case &mdash; is claimable on payments made in the previous year.  To certify that a payment has been made, a local authority will either give an individual a receipt in paper form, which they can include with their tax returns like everyone else, or, if they use state of the art information technology, they can take the RSI number and file it directly with the Revenue Commissioners. There is no paper transaction.</P>

      <P>That is a problem for Cork.  I am aware that Cork's aspirations for independence on occasions are fairly strong, but on this occasion the federalist and centralist nature of the State is intact and Cork is still a compliant partner in it.  We will try to sort it out, but Cork was the first to break ranks with regard to the actions of city managers.  In reality, however, those are the two choices.  We should be advised if there are operational problems, but the formal arrangements that have been negotiated with the local authorities and the Revenue Commissioners are as I have described.</P>
      <P>With regard to the points made by Senator Honan, the issue is in respect of services to a dwelling.  A dwelling that does not have either sewerage or water is uninhabitable for the purposes of all our legislation.  Where local authority tenants refuse to, do not or fail to pay their rent, the local authority cannot put them out.  There is due process and there are civilian and civic rights within the State.  We are saying to local authorities that if they are to undertake actions that would constitute rendering the dwelling a non-dwelling or a noninhabitable dwelling, they must observe due process and there must be some degree of equity.  This is a republic; people have rights.  It may be cumbersome and bureaucratic, but it is a balance that has been struck between the rights of citizens on the one hand and the powers of a local authority on the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The measure is based on legislation derived from Scotland, where a local authority cannot arbitrarily and unilaterally cut off the supply of an essential service that turns a building into a dwelling.  Without the sewerage and water supply the building is incapable in modern terms of being a dwelling and this is why the measure was introduced. It is a response in the Programme for Government to what was an outstanding political issue, and it has now been resolved.  There is no longer any justification for anybody not to pay their service charges.  It is a spurious argument <Col N="1411" /> that it was a double taxation, and I have always regarded it as such.  Buying a pint of stout is an exercise in double taxation because there is income tax taken off the money in the first instance, followed by the tax on the pint of stout.</P>
    <P>Many transactions in this country could be described as double taxation. It is an argument that goes back to the time when rates were abolished and people were told that they did not have to pay rates because it would be paid in income tax.  This was the origin of the highly politicised double taxation argument. I believe we have resolved this matter and this tenuous argument &mdash; I have always believed it to be such &mdash; in a manner which is satisfactory.  In addition, as has been remarked by Senator Calnan and Senator Burke, we have extended it to group water schemes, private refuse collections and any other services which are introduced. It is up to a maximum amount of £150, or whatever the service charge is in the local authority.  For example, if the maximum service charge in a local authority is £80, the person does not get £150 but £80.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>The threat of cutting off the water supply was a sanction available to the local authority and the cost of taking people to court is probably something that they will not now pursue because it is so expensive.  The amount of money they could possibly recover would be less than the cost of going to court.  Many of those who comply and pay their charges in time every year are very annoyed that people do not pay and continue to refuse to pay.  The fact that the local authorities had this sanction was in itself an incentive for a very high compliance rate.</P>

      <P>The people in difficulty with paying a service charge of any kind, whether it be water, sewerage or refuse collection, are not in the income tax bracket.  I am a long time member of a local authority and I make a handful of representations on this issue every <Col N="1412" /> week.  I know the kind of people in difficulty and at the point of having their water disconnected.</P>
      <P>The Minister is honest and correct to state that this is a political issue.  Unfortunately, it is a political issue which affects local authorities in collecting what is a fundamental piece of revenue for them if they wish to look forward and extend their services.  For example, in my county the local authorities have to provide additional water connections continually every year, and it is an ongoing programme.  The Minister's solution to the problem is that those who pay water charges obtain income tax relief.  However, those involved in the problem are not in the tax net&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It may have satisfied a partner in the Government, but there is not enough transparency on the matter because the person who may be cut off knows what is involved, along with everybody else.  This is a serious matter. The Minister is capable of making a clear cut decision on it.  He would not waffle, mess about and go around in circles to get a solution.  He is capable enough and honest enough to decide on a course of action which is simple and straightforward.  This has been a waffling issue which has presented all kinds of complications for local authorities.</P>

The Minister accepts that there are those who do not want to pay and will not pay.  He has thrown such people a life-belt and has caused complications over a simple straightforward issue.  Local authorities have a problem.  To offer tax relief to those who pay their water charges who may not be in the net in the first instance begs the question as to why not extend it to car tax and so on? I cannot get tax relief for paying my car tax, my ESB and telephone bills.  There are no grounds for this kind of solution to the problem, which was unnecessarily created at the outset.  I am a supporter of the Minister.  I grant him a straightforward, simple attitude because of his northern blood, but he is compromised&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I make no apology to anybody in stating that this was a political problem <Col N="1414" /> for many of the parties.

      <P>I am acutely aware of the origins of the service charges.  I was the Minister of State responsible for bringing them through the House.  We all know the background to that.  I wish to address the specific points made.  I make no apology for being a politician or for finding political solutions to political problems.  That is my trade.</P>
      <P>I want to address the comments made by Senator McGowan.  Anybody who is not paying income tax should qualify for a waiver in respect of service charges.  If their income is such that they are not eligible to pay income tax, then all other things being equal they should qualify for a waiver and, if they do not, this should be brought to the attention of the county manager or to the Minister for the Environment.  In general that is what the waiver scheme is supposed to be about and there is some discretion in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage during the passage of this legislation through the other House the Opposition made the very valid point that if the registered occupant of a house was an elderly parent and a working son or daughter was living in the house, paying the service charge, the ESB bill and all the other bills, as is normal, then that working person, although he or she would not be the registered occupant for the purposes of the serving of the charge, should qualify for the income tax relief.  I was persuaded of its validity and we amended the section accordingly. Therefore, it addresses that situation and brings it in line with the situation where if an elderly mother or father is <Col N="1415" /> the registered tenant of a local authority house and the working daughter or son was in effect paying the mortgage repayments, that son or daughter could qualify for the tax relief.  If there are further examples Senator McGowan should by all means bring them to my attention; but in the first instance he should bring them to the attention of the local authority, where he has considerable clout.</P>

      <P>I move recommendation No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 23, line 21, after &ldquo;Minister for Finance&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;or any of the charities listed in the Second Schedule&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister has heard of the expression which states that charity begins at home.  That is the fundamental principle on which this recommendation is based.  I do not know why the Minister decided in section 8 of this Bill to permit tax relief only in respect of contributions made to charities working in developing countries and territories, those on the list produced by the development aid committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An enormous amount of excellent charitable work is done in this country. The range of organisations and their activities are widespread.  Ireland is known to be an extremely charitable country.  Thousands of volunteers work for the organisations listed in the proposed <Col N="1416" /> Second Schedule and these organisations need money to fund their activities.  The primary source of funding for these organisations is their own private fund-raising schemes, such as church gate collections, selling flowers, daffodil days and so on.  The Minister will also be aware that with the introduction of the national lottery complaints were made by many charities that consumers' discretionary spending has been soaked up by the national lottery and that these organisations were not benefiting from the national lottery.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have read the proposed Second Schedule to section 8 which contains the list of charities.  In effect, the Minister is saying that the Alzheimer's Society of Ireland does not deserve support, that the Cystic Fibrosis Association does not deserve support, that the Irish Kidney Association does not deserve support, that the Polio Fellowship of Ireland does not deserve support. These organisations need help. Why should we discriminate between poverty in Ireland and poverty in other countries?  There is no logical answer to that question.</P>
    <P>Poverty, as the Minister, a reader of Karl Marx, knows, is relative.  A thatched cottage might be a castle for somebody while a semi-detached house might not be suitable for somebody else. There are people in this country who may be sick, handicapped, lonely or disabled and fortunately there are people who organise themselves in charities to help those people.  I am not suggesting for a minute that the Minister is not personally sympathetic to these charities; that would be totally wrong of me. However, there might be a body of thinking in a certain Government Department to which the Minster is attached which sees yet another escape of possible taxation revenue and is not prepared to run with it.  The answer to that is very clear.  If the Minster is going to open the door, he must open the door to everybody.</P>
    <P>What the Minister is proposing might have the invidious result of creating competition and perhaps friction <Col N="1417" /> between various charitable institutions in this country.  The Minister says it is there already.  I have never seen or heard of friction between charitable organisations in this country.</P>

      <P>The goodwill of the vast majority of the people involved in Irish charitable organisations is such that they would not partake in any kind of behaviour that might lead to friction.  I am not saying that charities which have their principal work abroad should hot be supported, but it amounts to heartlessness on the part of this Government and of the Department of Finance to close the door on Irish charities.</P>
      <P>The Association of National Charities had a meeting with the Minister and described that meeting as most unsatisfactory. It is very distressing to hear any group of charities describe their meeting with any Minister as most unsatisfactory.  They say:</P>
      <P>We cannot believe that a Labour Minister for Finance has created a two tier sector in the charity area and is providing an incentive to the already generous Irish public to donate their money to Third World charities over those charities operating at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleagues will also deal with this topic and we agree there should be a maximum financial limit on the amount of money which might be lost to the Exchequer.  That makes sense and the Minister must be strong on this issue. <Col N="1418" /> He should listen to us and remember that charity begins at home.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">

      <P>Recommendation No. 5 is in my name.  I agree with Senator Mulcahy that the Minister is creating inequality.  I listened to the Minister's reply to our arguments in relation to national charities on Second Stage yesterday. He stated there would be no difference in the amounts given to both types of charities and that an additional amount would be paid over to the charity by the Revenue.  However, the value of a person's contribution to a Third World charity will now be greater and these charities will advertise this fact.</P>
      <P>There is grave concern among national charities about this.  They feel the contributions made to their organisations and to Third World charities should qualify for tax relief.  They welcome and are in favour of the Minister's move in relation to Third World charities but they feel they should be given equal status.  As Senator Mulcahy said, a huge number of voluntary workers help domestic charities and they can only conclude, as the National Charities Association itself stated, that this Government places more value on Third World charities.</P>
      <P>This is unacceptable, particularly since the Government relies heavily on national charities, such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the Irish Cancer Society, the Irish Red Cross Society and the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, to carry out voluntary work.  This is work it would have to pay for if these groups did not exist.  The measure is most ungenerous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said the floodgates could open and one did not know where it would end.  Senator Lee's recommendation limits the relief to £2 million in any one year, which we would be most willing to support.  The Minister also mentioned that 3,000 organisations might claim this relief.  It is interesting that the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Burton, has invited organisations involved in fund raising for charitable and other <Col N="1419" /> purposes to a meeting to discuss difficulties they encounter, to examine the recommendations contained in the Costello report with a view to drawing up legislation and accounting practices and standards for charities.  The Minister of State only invited 100 organisations because the Department of Foreign Affairs believes there are only 100 organisations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If a Minister of State considers that only 100 organisations are involved in fund raising for charitable and other purposes, how does the Minister for Finance believe that the floodgates could open and many other organisations would apply?  Senator Lee's recommendation suggests a limit of £2 million and most Members would support that.  I ask the Minister to be generous to Irish charities and to show that this Government values them on an equal basis to Third World charities and appreciates their great work in this country.  I ask him to accept the recommendation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I warmly applaud the Minister's intention to trying to positively and concretely commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Famine. However, the way in which he has gone about it has already been counter-productive by creating unnecessary divisiveness. It is accepted that there will always be divisiveness where there is human agency, but one can do with as little divisiveness as possible in an area where the objectives are so admirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could understand the linking of the 150th anniversary with the approach if the proposals had been specifically <Col N="1420" /> focused on famine relief around the world, or even famine relief interpreted as natural disaster relief of horrors of a crisis nature wherever they occur.  I am not clear as regards the list of designated countries but we are obviously accepting an OECD listing.  Other countries may be included, but I do not know if Armenian earthquakes or Bosnian horrors of various types are covered as I suspect the OECD does not include these in its list.  We should determine our priority countries rather than follow another organisation's listing.</P>
    <P>I will return to point about the deleterious effects of the distinction between domestic and foreign charities and what is being done.  However, I suspect the admirable motive of making some restitution, however psychological, for the benefits we received from charitable people during the Famine &mdash; the Minister said earlier that we are all politicians and that there are political dimensions to everything &mdash; has not been unaffected by the consideration that our contribution is 0.23 per cent of GNP and the OECD average is 0.35 per cent.</P>
    <P>I suspect the Minister may have felt inhibited at meetings from time to time, in speaking out as strongly as he might wish on certain matters, by the fact that other members could point to our low official contribution and that we have not been able to incorporate the benefits of the substantial private charity to which we contribute in our formal positions. I have no objection to linking private voluntary charity with official charity in order to clarify for the wider world the earnestness and seriousness with which we take our responsibilities to those less fortunate than ourselves at national level.  I welcome this move but the mechanism is most unfortunate.</P>
    <P>It will create divisiveness between foreign and domestic charities.  I hope I am not misrepresenting the Minister's position; I have been reading Dáil debates in between examination papers. It is rare that one turns to a Dáil speech for relief, but this is one occasion on which one does so.  There is now an <Col N="1421" /> incentive for Third World charities to try to impress on potential donors that there is more bang for their buck in turning to the Third World than in contributing to domestic charities.  In the circumstances, it would be natural and proper for Third World charities to intensify their advertising to impress this aspect on potential donors.</P>
    <P>Although we are all uncertain about the precise consequences, it is reasonable to assume that there will be an inevitable diversion of the resources involved as a response to the intensification of the campaign to take advantage of this measure, which will be specifically listed as a reason for responding in a more generous way to Third World charities.  Diversion and redistribution within the charitable field as a result of specific legislation is undesirable, unless there is an intention to damage the domestic charities.  I accept that this intention does not exist, but I am convinced there is a serious danger.  Far from being threatened with danger, the domestic charities ought to be encouraged.</P>
    <P>I am not anti-State on an ideological basis.  I believe in seeking results whether they are delivered by the State or by voluntary or private concerns.  The voluntary sector in this country will be called upon to deliver more and more services because institutions which traditionally catered for disability of various types are declining in their effectiveness. The only alternative to such institutions is either the State or voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>I do not dispute the good intentions of the State but voluntary organisations play a positive role in fostering the type of society most people want us to be. We need a thriving voluntary sector and we must encourage the voluntary sector by expressing our admiration and gratitude for what it does.  I know it was not the Minister's intention but already this proposal conveys the impression that domestic organisations are second class citizens within the voluntary charities sector.  As long as this distinction lasts that impression cannot be avoided. <Col N="1422" /> However unintentional it was &mdash; and I accept that it was entirely unintentional &mdash; it is necessary that we extend this provision to the domestic voluntary charities as well as to organisations such as the Red Cross which have commitments in both areas and which may find contributions for their work in the Third World or overseas seriously affected by what appears to be almost double discrimination.</P>
    <P>I am concerned at the potentially deleterious effects of this provision.  It is better to hasten slowly in these matters. I accept that there are implications for the Exchequer.  That is why there is a capping figure which I owe, I hasten to add, to Deputy Sargent who perused the amendments proposed in the Lower House.  I accept the principle of that but I am not hung up on a particular figure. The principle involved is that it is better to hasten slowly and to feel one's way in what is a generally desirable direction &mdash; a direction I applaud &mdash; rather than simply to introduce this.  There is a commitment that if in a year's time it has been seen to be deleterious some compensatory mechanism might be put in place.  However, why take the risk? Even admitting that it might be shows the uncharted waters we are entering. We should not take that risk against what is the most deserving of all sectors in our society.  I implore the Minister to reconsider this matter at this juncture.</P>

      <P>Like Senator Lee, I believe it would be a great pity if the Minister's good intentions in this section were to be diluted in a way he had not intended and in a way that would create unnecessary problems for many societies and organisations which have been doing excellent work for a number of years.  The Minister must be aware of the widespread anxiety that exists, especially in organisations such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the <Col N="1423" /> Irish Red Cross Society.  It is unnecessary to remind the Minister that the Irish Red Cross Society was established by statute.  It has been involved, as Senator Lee said, in a variety of operations at home and overseas.  The effect of this section &mdash; let us put it in its starkest terms &mdash; will be that £1 donated to, for example.  Concern will go further than £1 donated to the Irish Red Cross Society.</P>
      <P>I listened carefully to the Minister's Second Stage reply last night.  I did not fully grasp what he was trying to say but I got the distinct impression that he was suggesting that societies such as the Irish Red Cross Society would be able to benefit from the Exchequer through covenants or some other mechanism.  I am not totally convinced by his argument. However, I would remind him that the Irish Red Cross Society, although engaged in a great deal of humanitarian work overseas, also has been involved in a great deal of work at home, for example, dealing with refugees. When I was Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs we were involved in difficult negotiations about bringing refugees into this country. The Irish Red Cross Society did trojan work on that occasion by organising facilities and so on for the refugees.  It is also the principal first aid agency in Ireland.  I compliment the chairperson of the Irish Red Cross Society, Una McGurk, and the society's administration on their excellent work. Recently the society helped the flood victims in Clare, Gort and Galway.</P>
      <P>What the Minister proposes in this section &mdash; and I do not think it was his intention and listening to his observations last night he would appear to be sympathetic towards dealing with the situation &mdash; will seriously discriminate against these bodies.</P>

      <P>The Minister will have to demonstrate otherwise.  We are not convinced that he will not create unnecessary <Col N="1424" /> competition.  Organisations such as the Irish Red Cross Society which are doing trojan work here and overseas will be seriously affected by this measure.  That applies also to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the 75 other agencies in this sector.</P>

      <P>I compliment and congratulate the voluntary groups on their magnificent work.  The Minister clearly spelt out yesterday what he intends to do about this matter.  He said he has a number of options with regard to the National Lottery Act.  He has also established a mechanism with regard to the Irish Red Cross Society whereby people will benefit from tax relief when donating through covenants to that organisation. I agree with Senator Daly that the Irish Red Cross Society is doing magnificent work throughout the country. However, the Minister has clearly outlined his intentions.</P>
      <P>This is the first time that Third World charities have benefited from special concessions and different treatment from domestic charities.  The Minister said he would like to do something to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Famine and he has done so by giving special concessions to Third World charities.  In view of these considerations we should leave this provision as it stands.  We will be in a position to see if it has adverse affects on domestic charities by next year.  At that stage we could reverse the provision or give concessions to domestic charities.  I appeal to Members to give this provision a chance for 12 months.  We can gauge any adverse affects envisaged by the Opposition in 12 months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other speakers in congratulating the Minister for introducing this worthwhile initiative. It is well intentioned.  However, the Minister must be aware that giving tax relief only to Third World charities is predicted to have a major effect on charities at home.  The fact that the charities spent some of their very scarce resources to place a full page advertisement <Col N="1425" /> in national newspapers is an indication of how scared those organisations are about the effect of this provision.</P>
      <P>Any politician who has knocked on doors will have met people who are involved with some charity or who have a relative with a handicap.  Every Member of the Oireachtas must admit that the work being done by charities affiliated to the National Charities of Ireland &mdash; as we will be told quite honestly on the doorsteps &mdash; is work which should properly be done by Government, regardless of what party is in power.  All parties in this Chamber have been in Government at various times so I am not apportioning blame to anybody.  I am trying to be fair.  All these groups which are permanently fund raising and so on are doing work which I and the public believe should properly be done by the Government of the day.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Senator Daly, referred to the Irish Red Cross Society.  I want to refer to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul because of my own situation in Dublin.  I live in and represent Blanchardstown and my local authority ward is particularly disadvantaged.  Four of the six parishes in my electoral ward are designated as CODAN.  The Minister may be aware of that term, but if he is not, it means County Dublin Areas of Need.  They are designated as such because they have upwards of 60 per cent unemployment.  The reality for people living in those situations is that while they receive the social welfare payments or unemployment benefits to which they are entitled, difficulties arise at First Communion or Christmas time. Where people are not in that 60 per cent bracket, I have had to approach the St. Vincent de Paul to ask for help for those who are having serious problems with their mortgages.  That is the reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise that famine is an emotive area.  However, the reality is that people &mdash; I am sure throughout Ireland but I can only refer to suburban parts of Dublin &mdash; are unbelievably deprived and rely heavily on the Society of St. Vincent de Paul for light, heat, a roof over their head and children's clothes.  There <Col N="1426" /> is a high traveller population in the county and they also rely heavily on the Society of St. Vincent de Paul in the County Dublin area.  A group of people will arrive home tomorrow having walked 200 miles for multiple sclerosis. A famine walk will take place in September in aid of St. Francis's Hospice in Raheny.  These organisations must constantly come up with new ideas because people get tired of buying the daffodil or whatever.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the reference to covenants, because if I put a pound in a basket for a lily or a bonnet I am not covenanting a pound.  The bulk of the money raised by these groups comes from the pound in the basket or the direct request from the Irish Red Cross Society to homes.  Those donations are between £1 and £5 and cannot be covenanted. It just will not happen.</P>

It would be very hollow if we were all to come into this Chamber tonight and try to successfully achieve something on the Adjournment which we are not prepared to support in a more tangible way on this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make one final point to the Minister, whom I respect.  He made the point earlier that he makes no apology for coming up with political solutions. He is quite right; we are politicians and that is our job.  This requires a political solution and is as worthy and probably more worthy than the political solution requested by one of the Government parties regarding water charges.  This is more serious and, because we are talking <Col N="1427" /> about charities, I beg the Minister to accept the worthy recommendations from this side of the House.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister for introducing this section and a well balanced budget.  He has taken into account that for the first time tax relief can be given to designated Irish Third World charities.  If a person contributes £750, the charity will benefit to the tune of about £1,027.  The tax relief will go directly to the charity and will not be dealt with by the person.  It is another initiative taken by the Minister and I admire him for it and support him totally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is particularly appropriate that this issue be dealt with in detail in the Seanad because we are, under the Constitution, the law and our mandate, the representatives of this country's vocational and voluntary organisations.  It was specifically provided in the Constitution that because those organisations played such a vital part in society through their caring and active support for all that is best in our community and particularly the needy, the Seanad would have an element of vocational representation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am privileged to have been nominated, as other colleagues were by different organisations, by the Irish Wheelchair Association, which is one of the charities which will be negatively affected, while not deliberately nonetheless directly, by what was originally a well intentioned provision.  It is essential <Col N="1428" /> that we highlight the anomalies and discrimination that arises as a consequence of this provision.  The Irish people do not make any distinction in their care, concern and support for charities wherever they operate.  It is one of the healthiest signs in our community that organisations have from time to time worked without recognition or a full level of support.</P>
    <P>At a time when we worry about social attitudes we can take some degree of comfort and consolation from the obvious spontaneous support of our people for these deserving charities and the people who devote their lives to involvement in them.  Whether it is a Third World, domestic, national or local charity, the response is always immediate and generous.  If the people do not discriminate, it is essential that those of us who represent them as legislators do not discriminate, even unintentionally, in any legislation we pass.  We would not be reflecting the views of the people and we certainly would not be discharging our responsibility.</P>
    <P>I am all for co-ordination and association of charities, but the Minister must have been surprised that as a consequence of section 8 of this Bill, a new national organisation was launched, namely the National Charities of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but why?  The Minister has to ask why and the reason is not what the Minister would want. Co-ordination is fine because the organisations operate in different areas for different purposes with different targets. This was a spontaneous coming together of these organisations to prevent the discrimination they believe will apply, albeit unintentionally, because of this provision.  It is quite extraordinary that as a consequence of the section a national organisation had to be formed to campaign against discrimination against people and organisations which we all admire and respect and which do things which perhaps we do not do as <Col N="1429" /> positively.  I have been privileged from time to time to be associated with some of these organisations, but unfortunately in public life one does not have the opportunity to give the commitment they give voluntarily to great effect.</P>
      <P>This is not meant to be a criticism of the Government.  Social problems are growing and we are reacting to the problem of unmarried mothers, battered wives, unemployment and so on. Are we going to ignore the fact that these organisations must cope, day in day out and night in night out, with urgent calls about problems which unfortunately are almost endemic in our community?  That is where they are. Anyone in contact with the Society of St. Vincent de Paul &mdash; and the others as well, I do not want to discriminate against them &mdash; probably the organisation targeted most directly on poverty and depression, will tell you that the demands on their resources are now greater than ever.  Surely this is not the time to introduce discrimination, unintentional though it may be.  It is even questionable whether a discrimination of this type would be legally defensible. I question that because, in my view, it is not defensible in terms of political actions.</P>
      <P>The people who sent us here, and the public who do not actually vote for us, would expect us to appeal to the Minister. If an unintentional anomaly or discrimination has been introduced, and it is very clear that it has, then it should be eliminated.  It is not reasonable to suggest that you can equalise in covenant what is provided under specific provision in statute.  The two are not the same.  It would give the wrong signal, that is, that there are two levels of State recognition of the worthiness or activity involved, one for those engaged in voluntary organisations overseas and another for those at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I respect the voluntary organisations overseas and I will be visiting a refugee camp next week where they operate.  I was involved in setting up many of their campaign programmes in Africa.  In my <Col N="1430" /> view, there is no justification for this discrimination.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to the points made and in particular to Senator Lee who is right when he says that what the Minister is trying to do this year is relevant.  I am involved in a voluntary organisation, and have been for many years, which collect day in and day out.  Unfortunately, there is a need for voluntary groups now more than ever.  It is a sad reflection on us as a society but it is a fact of life.</P>
      <P>We are even asking voluntary groups to take care of the elderly because we can no longer provide the necessary geriatric health care.  It is also a sad reflection on us that there are fewer nuns and brothers whose commitment to voluntary work down the years has been enormous.</P>
      <P>The Minister recognises what he wants to do and he made it quite clear when he said: &ldquo;If it turns out that I am wrong in this view, there is a mechanism open to us with regard to altering the donations which might derive from the national lottery.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I want to make that point strongly. Many people involved in voluntary organisations are watching the amount of money given every week by the national lottery.  Some £4.3 million was won by a Dublin family the week before last and I congratulate them.  However, we have an opportunity here that we should avail of and we should hold the Minister to it.</P>
      <P>The impression is being given that when you give £100 to one organisation you will get tax relief, but you will not. Somebody else is getting the extra benefit if we donate it to a Third World charity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were very badly off 150 years ago and we got very little help.  We must not forget either that for many years Governments, irrespective of the parties involved, demeaned these organisations and the State's contributions to Third World aid amounted to only a small percentage of GNP.  We are now trying <Col N="1431" /> to get it up to 0.7 per cent which is very welcome.</P>
    <P>I understand how local organisations feel but I would not like to see a divide. Senator O'Kennedy is right in saying that we represent different organisations and that we are elected by them. I appreciate that fact.  It is a feature of both Houses that we can speak on behalf of particular organisations, and it cannot be said that we are lobbying because we are not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is a fact.  The Wheelchair Association will be the subject of a broad discussion later in this House; this discussion is long overdue. Given the number of people confined to wheelchairs here, we should be contributing much more to making life easier for them and we can do so at very little cost.</P>
      <P>I do not want to stray from the point but this year, the 150th anniversary of the Famine, we have an opportunity to do something.  The Minister is sincere about this; if he was not I would say so. He has made a political decision to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Famine.</P>
      <P>Next year we will have an opportunity to do some something if this provision is not working properly on behalf of the national organisations, the voluntary groups, the handicapped and others.  I am directly involved with the handicapped and can speak personally because I have a nephew who is badly handicapped.  I can understand what happens when these people do not receive voluntary assistance from others.  They put a lot more into it than any of us do as politicians.  They are committed in no small way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In future, the Minister should recognise the work of voluntary organisations in all aspects of our society.  He should <Col N="1432" /> look at the amount of money that is being spent every week on the national lottery and he should make sure that more of this money is given to charities, whether as a tax relief nationally or internationally to the Third World.</P>
    <P>Most of the money donated to charity here is collected in baskets, hats or by selling daffodils or other items.  Each contribution amounts to 50p, £1 or £5, not massive sums, and the majority of national charity organisations make do with that.  We do not want to give the wrong impression to the general public who, in comparison with other countries, stand above the rest in making contributions to organisations in need.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Lee's point that the Minister was well motivated and positively disposed in bringing this proposal forward.  The problem that has been created was not anticipated.  The Minister should respond to the fact that Senators on this side of the House find it impossible not to support organisations who feel cut out of this arrangement.</P>
      <P>It is a personal thing for people like myself who are involved in groups like the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and other charities who deal with schools. At different times in this House we have discussed various groups, such as the Simon Community, those dealing with autism, and others and there is a real commitment to them from all sides of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1433" /> This provision is going to produce anomalies, division and confusion and, more importantly, it will be a cause of demotivation for people in Irish-based charities who will feel discouraged and will feel that they have been cast adrift.</P>
    <P>People send their contributions where they feel it will have the maximum impact.  If there is chance that it will mean twice as much to the charity to which they make their donation, it will work to the detriment of charities who do not have objectives abroad.  It will also create confusion for those acting in a dual capacity, not just the Irish Red Cross but refugee agencies.  I am a trustee of an anti-torture trust which deals with people who have suffered in Third World countries.  The people who qualify under the 1967 Finance Act should also be included.</P>

      <P>I want to make sure that we vote on this section.  I have no doubt the Minister is as interested in all the voluntary bodies in our society as I am so I am not scoring any particular point. I am simply making the point that there is a mistake.  The inclusion of this provision in the Finance Bill was good and progressive but it should also apply to domestic charities.  After all, charity begins at home.  The chairwoman of the Red Cross and the chairperson of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul are in the Visitors Gallery.  We all know the good work they and the other groups mentioned in the Schedule do.  I suggest that the Minister's proposition as regards covenanting would not meet the needs of these charities.  I suggest that his undertaking as regards the national lottery, although well meaning, could not meet the same requirements as the legislative provision.</P>

We recognised that it could create some of the difficulties which have arisen but I believe they are exaggerated.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to a comment made by one of the Senator's colleagues. The difference between the Third World and the First World is fundamental; it is quantum in terms of what we are talking about.  Income in Ireland is 50 times that in Rwanda which has no support systems.</P>
      <P>Existing bodies referred to in the Schedule &mdash; I will not be provocative &mdash; include the National Youth Federation which gets over £2 million from the Department of Education and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul which got £1,055 million from the Vote of the Department of Social Welfare in 1994.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It could get a lot more, but I am talking about relative comparisons. The present pitch is uneven.  The national lottery cannot give money to Third World charities.  There are already distortions &mdash; if one wants to use that word &mdash; in the existing system.</P>
      <P>No more than anyone else in the House, I recognise the validity of all the charitable work being done.  I have proposed that a contribution of between £200 and £750 will qualify.  Anything below that does not get into this system so the type of impulse donation to which Senator McGennis referred is not affected.  A person will have to make a conscious decision to make a standing order or to write a cheque to an organisation which will take their cheque and RSI number, which will be fed on line to the Revenue Commissioners.  If a person gives the maximum amount of £750, the Revenue Commissioners will deduct from the total tax paid from that person's income tax payment into the central fund a sum of £250 which will be grossed up and remitted to the recipient organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1435" /> There is no marketing benefit for a person giving money to a Third World organisation as against a First World one, if I can call it that.  A person is no better off because the £250 cheque does not give them a rebate on their tax; it gives extra money to Third World charities. To use a phrase which Senator Lee used, there is a bigger bang for the buck. I am deliberately giving a bigger bang for the buck given to Third World charities because it is self-evident that they need it.</P>
    <P>The organisations listed in the Schedule, for example, Barnardos, which will get £45,000 and the Alzheimer's Society of Ireland, which will get £44,000, never get enough, but they do get taxpayers' money at present.  I am trying to construct a relationship between citizens in the year of the 150th anniversary of the Famine to take on a type of personal citizen identification with Third World calamities and deprivation.  No matter how desperate the situation is in a family with a handicapped child or with an elderly parent with Alzheimer's or the deprivation to which Senator McGennis referred, this is real.  Poverty is relative and on a scale of magnitude it does not compare with the type of problems we are talking about.</P>
    <P>I am trying to construct a relationship where citizens will feel that they have a responsibility and a possibility of making a contribution. To address a point made by Senator Lee, we have structured it in a way so that money transferred in this manner &mdash; it has been carefully designed to so qualify &mdash; will be seen as additional parts of Ireland's contribution under the ODA provisions of the United Nations so that it will qualify for assistance to Third World countries.  That is why it is the OECD group and not areas of tragedy like, for example, Sakhalin, in the former Soviet Union.  We are way off our target of 0.7 per cent of GNP in contributions to Third World countries.  We have contributed less than half that target at present.  This is a way to recognise the partnership between Government, taxpayers' <Col N="1436" /> donations given in the normal way and citizens, which are volunteered through this system.  It is a voluntary system, but at least we recognise &mdash; I do not suggest that we substitute &mdash; that the value of this will be perceived as additional and it will be quantified.</P>

      <P>This section empowers the Revenue Commissioners to add potentially all tobacco products to the categories where they may remit or repay duty paid on tax stamps which are destroyed, damaged or defective.  It also allows for the extension to such products of new provisions for payment arrangements for tobacco tax stamps and for consequent longer deferment arrangements so the point of liability will now be earlier.</P>
      <P>The present arrangement for these products requires payment of duty no later than the last day of the month following the release from the warehouse. In essence what we are doing is closing a loophole of excise payment where we now have tobacco tax stamps on cigarettes sold on the street and we are adding that to loose tobacco or roll-your-own tobacco.</P>

      <P>This is a restoration of powers.  The House may recall there was a court case last year concerning some of the powers deemed to be vested in the Revenue Commissioners and Customs and Excise service following the removal of the customs barriers consequent on the completion of the Internal Market.  Whereas previously one had customs barriers on the frontier with all these powers, it was necessary to extend these powers across the country where Customs and Excise officers in the course of their duty felt they had reason to believe there was contraband or smuggling taking place.  These powers are being reinstated.</P>
      <P>A legal doubt was cast on their operational and constitutional validity and they are being restated to put them beyond any legal doubt.  By and large, they are a restoration of the existing powers introduced in the Finance Act, 1992.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This section sets out the powers of the Revenue Commissioners to deal with goods or vehicles seized in the time before they were condemned.  These include delivery to the claimant against appropriate payment and a procedure for dealing with anything seized which might be of a perishable nature and cannot be stored.  In the event of court proceedings establishing that anything seized is not liable to forfeiture but has already been disposed of, the section provides for reimbursement to the claimant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been complaints that goods have been seized and disposed of without adequate notice being given to the claimant which would enable them to have sufficient time to claim or examine the condition of the goods.</P>
      <P>In some cases cars have been seized and offered for sale and people had claimed they were entitled to import the cars under the transfer of residence provisions. Pending clarification or a final decision in some of these cases the properties were sold by the Revenue Commissioners expeditiously and sufficient time was not available to lodge objections or claims.  People found that property which they may well have decided not to import had been disposed of before they had the opportunity of a full examination of their application for the transfer of residence provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1442" /> How is this section changing what was already in place?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is largely a reinstatement of what was in place but with some modifications.  Section 94 (2) requires that where a seized item found not liable to forfeiture by a court cannot be restored to its owner the Revenue Commissioners must, under paragraph (a), refund any amount paid under section 94 (1) (a) or, under paragraph (b), pay over the proceeds of any sale or, under paragraph (c), if the item seized has been destroyed, refund its market value.</P>
      <P>I am not sure if that addresses the Senator's concern.  He was saying that a good may be seized and sold before the owner of the good has a chance to repossess it, reclaim it or send it back. If the Senator has any specific cases in mind we could try to address them and learn from them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, most of these cases are to do with public houses. At the weekend a person in business, who imported a Mercedes, complained to me that, because he had a residence here and in the United Kingdom, he was entitled to transfer his car back, but he did not have sufficient opportunity to make the necessary inquiries under the transfer of residence provision.  I am pleased the Minister is interested in this area and I will deal directly with him when I get the full details.  Is the Minister making specific changes to the existing legislation and are the new sections necessary?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are restating what we said before, but we are putting it beyond any legal doubt, which the court case had cast upon the provision.  There are no additional powers.  We are restating, beyond any legal doubt, provisions of the 1992 Act which were deemed to be open to challenge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The complaint is that the powers are already too extensive and that there was insufficient opportunity for people to have their cases examined, <Col N="1443" /> especially if, under the transfer of residence provision there was doubt about entitlement to bring the goods in.  I am referring mainly to cars and other items, for example, cameras, which are seized at airports.</P>

      <P>Last night during the Second Stage debate I mentioned this new provision which I welcome.  I appreciate that the Minister had discussions with the motor industry before this provision of £1,000 was introduced for ten year old cars.  Many people have expressed the fear that the £1,000 will be transferred to the price of a new car and that it will be the same as the housing grant.  There was always a claim that the benefit of that grant was not passed on to the consumer.  The Minister indicated last night that he hoped to pay the £1,000 directly to the person involved, which would avoid the use of that money in the dealing arrangements.  Is the Minister satisfied that this benefit will go to the person who is entitled to get it and that it will not be lost in the maze of transactions and deals for cars? I do not propose to become involved in the second hand car business because there is no expertise on that market available in this House.</P>

There have <Col N="1444" /> been complaints that some of them do not meet the description specified in the transactions and that they are a combination of two or three cars.  There is widespread anxiety about this business. It would help if the Minister could shed some light on how he proposes to deal with this issue under this section.</P>

      <P>I concur with Senator Daly on this issue.  I hope the consumer benefits directly from the £1,000.  Yesterday the Minister outlined how the scheme would operate.  The explanatory memorandum states that the scheme will operate from 1 July 1995 until 31 December 1996.  Does this mean it will stop after 1996 and that it will not operate in 1997?</P>

If a car is more than ten years old and is worth more than £1,000 and its owner decides to trade it in for £2,000, will the garage owner benefit?  We must not allow such a situation to develop.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It might help Members if I read my briefing note.  The Society of the Irish Motor Industry, the organisation representing dealers, the Revenue Commissioners and officials in the Department of Finance, covered all the possible loopholes which the ingenuity of the Irish psyche is capable of identifying and then driving a coach and four through.  That was where we started from and I will not explain how it will function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (1) provides that the Revenue Commissioners may make a VRT repayment of £1,000 to any person &mdash; I ask the House to bear with me in <Col N="1445" /> relation to this &mdash; who buys a new vehicle in category A, which includes cars.  The repayment of the £1,000 is conditional on the following conditions being met.  First, the new vehicle must be registered for the first time during the period from 1 July 1995 to 1 December 1996; that would exclude second hand cars coming from the United Kingdom or elsewhere.  Second, the person claiming the repayment must be the first registered owner of the new vehicle; in other words, they cannot have bought it the week before.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be the first registered owner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come back to the Senator on that point.  The person buying must be the first owner.  That is a double jeopardy clause to get rid of the possibility that not only is the car being registered for the first time, but the person must be the first owner of the new car.  Third, the same person must be the owner of another category A vehicle which must be scrapped within one month from the date of the first registration of the new vehicle.  Fourth, the scrapped vehicle must be not less than ten years old at the time it is scrapped. Fifth, the scrapped vehicle must be taxed and insured during the two year period immediately prior to it being scrapped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (2) provides that the subsection (1)(e) condition &mdash; the last one I mentioned &mdash; need not be complied with where any period or periods during which the vehicle was not taxed in the two years before scrapping does not exceed six months and where the purchaser can produce a written declaration made before a member of the Garda Síochána that the vehicle was not used during that period.  The car, however, must be taxed and insured on the day it was scrapped.  In essence, therefore, it must be a new car, it must be the first time owner applying for the benefit and the cars to be scrapped must clearly be their cars and must clearly have been in their ownership for a period <Col N="1446" /> of not less than two years.  Prior to that, it must have been taxed and insured.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is ownership to be in the name of the person for two years?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (3) places a requirement on the person who receives a repayment not to dispose of the new vehicle until at least six months have elapsed from the date of its first registration. If this requirement is breached the person who receives the repayment must reimburse the Revenue Commissioners. There can be no short term windfall gain.  One must hold on to the new car for a period of six months.</P>

      <P>Subsection (4) empowers the Revenue Commissioners to recover the repayment in the event of non-compliance with the requirement provided for in subsection (3), and the subsection defines the terms &ldquo;new&rdquo; and &ldquo;scrapped&rdquo;.  Section 98 also amends section 141 of the Finance Act, 1992, to empower the Revenue Commissioners to make regulations governing the operation and the repayment scheme provided for in the new section 135.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's remarks.  The idea is excellent.  The car must be ten years old, but the vast majority of cars are less than ten years old.  There are cars that are more than ten year old that are worth more than £1,000.  A person who owns such a car will hold onto it for longer than ten years, say for 12 years, until its value is reduced accordingly and he can avail of the benefit.  Take a person with a car worth £2,000 and which is over ten years <Col N="1447" /> old.  He decides to trade it in at a garage which, more than anything else, wants to make money.  The garage buys the car and the transfer of ownership goes from the owner to the garage.  As a company, the garage can consider that the car was insured and taxed for two years previously, it can hold the car for another month and advise another prospective customer that it has a car which is over ten year old and if he exchanges his five year car for the older car he can then trade it for a new car.  He will then gain a benefit of £1,000, but the garage will have gained a similar benefit in the meantime.  Will the Minister clarify this point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a technical matter. I believe that the answer is no, but I will obtain confirmation of the position.  It is a fair question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to protect the car owner.  We want safer cars on our roads and we want every benefit to be given to those who have older cars which might be in very good condition. They should receive the benefit of the £1,000.  I appreciate that the payment should be made directly to the car owner, but the situation could easily arise that if the car is traded in for more than £1,000 the benefit could go to the new owner of the car, which could be the garage, the second hand car owner or somebody else.  The Minister should close this loophole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the stipulations in the proposal, it would be easier to win the lotto than obtain a cheque for £1,000.  Can the Minister give an indication, in the discussions he had with SIMI, of the likely level of activity and how much it will cost?  What provision is the Minister making for this for the coming year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there a salvage value on the car?  If, for example, a car worth £1,500 is traded in, the seller buys a new car and complies with the criteria, presumably <Col N="1448" /> he obtains £1,000 from the Revenue Commissioners or whoever. Where can he obtain the extra £500?  Is the car dismantled?  Does it ever go on the road again?  Is it scrapped and, if so, does the garage owner make good the extra £500 that the car is worth?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The details of the scheme are being worked out in final form between Revenue and SIMI, based on similar schemes that operated in France and Denmark.  Three conditions apply.  A person must have a ten year old car or an older car.  He or she must have owned, taxed and insured it for road use for at least two years, must buy a new car and must arrange to have the old car scrapped.  In those three circumstances coming together one may apply to the Revenue Commissioners for £1,000 VRT repayment.</P>
      <P>To claim a repayment applicants will have to undertake the following steps. In the first instance, they must make a written application to the Revenue Repayments Office in Monaghan on a form which will be prescribed in the Revenue Commissioners' regulations. Second, they must enclose with the application the following documentation in respect of the car to be scrapped: the current tax disc, the certificate of insurance and the log book. In addition, they must enclose a certificate, to be prescribed, to the effect that the engine and the chassis of the vehicle have been destroyed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the car was not taxed for periods which do not exceed a total of six months during the previous two year period before the car was scrapped, a written statement made before a member of the Garda Síochána and stamped with the appropriate Garda stamp must be enclosed with the application. However, the car must have been taxed and insured on the date that it is scrapped.  If there is a gap in the preceding two year period and one can satisfy the gardaí &mdash; as we have all done on occasions to get insurance and so on &mdash; that the gap can be closed, but on the date the car is to be scrapped it must be <Col N="1449" /> taxed and insured.  All applications will be dealt with by the VRT repayments office in Monaghan which will send the repayment to the applicant, the car owner, that is, to the purchaser of the new car who had disposed of the old car, not the motor car dealer.  Claimants whose applications are in order should receive their cheques within one month of the date on which the applications are received in Monaghan.  A person who receives a repayment will be required not to dispose of the new car before six months have elapsed from the date of its first registration.  I thought this measure would be a &ldquo;win win&rdquo;, but my officials reckon it will be a &ldquo;draw draw&rdquo;.  According to our best estimates, it will be revenue neutral.  We do not know how well it will work.</P>

      <P>We had a long discussion on the Free Legal Aid Bill last week. On that occasion, an attempt was made to extend the provision of free legal aid to cover social welfare appeals and appeals to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  There was a long discussion and I do not wish to repeat what was said.  However, the appeals bodies have the benefit of professional help and advice in a complex area.  That would not be available to the ordinary individual who has a grievance or complaint <Col N="1455" /> and who might have to employ expensive advice to deal with the appeal in a reasonable manner.  Would it be the intention to make any allowance for the cost of professional help in dealing with such appeals through the free legal aid system?  Would free legal aid apply to this?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If one were to offer free legal aid or the prospect of it there would be an army of lawyers kicking in the door trying to get a bit of the action. I saw that happen in planning appeals. When they were first set up there was no need for a legal presence because the points being argued were not points of law to be argued in an adversarial sense. It was a more consensual process to arrive at an agreed compromise.  When I was practising as an architect I had to put the words into the mouth of a much higher paid lawyer who then tried to regurgitate the argument in a confrontational and adversarial manner.  That is the culture of the courts system.</P>
      <P>The Employment Appeals Tribunal was designed to avoid that type of confrontational system but over time, because lawyers have become involved and have started to charge fees, the basis of that culture has been legalised in the pejorative rather than the constitutional sense of the word.  As public representatives.  Members will have assisted at social welfare appeals and the last thing any of us would want is to have lawyers at such appeals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a matter such as this, where there is a dispute about a matter of fact, one is simply arguing figures.  To involve lawyers or to provide free legal aid in such cases would be an invitation to lawyers to get involved in this type of activity.  It would undermine the spirit of <Col N="1456" /> what we are trying to do and would not be in the best interests of the citizen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The counter argument is that the people on the appeals bodies have the best possible professional advice available to them to deal with complex areas.  Genuine people who do not have such advice available to them are at a disadvantage in their appeals.  I do not agree with the extension of legal involvement to planning matters and other areas.  However, that is the reality of the marketplace at present.  I want to ensure that, in this section, we will have reasonably satisfactory and responsible procedures so that people going to such appeals will not be at a disadvantage because the technical and professional expertise that is available to the appeals personnel will not be available to them.</P>

      <P>Indeed, we should curtail such involvement.  However, I understand Senator Daly's sentiments.  We should try in this provision to give benefits to the person who is making the appeal.  Few people wish to go before the Revenue Commissioners with an appeal; indeed, few people want to go before the Revenue Commissioners at all.  They would much prefer not to deal with them.  That is why we should take every opportunity to simplify matters; these matters are being simplified now. Business people are getting the message that if they keep their houses in order they can be quite comfortable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, some people can be nervous about going to an appeal.  Would it be possible to issue a leaflet to such people which states clearly what the appeal is about, what questions will be asked and so forth, so that they will know how they should act before they sit at a table with well trained people? <Col N="1457" /> It is similar to me sitting before an architect &mdash; he can tell me how the wall is built, I cannot.

      <P>When the budget is being prepared there is a table which shows the yield of each increase on cigarettes. The Senator is familiar with the law of diminishing returns, which is based on patterns of consumption and behaviour.  The higher the price increase, the lower the net gain.  When one increases tax by a substantial amount, there is a point at which one gets less additional revenue than if one was to increase tax by a smaller amount and not negatively disrupt the pattern of sales.  There is a fine balance.  It is based on patterns of consumption which can only be tracked by sales volumes, which in turn can only be tracked by excise duties.

      <P>I asked the question because various Ministers for Health over the last number of years held the view that people should not smoke. Given the revenue aspect of this, how does the Minister for Finance square this circle with the Minister for Health? The presumption is that the more the Minister for Finance puts on 20 cigarettes, the less people will smoke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, the Department of Finance is looking at this from a completely different point of view from the Department of Health.  If they increase excise duty on cigarettes to <Col N="1460" /> such an extent that the number of people smoking is reduced, revenue to the Department of Finance is also reduced.  This country spends something in the region of £730 million a year on smoking, which is about one third of what is spent on health.</P>
      <P>Last year cigarette smoking increased in this country for the first time in 20 years.  It is worrying because smoking damages people's health.  Cardiovascular disease, which accounts for a huge number of deaths in this country, can be attributed directly to smoking.  Last year figures produced by ASH showed that the number of people who died from smoking was six times greater than the number of people who died from road traffic accidents, AIDS, accidents in the home and other diseases and causes of death.  It may be that the Government is more addicted to the revenue it is getting from cigarettes than the smokers are to the cigarettes themselves.</P>
      <P>We should discourage people from smoking.  Perhaps if we try to increase the cost of cigarettes and the excise duty, it will ultimately reduce the number of people smoking.  It would affect the Revenue coffers but this would be greatly compensated for on the health side.</P>

      <P>I will answer the first question as I did not have the information to hand earlier.  We have tracking <Col N="1461" /> figures between projected and actual income.  The forecast for this year on a monthly basis was that by the end of April, tobacco revenue would amount to £134.3 million.  It actually amounts to £132.1 million, which is a variation in percentage terms of minus 1.6 per cent. That is neither here nor there and there is no indication that there is any impact on production or consumption.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator from the observant city of Cork indicates to me that it might be attributed to Lent. There are figures which might be of interest to the House which state that consumption of cigarettes fell by 26 per cent between 1980 and 1988.  The fall was due to a combination of factors including public concern about health risks posed by cigarette smoking and the relatively high level of taxation. Between 1989 and 1991, however, consumption grew by 11 per cent.  This was helped no doubt by the absence of a duty increase in the 1990 Budget and lowering of the standard rate of VAT during this period.  Following successive reductions in 1992 and 1993 of 4.5 and 4 per cent respectively cigarette consumption grew by 3.9 per cent, but with the return of The Labour Party to Government that has now been reversed.  I jest.</P>

The CPI is an average of what people consume and includes alcohol, even though not all people drink.</P>

The Minister, however, made an important point about the consumer price index.  Looking at the annual inflation rate, if only a percentage of our people are smoking it can be argued that tobacco should not be recognised on the consumer index levels because not everyone smokes.  It cannot, therefore, be recognised in the same way as food and shoes which, unlike cigarettes, everybody has to have.</P>

Section 65 of the Irish Horseracing Industry Act provides that the Revenue Commissioners, on application to them by the executive of a racecourse authorised by the Irish Horseracing Authority, may grant to the executive, or a person authorised by the executive, a licence for the sale of intoxicating liquor for consumption at the racecourse or, in due course, a renewal of such licence.

      <P>Does that relate to the idea, with which I totally agree, that we should allow on-course betting?  In the last six months there was an experiment at Leopardstown where on-course betting was allowed on the track.  Without going into names, one particular company <Col N="1465" /> had an on-track facility there.  I welcome that and I would like to see it encouraged.  It was an idea that, unfortunately, they decided to do away with at the time, but it was brought back under the Irish Horseracing Authority. It is in the interests of the consumer and the Revenue.  As I read that section, it relates to somebody betting on events outside the race meeting itself in the on-course bookie facility.  Is that what we are talking about?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Not being a racegoer I will refer to the actual note itself, which is quite explicit, rather than trying to summarise this.  The section makes a technical amendment to section 89 of the Finance Act, 1994, which provided for an exemption from betting duty on bets placed on course at a horse race meeting relating to events taking place elsewhere.  The purpose of the amendment is to restrict the exemption to racecourses authorised by the new Irish Horseracing Authority, which was established by ministerial order on 1 December 1994.  It was not possible in the 1994 Finance Act to restrict the exemption to such authorised racecourses, as the Irish Horseracing Authority was not established until after the passing of the 1994 Finance Act.  The section also clarifies that the exemption in question does not apply to bets entered into by any means of telecommunications. This section has effect from the passing of this Act.</P>

      <P>As the Senator has rightly anticipated, this makes a number of technical amendments to section 43 of the 1975 Finance Act which deals with gaming machine licence duty, not the legalisation or the licensing of gaming machines as such.  The purpose of the amendments is to make it an offence to have gaming machines available for play in a public place, as defined, without displaying a gaming machine licence as provided for in section 43 of the 1975 Act, and to extend officers' existing powers of entry, inspection and seizure in relation to gaming machines to include such public places.  At present it is an offence to make gaming machines available for play without displaying a gaming machine licence only in respect of premises licensed for gaming on foot of a District Court certificate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move recommendation No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 166. before section 131, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1468" />&ldquo;131.&mdash;As and from 1st July, 1995, the rate of VAT on newspapers and magazines shall be 5 per cent.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The rate of VAT on newspapers and magazines is 12.5 per cent, which is the highest rate in the EU.  Britain, our nearest neighbour, has zerorated VAT on newspapers.  As we are all aware, the newspaper industry is in a vulnerable situation at the moment.  It provides a lot of employment and some of our newspapers are literally on their knees. I noticed, on Committee Stage in the Dáil, that the Minister said State aid may be available for a state of the art printing process for the newspaper industry.  I noticed the various newspapers are divided as to whether this would be acceptable.  The Progressive Democrats would not support State aid to a state of the art printing process. £15.5 million in VAT is collected from newspapers annually and a VAT reduction would make a huge difference to the industry and would greatly improve the fortunes of many newspapers.</P>
    <P>I realise imported British newspapers pay VAT, but as a proportion of the total costs of these newspapers, the VAT on the small numbers of papers coming into this country in relation to their total sales has a small effect compared to that of a high rate of 12.5 per cent VAT on Irish newspapers.  I ask the Minister to consider reducing the rate of VAT.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Honan's proposal.  Her arguments are so self-evidently sensible that I think it is something we need to address.  The whole issue of VAT on newspapers and magazines has been a thorny one.  We need to do something.  I am sure the Minister, given the present hiatus in the <i>Irish Press,</i> is as concerned as the rest of us are on this matter.  I rise simply to record my support for the proposition. It makes sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the genuine and positive reasons why this <Col N="1469" /> recommendation or proposed addendum is being put forward and supported but I am not in a position to accept for the following reasons.  There would be a lost of revenue on an ongoing basis of the order of £13 million if magazines are excluded.  I do not think that is the intent of the recommendation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that in respect of both?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  For newspapers alone.  It is approximately £15 million for both magazines and newspapers combined.  The benefits to the newspaper industry in Ireland, which clearly is going through a difficult period, would be negligible in our view.  The newspapers would not get the benefit of it.  It would simply lower the face price of the newspapers unilaterally across the board.  Therefore, it would not confer any price advantage on a British tabloid newspaper as against an Irish newspaper. The reduction in the cover price of a tabloid selling at 25p or 30p would be less, as a percentage, in real terms than it would be for something selling at 85p; but there is no indication to suggest, from all market price theory and commonsense combined, that this would alter significantly the market share of any of the newspapers <i>vis-a-vis</i> the British tabloids, which is part and parcel of the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are bigger and wider issues.  We had a fairly extensive discussion and it became more of a discussion than a debate on Committee Stage in the other House.  At that time I offered a view, which was slightly firmed up by some of the newspaper commentary.  If people wish, they can go back and look at what I actually said.  I said that part of the problem in my estimation, from my experience as Minister for Enterprise and Employment and from some of the information I received there, was the structure of the Irish industry including its internal costs.  I was offering a personal opinion which I repeat now.  Some of these related to printing among some, but not all, of the newspapers.  It is a matter for the industry in the first <Col N="1470" /> instance.  If the newspaper industry was prepared and in a position to come to the Government with a proposal that would address those cost issues, given the cultural and political role newspapers have to play in our society as well as the economic role, I felt any Government would look at it.  Indeed, the previous Government was prepared to look sympathetically at such a proposal if it had broad industry support &mdash; not just because of the total number of jobs involved, although that clearly would be a factor, but because of the wider political and cultural issues.</P>
    <P>We have a unique problem in the Republic of Ireland.  It is unique to the whole of the EU.  In Belgium, as colleagues are aware, which is partially a francophone country, there is no penetration to any extent of French daily newspapers.  In multi-lingual societies like Switzerland, one seldom sees penetration of national French daily newspapers. Our difficulties are unique. They will probably be compounded and I am not sure what the answer to it is.  I can say in the context of this particular proposal that the abolition of VAT on newspapers is not an answer.  We would lose the revenue and I do not think it would have the desired effect.  I say this in the full knowledge that as I speak there is a potentially disastrous situation in the <i>Irish Press</i> Group.  I hope the talks that are about to resume between management and the workforce will be positive and will resolve the dispute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister.  We all share his sentiments that the <i>Irish Press</i> dispute be resolved as speedily as possible.  The newspapers have lobbied for a VAT reduction because they see a difference in price between British and Irish newspapers.  There is quite a substantial difference.  It is quite a shock to see how cheap British newspapers are compared to Irish newspapers and the huge penetration of British newspapers into the Irish market that has occurred. The industry itself feels a VAT reduction would be beneficial.  I hear what the Minister is saying but they feel <Col N="1471" /> the reduction of VAT to 5 per cent would make a sizeable difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the logic in everything the Minister said.  I always wondered at the argument that has been made about VAT.  I know the Minister has been concerned about this not only in this Administration but also during the last Administration.  Can some thought be given to further encouragement to reducing the cost structures of the Irish national newspapers?  The argument has been made, and was fostered by the Minister and his predecessor during the last administration, that there should be some joint pooling of costs, particularly on the printing end. It makes such eminent good sense.  I wonder could the Minister's use his good offices' to propel the newspaper proprietors in that direction.  It seems there is great validity in the arguments the Minister put forward, notwithstanding the fact that I supported the recommendation. Given the cost of £13 million to the Exchequer of surrendering the VAT, perhaps a more appropriate way might be to plough some element of that into assisting the reduction of cost structures.  I rise to encourage the Minister.  I know he does not need encouragement because it is an active issue in his mind that we should try, at the highest level in the State, to encourage our newspaper industry to come together and show a little more sense than they have done in the past.  They must realise that, in addition to good management, we need good work practices and action on cost structures to save the Irish newspaper industry.  The saving of the industry is in management's hands, particularly down on Burgh Quay.  I was more than surprised at the attitude of management there but that is a debate for a different day.</P>

      <P>I share the sentiments expressed by everyone here in relation to the <i>Irish Press.</i>  I hope a solution can be found shortly to that dispute.  I have to agree with the Minister that reducing <Col N="1472" /> the VAT rate would not be the answer to all of the problems in the newspaper industry.  We must remember that with the bringing of local and community radio on stream, they are all pulling out of the one cake.  They are all fighting for the same business.  By reducing the VAT rate it is reduced for all the competing papers and radio stations.  I agree with the Minister that reducing the VAT rate is not the answer to the problem. He must consider competition, although it is healthy.</P>

      <P>I will respond very quickly to the points raised by Senator Roche.  We do have a problem.  Frankly, I am not sure what the solution to it is, but the solution can only emerge in part from the industry itself and all sides of that industry.  There is both a commercial dimension and, as I said earlier on, a political and cultural dimension to it. There are different ways in which that could be addressed; but unless there is agreement, broadly shared by everybody, as to the way forward, then clearly the Government cannot move. The production costs are part of the problem.  The market size, in terms of economies of scale, is a big problem as well.  A broadsheet in Britain such as <i>The Independent</i> would have a circulation of around 200,000 to 300,000.  It is now in trouble because of the price war that is going on over there.  The tabloids &mdash; we do not have anything akin to them here except for <i>The Star</i>&mdash; have a circulation of 1,000,000 plus, whereas <i>The Irish Press's</i> circulation was something in the order of 50,000 at the last count.  The sheer production economies of scale are frightening when you compare those two kinds.  The set up costs, the journalists's costs and the printing costs, other than the paper, are similar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a complex area and I want to convey clearly &mdash; and it is shared on all sides of this House &mdash; that there is no opposition in principle to some form of productive State assistance to the newspaper industry because it is part of the national institution.  It is, self-evidently, the fourth estate.  I am not sure how we <Col N="1473" /> can provide and deliver assistance in a manner that does not compromise the independence of the newspapers and does not cut across commonsense grounds of commerciality.  We would have to see, in the first instance, what the industry itself was going to propose. I have to acknowledge that I do not have direct responsibility in this area, but clearly the Government collectively has.  My colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, has attempted to address that issue by having a forum, chaired by an eminent journalist, to try and tease out from the professionals answers to the very questions I have posed.</P>

      <P>Subsection (b) withdraws exemptions from golf clubs where green fees are being collected.  I have never been on a golf course except to use it as a short cut and I have no particular interest in golf courses.  There is now quite an amount of involvement by local communities in the provision of extensions to existing golf clubs where the conditions for membership have been changed in order to avail of European Union funding.  It seems to be contradictory to grant EU funding to a number of golf courses in order to enhance our tourism product and now find that exemptions are being withdrawn.  Many clubs are barely ticking over.  They are not in any situation where they could reasonably be expected at this stage to make any major contribution towards taxation.  I would not disagree in principle with this move at a later stage.  We are endeavouring to develop a product that we have been short of in the market, especially in the tourism market, and some of the green fees coming in are subsidising the provision of services. Golf is no longer an elite sport; a sizeable number of people are now involved in clubs of some shape or form.  It seems to be contradictory to be, on one hand, providing EU support and funding to enhance the prospect of getting new facilities provided and, on the other hand, withdrawing the exemptions.</P>

Subsection (b) withdraws <Col N="1475" /> exemptions from golf courses and I can see what the Minister is getting at in this.  It only applies to golf courses that take in over £20,000 annually in green fees.  The majority of member-orientated courses would not be taking in £20,000 in green fees.  The Minister is hitting at the bigger golf courses which are mainly geared towards green fees.</P>

      <P>This measure has been introduced in the interest of equity and not as a revenue generating measure because, as Senator Burke has mentioned, there are some large member-owned golf courses, one of which in the southwest has over £1 million in green fees income.  That is far and away the exception, but that can be the scale of revenue we are talking about.</P>
      <P>I will address the issue Senator Daly referred to.  One of the reasons this measure is being brought in is because of a distortion of competition between commercially developed golf courses &mdash; and I welcome the development of such facilities as it reinforces the tourism infrastructure of the country &mdash; where people have taken out loans, raised capital or put in their own money and every game of golf played on such a course is subject to a VAT charge, and a members only course where the capital development cost has long since been repaid and the fee income from nonmembers is in excess of £20,000, which would suggest an active volume of external participants.  In those instances in the interests of equity, because they tend to be located in similar regions, they should be eligible for VAT.  If they run a bar, as most golf clubs do, they are paying VAT and excise duties anyway and they have a professional manager.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had an extended and substantial debate on this matter on Committee Stage in the other House and a suggestion was made as regards the category of golf course to which Senator Daly referred where the community was raising money to develop and enhance the facilities of the golf course and was <Col N="1476" /> using green-fees to fund this.  There is no reason that type of golf course could not reconstitute itself.  It could register itself as a company for VAT in every sense of the word so that it would have an income attracting a VAT charge but would also have outgoings which would have VAT and it would be able to trade one VAT against the other.  That is the way to deal with that problem.</P>
    <P>If the club in question has an income from green-fees which is over £20,000 and is likely to start to attract VAT on those fees, it should get good tax advice and reconstitute the operation so that its development is as tax efficient as possible within the context of the law.  There is a way of redressing the problem to which Senator Daly referred.</P>
    <P>This is an equity measure because there was a distortion between commercially developed golf courses, which we welcome, and others.  In some cases State funding has been invested in the development of these golf courses and it does not make sense for that type of investment to be eligible for VAT on all the activities whereas down the road a well established golf course could have an income of over £20,000 per year which tax&mdash;&mdash;</P>

At a time when we are only in a position to grant social welfare recipients an increase of 2.5 per cent, the lowest increase in 30 years and which will be below the target rate of inflation in real terms, section 142 and the apparent generosity to the banks would require some explanation from the Minister.  It struck me and many others that when we are being parsimonious with people who live on limited fixed incomes, we seem to be excessively generous to the banks.  I do not believe the banks deserve or require any special generosity in the Finance Bill.  I believe they now operating in consort and are in effect an impediment to progress.

      <P>I support Senator Roche. Originally, there was a furore that the State was providing security services for banks in the trans-shipment of money. Part of the reason for the introduction of that levy was to offset the cost to the State of providing security through the Garda Síochána and the Army for the transfer of money, which should be the responsibility of the banks.  It was an effort to find a way in which some allowance could be made to the taxpayer and the Exchequer for the provision of these security services.  The State still carries the cost of heavy security for banks in the shipment and trans-shipment of money.  At a time when banks are making substantial profits, they are entitled to make a contribution to the Exchequer for the services which the taxpayer provides in the carriage of their funds.  I have worked for 32 years in a permanent position, but I would have been as well off if I had gone into the bank on day one and said I would work for nothing for the rest of my life because I have being paying them back since.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It was brought in because under section 84 and a lot of other shelters banks were paying virtually no tax.  From 1992 they were allowed to offset the bank levy against corporation tax.  To answer Senator Roche's question, there is not loss of revenue.  We brought this in as a levy and the banks took offence.  We agreed to take off the levy over three phases &mdash; it will be phased out over four years and will be zero in the last year &mdash; in return <Col N="1479" /> for which they promised to make good the cash flow so that we do not even have a cash flow loss because they will pay up front the £12 million which would otherwise be due.  I referred to that on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>In addition the banks have undertaken to enter into detailed discussions with the Department of Finance about how they can be more supportive to small and medium sized industries and enterprises in general.  We have no reason to doubt their sincerity in that regard.  We can always return to the levy and make it an additional one on top of corporation tax if we believe that the banks are not performing or making the necessary contribution.  I am prepared to take them on good faith at the outset, but if it does not manifest itself then the Government and the Oireachtas have other options.  As regards security, three-quarters of the cost of the security independent of the levy is paid for by the banks.</P>

      <P>I am pleased the Minister said that, in the event of the banks coming up with some creative ways of dogging their tax liabilities, he will come back to them.  I believe the original levy was introduced by a Minister for Finance at the end of a long period when successive Ministers had been defeated in their efforts to bring the banks in. The banks still do not pay anything like their due amount in taxation to the State.  They have been the most extraordinarily adroit group of institutions at avoiding their tax liabilities.  I know the Minister, privately if not wearing his official hat, would agree with me on that.  We are dealing with something which is so bizarre and anomalous that we introduced a levy which we are removing because the banks promised to stop being clever with the tax system.</P>

If one receives shares in a company by way of capital acquisitions and one is liable to capital acquisitions tax on the shares, the portion of the value of the shares which can be directly attributed to the heritage component of the overall enterprise is exempt.

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Chapter IV of Part I of the Finance Act, 1986, provided for a retention tax on interest paid or credited by financial institutions.  Financial institutions are obliged to deduct the tax, known as DIRT, at the standard rate when paying or crediting interest on relevant deposits.  A relevant deposit <Col N="1482" /> includes most deposits with the main financial institutions but excludes any deposit in the beneficial ownership of a person not ordinarily resident in the State.  Interest on such deposits was, therefore, paid on a gross basis.  In other words, there was no DIRT deducted from non-resident accounts.</P>
      <P>The 1994 Finance Act introduced a new definition of ordinary residence. The concept of ordinary residence is concerned with a person's habitual pattern of life.  Prior to the 1994 change, ordinary residence could in certain circumstances commence on the date of arrival in the State and cease on the date of departure.  However, since the 1994 Act ordinary residence is only acquired following three consecutive years of residence in the State.  Likewise, it is only shed following three consecutive years of non-residence.</P>
      <P>This has made the practical application of the law in relation to DIRT in this area somewhat anomalous.  For instance, persons coming to live in the State can arrive here and be resident here for up to three years before becoming ordinarily resident and thus liable to DIRT.  Likewise, Irish individuals going to live abroad cannot open a DIRT free account until they have lost their ordinarily resident status by being abroad for three years.  The section provides that in future non-residence instead of non ordinary residence will be the criterion used for exemption for DIRT.  It is a harmonisation of residential tax criteria from other tax legislation.</P>

      <P>In reply to Senator Roche, I suspect not, but this will become clearer when I elaborate on my speaking note.  Senator Daly is correct that it is designed to further encourage, and penalise less, those people who work periodically away from Ireland. Section 154 of the 1994 Finance Act introduced a new relief for persons who are resident in the State and work outside the State for significant periods.  It applies to persons who work abroad for at least 90 days in a tax year in continuous periods of at least 14 days at a time. That might exclude most sailors.</P>

      <P>It would include deep sea sailors in normal circumstances.  The relief operates on a proportionate basis related to the amount of time spent abroad in a year.  Thus, broadly speaking, if a person works abroad for six months, the relief is equivalent to half the person's income in that year.</P>
      <P>This section amends section 154, which I have just described, from the date of its commencement in two respects.  First, up to now the first 15 days spent abroad in a year did not qualify for relief.  It is considered that this is somewhat harsh in view of the other qualifying requirements of a minimum of 14 days absence at a time and an overall absence of 90 days in the year.  Accordingly, the exclusion of the first 15 days is now being removed.</P>
      <P>Second, the legislation is being clarified to ensure that those qualifying under the provision get the full value of the relief.  As it stands, there is some doubt as to whether the relief should be based on total earnings for the year or merely on a proportion of the foreign earnings only.  The section makes it clear that relief is to based on the total earnings for the year, as was always intended.  Thus, for instance, an employee of a semi-State body seconded to carry out an assignment abroad is entitled to have the relief based on his or her earnings from the semi-State body plus the foreign earnings for that particular year.  Likewise, in the case of a retired person similarly seconded to work abroad, the basis on which the deduction is to be calculated is to include that person's pension income for the year.  The penalty of the first 15 days being discounted has been removed and, secondly, all income is being treated for the purposes of the tax exemption.</P>

It is privately owned and has been donated to the State, which is providing a new Hunt Museum in Limerick city. The Minister will be aware that the Commissioners of Public Works are involved in the provision of a new facility in Limerick.  Most of the organisers of valuable private collections are finding it extremely difficult to provide the security and resources needed to enable them to be kept in regional areas.  I make a special plea to the Minister to look carefully at how it would be possible to build up collections in regional cities, particularly Limerick, because of the very important Hunt collection. Will this provision apply to an institution like the Hunt Museum and will private substantial collectors, as well as collectors like the National Gallery of Ireland and the National Museum of Ireland, be assisted?</P>

      <P>With regard to the composition of the committee, I refer Senators to page 198 of the Bill, which defines the selection committee.  It includes the chairperson of the Heritage Council, the Director of the Arts Council and so on.  The committee will consist of executives of the major cultural institutions.</P>
      <P>Senator Daly asked whether the section could apply to the Hunt Museum.  Page 197 states that it can relate to the schedule of various national bodies &ldquo;and any other such body being a body owned or funded wholly or mainly by the State or any public or local authority as may be approved with the consent of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.&rdquo; Therefore, a body like the Hunt Museum, which is partially funded, could qualify.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This provision was suggested to me by a member of the public to bring heritage items into national display in a cost effective way which could be offset against current tax liabilities or arrears as set out in the section.  It is an experimental <Col N="1488" /> provision.  We are not sure how it will work.  For that reason we have confined it at national level to these bodies or any other such bodies.  If somebody said they particularly wanted an artefact to go to the Hunt Museum, they would make the bequest and offer this artefact on the understanding that it would go to that museum for reasons of personal sentiment or because of the relevance of the artefact, such as that it had some connection with the Limerick region.</P>
    <P>In terms of costs, the cap which we have put on this is a maximum of £0.5 million.  We do not know how it may or may not work.  The minimum threshold is £75,000.  This is so that people with outstanding arrears with the Revenue Commissioners will not offer items which they value highly but would not be of national or local significance in real terms.  It is an innovative proposal and has been carefully designed by the officials of the Department of Finance in consultation with the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  We will have to see how it functions.</P>

There were reasons that has not happened up to now but they no longer exist.  In the interests of job creation such a zone should be set up.  I <Col N="1491" /> will send the Minister a report containing ideas for such a zone and I hope, if the pilot schemes prove successful, he will include Dublin Airport this time next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Burke asked about the capital write-off.  Section 25 of the Finance Act, 1992, closed off a tax shelter for holiday cottages, which I think is the matter to which the Senator referred.  Prior to that provision an investor in a holiday cottage could offset the expenditure incurred in the construction of the cottage against all his or her income, not just the rental income, as is the case in section 23 investment.</P>
      <P>This offset was done through capital allowances on the holiday cottages. After ten years the investor would have unrestricted use of the holiday cottage and almost half the construction cost of the cottage would have then been paid for by the Exchequer &mdash; it was a substantial loophole &mdash; alternatively, he could sell the cottage and pocket any gains.</P>
      <P>Due to the over-generous nature of the relief &mdash; which was described at the time by a promoter as the last great tax break &mdash; and because of the potential Exchequer cost involved, it was decided to curtail the scope of the relief by ring fencing the capital allowances to the income arising from the holiday cottage renting activity.  That is why it was done. We are restricting the amount of capital write-off over a phased period.</P>

      <P>I will be speaking to recommendation No. 12, which will be no surprise because it concerns County Wicklow. Within two days of the budget and long before the by-election in Wicklow I said on the Adjournment in this House that the most creative element in the budget was the new seaside resorts scheme, which has tremendous capacity to rejuvenate traditional seaside resorts like Bray, Greystones and many of those the Minister has included, which have become rundown and seedy and have lost their zest.</P>
      <P>I realise the Minister would have difficulties with a town the size of Bray, as I said on the Adjournment debate, and I acknowledge two modest tax incentives given to Bray in the form of urban designation. However, in the most recent scheme almost all the land belongs to the State transport company, CIÉ, so it has little impact on the people.  The scheme is welcome and I do not knock it, I simply make the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the resort scheme was introduced in the budget I was one of the first to welcome it, although I asked for Arklow, Bray and Greystones to be included.  The scheme was long overdue. When introducing the measure the Minister stressed this was a pilot scheme <Col N="1493" /> focused on eight seaside resorts, six on the west coast and two on the south and south-east coast.  Since then it has been extended and I acknowledge the Minister's generosity in extending it to Arklow; on 22 February in the House I specifically asked for that.  I was supported vigorously&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I now make the case for Bray.  There is an interest in reviving the seafront in the town; a group of business people have put together a scheme which would produce many jobs and ultimately provide a great deal of funds for the Exchequer.  Adventurous propositions are contained in the proposal; for instance, the renovation of the chair lift on Bray Head, the rejuvenation of two of the hotels and other specific innovations.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the Minister include the seaside area of Bray in the scheme; if he did so he would receive specific proposals. A catalyst is needed.  The Minister knows the town &mdash; perhaps not as well as I do, but he is aware of the tradition in Bray.  It was the original seaside resort in the country but it has run down.  There has been a lack of capital investment and consequent deterioration and degeneration.  The seafront contains many areas of architectural merit and unique features which are worth preserving.</P>
      <P>If the scheme focused on that part of the town it would be of great benefit. The officials will say there are already two designated urban areas in the town but they and the Minister know that only applies to a specific geographic location.  I want the whole seafront area of Bray to be included as it could be regenerated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also make a specific case for Greystones.  At present there are two separate propositions in the pipeline to <Col N="1494" /> build a substantial marina development in Greystones.  One has run into serious difficulties with the Minister for the Marine who, understandably, wants to charge a licence fee for the use of the foreshore.  This is putting the economics of this planned 450 berth marina into question.  If the benefits of this scheme were to apply it would have a real effect.</P>
    <P>When the scheme was introduced I welcomed it as innovative and long overdue.  I was among the first to look for extensions of the scheme; it is a pity Bray has been excluded from the extensions. The scheme has been extended to 17 seaside resorts in all and in the circumstances a positive case cannot be made for discriminating against Bray.</P>
    <P>I propose that the Minister introduce on Report Stage further flexibility allowing him, in the next 12 months, to extend the scheme by ministerial order to towns that come to him with real investment proposals.  I know that if a scheme is made universally available its value is dissipated.  I suggest the Minister puts it up to the people of the areas, that they would come to him with specific proposals for investment and he could give himself the flexibility to add any town or area that is innovative enough.</P>
    <P>The Minister could not argue against the need for rejuvenation of the seafront in Bray or the consequent job potential.  Nobody could argue that the town needs a fillip.  I know it is difficult for a Minister to take on board an Opposition proposal.  I do not wish to simply score points and my credentials on this matter go back before the tragedy that caused the by-election in County Wicklow.  I suggest the Minister examine the matter.  If the propositions I make are not acceptable because they are too wide or open ended, could the Minister come back on Report Stage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There are investment proposals in the pipeline for Bray and if this catalyst was available the Minister would be doing a great amount to rejuvenate a town, which had a fine seaside tradition, and to stimulate a large amount of related employment.</P>
      <P>I know there is a lot of pressure on the Minister, I am aware this is the llth hour 59th minute and I know there are political reasons it might not be clever to respond to my entreaties.  The Minister has introduced a good scheme. There are investment proposals which have been prepared.  The Bray and District Chamber of Commerce has written to the Minister.  There is huge potential there which could be realised.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to introduce some flexibility.  It will not cost anything because if the investment does not come on stream there will be no loss to the Exchequer and it does comes on stream there would be a huge gain to the Exchequer.  The Minister has introduced a good scheme.  He is aware that Bray could do with the revival this scheme could bring and I ask him to consider favourably my proposal.</P>

There is a planning application lodged at present for a hotel and leisure facility and these two townlands are adjacent to the area recommended for designation.  Having spoken to the urban district council, the county engineers and my party colleague, Deputy Joe Walsh, I tabled this recommendation. It would have a great deal to offer to Clonakilty, particularly as a <Col N="1496" /> planning application is already in process for a hotel and leisure facility.  The two townlands concerned are Ballyduvane and Ahamilla.  I would greatly appreciate if the Minister could include them.</P>

The western counties were designated for special treatment to attract industry and business and to help develop and keep together farming communities.  That is succeeding, albeit at a slow pace.</P>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that small western villages and towns are in serious decline.  The prospect of stabilising the population in them is almost unreal. Post offices and Garda stations are closing and the best of the younger population are leaving.  For this reason I suggested on Second Stage that it would be more advantageous and beneficial if there was a network of these designated towns in each of the important tourism counties.</P>
      <P>I draw attention in my recommendation to the town of Kilrush which is already designated a heritage town by Bord Fáilte and Shannon Development; Killaloe which is an historic and important town on the Shannon with the prospect for investment and development in the context of the inland waterways which have already been fairly successful, and Lisdoonvarna, a more traditional resort where one of our former colleagues, Jim White, has made an enormous contribution towards its development.  Jim White has kept Lisdoonvarna from decaying into a derelict town through hard work and heavy investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If these schemes are to be successful it is important they are dealt with on a regional or county basis.  We do not want to see a town, say Lahinch, developing at the expense of Lisdoonvarna <Col N="1497" /> or Kilkee.  Overall that would be detrimental to the Minister's intention in this section.</P>
    <P>I mentioned Kilrush Urban District Council in the recommendation because Shannon Maritime, a subsidiary of SFADCo, built one of the most modern marinas in the country at Kilrush.  There was some criticism of the cost but a few million pounds was small compared to the cost of the development of the Howth marina in County Dublin: if the money spent on the marina in Kilrush was spent on the Howth marina it would not even be noticed.  Given that it was built in a small, isolated, rural area, quite a song and dance was made about whether it was a good investment, especially by some people who were Ministers when the plans were made but are Ministers no longer.  They thought it opportune to criticise investments although they were there when the decision was made to fund such projects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of maritime leisure facilities is important.  I do not know a lot about fish, but I have detailed knowledge of the potential of estuaries, such as the lower Shannon Estuary.  We endeavoured to build a marina there which would link Ballylongford and other places on the estuary and create a new tourism attraction by providing deep sea fishing, boating, yachting and leisure related activities. This is a hugely expanding international market, but we are only at the tip of the iceberg as regards available revenue from international tourists.</P>
      <P>We should invest in the necessary amenities in order to exploit the full potential of the Shannon Estuary. Unfortunately, we are not prepared to do that because, as some people have said, the tidal nature of the lower Shannon Estuary is not conducive to developing maritime leisure and recreational facilities.  However, the Germans have made huge investments in resorts on the North Sea, especially those which were derelict due to the decline of the German shipping industry, and provided leisure and amenity facilities.  I do not want to labour this point because we will have an opportunity to discuss it when the harbour Bill comes before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a great absence of maritime leisure and recreational facilities in Ireland.  We are not availing of international business in this regard and we need designated areas in order to provide facilities in marinas and on land adjacent to them.  I was anxious to designate seven or eight acres adjacent to the local marina in Kilrush because the harbours were run down as a result of the <Col N="1499" /> change in the pattern of shipping and trade over the past 40, 50 or 100 years. The harbour in Kilrush, which at one stage could facilitate over 600 ships, and the buildings which were used for grain storage are almost derelict.  Many of these could be revitalised and rejuvenated in the same way as Dublin docks. There are many such areas in towns in coastal areas, including Youghal.  Having taken this initiative, perhaps the Minister might follow it up along the lines suggested.</P>

      <P>I am not looking for Malahide to be given status but I commend the Minister for this initiative which I am sure will be successful.  For the past six months Balbriggan Town Commissioners &mdash; the Minister dealt with this in the Dáil &mdash; Balbriggan Chamber of Commerce and Fingal County Council have researched and put together a positive proposal for this area along the coastline which needs help.  I ask the Minister to seriously consider this proposal if he decides to include other parts of the coastline in this scheme.</P>

Unfortunately, I did not get an opportunity to speak on this section during the Second Stage debate. I welcome these provisions which will play a major part in the development of tourism throughout the country.  I understand the case being made by Senators on the opposite side of the House, but we could make that case for all our constituencies.  The Government has done a great job because it has included one or two seaside resorts in each coastal county.  Other areas can be considered next year.</P>
      <P>Senator Wright made the case for Balbriggan.  However, there is only one county which has shown evidence of decline and yesterday I said that a pilot scheme should be introduced for County Mayo.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. R. Quinn Mr. R. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of points were made, but I will give the genesis of this scheme as I did on Second Stage. The proposal originated when Deputy McCreevy was Minister for Tourism and Trade, inspired by Bord Fáilte and its current chairman.  Irrespective of its origin, its merits seem to be self-evident. It focused on declining traditional seaside resorts which had no countervailing economic activities to sustain, support or expand them.  They were selected on a pilot basis and the original list was larger than the numbers which currently appeared.  It was felt that if it was extended to too many locations in the same region it would have a diluting effect and that there would be no additional benefit.  It would mean that the activity would take place in those areas, but with a tax break like a windfall gain which was not warranted by any market force and which did not produce any additional activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The boundaries in relation to Clonakilty and other towns and areas were identified by the Department of the Environment and the Department of Finance in consultation with the local authorities, county councils and, in the case of Clonakilty, Clonakilty Urban District Council.  They would have known about the proposed hotel development and they may have taken the view this would be windfall gain. This application was already submitted. As a hotel, it will qualify for a 15 per cent capital allowance in terms of writeoff value over the first six years and 100 <Col N="1501" /> per cent over seven years, which is a generous offset.  The officials in the local authority, in consultation with the Department of the Environment, gave us the maps for all the areas, including Clonakilty.</P>
    <P>If a new favourable regime came in when someone had planning permission in place and was proceeding with a project whose boundary stopped at the foot of their drive, they would want to get it extended, although they would not need it economically.  They have done their sums and they have come to the conclusion that this is a viable project in the context of the existing tax regime. No one would argue that we should give a free gift to those who do not need it economically.  This scheme is designed specifically to go to those areas that are declining and that do not have the countervailing support of new developments.</P>
    <P>With regard to Senator Roche's eloquent advocacy of Bray and Greystones, Bray is serviced by the DART, and as the Senator clearly signalled to the country last Monday, Greystones will also have access to the DART.  In addition, both are serviced by the N11, which is probably one of the best stretches or road in the country and the access into the Bray/Greystones part of this road &mdash; the new flyover &mdash; is among the best.  In addition, Bray has already got urban designated status and the hotels along the front of the promenade in Bray will qualify for the very generous capital allowances that are already available.</P>
    <P>As I am aware that Senator Roche believes in the free market and the spirit of entrepreneurship, I would not like to choke that free entrepreneurial spirit with too much State aid for fear that he might be accused of being some kind of Albanian Stalinist.  What is available at present is more than enough to take out any residual risk in any of the projects. In addition.  Bray and Greystones are part of the Greater Dublin urban system in daily terms and in terms of suburbanisation and access.  The support in <Col N="1502" /> population terms for retail and other activities is already there.  The same could be said with less force for Balbriggan. The by-pass when it becomes operative will have a dramatic affect on the quality of life in the town but with less force because the transport infrastructure is not the same.</P>
    <P>The Bill will have to be signed by the President by 8 June 1995 in order to comply with constitutional and legislative provisions, so I am not in a position to acquiesce to the requests for extensions and I have given reasonable explanations as to why.  It is a pilot scheme and I hope it works.  It will do so unevenly, because ultimately it now depends on the level of risk taking in the various towns, the quality of the product that is put in place and the way it is managed.  It also depends on the quality of the partnership between the local authorities and local business interests, which is a very uneven commodity. It is one of the areas where local authorities and local representatives on local authorities can ensure that local administrative infrastructures are business and enterprise friendly rather than bureaucratic and obstructive.  This must be worked at.  It is not just the institutional systems that must be worked at but, given the nature of our society, personal relationships.  Public representatives from all sides of the spectrum can play a very creative role in this area.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to extend the scheme any further.  There are other support systems in place, some stronger than others.  I recognise the points that have been made and at the end of two to three years we will review it to see if it needs to be extended.  The precedent exists from the urban designated status scheme, which worked and was subsequently extended to other areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I put down the recommendation because the planning application was lodged recently.  I do not know very much about the application, but it was probably lodged in the hope that it would be included in this scheme. My concern is that it may not now go <Col N="1503" /> ahead.  It is in respect of two townlands that are adjacent to the area already recommended for the tax incentives. This could jeopardise the project and it could move elsewhere, perhaps to a town which has been designated.  I ask the Minister to take action with regard to these townlands to ensure that it remains in Clonakility.  The planning application is in respect of a project in Clonakility and if it can remain there it would be greatly appreciated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is wrong in his judgement about Bray; we will have to differ on this matter.  While all the infrastructures are in place, the nature of the town has been changing and an industry is dying.  The town is becoming a suburb of Dublin, but there was an industry and a degree of enterprise within the town which could be rejuvenated if the scheme was to be applied even to a portion of the town.  This is why I have delineated a specific portion of the town that has always been identified with the tradition of the seaside resorts.  I accept that two urban designations have been made, one of which has been very successful, with 100 per cent take up.  The other will be equally successful.</P>
      <P>This is a pilot scheme and there are three years to run.  When the scheme was in its inception, I lobbied other Ministers in the previous Administration and was anxious that the case of Bray be considered, because I knew the official response to Bray &mdash; it is too close to Dublin.  We are struggling for our life in a town that had a great life in the tradition of the sea side resort, and we are struggling to keep an industry alive that has declined.  There were 1,500 to 1,600 jobs in the 1940s and the 1950s, but they have all disappeared. They were the best kind of jobs because they were indigenous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not talking about people who want to get a windfall profit.  We are talking about a group of entrepreneurs and a group of people who have come together and who are prepared to fund <Col N="1504" /> things which on the surface would not be tremendous profit centres.  For example, recently a group of them got together and put the sea side train on the sea front in Bray.  It will not produce any kind of profit.</P>
    <P>Is there a possibility that the Minster will consider Bray in next year's Finance Bill?  If people come forward with realistic proposals, I only ask that he give them a hearing.  There has never been the enterprise that exists at present, nor has there ever been a group of business people who want to lift the seafront above the slots, above what has become tacky and above its present situation. The enterprise of this group of people could be otherwise dissipated.</P>
    <P>As the Minister remarked, capital will flow to wherever it gets the best return. Courtown and Arklow will give a better return than Bray for the kind of capital structures that are being put in place.  I am not just referring to hotels but to specific facilities &mdash; for example, a chairlift, a planetarium or reviving that appalling monstrosity, the aquarium, which is effectively falling asunder on the main strip of the seafront.  I am speaking of a group of business people who are willing to come together and put up money, not in the usual pubs or slots or whatever it is that gets a quick return, but to put it into something more thoughtful.  I accept that the Minster's time has run out on this matter at present, but if they put together a costed proposal to him between now and next year's Finance Bill, will he listen to them?  That is all I ask.</P>

      <P>Gabhaim buíochas leis an Aire as ucht bheith anseo anocht.  I wish to use this occasion to raise some of the issues that are crucially important in this debate. We now have an opportunity to attempt to make progress.  Over recent days the Minister has indicated that it is possible to resolve this issue.</P>
      <P>I wish to respond in detail to the issues that are raised in the briefing document which has been circulated widely over the last week and today to Members of the Oireachtas.  I wish to refer in particular to the differences in money terms between what the teacher unions have put forward and what the Department put forward.  I do not believe the calculations of either side are necessarily wrong.  I know for a fact that the figures put forward by the teacher unions are correct.  They were compiled by an independent group.  It is, however, disheartening and frustrating not to have access to the assumptions and calculations which gave rise to the figures of £20 million and £30 million.  I feel particularly aggrieved that, despite the fact that we have made all our figures and calculations available, I still do not know how the figures of £20 million and £30 million were arrived at.  I believe they were arrived at honestly but I also believe that the assumptions were incorrect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gather from page 5 of the document that the figures are based on a possibility <Col N="1509" /> or potential of 1,000 teachers retiring in any year.  The document refers to the high numbers that might retire from teaching over the next few decades.  It cites in particular 2012 as a year in which there would be a very high number of retirements.  I wish to point out a simple mathematical fact.  There are approximately 40,000 teachers between primary and post-primary schools, although that number might increase or decrease slightly depending on demographic trends, pupil/teacher ratios and so forth.  That means that mathematically &mdash; and nobody can deny this fact &mdash; over a period of 40 years the average number of teachers who will retire from the system on an annual basis is 1,000.</P>
    <P>We have looked carefully at the information we have gathered to date.  There is one reality: it is not possible at this stage to work out any set of conditions in which an average of 1,000 people could or would avail of early retirement. There are a number of reasons it cannot happen.  First, approximately 50 teachers die each year.  Second, approximately 150 go on disability each year; at primary level the total is about 100 each year between disability and death.  In addition, a significant number of people leave the service each year without having full pension, possibly with preserve benefits; some of them might leave and emigrate and some might re-enter. However, a significant number cannot do that.</P>
    <P>I have looked at the figures for primary level for the last 16 years, which is a long enough period to make judgments.  Since 1979 there has never been a year in which more than one-third of the teachers who are entitled to retire at 60 years of age took that option.  That is significant.  The largest number was in 1993 when 107 people took early retirement.  However, if I group them according to those of between 55 and 60 who can leave, those between 61 and 64 and those who must go at 65, there has never been an instance where more than a third leave before or at 60 years of age.  Of the people who continue beyond 60 years of <Col N="1510" /> age, the vast majority are still paying into a pension fund, even though it will not gain a higher pension for them. They do it either because they are happy in their work and want to continue teaching or because they cannot afford to take a cut in salary.  Who knows which would apply?  However, the fact is that they continue to teach.  I ask the Minister to consider this issue.</P>
    <P>I am worried about where we go from here.  We have made every possible attempt to ring-fence the proposal we have put forward.  We have looked at issues within the public service and the Civil Service to see if there is any issue on which we can find to move forward. There is a great deal at stake.  Take, for example, the recommendations in the White Paper.  Whatever differences of opinion we would have on issues, there is a broad measure of consensus on what might be done in the White Paper. There is also a strong partnership in education.  If we get into a situation after the summer holidays where, apart from whatever industrial action that might take place, there is disruption at school level in certain areas, such as not covering for absent teachers or on whatever issues that might come to the fore at that time, that would be in nobody's interest.  There is now an opportunity to make progress if progress is to be made.</P>
    <P>There are three options open to the Government.  First it can set its face completely against this so that it becomes a long term row; second, the Government wishes to find a reasonable way forward; if that is the case, now is the time to do it; and third, the Government will say it has other more important things to do and that it will look at it again in September.  Leaving this matter until September or putting it on the long finger will cause all sorts of problems with which we all will have to deal in our own way.  However, at least we are aware of that.</P>
    <P>We have put forward a proposal that is ring-fenced within the public sector. There are 208,000 people employed in the public sector.  If the teaching and education elements are excluded there <Col N="1511" /> are approximately 158,000.  If one subtracts all the people who have 30 years or more served, the professional people in the public service who can get added years and those who do not need an essential pre-service qualification, there is a very small number of people.  Examining the possibility of a solution based around the 1956 superannuation legislation, and the deal nurses have always had whereby they can get or buy credit or count training years, is perhaps a way in which we can move forward.  All these things have been said before.</P>
    <P>When trying to find a resolution, one thing is not clear.  We can argue about figures forever.  We can give the Minister all our calculations and she can continue not to give us her calculations except for her bottom line figure.  We can continue to use independent people and the Minister can continue to use her Department and this can go on interminably. People are generally sick of it.  I make one appeal to the Minister tonight and that is to let us see the calculations and assumptions on which her figures were based.</P>
    <P>I do not have the slightest difficulties about sitting down with anybody to establish what the gap is.  There is a unique difficulty in this dispute.  I said publicly that there was a narrow gap between us and the Minister said publicly that there was a very wide gap between us.  When I went to examine it, I found that neither of us was right.  I do not know what the gap between us is because there has never been an established position of movement from the Government side.  There is another matter that gives me a huge difficulty.  I know that when there is a row or a dispute, comments must be made and things must be dealt with.  Maybe these things should be taken with a grain of salt, but if it is the Minister's view that nothing more needs to be offered in the area of pensions, this will go on forever.</P>
    <P>The reality is that there is little in it in terms of costs.  The most significant issue is that even if one takes the £20 million that it is said it would cost, along <Col N="1512" /> with any variation or quota, we are still working within the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and even within the option B system of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> I am not seeking a detailed response to that.  We have put forward something for which we have prepared in different ways but strictly within the context of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i>  We have put forward something that is ringfenced in terms of how we deal with professionals in the public service and those with essential pre-service qualifications.  If we are within the cost parameters and the area of existing precedent, I do not understand where exactly the problem is.</P>
    <P>For a long time there was a view that this would not be conceded to the teachers because it would have an impact on the wider public service.  I have come suspiciously to the view that the real problem might be that what we are proposing does not have any impact on the wider public service and that might be upsetting many other people. It has been put to me by some people in positions of authority that they would like to see teachers breach the barricades and leave a hole big enough for the rest to come in behind us.  We have put forward a proposal which would be parallel to what has been available to nurses, similar to what has been available to professionals in the public service and not far from the provisions of the 1963 legislation which allowed the Government extricate itself from its difficulty yesterday.</P>
    <P>Wherever I look I see possibilities of doing business, but that can only be done if there is space for movement from people.  The question I ask tonight is not can we all sit around the table getting back to talks, but rather can we establish that the Government is prepared to move on this issue.  What that movement has to be is a matter for negotiations.  School management, parents and other groups have a right to know our plans in this area.  I have a duty representing members of the INTO and it is the strongly held view <Col N="1513" /> of the INTO executive that we have a responsibility to take every step possible to try to resolve problems before they create disruption at school level.</P>
    <P>The only reason that there was strike action on the streets last week was because the Department of Finance was misrepresenting the position and giving wrong advice to Ministers and members of Government.  People spoke openly to me and said that teachers would not be prepared to take a strong line on this and that they could all go away until September.  That kind of talk causes problems for the Minister's interests and the interests of teachers and everybody else.  Within the context of what I have said tonight, the Minister has a responsibility to put forward her price in terms of the proposals she thinks should be put into play.  We said from the beginning that we would negotiate under option A and that we understood this was <i>quid quo pro</i>&mdash; let me try that again &mdash;<i>quid pro quo.</i></P>

    <P>I want to finish on what I hope is a lighter note.

      <P>We had the Famine earlier today, so if we were to take that model, God knows where we would finish up.  As somebody who I hope has shown an interest in education over the years, I think it is a sad day for the country when so many teachers are so concerned that they arrive <i>en masse</i> in Dublin for a one day stoppage.  I hope that whatever steps are necessary to ensure that sort of thing will not recur will have been taken before the beginning of the new school year and that this type of dispute will not continue on an open-ended basis.  It damages everybody involved and certainly damages the reputation of the educational system and perhaps the teachers, the Government and the Department.  I do not think that can be in anybody's interest. Our common interests ought to and can transcend the specific differences that divide us from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We recently discussed the White Paper on which perhaps some of the most significant education legislation this State has ever seen can be based. No one would dispute that the teaching profession is playing an ever more central role in our society.  Teachers in the last generation and even more in the next generation are having to increasingly substitute for inherited structures <Col N="1515" /> and organisational institutions, such as Churches or families, to which we turned and on which we relied for social bonding in this society and which are now under pressure or in decline.</P>
    <P>The education system is having increasing responsibilities imposed on it, whether it wills it or not, to play roles that simply were not expected of it previously. The burden of social responsibility and expectation that is increasingly imposed on the teaching profession at both primary and secondary level &mdash; and in some respects at third level &mdash; requires one to stand back and ask what we can reasonably expect from people who undertake this responsible social role.</P>
    <P>Likewise, as is stressed in the White Paper, the economic expectations of the education system have increased.  There is far more responsibility now attaching to education for the long term economic development of the country than used to be the case until recently.  So the teaching profession is of central significance in this society.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate when ones sees media contributions invoking relativities which do not take cognisance of the changing and increasing responsibility of the teaching profession.  In many ways claims of this sort offer targets for expressions of envy, jealousy or begrugery as well as legitimate criticisms.  The quality of the criticisms of the teaching profession and of teachers' incomes that we have seen in many newspapers and have heard on some programmes over the last couple of months, when these claims were under public discussion, do not do any credit to those involved either in terms of short term political opportunism or concern for the long term welfare of the country.</P>
    <P>Because of the wider implications of this issue, it is central to good citizenship and general societal development that this type of problem should be resolved.  I am sympathetic to Senator O'Toole when he points out that it is difficult for a lay person like myself, without having the calculation spelt out, <Col N="1516" /> to know where validity lies in the claims and counter claims.  In that respect the briefing document, which is a useful one that could be discussed at length, states:</P>
    <P>It was estimated at that time that the cost of conceding such a claim would over time be of the order of £260 million per annum.</P>
    <P>I never like the passive tense and I do not like phrases like &ldquo;it was estimated&rdquo;. Who estimated it?  What was their basis for estimation?  What were their qualifications for estimating, and over what period of time?  I am not saying that it is necessarily wrong, but it is loose.  I am intrigued to see the reference to &ldquo;an independent and competent team of experts&rdquo;.  I see that independence is no guarantee of competence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>Precisely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>Mind you, competence may be no guarantee of independence either.  However, I doff my cap to the person who drafted that particular sentence because they were covering a variety of angles.  I do not doubt that the enhanced provisions for the public service bill is already set to double in real terms.  The whole issue of pensions is a major problem not only for teachers but for all of us in society.  I do not like the phrase &ldquo;in the years ahead&rdquo; which is an open-ended loose sort of thing.</P>
      <P>I noted carefully what Senator O'Toole said about 1,000 retirements per annum.  Page 5 contains one of the nubs of the briefing document.  On the one hand, estimates that 150 teachers will retire per annum were taken as the basis of certain calculations and, on the other hand, it is argued that &ldquo;the official costings will be based on a much more realistic prediction of up to 1,000 retirements per annum&rdquo;.  What does &ldquo;up to&rdquo; mean?  Is it 1,000 and whatever the margin of error is?  It is not possible for someone like myself, who does not know the density of calculation behind it nor the precise assumptions, to know how compelling or how convincing these types of assumption are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1517" /> I am not trying to make opportunistic points.  I would like to know what weighting one can lay on the assumptions of what I would call the official mind in this respect as well as on the assumptions of the unofficial mind, if I may say so.  Maybe I should say the alternative official mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that that was a compliment, by the way.  &ldquo;Official mind&rdquo; does not normally rank in my vocabulary as the highest praise I can think of, however unfair that may be to individual officials, present company naturally included.</P>
      <P>On the basis of this document I would not be able to say that I was convinced of the case against the teachers' claim any more than the case can be put that the teachers' claim can also be subjected to a comparable type of scrutiny.  I do not have sufficient comparable data on the table to allow a rigorous evaluation of the validity of the conflicting claims. As far as I am concerned that would be the first step to arriving at some sort of reasonable compromise.</P>
      <P>Towards the end of the document it says that &ldquo;the gap between the Government position and the teachers' unions position is large, not small&rdquo;.  The outlines of a possible compromise arrangement have to be spelled out clearly, and such an arrangement will have to be arrived at in due course anyway.  We all know that in such things there is not 100 per cent on one side or on the other.</P>
      <P>The sooner one begins working towards a constructive compromise arrangement with all the assumptions and calculations open to scrutiny from both sides and from independent &mdash; and even competent &mdash; people, the sooner that a satisfactory solution will be arrived at.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I compliment the proposers of the motion for putting down a non-contentious motion which will not force a division.  Given the delicate balance <Col N="1518" /> we have in the House, it could have been used to divide us into all sorts of acrimony which would not have achieved anything.  It is good to have such a discussion which gives the Minister an opportunity to speak about it in public as well as giving us an opportunity to put some of our views before the House and listen to the views of others.</P>
      <P>The While Paper on Education is widely recognised as being a tremendous document.  We are in very exciting times educationally.  At some stage in the future the problem we are discussing this evening will have gone away, and the sooner the better.  We can then get down to the business of dealing with the White Paper, and all the matters arising from it, and thus get a better understanding of the whole system.  The White Paper has a strong commitment to the teaching profession and, as a teacher herself, the Minister for Education has a strong commitment also. The Government is committed to the work that the Minister is doing and, all in all, the education system in future will be a better one than it has been in the past.</P>
      <P>The White Paper would not have been possible but for all the processes that we have been through since the 1960s.  The development of educational philosophy is an ongoing process and the White Paper has done a magnificent job in that area.  The early part of the document sets out the aims, objectives and basic philosophy as it has never been done before.  We can be proud of that brilliant achievement.  The Minister would be the first to recognise that that was not all her own work.  She is the motivator behind it and her name is at the bottom of it, but it is the culmination of a lot of thinking and discussion as well as previous Green and White Papers published since the 1960s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Being the Minister for Education is an awkward and difficult job.  As public representatives we are approached almost every week by some pressure group within education seeking something that will cost money.  We approach <Col N="1519" /> the Minister for Education with gusto, trying to persuade her that what the group wants is essential and they must have it now.  But setting priorities, particularly short term priorities, is difficult because, as a member of the Government, the Minister has restrictions. These are dictated by the Government's financial strategy whose guidelines have to be adhered to.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister wishes that any notion she ever had could be financed that afternoon.  That would be great.  We all have our priorities for the education system.  We have a set of priorities here in the White Paper too which will guide us over the coming years and the implementation of the various elements will depend on how much money is available. That is always the problem.  For example, we all want additional remedial teachers or more educational psychologists, a further reduction in the pupil/teacher ratio as soon as possible, a renewal and refurbishment of buildings all over the country and new buildings put in place where existing buildings are not adequate and the introduction of client-friendly curricula.  We want all those things now.  Of course, we have to be sensible and realise this is a progressive process.  These things must be put in place as time goes by and money becomes available.</P>
    <P>There is no problem setting overall goals in education; the White Paper has done that brilliantly but trying to implement them is the difficult thing.  I am sure the Minister is in conflict with the Government on a regular basis because she is the one who must fight our comer and fight on behalf of all the various clients of the system so that as much money as possible is provided every year for education.  In the autumn, I am sure there is an uneasy relationship between Ministers, each fighting for a bigger slice of the financial cake.  We can luxuriate in the meantime in the knowledge that we do not have to make decisions.  We can continue to clamour for x, y and z with abandon and the <Col N="1520" /> decision, good or bad at the end of the day, will not be ours.</P>
    <P>The education system is a good one. We are agreed on that.  Generally speaking, we have fine teachers who do an excellent job.  The Minister and all of us agree that many teachers are not working in ideal conditions.  Many teachers are working in schools which are not adequate for the basic job they have to do.  The Minister made a strong commitment and has, over the last couple of years because money became available, managed to take a lot of the old schools out of the system.  All of us have the experience of visiting schools where the new curriculum and what happens on the ground are a thousand miles apart.  Teachers say they cannot possibly teach some element of the new curriculum in the circumstances in which they are forced to work.  I have been in schools like that myself and I am sure the General Secretary of the INTO has been in many of them. Indeed, I have seen secondary schools where&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>Eight minutes will have to do.  I am sure we cannot change it now. <Col N="1521" /> There is a commitment at ministerial and Government level that there should be a system of early retirement for teachers.  There are many good reasons that should be the case and, obviously, the Government recognises that.  Those of us who were teachers can easily identify with all the good reasons there should be system of early retirement. Indeed, in discussions with the Minister and the Taoiseach about this problem, I get the feeling that there is a strong commitment there but they must keep in mind the cost and that is a huge difficulty when coming to a decision on this issue.</P>
      <P>The briefing document has put down various different positions which can be examined and, hopefully, over a period as further negotiations continue, the positions will get closer.  I am hopeful that we will have a solution to this problem within a relatively short period.  We must resolve it.  The job, as outlined in the White Paper, is too important to be set aside because of a niggling difficulty in the system.</P>
      <P>I started teaching in the middle of the 1960s.  Within a few years I was joined by a huge number of teachers as the system expanded.  I am in my early fifties and I assume many of the teachers in our schools today are middle aged or older.  Teachers would agree that this is not good.  We need new energy, ideas and focus in education and that is one of the reasons I would like to see an early retirement system in place, particularly at a time when education principles are being examined.  There is a renewal going on in education.  We need new people, ideas and energy in the system more than ever before.</P>
      <P>That is only one reason and there are others.  Teachers who are unhappy and want to get out should be given the opportunity to do so because they are under-performing.  Teachers who are burnt out are under-performing.  The Minister and the Government are aware of all these matters.  My hope this evening is that this will be another small step in the direction of finding a solution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I must congratulate Senator O'Toole for wording the motion the way he did.  I interpret it as noting the breakdown of negotiations between the teacher unions and the Departments of Education and Finance. As a result, there has been a withdrawal by the teacher unions from the various courses and departmental committees that had been set up, for example, the sexuality and relationship committee and in-career development courses. What are we going to do?  What proposals is the Minster going to bring on stream to resolve this conflict?</P>
      <P>The school year is drawing to a close. There are three months to September and some steps must be taken between now and then to try to get us moving again.  I fear an escalation next September of what occurred last week and none of us want that to happen.  I speak for responsible teachers who do not want to go down that road the first week of September.</P>
      <P>We have a new programme being put in motion, the leaving certificate applied programme; in-service training is about to start and school managements are in a terrible predicament wondering whether that programme will come on stream next September, so the Minister can see the concerns that exist out there because of what happened last week. About three weeks ago we spoke on the White Paper and many good issues were raised.  I was very impressed with it as a discussion document.  Maybe down the road we will be able to implement some parts of it.  In the course of the discussion, the Minister said she put great store in education and the quality of education.  She recognised the stress caused in the last number of years by unemployment, alcohol, drug abuse and the increase in the number of disturbed children coming to school.  We need a backup service to deal with these problems. That has been acknowledged. Teachers in every school are feeling this stress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the process of discussions, we must ask ourselves where we are going from here.  Look at the volume of change that <Col N="1523" /> is coming about.  There is a new junior certificate, the transition year, the LCAP, the leaving certificate vocational programme, a new curriculum for leaving certificate, PLCs, NCEA, NCCA and NCVA.  I asked my staff this morning if they could tell me about these programmes that were coming on stream. They told me not to talk to them anymore. They literally cannot cope with the number and volume of changes coming on stream.  The Minister talked about a <i>quid pro quo</i> of productivity in relation to the issue of early retirement. That should be a formula for discussion.</P>
    <P>The volume of change taking place and the number of new courses coming on stream &mdash; if that is not enough productivity &mdash; as well as the number and amount of administrative duties that every teacher has to perform in the process of doing his or her teaching routine, combined with producing points at the end of the leaving certificate under the pressure of parents and students trying to get into third level, is causing a huge strain.  It requires a whole new think in relation to our teachers.  Many of them, as Senator Cotter said, are over the age of 40 years and we cannot get new blood into the system.  Many fine teachers of 25, 26 and 27 years of age, who are trying to get into the system, cannot do so because there is no early retirement. They cannot find vacancies.  They are excellent people with new ideas who would love to come into the system.  I could not keep up with them.  There is a fresh new blood coming out of the colleges. They cannot get into the system because we cannot loosen it up at the other end.  This is a golden opportunity to allow those people in and to try to look for some way to open up the discussions between the Minister and the teacher unions.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned this document and I wish I had it two weeks ago &mdash; I received the document yesterday. I would like to have spent more time reading it.  I am not one who can flick through it and then think I can talk about it.  There are many things in it I <Col N="1524" /> would agree with.  The Minister said that she brought her own independent facilitator in to assess the number of teachers who would retire each year, the costing and what the teacher unions had said.  I understand that the independent facilitator has reported to the Minister. Can we have that report made available to us so that we can see what is going on?  I do not know, but I feel there is some other document that I do not know about.  I am not in a position to calculate whether the teachers are right or whether the Minister is right, but it is surely time for some middle ground to be found.  We are now at the end of May and we have three months until the end of September.  I ask the Minister to make sure she does not close the door with the result that, when we all come back in September, she &mdash; and we public representatives &mdash; will have trouble on our hands if we cannot find a nucleus for discussion.</P>
    <P>I understand what Senator O'Toole said about the training end of our teachers's programmes: that they would be allowed two years credit for pension entitlements at that level.  I do not know if that is an acceptable suggestion, but it should be considered.  The Minister also talked about the other end of the scale. I appreciate what she is doing in lifting the cap off allowances for principals and vice-principals.  She also mentioned posts of responsibility and shortening the salary scale.  I acknowledge all of that and it is good that we are moving down that road.  I am worried that the Minister is using the fact that teachers were allowed five years extra credit in pension rights because of stress.  That is grand, but it is taking them off the payroll. It is a gain for us so we should not use that as a base for discussion on the issue of early retirement.  All I am saying to the Minister is to get an independent facilitator on the ground.  Get around the table again.  I know there is movement on both sides and it is time to open discussions again.</P>

      <P>I want to thank the Independent <Col N="1525" /> Senators for proposing this motion and giving me the opportunity of coming here to speak on this important issue.  It is the most important item on my agenda at present.  I know the House shares my disappointment that the stage has been reached where the teacher unions have decided on a campaign of non-co-operation with my Department and that members of the INTO and the ASTI have engaged in strike action.  It has been a major tenet of my policy that partnership is an essential ingredient in developing and improving educational provision.  That partnership of managers, teachers, parents and the Department is something which I have encouraged since I took office as Minister for Education early in 1993.  I am fully aware that in the development of future education policy and provision, as set out in the White Paper, the partnership of which I have spoken is important.  The teachers are one of the major parties in education and it gives me no pleasure that they have signalled their intention not to cooperate with my Department in a number of important areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Already we have lost six most important in-service training days, which were to provide the foundation for some 7,000 teachers to introduce new syllabuses in several subjects at the leaving certificate beginning in September. Similarly, training in respect of the new leaving certificate applied &mdash; the LCAP &mdash; has not taken place, putting in jeopardy the introduction of this most important development at senior cycle.  The extension to more schools of the leaving certificate vocational programme is similarly affected.  I am not prepared to introduce these initiatives into schools unless and until I am satisfied that the teachers who will be charged with their implementation will have had adequate training for the task. Therefore, I have decided with regret that the introduction of those initiatives, which were due in September next, must now be postponed.  A circular to this effect has been issued to schools today.  Apart from these specifics, I am <Col N="1526" /> only too well aware of the negative effects that disruption caused by teacher strikes have on school life generally. These are serious issues for the education sector and I refer to them because I want to assure the House that I am fully conscious of how serious they are.  In doing so, I want to impress on Senators that this dispute is not a matter of the Government digging in its heels on a simple issue.  I want Senators to ask themselves whether any Minister for Education would allow the kind of disruption I have referred to take place if the issue giving rise to it could be easily resolved.</P>
    <P>I have said that I welcome the opportunity of this discussion, not least because it gives me the opportunity of setting out for the House my position in regard to some of the allegations made against me and the official side.  These include allegations of broken promises, refusal to negotiate, inordinate delay and scare tactics in regard to costs.  I want to deal firstly with the allegation of broken promises.  At the teacher conferences at Easter 1993, I, as Minister for Education, referred to the issue of early retirement.  My statements clearly indicated my concerns about stress in the teaching profession and how a scheme of early retirement might help to alleviate the problem.  At the INTO conference I said:</P>
    <P>I have indicated that I am prepared to enter into discussions with all the interested parties to examine proposals for early retirement.  There are (at present) very limited opportunities in this area for primary teachers and I would wish to see enhanced opportunities for early retirement.</P>
    <P>Such a development would address the particular problems facing teachers including the problem of burn-out arising from the appalling stress facing some teachers in the classroom.</P>
    <P>I repeated those sentiments at the ASTI and TUI conferences.  In negotiations on the early retirement claim the official <Col N="1527" /> side made an offer of early retirement with up to five years full pension credit, that is added years, for teachers who, for reasons of stress or otherwise, find that they can no longer function at acceptable levels of performance.  I honestly consider that this offer meets the commitment I gave to deal with the early retirement issue in the context of teacher stress.  I might add that I am seeking to address stress-related problems in teaching on a comprehensive basis.  In addition to this early retirement scheme, provision is being made for relevant in-service training and the development of a welfare service for teachers.</P>
    <P>The teacher unions have put forward a number of claims to be negotiated under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> including the claim relating to early retirement.  The impression has been created that no serious negotiations have been undertaken by the Government side over the last year or so in relation to the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> claims.  This is not so.</P>
    <P>In response to their claims the teachers were offered the extension to post-primary teachers of the general provision of retirement at age 55 with 35 years service already available to primary teachers.  This addressed a long-standing complaint by post-primary teachers regarding the anomalous situation that existed in relation to teachers on the common basic scale.  The offer meant that all post-primary teachers with 35 years service could now retire from the age of 55 rather than 60.</P>
    <P>They were offered early retirement with up to five added years for teachers who because of stress and other difficulties find themselves unable to function at acceptable levels of professional performance.  This was a direct response to the teachers persistent demands for a mechanism to deal with the problem of stressed out teachers and a management need to deal with long serving teachers whose professional performance was no longer adequate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1528" /> They were offered early retirement with added years for teachers who are surplus to requirements because of school closure, amalgamation and enrolment decline and who cannot be readily redeployed.  This measure would provide significant opportunities for early retirement for teachers.  They were offered a reduction of the common basic scale from a 26 to a 24 point scale.  This offer addresses an ongoing union complaint about the length of the salary scale and would be of benefit to teachers not on the maximum of the scale.</P>
    <P>They were offered a phased payment of the pass degree allowance to teachers who do not have a degree.  This addresses a claim dating back to the early 1970's.  The offer would benefit some 8,000 primary teachers and about 2,000 specialist post-primary teachers to the extent of £765 per annum.  They were offered payment of the higher diploma allowance as well as a degree allowance to teachers holding a four year concurrent degree which includes a qualification in the theory and practice of education.  This would give the teachers concerned allowances of £513 for an honours degree or £244 for a pass degree per annum.</P>
    <P>They were offered a raise in the existing limits on the allowances payable to principals and vice-principals to £13,000 for principals and £8,336 for vice-principals. This provides for increases of up to £2,500 for principals and £1,700 for vice principals.  It addresses a long-standing grievance that these allowances were capped at £10,506 and £6,636 respectively. They were offered the payment of a once-off lump sum to all principals, vice principals and posts of responsibility holders.  This was offered as a payment on account pending further discussion on claims relating to promotion posts in the context of the White Paper.</P>
    <P>They were offered full recognition for pension purposes of capitation and supernumerary service given by existing teachers in convent and monastery schools.  This will afford full, as opposed to half, pension credit for teaching service <Col N="1529" /> by certain religious and ex-religious. It would also give full pension credit for service in convents and monasteries by certain lay teachers which currently does not count for pension purposes.</P>
    <P>The offers made to the teacher unions were subject to there being a successful outcome to negotiations on productivity, including securing the integrity of the school year.  These were significant offers made during many months of negotiation.  The offers were made in the context of the teachers campaign for early retirement on the grounds of increased stress as well as their other claims on non-retirement issues.</P>
    <P>In the course of later negotiations, the unions changed their position and emphasised a demand for improved pension provisions at the age of 60 for all teachers as well as a general scheme of early retirement for teachers with 33 years service.  This is a much more costly claim than a scheme of early retirement for those teachers who were unable to continue in the profession.  Most recently, the teachers indicated that they are seeking pension credit for two years of their training period.</P>
    <P>There is no great mystery about the difference in the costings arrived at by the Government side and those presented by the teacher unions.  It depends on the assumptions made.  The teachers took an example of the costs arising in relation to 150 retirees per year.  The Government's costings were based on a much higher number of teachers per year.  Let me explain the reason for this.</P>
    <P>The latest proposal from the teachers was for two extra free pensionable years to be added to service in respect of initial training.  What that means is that every retiring teacher, except those who already have 40 years service, would be given two extra years pensionable credit whether retiring early or not.  The number of teachers reaching the age of 60 will climb to about 1,700 in the year 2015 &mdash; just 20 years from now.  By this time the cost of teachers' pensions will <Col N="1530" /> have more than doubled in real terms without any improvement in pension provisions.</P>
    <P>The teachers themselves have claimed that it is difficult for a teacher to accumulate 40 years service.  In the face of these facts, it is quite clear that the number of beneficiaries would be many times the 150 suggested by the teachers.  Estimates of the number of teachers who took to the streets recently go as high as 15,000.  Is it seriously suggested that this number would engage in public agitation for something that would benefit a relative handful?</P>
    <P>Much has been made too of ringfencing, that is, confining any concession to teachers so that it could not spread to the wider public service.  It is the view of this Government that any general concession made to any public service group, whether it be a reduction in retiring age, added years or revising how pensions are calculated, could not be confined to the group benefiting initially.  Apart from any other consideration it would hardly be equitable to confine it to one group.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances it is legitimate for the Government to examine the teachers' claim in the context of the superannuation provisions of the wider public service.  I want to stress that this is not a scare tactic.  It is a legitimate concern of the Government to ensure that public service pensions will not place an unbearable burden on the taxpayers of the future.</P>
    <P>The public service pension scheme is a generous one.  Pensions are index-linked and enjoy <i>pro rata</i> increases with pay.  In addition national teachers can retire at 55 years of age provided they have 35 years service.  An offer of similar provisions has been made to post-primary teachers.  By any standards, teachers have very good pension provisions. It has been said by the teacher unions that there has been inordinate delay in dealing with the teachers' claims by the official side.  Again, I would like to explain to the House why this is not the case.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1531" /> Negotiations on the teachers' early retirement claim have to be conducted within the terms of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> along with other outstanding cost increasing claims. In early 1994 the teacher unions opted to pursue as a priority a 1 per cent increase on pay and pensions with effect from 1 April 1994 as allowed for under Clause 2 of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i>  In line with budgetary and expenditure parameters that underpin the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> no payment on any settlement of special pay claims, including the early retirement issue, would fall due before 1 June 1995.</P>
    <P>In effect, therefore, no concessions on any of the claims could be implemented prior to 1 June 1995.  The offer made to teachers on a general early retirement scheme was made well in advance of that date on 10 February 1995.  In negotiations to date the Government side has responded where feasible to all claims put forward by the teachers.  The Government considers itself to be acting fully in accordance with the terms of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i>  As further evidence of the Government's commitment to the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> I am ensuring that a 2 per cent increase in pay and pensions in line with the terms of Clause 2(i) of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> will be paid to teachers, with effect from 1 June 1995.  The annual cost of this increase is of the order of £24 million.</P>
    <P>I have no desire to engage in an unproductive barrage of recrimination and propaganda.  My main concern is that the education of children will suffer because of the disruption being brought about by this dispute.  I am concerned, too, that the progress towards a better education planned in the White Paper on Education would not be disrupted. Therefore, it is my wish that we would find a basis to resume negotiations with the teachers.  This, I know, is the wish shared also by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, with whom Government <Col N="1532" /> Ministers have discussed the issue.  We on the Government side are seeking ways of finding a basis for resuming discussions. I thank the House again for the opportunity of speaking here this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I do not think this is the place for this debate at this time.  We are in the middle of what is, essentially, a trade union dispute.  In my short time in the Seanad we have not gone into the inner details of any other trade union dispute in this House.  I do not see why this issue should be discussed here simply because the general secretary of one of the trade unions involved happens to be a Senator.  He should separate his job as the general secretary of a trade union from his job as a Senator.  The debate tonight has been blurred somewhat by this.</P>
      <P>I am also very perturbed that what is being lost in all of this debate are the people who are directly involved in this dispute; the children and the teachers who are looking for early retirement, because I do not think the INTO or the Department has really examined the situation of stress and how it impacts on the teaching profession.  I do not honestly think &mdash; and I can speak with a fair amount of authority on this &mdash; that the INTO has talked to these teachers.</P>
      <P>In 1994, 105 teachers had to retire because of ill health, 60 from the primary sector and 45 from the secondary sector; there were 251 voluntary retirements from primary education, 161 of which were over 60 years of age and 90 were between 55 years and 60 years of age; and there were 75 voluntary retirements from the secondary sector, all of whom were over 60 years of age.  I do not think that the management of the INTO has spoken to any of those teachers.  No questionnaire has been sent around and no attempt has been made to quantify the problems which cause teachers to suffer from stress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We talk about the awful problems which teachers have in classrooms but <Col N="1533" /> we have not quantified how many teachers would like to retire early because of stress.  There are some, but we do not know enough about them.  It is in the public arena that this dispute is primarily about stress and this does not do justice to the majority of teachers who are not under stress or who would happily go on teaching after the age of 60 years &mdash; some would like to go on after 65 years of age.  Not every teacher is totally stressed out and not enough is known about this problem.</P>
    <P>This Minister and this Government have, in their own way, recognised that there are problems.  Since the Minister has taken office, we have seen increased funding, whether it is in capitation grants or extra resources for schools in disadvantaged areas.  We have seen a greater commitment to support services, with more caretakers and secretarial staff being employed in schools.  There is a general recognition that that back up is needed in some schools, which this Minister is providing.  A hyped up campaign using the few stressed teachers to try to get a better deal for all teachers is unfair and disingenuous.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned, as a former member of ASTI, that the concerns of second level teachers are being swept under the carpet.  Many of the things they have looked for over the years seem to be lost and the INTO seems to have taken over the negotiating for all three unions.  The other two unions are not necessarily looking for the same as the INTO.  Christina Murphy, a very respected journalist who has written for many years on education, stated in the education supplement of <i>The Irish Times</i> that:</P>
    <P>O'Toole and the INTO are seen to have effectively hijacked the whole campaign and successfully concentrated it on the aspects of most interest to INTO members...  Even the controversial costings of an early retirement package were commissioned <Col N="1534" /> by the INTO and not by the three unions together.</P>

        <i>The Irish Times'</i> education supplement of Tuesday, 30 May 1995. The Minister stated in her briefing document that &ldquo;the teachers' unions have rejected an offer by the Government to have all costings submitted to an independent expert group for examination in order to resolve the difficulties in approach and interpretation&rdquo;.  I would like to know why the teacher unions have rejected that.  An independent body, such as the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, would see both sides of this argument and could fairly adjudicate on the differences between them. There is a huge difference between £2 million and £20 million or £30 million, which is the official estimate.</P>
      <P>There is too much at stake here.  As a mother of six children, I am very concerned that the progress which we were all looking for in the White Paper will not now take place.  As the Minister pointed out tonight, various programmes have had to be postponed because of the withdrawal of teachers from in-service training.  This is very regrettable because we all want to see progress in education, whether we are parents, teachers or public representatives.</P>
      <P>It is very unfortunate because this country owes a great deal to our teachers.  They have worked very hard over the years to produce people of great quality and integrity, often working under atrocious conditions.  We must all acknowledge that.  It is regrettable that there could be a fight over what may be a very small number &mdash; if the teacher unions are to be believed it is about 150 people a year.  The teacher unions and the Department need to resolve this dispute sooner rather than later.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike the previous speaker, I see every reason this issue should be discussed in Seanad Éireann. I was very disappointed by the negative tone of the Minister's address this evening.  When she attended the annual conferences of the teachers' unions in 1993, she correctly identified early retirement as the issue which was uppermost in the minds of the vast majority of delegates.  This was not a new issue. It had been gathering momentum for a number of years.  It was clear that teachers were becoming impatient at the lack of progress on the early retirement issue.  This is why they gave a warm welcome to the clear commitment given by the Minister that she was prepared to initiate and become involved in discussions with a view to agreeing an early retirement scheme for teachers.  I believe the Minister gave that commitment in good faith and that it was her intention that there would be meaningful discussions which would lead to that commitment being honoured.  Regrettably, this has not happened.  It would appear that somewhere along the way other forces with a different agenda intervened.  Despite the fact that a joint claim had been submitted by the three teacher unions to the conciliation council, I am satisfied no real effort was made over the past two years by the official side to resolve this issue.</P>
      <P>When industrial action was threatened last year, a commitment was given that the negotiations would be concluded by 30 September.  Again, this did not happen.  There was no movement until February of this year when a totally unrealistic offer was made to post-primary teachers and no offer was made to primary teachers.  The offer in the case of post-primary teachers was totally unrealistic because what was offered was a provision whereby teachers with 35 years service could retire at the age of 55.  The Minister knows as well as everybody else in the House and I that it is virtually impossible for any post-primary teacher to have 35 years service at the age of 55.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past week the Department provided <Col N="1536" /> us with a briefing document dealing with early retirement.  Page 6 contains a table which gives the number of teachers who will reach 55 years of age each year for the next 20 years.  It would be very interesting to get a breakdown of these figures into primary and post primary teachers.  It would be even more interesting to be told how many of the post primary teachers reaching 55 years of age each year will have 35 years service.  The Minister and I know that the vast majority of post primary teachers are much more likely to be 60 years of age or more by the time they have 35 years service.  It is no wonder, therefore, that the talks broke down.</P>
    <P>The appointment by the Government of a facilitator enabled the talks to resume, but the hopes of an agreement before this year's teacher conferences were soon dashed when there was no improvement forthcoming on the offer which had led to the breakdown of the talks some weeks earlier.  This sequence of events left nobody in any doubt as to what the mood at the teacher conferences would be like.  It came as no surprise that there was overwhelming support at each conference for a programme of industrial action and non-co-operation with the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>There are many who would ask if teachers were deliberately manoeuvred into a position where they had little choice but to take such decisions.  Was there an expectation in certain quarters that strike action by teachers would alienate public support and sympathy for their case?  If that was the hope or intention, it has not materialised.  The vast majority of the general public, and parents in particular, know that teachers are not people who will down tools and take to the streets at the drop of a hat. They know the reason teachers were on the streets of this city yesterday week was because it was the only way left to them to bring home to the Government the extent of their disappointment and frustration at the total lack of progress on their very reasonable claim for early retirement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1537" /> The last thing teachers want to become involved in is industrial action. Teachers want to be in their classrooms teaching their pupils.  When there is disruption of schools and classes, nobody regrets this more than teachers themselves. They regret the inconvenience to parents and pupils and are angry that this action was forced on them last week.</P>
    <P>In the briefing document and in the Minister's speech this evening great play is made of the fact that an offer of up to five years full pension credit was made for teachers who, for reasons of stress or otherwise, find they can no longer function at acceptable levels of performance. This offer is a red herring in the context of what is being sought. Teachers see this offer as a device to deal with the issue of so-called problem teachers by introducing a compulsory early retirement scheme for such teachers.  This is a totally distinct and separate issue.</P>
    <P>What is being sought by the teacher unions is an option of voluntary early retirement for all teachers.  This does not mean they are looking for early retirement for every teacher or that all teachers would avail of it if it were on offer.  The operable word is &ldquo;option&rdquo;. Teachers are not looking for any reduction in the normal retirement age of 65 years.  They are simply seeking to bring about a situation in which teachers who have given the best part of a lifetime to teaching but who find they are no longer able to discharge their duties and responsibilities as satisfactorily or as well as they would like could, if they wish, retire with dignity.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that in all the discussions which have taken place, the teacher unions have acted reasonably and fairly. They have shown flexibility and a willingness to compromise in their efforts to reach agreement.  This is more than can be said for the official side.  During the course of the negotiations teachers have modified their claim considerably and have offered to pay increased pension contributions.  They have also offered <Col N="1538" /> that the number qualifying for early retirement in any year would be governed by a quota.</P>
    <P>In an article on page 8 of the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 19 April, 1995, dealing with early retirement, the paper's education editor, John Walshe, wrote that:</P>
    <P>The union leaders took a considerable risk in modifying their original demands so much and there have been some misgivings voiced at the three conferences over the approach taken.</P>
    <P>This is the observation of an independent and impartial observer.  On page 17 of the Government's briefing document, this flexibility and willingness to compromise on the part of the unions is unfairly presented as the teachers changing their position.  It is presented as if they were making it more difficult for the official side to do business with them, when the opposite was the case.</P>
    <P>Even if the teachers were not prepared to agree to a quota in respect of the number qualifying for early retirement each year, I believe the official side has grossly overestimated the number of teachers who would be likely to avail of an early retirement option.  It would appear this is being done so that the worst possible cost scenario can be used in an effort to mobilise public opinion against the teachers' claim. Rather than engaging in this kind of propaganda, the Government has a clear responsibility to the whole education service to bring the current unrest to an end by putting a realistic offer on the table which will allow the talks to resume and a settlement to be reached.  It is in nobody's interest to allow the present situation to continue to fester over the summer with the inevitable implications which this will have for the coming school year.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a realistic early retirement scheme for teachers would have many beneficial effects, apart from the obvious one that it would enable teachers who no longer feel up to the job to retire with dignity and make way for new blood.  In particular, it would <Col N="1539" /> enhance the attractiveness of teaching as a career, and this is very important. Senator Lee said the teaching profession is playing an ever more central role in our society.</P>
    <P>It is important that the attractiveness of teaching as a career is enhanced. Regrettably, for some years teaching as a career is no longer as sought after as once was the case.  Teachers are no longer seen as being well paid and the perception of teaching as an occupation involving short hours and long holidays no longer exists.  The introduction of a voluntary early retirement scheme would be a significant factor in improving the attractiveness of teaching.  It is disappointing that the matter has dragged on for so long.  I look forward to an early resolution of the difficulties.</P>

      <P>Senator Mullooly prefaced a statement with the phrase &ldquo;the majority of people believe&rdquo;.  I accept that proposition but when one spouts propaganda, as the last speaker did, the majority of people recognise it for what it is.</P>
      <P>Unless I am mistaken &mdash; Senator O'Toole can correct me if I am &mdash; this claim by the teaching profession did not drop from the sky in 1993.  Questions of teacher stress and burn-out have been on the agenda for a considerable time. However six short months ago Senator Mullooly sat on these benches when we discussed this problem and there did not seem to be any burning ambition in Fianna Fáil to deal immediately with this issue.</P>

      <P>I did not interrupt Senator Mullooly because I was interested in hearing history being rewritten.  I am sure there will be a chapter in Senator Lee's next book on how Irish politics is conducted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reality is more basic.  As my colleague Senator Kelly said, this is an <Col N="1540" /> industrial relations dispute which will not be solved on the floor of this or the other House.  All we can do is change Governments; on most occasions we cannot do much to improve the system of Government.</P>
    <P>Teachers have immense power in terms of their impact if they choose to take industrial action.  We have seen similar power exercised in the past by the farming community and ESB workers.  With that power comes awesome responsibility.  I do not want us to take the same approach as the Tory Government in the UK when, in order to fight off legitimate claims by teachers, it systematically degraded teaching as a profession and those working in it, at tremendous cost to that country's social fabric.</P>
    <P>It led not only to a complete loss of morale in the profession but to a total lack of respect from pupils and their parents and has contributed in no small way to making the economy and society of the UK among the worst in Europe. That is not the path we ought to follow and this Government does not intend that.  I am conscious of the presence of the general secretary of the INTO when I say I hope the leadership of the unions are not following that path.</P>
    <P>This matter will be solved in a rational way, within the confines of what is available.  Senator O'Toole said he was not sure there was a gap between himself and the Minister, which is the first indication he was less than certain of it.  He always maintained the gap was small and could easily be bridged; if only the mandarins from the Department of Finance, led by the Minister, Deputy Quinn, gave the money to that decent woman, the Minister for Education, the problem would be over.  Now we are speaking about anything between £2 million and £40 million.</P>
    <P>Eventually Senator O'Toole and his colleagues from the other unions will meet with the Minister and solve the problem.  The big question concerns the children who are the fodder.  The unions were too quick to bring teachers onto the streets and send children home. <Col N="1541" /> There is a climate of expectation of another autumn and winter of discontent.</P>
    <P>The Minister's contribution demonstrated her good will and anxiety to bring about a settlement which is fair to all.  However while she administers schools she does not control them.  She cannot determine whether those children remain in school for the ordinary school week or teachers answer the call of union leaders and send them home. The action was premature and that strike weapon should either be discarded or only used as a last resort. Here it was used in circumstances where Senator O'Toole cannot judge the gap except that it is wider that he said initially&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank those who participated in the debate.  I will clarify some points, beginning with the last speaker.  I appreciate what Senator Magner said but I must clear up some matters.</P>
      <P>I have tried to express myself in language with an even tone.  I did not say the gap was wider or narrower, I said I did not know what it was.  It is unfair and wrong to say that I do not know the assumptions on which calculations were made in the Department of Finance, nor do I know the calculations themselves. I know the bottom line is between £20 million and £30 million, as Senator Lee said earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have made available to the Department of Finance and the Department of Education all my calculations, the assumptions on which they were made and every piece of information I have. If there was an element of parity of esteem when we negotiated we might have found ourselves in a different position. It was only when it was made clear we would not be given the assumptions on which the Department had based its figures that I said I did not know what the gap was.  One actuary in the Department <Col N="1543" /> of Finance said he had based his costings on every teacher living until 95 years of age.  If that is the kind of nonsense on which this is based, the gap is not big because we can quickly root out such non-logical thinking.</P>
    <P>I also think the strike was premature. While the Senator was out of the Chamber I explained it happened because no movement took place. Senator Magner validly asked why we are in this position since these problems have existed for many years.  That is true and I wished to have them off the agenda.  The two advisers from the Department of Education were there during the negotiations for the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> two years ago when I suggested that rather than having running sores year after year, we should agree to deal with them in the course of the programme. We agreed that would be done.  That is why they are now being dealt with and why they could not be dealt with before. I want to get them off the agenda during the course of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> so they are not hanging around forever.</P>
    <P>In terms of the UK problems, I spent two days recently in discussions with the UK teachers' unions and I am well aware of the damage created by such a dispute.  Strike action is an outmoded and useless way of dealing with industrial relations.  I have used every new technique proposed by the Department of Finance and others in the course of this dispute, but I have been wasting my time.  Every time I have tried to make a move it has been presented as negative. The different claims that have been made are being presented as a vacillation or a change in the ball game. Every one of those changes was an attempt to find a compromise, and not one speech from the Minister or one statement on the Government side has recognised that.  It makes it more difficult <Col N="1544" /> for me to go to my members and&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It was arising from those discussions that we insisted the matter be sorted out through the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>
      <P>I thank Senators for their views.  I recognise the validity of the points made by Members on all sides and the commitment to finding a solution.  However, it is important to clear the air on issues. Senator Mullooly made the point on the changing of position during negotiations and the risks we as negotiators took in trying to narrow the position between the Government and us.  There was no reciprocal move from the official side on this issue; there has been no move at all. It is unique in industrial relations to spend two years in negotiation and have no move on the other side.</P>
      <P>I do not know where Senator Kelly researched her contribution but I recognise the point she made about the different roles of the general secretary of the INTO and a Senator.  I advise the Senator to look at the history of her own party and she will find that a previous general secretary as a Member of the other House was leader of the Labour Party.  If the practice started anywhere, it started in the Senator's party.</P>

I would remind Senator Kelly that during the last debate on early retirement the Minister's response drew copiously from the document on stress commissioned and paid for by the teachers' unions, which included the questionnaire sent to the people the Senator mentioned &mdash; although perhaps not in the year she mentioned.  That document is available and I will send it to the Senator.  The general secretary of the ASTI &mdash; the Senator's own union &mdash; would be aware of it.  I will ensure the Senator receives a copy of the document, although I thought she would have been well aware of it having been involved in the previous debate.  We have had long debates in the past on proposals to close post offices, on industrial relations in Arigna, at least three debates on TEAM Aer Lingus&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>With regard to the actuarial considerations, because there is no fund for the scheme half of the £20 million or £30 million extra cost will go back to the Exchequer in taxes and there is also job creation involved.  There are aspects of actuarial costing which have to be examined.  We need to know the basis on which the Department made its calculations and the assumptions it made.</P>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions. I have not had the opportunity to deal with all their points.  It is unfair, unacceptable and leaves no options if the Minister says she is seeking a basis for resuming discussions but that it would hardly be equitable to confine it to one group in the public sector.  I am putting forward a proposal for the teachers.</P>
      <P>The points put forward by Christina Murphy would be rejected by the general secretary of the ASTI, who would not agree in any way.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this matter and stress the need for the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs to convey to the Interparliamentary Conference on East Timor, taking place in Portugal, Ireland's strong stance against the atrocities continuing to be perpetrated against the people of East Timor and Ireland's support for the self-determination of the Timorese people.</P>
      <P>I wish the Members of this House attending the Interparliamentary Conference on East Timor well &mdash; Senator Norris, Senator Henry and Senator Lydon.  The issue has been debated in this House on several occasions and it is right and fitting that the House be represented at this important conference.  It is important to continue to discuss the levels of atrocities committed in East Timor.  The conference in Portugal will play a key role in overcoming the international silence which has enveloped East Timor since the Indonesian invasion in 1975.</P>
      <P>The basic facts ought to be well known, but they are not.  As a direct result of the invasion about 200,000 people &mdash; a third of the population &mdash; have died.  The estimate was made in 1983 by the head of the Roman Catholic Church in East Timor.  What in other countries would be condemned as a crime against humanity has, it seems, been quietly deemed acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1548" /> I wish to acknowledge the Tánaiste's statements to this House in April when he acknowledged the concern in Ireland at the situation in East Timor and at the gross abuse of human rights which has been reported from the area.  International pressure must be mobilised to stop the persecution of the East Timorese people.  Evidence is still coming through of the continuing atrocities.</P>
    <P>On 16 May a male nurse, in an interview with the Australian Associated Press, told of treating victims of torture, rape and beatings by Indonesian soldiers in East Timor while working there for three months this year.  Mr. Simon De Faux from Melbourne told the <i>Age</i> newspaper that he heard from locals that there had been six other massacres following the Dili massacre.  He said he was watched around the clock after arriving there in February and that he was hit by a soldier with a rifle butt when he tried to stop troops beating an eight year old boy.  The boy's injuries were so serious that almost certainly he would have lost an eye.</P>
    <P>Mr. De Faux said on another occasion an officer tried to shoot him after he took photographs of a village market place with a soldier in the background. A local nun stepped in front of the rifle and talked the officer out of it.  Mr. De Faux arrived in the East Timor capital, Dili, on 9 February after the Indonesian authorities would only allow him in as a health worker and not a nurse.  He said he found himself in the middle of a dirty war which was being fought on Australia's doorstep, but no one knew about it.  He quickly found out that the Australian Government did not care.</P>
    <P>He said he secretly treated victims of Indonesian atrocities brought to him. They included women who had been repeatedly raped, men tortured by being tied by the neck to a metal bed and having electric charges sent through their bodies, youths almost drowned in barrels of water and many victims who were badly beaten.  He said that in East <Col N="1549" /> Timor's south area the Timorese were being forced off fertile land to make way for Indonesian migrants.  The Church then moved him to the north which he reached by hiding under pig carcasses in the back of a truck.</P>
    <P>On 8 March the Australian Ambassador to Indonesia, Mr. Alan Taylor, undertook a tour of East Timor.  Mr. De Faux said that a member of Mr. Taylor's staff told him not to talk to the media about his experience.  &ldquo;The Australian was not interested in what I said and told me to keep quiet.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I refer to a report from a source close to the Catholic Church in East Timor, which for obvious reasons must remain anonymous.  This was a briefing on East Timor by the Catholic Church.  During the past six months, since the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation meeting in Jakarta, the situation in East Timor has been extremely volatile with increased numbers of actions by the clandestine urban movement.  This has largely been in the form of demonstrations or mass response to violent or intimidating behaviour by the occupying military forces.  The common view is that this is evidence that the clandestine movement is not only still strong but able to change and adapt to meet the new demands and strategies of the occupying Indonesian forces.</P>
    <P>Two particular killings have had a strong impact in the past three months, the reported massacre in Baucau, outside the parish church in January, and the killing of six civilians in the town of Liquicia in February.  The number of people killed in Baucau is unclear and, as yet, the justice and peace commission of the diocese has made no investigation. A number of sources report that the local Church officials are not happy about reporting this incident for fear of reprisals.</P>
    <P>In Liquicia the opposite was true, with effective reporting from the local parish bringing the killings to international attention and ensuring that the <Col N="1550" /> new Indonesian national human rights commission undertook an immediate investigation.  The report of the commission described the incident as a &ldquo;military engagement&rdquo; and demanded that the military take action against those responsible.  Although little confidence in Indonesian national institutions is expressed by most Timorese, there was a positive response to the commission's report.</P>
    <P>It is likely that more severe penalties will be imposed on the officers responsible for the Liquicia killings than those given to the military responsible for the Santa Cruz killings in 1991 in order to satisfy international opinion.  There are strong rumours that the present military commander in East Timor will be removed and there is some trepidation in regard to who will replace him. However, with the clandestine network as strong as ever, any opportunities to demonstrate rejection of interrogation will continue to be taken and the military will not temper its brutality.</P>
    <P>The Indonesian policy of divide and rule and application of a form of low intensity conflict is having a substantial impact.  The ninja gangs, groups of Timorese youths paid by the military to undertake terrorising gang raids at night on the houses of identified critics of Indonesian interrogation, have produced a heightened sense of fear. Recruits for the ninjas are said to come from the increased numbers of youths involved in martial arts youth culture. The development of martial arts clubs is heavily encouraged by the military and many of them take on a fanatical nature similar to the Alsa Masa militia group in the Philippines.  In the southern town of Suai a litany of ninja gang attacks is reported, although it is difficult to ascertain whether there have been fatalities.</P>
    <P>Since the retirement last year of the town mayor &mdash; a Timorese who had the confidence of the local population and who was replaced by a Javanese military officer &mdash; relations between the local <Col N="1551" /> government and Church have taken a downturn.  A priest complained that three times ninja gangs had trespassed on the parish church compound, but when the police were summoned to give assistance they would not respond.  This is the Church's clear evidence that the police and military are behind the ninja gang activities.  Unlike Dili, no members of the ninja gangs in Suai have yet been caught and shown to be in the pay of the Indonesian authorities.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, it is important to send a message to the interparliamentary conference in Portugal which I hope contributes to the improvement of the situation in East Timor.</P>

      <P>I thank you Sir, for welcoming me to the Chamber this evening.  I also thank Senator Neville, who raised the subject of East Timor and the important Interparliamentary Conference on East Timor which is taking place in Lisbon over the next few days.  I am pleased that a significant number of Senators and Deputies are attending.  I am sure they will articulate the great public concern there is in Ireland about the situation in East Timor, the strong stance the Government has consistently taken against the abuses of human rights there and its wish for a just, lasting and internationally acceptable solution to this major problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste delivered a detailed speech on East Timor to the Seanad on 8 March last.  I take this opportunity to mention briefly some developments in the situation since then.  In March the Tánaiste reported on the fifth round of talks between the Portuguese and Indonesian Foreign Ministers under the auspices of the UN Secretary General on East Timor.  In particular, he drew attention to the initiative of the Secretary General to invite Timorese, both those who accept and those who reject <Col N="1552" /> the Indonesian presence in East Timor, to take part in a dialogue meeting to explore ideas of a practical nature which might have a positive impact on the situation in East Timor.  This important dialogue meeting will now take place from 2-5 June in Austria.  It had to be postponed from April because some of the pro-Indonesian participants withdrew. We are hopeful that this all inclusive Timorese dialogue will represent an important advance towards local autonomy and a better internal situation.  We also hope that these talks will produce results which will be taken into account in the meeting which will follow between the Portuguese and Indonesian Foreign Ministers.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville raises the issue of self-determination for the people of East Timor.  This is a matter for the people engaged in the talks under the auspices of the United Nations.  The Government will support any just, lasting and internationally acceptable solution which emerges from the talks.  I understand that the sixth round of talks between the Foreign Ministers under the auspices of the Secretary General will be held on 8 July.  Ireland will continue to follow developments in these talks closely.</P>
    <P>As was stated by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Gay Mitchell, in the Adjournment debate on East Timor in the Dáil on 24 May, the Embassies of the six Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) sent representatives to meet with the Tánaiste and the Minister for Tourism and Trade on 23 May, one of the regular visits to Ireland of ASEAN Ambassadors in London accredited to Ireland.  The Tánaiste took the opportunity to impress on the Indonesian Ambassador the great concern which exists in Ireland concerning Indonesia's human rights record in East Timor.</P>
    <P>I would also point out that on a recent visit to Jakarta, the Irish Ambassador to <Col N="1553" /> Australia, who is also accredited to Indonesia, raised with the Indonesian authorities Ireland's concerns and drew attention to the intense public feeling in Ireland about human rights atrocities in East Timor.  At a recent meeting of the EU-ASEAN senior officials in Singapore, Irish and EU concerns were also appropriately expressed.</P>
    <P>Senators need not be in any doubt that the Indonesian Government is fully aware of the international concerns that exist about the situation in East Timor, and especially of Ireland's continuing concern.  Again in reference to the Tánaiste's speech to the Seanad of last March, I know that Senators will be interested to note some of the recent comments made by the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Gareth Evans, during an interview which he gave in Parliament House on 16 May 1995.  When asked about human rights abuses in East Timor, his response included the following remarks:</P>
    <P>I don't think that we are turning a blind eye to them.  When we get hard evidence of what is going on, and there has been plenty of that around, ... that only makes us redouble our efforts to try to persuade the Indonesians to make a change of policy.  There is no doubt that there is an oppressive military presence in East Timor far and away beyond that which is needed for the security of the place.</P>
    <P>The truth of the matter is that at the moment there is no visible progress towards the kind of reconciliation strategy that we would all like to see.  I know that a great many people in Indonesia equally want such a strategy, a draw-down of the military presence, a more sensitive development programme, and a whole lot of other things.  A lot of people want to see that happen.  A lot of ministers, a lot of senior officials, and there is an active debate going <Col N="1554" /> on.  But that needs to be translated into action, yes.</P>
    <P>Commenting on the work of the Human Rights Commission in Indonesia, and some recent decisions of the Indonesian Supreme Court, Minister Evans said:</P>
    <P>There is good news and there is bad news...the good news is ... there is a lot of openness, a lot of liberality creeping into the Indonesian system. We want it extended to East Timor, and we will go on making the case in our way, which we think is the most productive, until it happens.</P>
    <P>These comments are both welcome and encouraging.  Australia is in a position to use its special influence with the Indonesian Government to improve the situation in East Timor, and the Foreign Minister's comments demonstrate its willingness to do so.</P>
    <P>The Government remains strongly committed to doing what it can to improve the situation of the people of East Timor.  I know that those of you who are in Lisbon will be able to manifest this commitment and I wish you and the conference every success.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am obliged to the Chair for allowing me and my colleagues, Senator McGennis and Senator Wall, to raise this matter.  Given that three Members will be contributing on <Col N="1555" /> the same topic, I will confine my remarks to three or four minutes.</P>
      <P>The fact that three Senators have raised this issue demonstrates a common cause in respect of this important service which is provided by the Irish Wheelchair Association from its own resources.  It provides training and general counselling of disabled drivers to enable them to fulfil and discharge their role in a full way as citizens, in the same manner as any other person.</P>
      <P>Mobility is the most important precondition for people with disabilities.  If they do not have mobility and access, they are unable to enjoy the rights and entitlements of citizenship that we take for granted.  For that reason, the association, from its own resources and with some support from the State, provides this service.  However, its resources are not nearly adequate to provide the driving tuition, training and equipment which are essential to achieve that result.</P>
      <P>The association currently receives approximately £30,000 in funding, but I understand there is a shortfall of approximately £130,000 in terms of total funding.  We all agree this is an essential service and I understand there is another significant aspect in this regard which I intend to acknowledge this evening.</P>
      <P>I am privileged to be a nominated by the Irish Wheelchair Association as a Member of the Seanad.  The association contacted me this afternoon and indicated, following ongoing discussions with the Minister, that he has indicated his disposition towards making up the difference between the cost of the essential programme and the amount of resources available to the association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not think it would be necessary for me to use much persuasion on the Minister or the Government to acknowledge the importance of this essential service.  In view of the indications I have received, which are a matter <Col N="1556" /> for the Minister to confirm, this Adjournment debate is timely.  It is seldom one can look forward to the conclusion to which I look forward this evening, namely, that the Government will make up the shortfall in funding for this important service for disabled people.</P>

      <P>I express my thanks to the Minister for taking this motion and to Senator O'Kennedy and Senator McGennis for sharing their time.  The driving assessment, training and advice service operated by the Irish Wheelchair Association is a vital ingredient in ensuring independence through mobility and travel for its members.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, public transport in this country is not user friendly in practically all cases in relation to handicapped or wheelchair bound citizens.  The Irish Wheelchair Association has continuously sought funding for the continued operation and expansion of its driving school so that it can assist its members and others who are unfortunate to have a disability.</P>
      <P>To date, funding by the Department of Health has been minimal, with a ratio of 4:1.  In the current environment, it is very difficult for the Irish Wheelchair Association to raise £100,000 annually in addition to fund raising for its everyday working.  I ask the Minister to provide financial assistance to this worthy venture through the Department and the health boards.</P>
      <P>Four tutors are employed by the association and there is a back up service for applications, etc.  The result of their endeavours is happiness for many handicapped people and their families when they achieve success in obtaining their licence.  I have no doubt, if the Minister and his Department express their intention to increase the grant aid, that the association will continue to operate the scheme and fund raise towards its cost.  However, a more equal input must be agreed.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator O'Kennedy and Senator Wall for sharing their time.  As the Fianna Fáil Party spokesperson in the Seanad on Equality and Law Reform, I feel this request from the Irish Wheelchair Association is most important in terms of the fact that people who suffer mobility impairment are not treated equally in this country or elsewhere.  For example, a recent survey showed that people with disabilities show much higher rates of unemployment.</P>
      <P>In its submission, the Irish Wheelchair Association pointed out that there is no such thing as accessible public transport for people with mobility impairment, and wheelchair users in particular.  I am not making a political football of this issue because the association also stated that it has been campaigning on this issue since 1960.</P>
      <P>It would be cruel in the extreme if the association was told that it would not continue to receive funding.  It indicated that the cost of its service is £135,687 and it receives £27,224 in support.  It just cannot continue to provide on a voluntary basis a service which, as I stated earlier during the debate on the Finance Bill, should be the responsibility of Government.</P>
      <P>We must encourage groups such as the Irish Wheelchair Association to continue their fantastic work.  However, the association has stated that it is facing a crisis and that the service will cease on 30 June.  I am not aware if the Minister has good news for the House, but I hope he has because this is a very worthy cause.  I ask him to take the request of the Irish Wheelchair Association on board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for raising this important matter. Driving assessment, training and advice for people with physical disabilities are provided by the Irish Wheelchair Association's driving school.  The <Col N="1558" /> Senators may be aware that a driving instruction course for people with disabilities is also provided by the Disabled Drivers Association of Ireland, which is based in Ballindine, County Mayo.</P>
      <P>The Irish Wheelchair Association raised the matter of funding for the driving school earlier this year and informed the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, that the viability of the school was threatened due to a lack of funding.  The Minister was anxious, as I was myself, to ensure that this service should continue.  Consequently, Department of Health officials were asked to carry out a detailed examination of the matter.</P>
      <P>This involved contacting all the health boards for their views and a request to the Irish Wheelchair Association for detailed information on the operation and cost of the driving instruction course.  Following that examination, new funding arrangements were agreed at a meeting with the association today. I am pleased to inform the Seanad that additional funding of £100,000 is being made available to ensure the continuation of the association's driving assessment and instruction service.  This additional funding will be provided by way of a block grant to the association through the Eastern Health Board towards the core funding of the driving school.</P>
      <P>In addition, the capitation fee, currently £466 per person, will now be payable to all those who undertake a course of driving instruction instead of the previous arrangement where payment was made only to those who passed the driving test.  The new arrangement for capitation will apply also to the driving instruction provided by the Disabled Drivers Association of Ireland in Ballindine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very pleased that this long standing problem has been resolved.  I am confident that the additional funding announced today will ensure the survival of the invaluable services provided <Col N="1559" /> by both driving schools and enable people with mobility impairment to integrate more fully in all aspects of economic and social life.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister. This is certainly welcome news.  The Members who raised this matter are <Col N="1560" /> happy with the response.  We can modestly claim that our initiative had a small part to play.  The response from the Minister and his Department has been what we hoped.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 1 June 1995.</P>
