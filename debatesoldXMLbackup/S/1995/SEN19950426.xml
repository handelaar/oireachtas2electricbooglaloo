      <P>I have notice from Senator McGennis that, on the Adjournment of the House today, she wishes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to sanction a second remedial teacher for Scoil An Chroí Ró Naofa Íosa in Huntstown, Mulhuddart, Dublin 15.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take item 1 and item 12, motion 18.  Item 1 will be taken until 6 p.m. with 20 minutes per speaker.  As this is a Bill with one section it is proposed that, if the Second Stage is completed before 6 p.m., we start Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed.  I am sure the House will agree when I ask the Cathaoirleach to communicate to the American Ambassador our revulsion at the recent events in Oklahoma and our sympathy for the tragic loss of life there.</P>
      <P>I welcome that exploratory talks will now take place between Sinn Féin and the British Government and I hope the House will have an early opportunity to have a further debate on Northern Ireland.  I remind the Leader that he agreed before Easter that we would have an opportunity to discuss the violence at Lansdowne Road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Easter I asked the Leader of the House if he could arrange <Col N="3" /> for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to make a statement to the House on Shannon Aerospace.  At that time negotiations were in progress and the Minister was reluctant to come to the House because of those discussions. A conclusion to those negotiations has been reached and we would like to hear an update from the Minister and have assurances for the future of the 700 jobs in that company.  There is grave doubt as to the commitment of Lufthansa and Swissair to this project and it would be advantageous if the Minister could explain the situation to us at an early opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>Talks are due to take place between the British Government and Sinn Féin and, on behalf of my party, I wish them well.  Before Easter the Leader agreed that the Minister for Health would come to the House to discuss the report of the expert committee. The Joint Committee on Women's Rights discussed it at one of its meetings but it is important that the Minister come to the House as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader if it would be possible for the Minister for Justice to report to us on the serious circumstances that pertain in Cork with regard to drugs.  We should discuss this matter as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Wright referred to the report on the violence at Lansdowne Road and it is appropriate today, while we wish the Irish team well, that the only body to emerge with credit from the report was the fans whose money the FAI insists on keeping.  They ought to have been given a refund or a ticket for tonight's match.  There is no excuse for hanging on to their money. When the report comes before the House I hope the Minister of State with responsibility for sport will tell us of the efforts he has made to recover the money which rightfully belongs to the followers of the Irish team who did not get what they paid for.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Wright's comment in relation to the bombing in Oklahoma.  We saw recently on TV scenes of urban terrorism in Japan.  Perhaps the Leader, when communicating with the Minister for Justice about coming to this House, might raise with her the problem of urban terrorism by cults with political axes to grind.  This is a trend from which, so far, we have escaped although we have had our own forms of terrorism.  Would the Leader ask the Minister for Justice to deal in her address to the House with the steps which are being taken to deal with similar acts of terrorism which may happen in this country?  There is no reason to believe that we will be totally immune from acts of terrorism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>When is it hoped to take the arterial drainage amendment Bill? The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Jim Higgins, who has responsibility for the Office of Public Works, said that this Bill would be initiated in this House at an early stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the decision of the British Government to enter into exploratory talks with Sinn Féin.  While we all understand the sensitivity that needs to be shown in that area, it is only by sitting down, face to face, expressing concerns and explaining positions that progress will be made.</P>
      <P>I support what Senator Daly said about Shannon Aerospace.  It is very welcome that the Government responded so quickly in deciding to put £12 million into the company, and I hope this will safeguard the hundreds of jobs in the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no shortage of money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader for getting the potholes at the gate filled. Unfortunately only two of them were filled and the big one was left.  The Leader might arrange to have Wellingtons provided for the next flood because it will be another two or three years <Col N="5" /> before this pothole is filled.  It took a very long time to get the other two filled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimTownsend" hpid="Mr. Townsend Mr. Townsend">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Townsend</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader will recall that some time ago I asked for a debate on the rural environment protection scheme.  Last year £10 million was made available for this scheme but only £1.4 million was used.  The EU is to finance 75 per cent of the scheme and the Government is to finance the remaining 25 per cent.  I have had representations locally from the IFA, which is anxious to get the scheme under way, and I think a debate on it would be helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Leader had any indication from the Minister of Health when he intends to bring forward the White Paper on mental health?  This matter has been raised here on a number of occasions.  The House is aware that the legislation governing mental health treatment is 50 years old and we have seen the results of this legislation in the last few days. At present there is a controversy between the Department of Justice and the inspector of mental hospitals.  The Minister for Justice should clarify whether political pressure was put on the inspector to withdraw his statement. It is time the Minister for Health brought forward the White Paper on mental health and I ask the Leader to ask him to indicate as soon as possible when this is likely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Miss Ormonde Miss Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to confirm if comprehensive and adequate legislation is being planned to deal with wandering horses.  This is very important.  Would the Leader also confirm whether this legislation would be enacted before the summer recess?  I say this in the light of the number of serious accidents we have had in the last few weeks and the road hazards posed by wandering horses.  This problem is growing to epidemic proportions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader was kind enough to indicate that he would provide <Col N="6" /> Government time to discuss what I consider to be very important items. There are a number of funding agencies and I ask the Leader to allocate time, sooner rather than later, to discuss INTERREG II, Leader II, the Delors package, the peace package and the International Fund for Ireland, all of which are related.  A problem has arisen with regard to these programmes. People are going around the country whipping up interest and offering to act as consultants.  They are approaching the public and local authorities and urging them to commit themselves to present claims or applications for funding. It is important that this issue be debated in the short term.</P>
      <P>Could the Leader also provide time for a debate on the report of the Foyle Fisheries Commission?  This is the only North-South agency and it has existed since 1952.  A reorganisation of the Foyle Fisheries Commission is taking place at present and the British and Irish Governments are spending £400,000 assisting that reorganisation. As it is the only cross-Border agency in existence &mdash; and it is working reasonably well&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to provide time to debate this matter.  It is an opportune time for the House to make recommendations and to assess the value and success of the Foyle Fisheries Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Leader of the House indicate when item 7, the Road Traffic Bill, 1995, will be taken?  What time does he propose to allocate to that Bill?  Would he also take the opportunity to indicate what legislation it is proposed to take during the current session?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Leader of the House ask the Minister for the Environment if he has had any success in getting <Col N="7" /> from Cabinet further funding for county and regional roads?  The Minister made that promise during a debate in this House.  This issue will not go away, despite the best efforts of a more urban oriented media.  This issue is of major concern in rural Ireland and I intend to raise it in the House every chance I get until we get at least an indication of a further allocation of money for county and regional roads, especially in the light of press reports that the National Roads Authority intends to impose tolls on national primary roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>A question for the Leader of the House, Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to be another attempt to take more money through taxation from the hard pressed people of rural Ireland.  In the context of the debate that took place in this House and without being partisan &mdash; this issue crosses party lines &mdash; I ask the Leader to convey to the Minister for the Environment the fact that this continues to be a major problem which must be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise in a dual capacity &mdash; as a member of the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body and as my party's spokesman on Northern Ireland &mdash; to endorse what has been said by colleagues regarding the decision, albeit belated, of the British Government to enter into ministerial talks with Sinn Féin.  I welcome that decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the suggested debate on Northern Ireland, we should consider inviting representatives of the parties in Northern Ireland to attend the debate as our guests.  In particular we should invite members of the Unionist Party.  While the ban on talks with Sinn Féin was an imposed ban, the Unionist Party has, regrettably, a self-imposed ban which absents its members from the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body and we would love to see them playing a meaningful role.  What they will hear <Col N="8" /> at our debate on Northern Ireland would reassure them and might even surprise them.  They will find that the Government's and the Opposition's views are at one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate on the proposed cutbacks in the ESB workforce across the country which were announced by the Minister? This is a very serious matter, particularly in my area and that of Senator Daly, where it is envisaged that the entire workforce of both power stations will be cut by two thirds.  That would be a devastating blow to our area and requires a major debate in this House. The Minister is going in the wrong direction and I call on the Leader to arrange a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Following on the points made by a number of speakers, could I on behalf of the House express our revulsion at what happened in Oklahoma and send our sympathy to all those concerned?  It is an experience which nobody could have envisaged and it brings home to all of us the reality of urban terror, as mentioned by a number of speakers.</P>
      <P>Several speakers raised the question of Northern Ireland and everybody is heartened by the progress of the last few days.  The sensitivity and surehandedness of both the Taoiseach and Tánaiste in their handling of this matter deserves commendation.  A debate here would be useful and I will see if that can be arranged at an early stage.  In reply to Senator O'Kennedy, if it would serve a useful purpose or if people would accept the invitation, it would be very appropriate and worth doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Time will be made available shortly to debate the report on Lansdowne Road.  Senator Daly raised the question of the negotiations and, as I said on the last occasion, it would not have been appropriate to bring the Minister in then.  I believe that the outcome of the negotiations is satisfactory, but I will ask the Minister if he will take some questions <Col N="9" /> here and add further to what is being done.</P>
    <P>A number of requests were made for a debate on health.  I would say to Senator Finneran that I am remiss and I will find out for him the status of the White Paper and return to him very shortly on that.  The Minister for Health has indicated that he will come here for a wide ranging debate on the whole health area.  I will raise Senator Cregan's question on the drugs situation in Cork with the Minister today.  I am quite sure that she would be happy to come here to discuss a situation which horrified people across the country.  Senator Magner raised a number of issues about Lansdowne Road and the FAI which could be discussed during the debate on the report.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke raised the question of the Arterial Drainage Bill, which was promised for this House.  The most up to date information is that the Bill is on course and is almost completed.  It should be finalised in the next week or so and it will then be brought into this House without any delay.  It is on course, give or take a couple of days, as indicated.</P>
    <P>Senator Townsend has asked on a number of occasions for a debate on the rural environment protection scheme and I will do everything in my power to facilitate him.  Senator Ormonde asked about horses and there is a Bill in preparation to curb this menace.  I do not think that it will be available this session but it is fairly high up on the Government's list of Bills to be published, probably during the summer to be taken in the autumn session.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan raised the question of a debate on the various Border schemes and I said to him during the last session that this would be done.  I have spoken to the Tánaiste's Office about that and we will seek to have that debate at a very early stage, certainly ahead of the economic conference in Washington.  I will communicate with the Senator afterwards to see what can be done about the question of the Foyle Fisheries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="10" /> Senator Howard asked about the Road Traffic Bill.  Second Stage will be taken next Wednesday and Thursday, followed by Committee Stage in the normal way.  In reply to Senator Mooney, I will ask the Minister for the Environment to come in and talk about the question of rural roads.  I am not sure if it is appropriate to debate the internal affairs of the ESB here, but I will communicate Senator Dan Kiely's concerns to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard also asked for an indication of the legislation to be taken this session.  In this House at present we have the European Communities (Amendment) Bill, 1995, which will be taken today; the Road Traffic Bill, which I indicated will start next week; the Civil Legal Aid Bill, which is half way through Committee Stage; the Family Law Bill, which is at Committee Stage; the Criminal Law (Incest Proceedings) Bill, which will be completed tomorrow and the Arterial Drainage Bill, which will be a Seanad Bill and will start in the next couple of weeks.</P>
    <P>Other Bills before the Dáil which are due to come here are the Electoral Bill, the Transfer of Sentenced Prisoners Bill, the Finance Bill and the Courts and Court Officers Bill, all of which are for the forthcoming session.  The Refugee Bill, the Casual Trading Bill, the Competition (Amendment) Bill, the Stock Exchange Bill, the Minerals Development Bill, the Ethics in Public Office Bill, the Occupiers Liability Bill, the Package Holiday and Travel Trade Bill and the Consumer Credit Bill is legislation currently in the Lower House which is expected to clear from there over the next couple of weeks.  It will then come directly to this House.</P>
    <P>The Bills expected to be published this session include the Industrial Development Bill, which is to reflect the restructuring of the agency; the Trade Marks Bill, to give effect to EU directives; the Constitutional Amendment (Votes for Emigrants) Bill, to allow for election of three Members to the Seanad by Irish emigrants which must, <Col N="11" /> under the Constitution, start its life in the other House; and the Local Government Sanitary Services (Amendment) Bill and a Waste Bill, to provide a comprehensive modern framework for dealing with waste.  There will also be a Domestic Violence Bill, to extend barring order legislation, the Houses of the Oireachtas (Privileges and Compellability) Bill, to provide privilege for witnesses before Oireachtas committees, an Investment Intermediaries Bill, to provide for regulation of investment intermediaries, a Health (Amendment) Bill, to strengthen the statutory accountability of health boards &mdash; this will be a very important piece of legislation &mdash; and a Health Medicines Board Bill, to restructure the National Drugs Advisory Board.  In addition, the Harbours Bill, which the Minister for Defence and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, promised to Senator Fitzgerald, will be published shortly, will provide for the reorganisation of the commercial ports and will include a Dingle section.  There will also be the Merchant Shipping (Liability of Ship Owners and Others) Bill, a Social Welfare Bill, to provide for changes in advance of the divorce referendum, a Tourist Traffic (Amendment) Bill to implement the recommendations of the Arthur D. Little report&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you a Leas-Chathaoirleach and Members of the Seanad.  The Bill before us today is straightforward.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs has certain statutory functions under the European Communities Act with regard to the supervision of EU secondary legislation. The purpose of the Bill, following the establishment of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs, is to transfer the statutory functions in question exercised by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs.  The transfer of these statutory functions necessitates a simple amendment to the European Communities Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The brief background is that after Ireland joined the European Community in 1973, the statutory function <Col N="13" /> under the European Communities Act was initially exercised by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities. With the establishment of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, the function was transferred to that committee.  The new Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs is now the most appropriate committee to exercise this task.  Secondary legislation plays an important role in the implementation of directives adopted by the EU and it is right that the Oireachtas should continue its constructive role in examining this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs is, of course, far from limited to the supervision of secondary legislation.  It will, in conjunction with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, make a valuable and imaginative contribution across the range of issues arising from Irish membership of the EU.  Yesterday, His Excellency, the President of the Republic of Hungary, Mr. Ápárd Golncz, was on a State visit to Ireland. He addressed the Members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  It was an important and indeed historic occasion and it illustrated the important role of the two committees.</P>
    <P>The decision to establish the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs is a reflection of the importance which the Government attaches to European issues and to the role of the Oireachtas in addressing those issues.  I take this opportunity to wish the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs well in its future work.  It will certainly be kept busy over the coming years and I look forward to working closely with it.</P>
    <P>I do not intend today to dwell in any detail on the array of European issues which we will have many opportunities of discussing over the coming years.  The importance of the issues for Ireland, and <Col N="14" /> the European Union as a whole, is great and the range is impressive.</P>
    <P>I would highlight some of the foremost priorities.  First, the creation of employment must remain our top priority at both national and Union level.  The White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment has identified a number of avenues for progress and these must be followed up imaginatively.</P>
    <P>Second, the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference offers both a challenge and an opportunity for the Union to improve its effectiveness and to begin to equip itself for the challenges of a new century.  Ireland will approach the Intergovernmental Conference imaginatively and constructively.</P>
    <P>Third, the achievement of the economic and monetary union represents a central aim of the Union over the coming years.  Ireland fully supports that aim and will be ready to participate in the third and final phase.</P>
    <P>Fourth, the further enlargement of the European Union to include, among others, the countries of central and eastern Europe, will remain a major priority over the years ahead.  The emergence of democracies with reforming economies in central and eastern Europe means that the political and economic context in which the European Union operates has fundamentally altered.  The countries of central and eastern Europe actively aspire to European Union membership and that aspiration must be met.  Working out the arrangements for this, in a way which preserves the Union's essential achievements and which permits the continuing process of European integration, will occupy much of the European Union's energies in the coming years.  This list of priorities over the coming years is, of course, far from exhaustive.</P>
    <P>Ireland will hold the Presidency of the European Union in the second half of 1996.  We have held the Presidency on four previous occasions.  However, the 1996 Presidency will pose an even greater challenge for the country in organisation and management terms.  It <Col N="15" /> is a challenge which we are glad to accept and confident that we will meet.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to emphasise that Ireland has much to gain from Europe, and I do not mean in narrow financial terms, as well as much to contribute to Europe.  It is vital that we work constantly to increase our knowledge and understanding of European issues.  It is vital that an increase in knowledge and understanding should apply not only to the Government and the Oireachtas but also to the public generally.  That is a priority of the Government.  Only in that way can we reap the rewards while simultaneously making a valuable and informed contribution to the affairs of the European Union.</P>

      <P>We support this legislation.  We do not have any reservations about the fundamental principle behind it.  It ensures that the function in respect of the examination of secondary legislation, hitherto exercised by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, will be transferred to the Joint Committee on European Affairs.</P>
      <P>At the same time, there are some observations that should be made in relation to the practical and effective implementation of that principle.  First, with the establishment of this committee, we now have 17 Oireachtas committees and each has a significant and specific role.  In my experience, over the years and more recently as a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, it is becoming increasingly evident that the capacity of the individual members to effectively attend, much less research and service, these various committees must be questioned.  There is now such a growth in the number and range of activities within these committees that, while nobody is going to question the democratic accountability which is a welcome feature of committee work, there is, in fact, a serious issue to be addressed in relation to the capacity of members to do what we would want them to do in an ideal world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="16" /> In relation to my experience of committees in recent times, which was denied me for longer than I would have wished, I welcome the opportunity to be back on the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and on the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body.  I have noticed, and I would not be discharging my responsibility to the House if I did not report, that attendances are much lower than Members would wish.</P>
    <P>Yesterday we had the privilege of being addressed by the President of Hungary at a joint session of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Joint Committee on European Affairs. The attendance was far below what we would wish to show due recognition to the status both of the speaker and the country he represents.  That was not because people were not interested or showed a lack of respect; it is that we are at the limit of the numerical and other capacities of Members to service these committees.  That point should be made because, if I have a reservation, that is it.  I do not mean this as a point of dogma, much less theology, in respect of this committee because I support the idea behind it.</P>
    <P>It is a pity it was not possible to have a degree of co-ordination between the two committees; perhaps it still may be possible.  As the Tánaiste's introductory remarks have indicated, the range of activities to which we are linked through the European Union is broad.  It extends every day along with the EU and will extend even further with the evolving international position on security and other issues, which changes each day before our eyes.</P>
    <P>One assumes this committee will operate to examine secondary legislation, which is the law giving effect to the political decisions of the EU in so far as they require internal implementation in the member states.  For that reason it will reflect political decisions. It follows that we need effective liaison between the Foreign Affairs and European Affairs Committees so that, even in discharging this function, the European Affairs Committee will be cognisant <Col N="17" /> of the political implications of the issues it considers.</P>
    <P>When we move closer to economic and monetary union, a long cherished but much delayed ambition, presumably it will be brought into effect through secondary legislation &mdash; some of the measures will be passed in statutory form by the Oireachtas but much secondary legislation will be involved.  The implications of this are enormous.</P>
    <P>This is only one case where we need to take due account of this at political level, which is the role of the Foreign Affairs Committee.  That works with a degree of consensus, not just in a bipartisan but in a multi-partisan manner. The range of views is not based on party positions as much as individual views. That will help to inform our views both in the House and on the committees.</P>
    <P>This week alone many issues have arisen in Europe.  For instance, the EU fisheries dispute with Canada was settled, which is a major issue for all of us.  In time that will involve a formal agreement which will be implemented by each member state.  Each country will have rights and responsibilities in patrolling, in regard to total allowable catches, etc.  That will probably feature in secondary legislation; it is not for me to specify in what sense.  Again, this is a political decision being transformed into legislation, and co-ordination is necessary because one cannot operate in isolation from the other.</P>
    <P>New developments are taking place across the spectrum.  I am looking at <i>This Week in Europe</i>, issued by the European Commission, and I see a paragraph headed &ldquo;European Union &mdash; Tunisia free trade deal concluded&rdquo; and another headed &ldquo;New chapter in European Union &mdash; China relations&rdquo;.  Many of these developments will impact here over time.  Political decisions arising from these developments will in many cases require probable inclusion in secondary legislation.  Although this new committee is taking responsibility for certain areas which were previously within the remit of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, it is essential that <Col N="18" /> liaison between the Foreign Affairs Committee and the European Affairs Committee be maintained.  I know the Tánaiste and his Department are conscious of this.</P>
    <P>I wish to make some other points while I have the opportunity.  It is not anticipated that this committee will incur cost for the State; it will not have financial or staffing implications.  I am glad to hear that; I hope it can be demonstrated and that it will turn out to be the case.  Where committees serve a useful function they must be staffed and financed, but we have noticed that there has been a steady growth in staffing in recent times, reflected, I would have thought, in the financial costs of servicing these committees and constituting a burden, if I may call it that, on the Departments directly involved.  I welcome that this change does not appear to have either staffing or financial implications. If that were to be the case then we would be at risk of overwhelming not just the parliamentary system with this new committee system but also of adding to cost burdens at a time when everybody recognises that very strict and consistent control of public expenditure must be a feature of our economic management.</P>
    <P>I wish to mention some matters which are topical at this point, as the Tánaiste has done.  I wish to deal with enlargement. We will have another opportunity to discuss the major issues involved in enlargement, so it would be inappropriate for me today to use this opportunity to deal with this or any other issue in detail, but I wish to make one or two practical points in terms of administration. I regret that I did not have the opportunity of asking the Hungarian President about this when he was here. We are talking about embracing an extra 100 million people from Hungary, Slovakia, Slovenia and Romania, peoples who are really at the core of Europe.  We have never had the right and certainly do not have the right now to tell them that they are going to upset the cosy set-up in the European Union, <Col N="19" /> in which we have been involved since 1972.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that observations made yesterday suggested that Hungary is on the periphery of Europe.  I found it quite amusing that a country right at the centre of Europe, in terms of its cultural role, its historical role and its geographical place, was described as being on the periphery.  However, it did illustrate that the extension of Europe almost to the Urals is to be the reality of the European Union if the political direction now being pursued is achieved.  Major practical economic and financial implications have to be addressed in that light.  Yesterday I was conscious of one in particular while listening to the President of Hungary and the translation.  At present there are nine official languages in the European Union.  I know from my considerable experience that, in terms of internal negotiations in the Union, at least 60 per cent of the time is taken up waiting for translations or facilitating translations and interpretations of what is agreed at each stage.</P>
    <P>The classic example is the Council of Agriculture Ministers.  It is not that each of the 12 Ministers for Agriculture is at each other's throats all night but if agreement in principle is reached at 12 midnight or 1 a.m., there is a three or four hour lapse until that agreement is translated into documentary form to be put before each member state.  It is a considerable achievement in itself to get the translation into the language of every member state.  This is what causes the great delay at Council level.</P>
    <P>I addressed this issue in my capacity as a European Commissioner in 1980-81, when I had responsibility for administration and personnel.  Even then over 60 per cent of the staff of the European Commission were, in one way or another, involved in linguistic or interpretation activities.  For example, there were people who were jurisprudence experts in law and language.  The delays involved are enormous.  This is an area to which we could make an effective <Col N="20" /> and practical contribution in relation to the proposed enlargement.</P>
    <P>The President of Hungary said yesterday that enlargement would involve approximately another 100 million people.  This means a European Union involving 460-500 million people.  This can be coped with if reasonable machinery is in place to give administrative effect to the political decisions which are reached.  I do not have many reservations about reaching political consensus. As things change, one finds an extraordinary degree of determination to find political consensus.  The best example of this was in the early fifties when the European Community was set up and people who hitherto were enemies found a degree of internal cohesion.</P>
    <P>What I have seen in my experience of the European Union since the 1970s encourages me to think that there will be political cohesion if the Union is enlarged and extended to the east, north and south.  There will be problems and differences but unless the entire EU administration is examined now, effective and efficient administration of an enlarged Union will not be achieved.</P>
    <P>At present, the Union is creaking under the weight of administration.  The linguistic requirements, as they currently stand, are such as to bring it almost to a standstill on occasion.  In the light of the applicant countries, the Government could take an initiative in this regard; Ireland is uniquely placed to do this.  We should approach our partners and suggest that if an enlarged Union is to become a reality we should determine now that there should be, say, four working languages in the European Union.  We do not need to translate every single document into every language, otherwise it is interpreters or translators that we require, not political leaders or administrators.  That reality has to be faced and the applicant countries should be made aware of that priority.  I thought that I would mention those points at this stage.  It is not appropriate on a Bill that we support to range any further than that, but when we look at the various laws and regulations that <Col N="21" /> have to be translated into our own law, the issues that I have touched on may arise sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>I welcome and support this Bill, but I hope the Minister and his Department can take account of the points I made, particularly on the liaison with the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and the need to ensure that there is no overlapping or duplication.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to see that this Bill will have all party support because it is only dealing with a practical administrative matter which must be put in order for the benefit of the procedures in the House.</P>
      <P>It is essential, desirable and necessary that one would have a Joint Committee on European Affairs and a Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  They may overlap to a large extent, but they are nevertheless separate and distinct committees. As Senator O'Kennedy has rightly pointed out, the volume of documents and amount of material obtained from the EU are such that only one committee could adequately manage to cope with it all.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and the volume of materials I receive is such that it is difficult to keep abreast of what is happening in this sector alone.  I spoke recently to a number of people at local authority level, such as county managers and county secretaries, and they are also having great difficulty in keeping abreast of the changes in the legislation that is affecting them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I was asked what issue poses the greatest challenge to Europe at the moment, I would, say it is the environmental issue.  Today is the ninth anniversary of the Chernobyl incident and 125,000 lives were lost on that occasion. In fact, from what I read of the incident at the time, this figure could have been far greater.  Reports of that explosion seemed to suggest that babies born after that incident have had serious problems. New diseases that were never heard of before and many types of cancers have come about because of this explosion. That nuclear power station is still in <Col N="22" /> existence and a concerted effort should be made by members of the European Parliament to ensure that it is made safe immediately and that all practical efforts should be made to achieve that. A sizeable investment should be made by the European Union to try to remedy to some extent the worst excesses of this incident.</P>
    <P>We have succeeded in getting freedom of movement among the member states of the European Union, but our air is being polluted and radiation is being spread across Europe and that needs no freedom of movement.  It does not recognise borders, but it affects everybody.  It will not only affect us now, but future generations.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Government is taking a strong line as regards Sellafield because of the damage it is doing to the Irish Sea and along the east coast. Nuclear power stations located along the British coast are closer to Ireland than the main population centres in Britain.  A positive line needs to be taken on the areas of environment and energy and I hope this will be examined.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste spoke about employment, which is important.  Efforts have been made and I congratulate the Government and the European Parliament on the Leader programme.  Later this week the Minister of State is to launch initiatives in relation to the partnership areas and also employment, which is welcome.  Those programmes are trying to keep people in the areas where they were brought up, which must be encouraged.  These are an incentive to keep people there and are also of benefit to the cities, which are overcrowded.  People are moving &mdash; and not only in Ireland &mdash; from rural areas to villages and small towns and then to larger towns.  In 15 or 20 years time there will only be county towns or a number of major centres in larger counties like Cork, Galway and Mayo.  Small villages will be completely denuded of people.</P>
    <P>As regards the social structure in rural areas, the numbers involved in sport &mdash; for example, hurling and rugby <Col N="23" />&mdash; have declined.  People who in the past married and lived in these areas are now moving to villages and towns.  I do not know whether Europe can assist in solving that problem.  The Leader and the partnership programmes are of benefit in this regard.  What has happened in France and Italy, where villages are like ghost towns, shows how serious the situation is.  Government policy involves decentralisation.  It is equally important that an effort is made by Europe to ensure people move from cities to rural areas.  It is important that facilities, services and offices are located in peripheral areas, which will benefit communities.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste believes the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs will be able to play a major role in economic and monetary affairs.  It is important to achieve economic and monetary union, but we must be careful to get the balance right.  We do not want one currency to take over the economic and monetary union or one country to have all the say.</P>
    <P>Interest rates and the strength of different currencies will lead to serious problems and rivalry.  One can see major problems arising with the Deutsche mark as against sterling, the French franc, the peseta, the lira, etc.  If the currency problems we experienced two years ago when interest rates were in the region of 50 to 100 per cent recur, industries and economies will be wrecked.  If interest rates continued at that level for three or four months, our economy would be devastated.  This is a small nation and our strength lies in the economic and monetary union which would avoid the worst excesses of the currency markets.  I listened with interest to the former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, when this happened. People said he should do something about interest rates.  However, he made the point &mdash; and he was correct &mdash; that because the currency markets were so volatile, we could do nothing to save ourselves from what was happening. People at ministerial and other levels <Col N="24" /> must make a serious effort to achieve monetary union as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I will not discuss this matter at length because everyone agrees with this Bill, which I welcome and support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire.  I welcome the legislation and I will comment briefly on the Tánaiste's speech, with a glance at what Senator O'Kennedy and Senator Enright said.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State may remember the debate we had before Christmas when the first priority highlighted by the Tánaiste was that the creation of employment must remain our top priority and that the White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment had identified a number of avenues for progress which must be followed up imaginatively.  At that time some of us said the White Paper was strong on aspiration and relatively short on specific policies which might promise effective results.  I am not sure that much has happened in the intervening months for us to revise that comment, but we hope for the best in European and national affairs on these matters. Perhaps the present international upturn will allow us to claim credit for development policies which might have occurred anyway.</P>
      <P>The Intergovernmental Conference offers a challenge and an opportunity and Ireland will approach the conference imaginatively and constructively. Will the day ever come when we say we will approach things unimaginatively and destructively?  I will move on rapidly, having made those unworthy observations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A more serious issue is the achievement of Economic and Monetary Union.  Senator Enright correctly highlighted the possible difficulties.  I support our policy on economic and monetary union and I believe we should aim to participate fully in the third and final phase.  However, we face a serious problem in terms of the United Kingdom's position.  I will not speak derisively about the UK's European policy; it faces its own problems and if <Col N="25" /> some of those are self-inflicted, we should not talk about them.</P>
    <P>It seems we should &mdash; I presume and hope we are &mdash; working hard on contingency plans in case a sharp divergence of approach occurs between the UK and Ireland when approaches must finally be decided.  The implications for us if the UK does not go the way we would wish it and ourselves to go are potentially serious.  Everyone knows this, although I do not know what we can do about it or if we can take realistic steps in advance to try to limit the damage which might arise if we go in different directions.  However, it seems to be one of the major issues confronting the formulation of our foreign policy in general and our economic policy in particular.</P>
    <P>I hope there is close co-ordination between the relevant Departments contemplating that maligned scenario if it comes to that.  I do not believe in expecting maligned scenarios until they happen because we do not know how many changes can occur politically and economically.  However, that remains a simmering, underlying problem in terms of Ireland's relations with the EU and it could explode in our face at any time once serious negotiations begin.  I hope we have more than aspiration to support our position if and when the crunch comes.</P>
    <P>I listened with great interest to Senator O'Kennedy's warm welcome for the legitimate aspirations of the countries of central and eastern Europe to become members.  I share his views because I do not believe that we, as Europeans, have a right to try to block or to slow down the pace of closer connection between eastern Europe and the EU.  Even if we could, we should not.</P>
    <P>We have a direct interest in trying to ensure that we do not suffer from the consequences of the changed regimes, particularly in agriculture, which will inevitably be necessary to accommodate those countries.  I hope the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, the Department of Foreign Affairs, the <Col N="26" /> Department of Finance and, when the time comes, the Cabinet are thinking of the most effective negotiating position which Ireland can adopt consonant with our commitment to the European Union and to supporting the legitimate aspirations of these countries.  We must accept some changes in agricultural policy in particular hut, at the same time, it is not fair to expect our agricultural community to bear the burden of abrupt change.</P>
    <P>How can one negotiate the most effective transitional arrangements for the eastern European countries and for those sectors of our own economy which will be affected?  We are entitled to demand adequate compensation, although I do not like using that term because it tends to be linked with the begging bowl mentality.  However, this is not a begging bowl position but a legitimate aspiration to ensure that a significant sector of our economy does not suffer from measures which must be taken.</P>
    <P>It was also instructive to hear Senator O'Kennedy refer to the Hungarian President's image of the Hungarians as being on the periphery of Europe.  It serves to remind us that for many years we used the argument of being on the periphery as an excuse for either demanding more or excusing our performance. Our peripheral geographic location is a disadvantage in some areas and we are legitimately entitled to claim recognition of that.  However, &ldquo;core&rdquo; and &ldquo;periphery&rdquo; in a European context, as that comment by the Hungarian President reminded us, is at least as much psychological as geographical.  As a successful member of the European Union for more than 20 years which is now contributing as much as it is taking in general, not financial terms, Ireland is entitled to indulge in a self-image as being central to the European Union and the ambition of moving towards an ever closer union rather than thinking of ourselves in a post-colonial sense as being peripheral, always at the end of the queue and deserving constant compensation. The psychological shift, <Col N="27" /> which is already occurring, should be reinforced by the Government's position, attitudes and vocabulary.  I welcome the fact that it is happening to some extent in this and other documents that the Tánaiste has laid before us.</P>
    <P>Senator Enright referred movingly to the implications for environmental policy on this, the ninth anniversary of Chernobyl.  The membership of central and eastern European countries will have major implications for environmental policy in the European Union. Anybody who heard Adi Roche on the <i>Pat Kenny Show</i> this morning reporting from Chernobyl on the continuing horrific consequences, including deformed babies, cannot but be moved by their plight and must take seriously the implications for environmental policy.</P>
    <P>The question of language policy in the European Union is one which I disagree with Senator O'Kennedy on, at least in terms of the pace of change he was suggesting. From a purely administrative viewpoint one can see the advantage of having a limited number of official working languages; he suggested four. The European Union, however, is about much more than administrative efficiency or convenience, although that is important at its own level.  In many respects it is about the way in which the identities of individual cultures can be reconciled with a move towards what is termed, in the fashionable rhetoric, an &ldquo;ever closer union&rdquo;.  Moving in that direction, without serious reflection on the implications and the message being given to citizens of the European Union, would be potentially dangerous and would add to the potential for backlash against the Union which now exists in a number of countries and regions.</P>
    <P>Without wishing to be dogmatic, it is an area which we should be careful about, but I would be loath to see Ireland taking a lead in suggesting that. While we have a specific language situation which some of us would feel has not been adequately represented at European Union level over the years, I will not linger over that.  In the wider European <Col N="28" /> dimension, we must ensure that citizens of Europe feel they are full members of the Union.  They should not feel, as many already do, that there is a growing distance between them and the centre, and we saw some of the backlash to this in the initial responses to Maastricht. An issue could be made by those who want to oppose the movement towards an ever closer union, which I support, that ill-considered steps were taken prematurely towards what I would call linguistic centralisation in the administration practices of the EU.</P>
    <P>We have held the EU Presidency four times, and one accepts what the Tánaiste says about an even greater challenge facing us now.  One of the components of that challenge is the fact that we have discharged the responsibility of the Presidency, and are perceived as having discharged it, so effectively. An Irish EU Presidency is now expected to be a good and effective one, but that was not necessarily the case on the first occasion nor on some subsequent occasions.  There is now a burden of expectation on our politicians and officials that adds to the pressure on them to achieve an effective Presidency. It may be that an equally effective performance next time round will not receive the same degree of recognition as on earlier occasions.</P>
    <P>I have some sympathy with those responsible for carrying that out.  They are entitled to whatever organisational assistance and resources they need.  The Government should keep that in mind, because the Presidency is now a showpiece for Irish diplomacy and one that we are well capable of discharging provided that we approach it in that manner.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy made valid comments on the dangers of the emerging committee system.  I am a strong supporter of the system, but if the committees are not effectively worked by the Members and if they are not effectively resourced, then they will discredit the committee system itself.  I hesitate to think that there could be, but there may be, those in the political system &mdash; and, <Col N="29" /> dare one say it, even the administrative system &mdash; who are prepared to stoically endure the discomfiture of committees from time to time.  However, if we are to have the type of co-operation at all levels of decision making from ministerial through the Oireachtas to the public service, it is more important that they should wish to co-operate and see each other serviced properly than that they would try to snatch short term advantage over particular issues as one or other may feel tempted to do at various times.</P>
    <P>If the Tánaiste &mdash; and I take his word for it &mdash; is aptly committed to trying to increase, as he says, &ldquo;knowledge and understanding of European issues&rdquo; not only in the Government and the Oireachtas but among the public generally, then this committee could play an important, constructive role in that respect if it so wishes, if it operates by consensus and if it feels that it has the full support of both the Government and the public servants.  If, however, there is a fear of lack of support from the public service for Oireachtas committee work, many more members of these committees will be inclined to engage in solo runs and exploit them for short term purposes.</P>
    <P>When one looks back at the degree of information that was provided to the public before the Maastricht referendum, one can see the opportunity that exists for enhancing public understanding and increasing knowledge.  I do not doubt that from a purely short term party political point of view the then Government handled the Maastricht referendum issues quite skilfully. However, from a national point of view it was a missed opportunity.  It was badly handled and there should be no repetition whatever of approaching the Intergovernmental Conference from the perspective of keeping the public, for practical purposes, in the dark as far as possible and of discussing issues only when one could not avoid discussing them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="30" /> I hope that the circumstances this time will not be such as either to tempt or oblige the Government to proceed along those paths.  I hope that this Oireachtas committee will play a constructive role in ensuring that if anybody were tempted to pursue that path, it will not happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Gay Mitchell, to the Seanad.  I support this Bill because the formation of a Joint Committee on European Affairs is necessary.  In the past, before the expansion of the European Union to its current size, matters relating to Europe were dealt with by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs. At one stage the EC had six members. When we joined it went up to nine, and was later enlarged to 12 in the 1980s. Now, under the new name of the European Union, it has 15 members.</P>
      <P>With the Maastricht Treaty, European issues are becoming of the utmost importance for us, and thus a Joint Committee on European Affairs is a necessity.  The Members of this committee, of which I am one, will do their work properly, getting us more involved in European affairs.</P>
      <P>There is a great need for communication between, on the one side, Brussels, Strasbourg and Luxembourg &mdash; or, if you want to put it another way, the London-Paris-Brussels triangle &mdash; and the man in the street.  What is happening in Europe is not translating down to the man in the street, the field, the factory or the unemployed, not to mention our educational facilities.  Local authorities need more information from Europe to disseminate to the local electorate.  The European Affairs Committee can play a big role in the diffusion of knowledge about European affairs to the people and to the local and regional authorities.</P>
      <P>Further expansion of the EU will take place.  The President of Hungary was here yesterday and countries such as his in central and eastern Europe are looking for membership of the EU.  This will be important for the role of the Joint Committee on European Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="31" /> The advent of democracy in eastern and central Europe has not been without great hardship due to economic and political upheavals.  Some countries disappeared; new powers emerged in some countries such as Poland, Hungary and Romania; there was a peaceful division of Czechoslovakia and a violent division of Yugoslavia.  A ten year old atlas is now of little use with regard to eastern Europe &mdash; Slovenia, Slovakia and the Czech Republic did not exist then.  With the expansion into eastern Europe of the EU and the complex difficulties that may be encountered there, we need a committee to deal solely with European affairs.</P>
    <P>An increasing number of our people are going to Europe for employment. We have always had emigration, mainly to English speaking areas such as Britain, North America and Australia, but more people are now going to EU countries for employment.  We need to keep in close contact with them, especially people in this House as they may have votes for the next Seanad election.  Those working in Europe need somebody to speak for them and the European Affairs Committee may provide a voice for them.</P>
    <P>Europe has a long complex history involving political, religious, ethnic and national turmoil through the years.  The EU is removing a great deal of the conflict and perhaps, as somebody said earlier, a Europe stretching to the Urals as one political entity will remove the conflicts between racial groups which were the cause of many wars in the past.  The Joint Committee on European Affairs can play a big role in dealing with European matters.</P>
    <P>As regards the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference a lot of work can be done by this committee and the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, to deal with matters of particular importance to Ireland.</P>
    <P>When there were 12 member states of the EU somebody worked out that if a person left Dublin with £100 and just changed it in the EU capitals to the relevant <Col N="32" /> currency, by the time he arrived back in Dublin he would have £47. Given that there now another three member states, that sum would be even less, and if we included some of the eastern European countries we might have nothing left.  An economic and monetary union is a necessity.  It is difficult for those trading with foreign countries to counteract the effect of currency changes.  Monetary union should and will take place.</P>
    <P>It is important to give people information about the Commission initiatives, such as PETRA or Leader.  It is our duty to inform people about such schemes and the operational programmes and EU funds.  I welcome this Bill.</P>

      <P>I welcome this amending legislation to allow the Joint Committee on European Affairs to be structured to allow the transfer of some of the remit of the Foreign Affairs Committee. I am a member of the European Affairs Committee and I am pleased that I will have a contribution to make in my field.</P>
      <P>I am concerned, however, that we may be getting too fond of committees. If we cannot resolve a matter we set up another committee to discuss it &mdash; I admit to being guilty of this approach myself.  If we keep forming committees to discuss issues it may cause problems in the future.  That said, this committee is important at this time.  We are approaching the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference and many EU policies will have to be reviewed and analysed.</P>
      <P>I will be anxious to make an input in education and occupational mobility in Europe.  The Single Market has enormous potential for all of us, particularly the many EU programmes.  We are removing barriers to allow young people to move around Europe more easily than in the past.  The Single Market has given us many opportunities to look at our education structure to see how best the various programmes can complement each other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="33" /> We now no longer have planning at local level with regard to job opportunities or recruitment of candidates for Europe.  We are now dealing with this on an international basis.  Many programmes have come on stream, particularly the network of programmes under the umbrella of the Socrates Group which embraces ERASMUS, COMET, TEMPUS and PETRA.  I would want to make a contribution in the area of student exchange and the opportunities available for young people not alone before they have completed their second level education but in the transition stages between second and third level and between third level and obtaining a job.</P>
    <P>As some speakers have said, the problem is that information is not processed down to the man in the street and to educational and vocational institutions.  We do not even understand the jargon as to what information is available and who we can contact.  Very few people know about the COMET programme for vocational training. People are now only familiarising themselves with the PETRA programme, which is another opportunity to get involved in vocational training.</P>
    <P>I understand the TEMPUS programme is being extended to the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland.  Many Irish people are setting up offices in the eastern bloc to see if we can take part in exchange training programmes.  We are now embracing eastern Europe and looking at how we can help in the development of new democracies and to develop market economies there.  We have a huge role to play in this area.</P>
    <P>I am glad I will be a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs.  I will do my best to ensure we hold our pivotal role and power in the European Commission and the Council of Ministers in case it is eroded, that there will be associated membership of the EU for eastern European countries, that we will open our doors <Col N="34" /> to them and that there will be trading possibilities for them.  Ireland is one of the key members of the EU.  I would like to think that we would not only enhance our own position but would also make a contribution to the eastern bloc so that we would not be vulnerable at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>I am particularly anxious about educational and vocational mobility.  With regard to the programmes which are now set up, a delegation from the Department of Education will represent our position. The Socrates umbrella group hopes it will be the key group to monitor programmes designed to enhance mobility and to make sure that people who are skilled professionals will have opportunities not alone to move from one country to another but to take up positions in other countries and not be faced with barriers because their educational qualifications may not be accepted.</P>
    <P>If we are to open up the EU market we must make sure there is harmonisation of qualifications.  This is very important.  There is no point acquiring a third level education here if other member states question it.  We must move quickly to ensure harmonisation of all third level qualifications and allow people to avail of exchanges with equivalent universities or institutions in other countries.  This matter needs to be tightened up.</P>
    <P>I hope the necessary legislation will be discussed by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs, which will have an opportunity to discuss EU secondary legislation.  We must not be loose on such issues, particularly in the light of next year's Intergovernmental Conference.  Our young people must have the opportunity to move from one country to another and have easy access to information, perhaps in the form of a handbook, about where they are going, and they must not be inhibited by the fact that we are not part of mainland Europe.  Because we are disadvantaged by not being part of the European mainland, we will be vulnerable if we do not have information and a computer data base on learning programmes, in-service <Col N="35" /> programmes and all aspects of aids to movement between Ireland and Europe to help people who wish to work in Europe.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and hope it will have teeth.  I hate talking but I like action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important legislation.  I also welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Gay Mitchell. It is important that this legislation was initiated in the Seanad because it makes the House more relevant.  This is something to which we are constantly aspiring and on which this Government is very positive.</P>
      <P>This Bill provides the necessary statutory base for the work of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs. It is extremely important that matters relating to the functioning of the EU, proposals put forward by the European Commission, drafts of legislative proposals and legislation which has been passed are given proper parliamentary scrutiny and examination by the committee system in the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Two areas in particular deserve attention by the committee.  Attention must be devoted to directives, proposed legislation and proposals emanating from the Commission and being considered by the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament.  The pace at which EU legislation is transposed into national legislation deserves close examination and special attention.  It is true to say that we have been found extremely wanting in the recent past on transferring EU legislation into national law.  The Government will have to pay particular attention to this and the committee can assist the Government and the Oireachtas in ensuring that this is done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government should allow a completely open debate on the Commission's proposals.  In the past interest groups frequently made their submissions on proposals long before any parliamentary debate or scrutiny took <Col N="36" /> place.  This is a most unsatisfactory state of affairs.  Proposals have usually reached such an advanced stage by the time the parliamentary system gets to examine them that there is very little opportunity to introduce amendments. This needs to be rectified quickly.  Earlier political debate would be desirable in order to identify possible drawbacks from an Irish point of view and to improve the legislation.</P>
    <P>I am glad to acknowledge that the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs has shown a disposition to be more open by having widespread public debate on the preparation of the White Paper on foreign policy.  This is a welcome development.  He and his Cabinet colleagues should adopt the same approach to the more tedious and less glamorous but no less important task of scrutinising EU legislation and proposals for such legislation.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Tánaiste's disposition to openness extends to preparations for the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference. I hope that both the Tánaiste and the Minister of State, Deputy Gay Mitchell, our representatives on the reflection group, will have extensive and open discussions with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs on the matters to be discussed at the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister of State every success because I know he has particular responsibility for the management and co-ordination of the Irish Presidency in 1996, which is very important not just for Ireland but for Europe.  I have every confidence he will do an excellent job and that we will be proud of our Presidency as we were in the past.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste has shown a welcome and refreshing willingness to think in new and creative ways about security and defence issues.  His speech at a recent seminar in UCD and his article in the current issue of the newspaper <i>Signal</i> show a willingness to ensure that Ireland plays a full role in identifying appropriate policies in this crucial area in the new post-Cold War situation. That same freshness of approach is <Col N="37" /> called for in relation to the enlargement of the European Union and the specification of the institutional arrangements necessary to deal with this enlargement and with the democratic deficit which became so glaringly obvious during the Maastricht referendum debate.</P>
    <P>Ireland needs a cohesive European Union with a genuine commitment to social and economic equity for all its regions.  Neither we nor other peripheral member states, nor future member states, need a European Union that opts for the easy, two speed answer.  That course would run the serious risk of accentuating and perpetuating disparities between the regions and between member states.  It would run counter to the principle of cohesion which we fought so hard and so successfully to have included in the Single European Act and which was specifically and deliberately included in the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>These and other issues must be fully debated even if, in some cases, they give rise to differences of views in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  These differences, if properly explored and debated, will provide a far better basis for policy than a superficially cosy consensus which ignores the real issues.  Opting for the easy way out is not the responsible position to adopt for the long-term national interest.  All these matters can be successfully discussed in the Committees on Foreign Affairs and European Affairs.  It is important that both committees are used to their full potential over the coming months and years.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to hear the Tánaiste say that he looks forward to working closely with the committees.  It is important that there is interaction between the committees, the Minister and the Department of Foreign Affairs in this sensitive political area.  Equally, there is a need for a constructive and open discussion in which all aspects are properly and closely examined.  The issue should be debated everywhere and whatever final conclusions are arrived at should be in the best interests of Ireland and of Europe.  That must be our primary <Col N="38" /> consideration.  We must also remember that we have always been committed Europeans and we must not shirk our responsibilities as Europeans. If the Irish people are given the proper leadership on this issue we can arrive at a successful conclusion.  The committees, the Minister and the Oireachtas have a role in that respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and I welcome the Minister.  The Bill will lead to more and better discussion about the fundamental issues regarding our relationship with the European Union as it evolves in the next few years.</P>
      <P>I will take this opportunity to highlight a matter that is not getting the attention and discussion it deserves &mdash; economic and monetary union.  The recent turbulence in the currency markets should remind us that the question of whether we join the economic and monetary union, if and when it emerges, is a crunch issue for Ireland.  If we do not address the issue now and take whatever action is necessary, we will find ourselves controlled by other events and we will find ourselves unable to exercise any real choice in the way we should proceed.  That is not how we should let the future of our country be determined.</P>
      <P>Realistically, the next stage of economic and monetary union will not happen until the year 1999.  The original date of 1997 is out the window. However, as 1999 is the new key date, there is a big temptation &mdash; and we have been suckers for this temptation in the past &mdash; to think that we need not make any decisions at this stage or that we need not take any action until nearer that date.  Nothing could be further from the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Until now discussion on economic and monetary union has been divorced from reality in one important sense.  The official line has been that we are in favour of economic and monetary union, that we are committed to participate in it if we qualify and that we should continue working hard to ensure that we do qualify by meeting all the convergent <Col N="39" /> criteria set out in the Maastricht Treaty. The implication is that the only issue is whether we can get in and whether we can meet those criteria.  The reality, however, is quite different.  The real issue is not whether we can meet the Maastricht criteria; it is about how we will cope with the challenges of the relationship between the Irish punt and sterling.  The currency crisis of two years ago and the renewed turbulence in the past few months in the currency markets should leave us in no doubt that this is the real issue facing us.</P>
    <P>The UK is our main trading partner both in imports and exports.  It is a particularly important market for Irish owned companies.  We now realise that Irish owned companies are the key to our future and that over 40 per cent of their exports go to the UK compared with less than 30 per cent of our exports overall.  The present commercial reality is that when sterling fluctuates we must follow or we cause enormous problems for Irish exporters.  Over the past few months our currency has been devalued against the German mark.  We have devalued even against the French franc, the EMS currency supposed to be in trouble at present.  These devaluations have happened because, to all practical purposes, we are tied to sterling.  That is the present reality.</P>
    <P>Let us think of what happens under economic and monetary union.  If we join the economic and monetary union &mdash; which we are committed to do and for which we are working hard to qualify &mdash; we will be tied irrevocably to the EMS currencies.  In effect, we will be tied to the German mark in a stranglehold grip.  However, if we join and the UK does not we will have lost the freedom to track the currency of our main trading partner, a partner of the utmost importance to indigenous industries. The UK has the option, under the Maastricht Treaty, of not joining the economic and monetary union and it looks increasingly as if the UK will not join.  If we are locked within the economic and monetary union and the UK <Col N="40" /> is outside, we will lose the ability to keep our costs in line with the UK through keeping our currencies in step.</P>
    <P>I spoke recently about central European time and said that we should be willing to leave the nursery even if nanny does not come with us.  I am not sure that we are quite as willing to leave the nursery of our link with sterling if nanny does not come with us unless we have thought it out carefully.  If sterling goes down our goods and services will become less competitive in the UK market. That happens now but in the economic and monetary union we will have lost the ability to maintain our competitiveness by adjusting the exchange rate.</P>
    <P>We have two choices and the time to examine them is now.  Our first choice is to stay outside the economic and monetary union and tie our currency to sterling.  Our second choice is to turn our backs on sterling and join the economic and monetary union if we qualify. We could stay out of the economic and monetary union.  Unlike the British we do not have an opt-out under the Treaty but we could stay out by simply failing deliberately to meet some of the criteria. That is a practical option. However, I am more concerned about what happens if we choose the second option and join the economic and monetary union.  Until now we have focused our attention on joining and on whether we will meet the necessary criteria.  As it appears that we might broadly meet those criteria, there is a feeling that this is not an issue.  We have ignored what would happen if we join, if the UK does not and if sterling takes one of those dives it seems to take regularly.  Joining the economic and monetary union will not take away the circumstances which created the 1992 currency crisis or the recent turbulence in the market.  On the contrary, it will actually aggravate those very circumstances.</P>
    <P>We have to plan for that now and not in four years time.  We have to accept that if we want to join the economic and monetary union we will have to tie our economy to those of the economic and monetary union and break the ties <Col N="41" /> which now exist between our economy and that of the UK.  If we simply concentrate on meeting the Maastricht criteria and ignore this more fundamental problem, the economic and monetary union could turn out to be a national disaster for Ireland in the years following 1999.  If we decide in favour of the economic and monetary union we will have to do much more than just qualify for it &mdash; we will have to shift the whole direction of our economy away from the UK and towards our other partners.</P>
    <P>There are two main elements to that task and they are not easy ones.  First, we would have to keep our inflation and whole range of costs well below that of the UK.  There is no way that we can do that if we lose our grip on public sector spending, which is precisely what we seem to have done.  The current spending targets themselves are too lax even if we are going to meet them, and all the signs are that we are going to miss them by a kilometre, to use the European phrase.  Second, we will have to shift further and faster away from our dependence on the British market than we have being doing up to now.  Once again, I stress that it is the importance of the UK market to our indigenous exports &mdash; not to the exports overall &mdash; that is the key factor here.  We will have to mount a massive campaign to shift that dependence away from the UK.</P>
    <P>This all underlines my basic point that there are questions to be looked at and decisions to be taken in the short term rather than in the long term.  Getting out from under sterling will not be achieved overnight.  Perhaps, it can be achieved in the four years which remain before the economic and monetary union takes off. However, it certainly cannot and will not be achieved if we leave things until the last moment.  The time for decisions on the economic and monetary union is now, and I welcome the increased focus on Europe which this Bill will facilitate as a means to address these issues and move towards those decisions.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State will not be aware that gardening is one of my hobbies. For years I could not grow celery <Col N="42" /> until one day I picked up a gardening book which said that in order to grow good celery it should be planted in ground which was prepared two years previously.  Only then did I realise what I was doing wrong &mdash; I was not allocating enough time to my celery.  I now grow very good celery.</P>
    <P>We have to prepare the ground now &mdash; not two years but four years previously &mdash; for the likely event of an economic and monetary union.  We have to make decisions and start discussions now, which I fear has not been done.  I welcome this Bill and the opportunity for more in-depth discussion on Europe. I believe that we will avail of this and benefit from it by allocating time, attention and a concentration of energy to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, although I have reservations about the fact that there may be overlapping and duplication of some of the work.  I am sure that it will not be written about me that when I was a Minister I was against overlapping and duplication, but we seem be to be referring to this in regard to almost every piece of legislation which comes before the House.</P>
      <P>I was a member of the old committee on secondary legislation and I am a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and I can see that there are areas in which both committees would have a very deep involvement and would wish to discuss.  I note that there was a joint meeting of both committees with the President of Hungary.  Nevertheless, there is a risk of duplication of effort in the detailed work of both committees at a time when there is extreme pressure on Members of both Houses to service the various committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 17 committees now, which is too many, in my view.  They will become increasingly more difficult to service as time goes on.  Only this afternoon a meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs was delayed by 15 minutes because Members were discussing matters in this House.  The chairmen have already experienced difficulties in obtaining quora and getting <Col N="43" /> people to attend.  These committees put pressure on Members, especially where much of the work is of a related nature.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I am fully aware of the huge volume of work which has to be dealt with by the Joint Committee on European Affairs.  When I was secretary of the committee on European secondary legislation there was such an amount of documentation in my office at home that I had to get a wheelbarrow to remove it as it was piled up to the ceiling.  It was almost impossible to keep abreast of the amount of material which came from the Community.</P>
    <P>I am probably contradicting myself in saying that a second committee dealing with related matters will lead to duplication. However, I presume that the work of this committee will be mainly looking at statutory instruments, secondary legislation and the necessity to keep abreast of developments, new directives and so on coming from the European Union.</P>
    <P>We are entering into a very important time from Ireland's point of view in that detailed arrangements are being made at present for our Presidency of the EU. This will offer a large opportunity for Ireland and also pose a great challenge to the Government in dealing with the enormous issues which will arise.  Some of the issues which are important in Europe today are very relevant to us.</P>
    <P>I wish to avail of this opportunity to raise with the Minister of State the operation of the committee of the regions which was established with a huge fanfare quite a while ago and from which we have heard very little in terms of an agenda of its work, its activities and how it is dealing with some of the problems which it was set up to deal with.  There are many regional disparities and imbalances which need to be addressed, both in the EU and nationally.  The committee of the regions is an excellent one with a clearly defined mandate.  Nevertheless, very little information is coming from the committee on its activities.</P>
    <P>In recent times there has been a backtracking from the strong regional <Col N="44" /> dimension to our policies.  I am afraid that we are beginning to centralise again and that the major political initiative of a few years ago towards decentralisation and strengthening the regions is being watered down.  That would be a very backward step and one about which the Government should take some action.  It is vitally necessary for Ireland, which has such regional imbalances, to have a very dynamic regional policy.  We can strengthen and build up the regions by a number of initiatives, few of which are coming from Europe.</P>
    <P>When we joined the European Community I anticipated that some of its major institutions and organisations might be established here.  I do not believe the regions, in particular, are getting their fair share of European Union activities connected with the various institutions of the Union.  Other than the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions in Loughlinstown, we have little else by way of European institutions here.  We heard so much about how important it was that the isolated regions of the Community, and the most attractive ones, would be protected and safeguarded in the lead up to the Maastricht decision.  If the EU is serious about the regions, we still find the extreme regions of the Community, the western ones in particular, are suffering from the same disadvantages, if not worse, than they had when we joined the Community.  It is very difficult to explain this to people in western areas who suffer from some of the handicaps we have mentioned in various debates this year.</P>
    <P>In Gort, south Galway and north Clare, no assistance of any significance, other than a few pounds given to the Irish Red Cross, was available to deal with the people who were flooded out of house and home since Christmas. They are still affected by the floods.  I acknowledge the work of the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Higgins.  He was down there last Monday night where he met people who have been flooded out of their houses and who are feeling very <Col N="45" /> frustrated because of the lack of action to deal with their problem.  These people sought assistance from the European Union by way of funding and support to enable them to deal with the crisis but little was forthcoming.</P>
    <P>Dare I mention the state of the county roads?  At a time when millions of pounds are being pumped into bringing our national highways into line with the EU standards, people in isolated rural areas cannot go to church or bring their children to school because of the appalling state of our roads.  Every time I go to Brussels, Strasbourg or Luxembourg I see more investment in new buildings, offices and accommodation for the institutions and the European Union.  Meanwhile, we see a declining population in western areas.  These areas are suffering from the same regional imbalances we have suffered from since the foundation of the State. The feeling there, particularly along the west coast, is that the emphasis now will be more on Dublin and the large centres of population.  Admittedly, there are huge problems there but they are of a different kind and, in the view of the people of the west of Ireland, they are taking precedence over the situation in which they find themselves.</P>
    <P>The committee being set up under this legislation will offer an excellent opportunity for Members of the European Parliament to address the issues of the day here.  Under present arrangements we do not have a forum where MEPs can express their views.  This is a disadvantage.  When we were discussing the establishment of the committees I suggested a mechanism might be found to enable Irish MEPs to come here and speak on a regular basis, even if it were only on a three monthly or six monthly basis, so that they could bring Members up to date with developments in the European Union.</P>
    <P>I also suggested arrangements might be made to provide a platform for EU Commissioners to outline Commission policies on some of the major issues of the day. I have no doubt that one Commissioner, Pádraig Flynn, will be more than willing <Col N="46" /> to come before either the Seanad or the Dáil to outline the Commission's view in relation to social affairs issues, for which he has responsibility, in so far as they refer to Europe and Ireland in particular. These committees may be a forum which would provide a platform for distinguished people from the Commission, MEPs and other institutions to give us the benefit of their experience from a European dimension.</P>
    <P>Overall, this is will be a useful committee and I take this opportunity to wish it well.  There is a huge amount of work to be undertaken and I hope it will be possible to devise a mechanism to avoid any overlapping or duplication of the workload so that we can get the best possible results.  I give a guarded welcome to the legislation and I wish the members of the committee well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party to accept the general principle behind the setting up of this committee but I would be dishonest if I did not express concern about the number of committees which have been set up &mdash; about 15.  It is essential to tell the Government and the Minister that it is time we looked at the effectiveness of the committee system and what the committees are doing.  It is not a case of setting up another committee to satisfy a few people who were not made members of the last committee.</P>
      <P>The public, who are tuned in to what is happening, are capable of assessing the current situation.  They do not see the effectiveness or the value of these committees.  This is a duplication of what is happening in rural Ireland today; local authorities have established a number of subcommittees, the regional authorities have no money and no plan and they are going nowhere.  As regards regional tourism, there is no money, no power and no help; regional tourism has not £1 to deliver.  They could not put up a sign &ldquo;To the Beach&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am making the point that we have a plethora of committees to the point where the general public are asking what they are doing and where they are <Col N="47" /> going&rdquo;.  Elected representatives find themselves in a whirlpool; they do not know which committee to attend.  You can be on as many committees as you like, especially at this time when we are examining what section of industry can be funded from the International Fund for Ireland, the Delors package, INTERREG and Leader.  There are advisory sections to advise the public and all they want to do is get on the bandwagon.  They say they will put the plan together if a contribution of a few thousand pounds is made.</P>
    <P>Last week, the private sector in Letterkenny called a meeting and had senior advisers from the Department there setting up another committee.  I was talking to one of the lecturers and he was pleased with the attendance but, although the hall was full, there was not an accountable body there.  I attended another meeting in Belfast where the Commissioner for Regional Development stated that accountability would be the bottom line, that accountability was an important part of any structure setting up as a committee, making a submission or applying for grant aid.  It was spelt out clearly.</P>
    <P>The Government should rationalise, and I do not mean this in a political sense; I have no point to score.  I have nothing to gain whatsoever, and I am not on a crusade to knock anybody.  The committee system did not start today or after the Minister's appointment.  The Minister and the Government have inherited a committee structure that seems to have no end.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have the same problem. The last few items on the agenda of every council meeting are invitations to conferences and European committees. This has become totally out of hand.  There is no funding to support this and the structure will destroy itself. Donegal County Council is affiliated to a number of European committees.  One of those is the CPMR &mdash; the Community of Peripheral Maritime Regions &mdash; which is holding a conference in Donegal next October.  This will be an <Col N="48" /> opportunity for all local authorities to assess the value of participating in the CPMR.</P>
    <P>In principle no one is against this. That is as strongly as I can put it. However, I cannot see the value or purpose of forming another committee.  I do not possess all the wisdom, but the Minister and the Cabinet must work out where the committee system is going.  If someone sets up a committee he must give it a function and funding; rural Ireland has been obliterated by committees without either.  The regions believe they have a contribution to make, as does the committee of the regions.  All these bodies are organising seminars and expectations are being built up. There should be rationalisation.  Every committee must have a purpose and a time within which to deliver a report.</P>
    <P>The present Government has set up 15 committees.  How will public representatives have enough time for them?  I hope rural representatives are featured on the committees.  The Seanad was not well represented on many of them.  Senators were only involved as an afterthought; when someone highlighted that we were excluded, token representation was given.  We have almost become complacent about that.</P>
    <P>My confidence in committees is not high.  I base that on information from my area.  The Minister should look at the regional tourism organisation committee structure.  It only has enough money to pay the salaries and pensions of its office staff.  The previous Government passed legislation to set up five more bureaucratic structures to administer tourism.  This has become ridiculous. People set up a committee because it is a way of doing nothing.</P>
    <P>Someone must have the courage to do something about this.  I ask the Minister to use his clout in the Cabinet to examine the function of the committees because they cause confusion.  People laugh at anyone who sets up a committee. Today expectations are high in rural Ireland; people are led to believe money will fall off the back of a train, especially in the Border counties.  I know that is <Col N="49" /> not the case.  I ask the Government to think about the function of any committee it sets up.</P>
    <P>It should also rationalise the number of committees around Ireland.  They are not allowed to make any contribution. Many good ones were scrapped, such as county committees or agriculture and local health advisory committees.  The country has been obliterated by committees which achieve nothing and discourage many good people who would like to make a contribution.  Someone must rationalise this.</P>

      <P>I thank those Senators who contributed in such an interesting way.  I noted the comments made.  I thank them also for their welcome and their good wishes for the reflection group and for the Irish Presidency of the EU.  Before replying to some of the points raised I will make some points of my own.</P>
      <P>I have undertaken to raise at every possible opportunity one serious matter which needs to be addressed.  I hope Senators, especially those who are Members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Joint Committee on European Affairs, will consider it also.  A major task which will face next year's Intergovernmental Conference is to devise procedures and methods of making the European Union more relevant and visible to its citizens.  This is an ongoing objective which should be a key influence on all decisions taken at European level.</P>
      <P>One area with great potential in this regard is that of justice and home affairs, but regrettably there has been slow progress on this front.  The benefits in terms of public goodwill of a successful European wide attack on organised crime are obvious.  In particular I want to see the European Union playing a more active and co-ordinated role in the war against drugs.  The scourge of drugs is destroying the lives of countless European Union citizens.  We have seen in Ireland all too often the tragic consequences of this vile infernal trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="50" /> How can Europe's drug problem be tackled?  On first glance there are two options available.  The first is the oftcited option of legalising drugs.  This to my mind is a horrendous prospect and would be an irresponsible step for any democratic Government to take.  One only needs to have the most superficial knowledge of the physical and mental effects of drug addiction to realise that no responsible Government could seriously consider legalisation.  The other option, in reality the only option, is an unrelenting war against the illegal drug trade.  If we are to win that war it is essential that there be increased co-operation with European partners.</P>
    <P>There is scope for the member states to co-operate in this area within the framework of co-operation under the justice and home affairs section of the Maastricht Treaty and this must be availed of fully.  I should say that at every bilateral meeting I have had with European colleagues I have raised this issue.  I have been impressed with the consensus that something must be done.</P>
    <P>Europe now must put a concrete form on this aspiration.  I can assure Senators I will bring whatever pressure I can to bear to ensure action is taken.  We must be innovative in our war against drug pushing.  The Taoiseach has already raised the possibility of a European coastguard.  Another step which we must take is to pursue the drug barons to the source of their supply.</P>
    <P>In terms of GNP some countries in Latin America produce more in illegal drugs than they do in all of their legal products added together.  The result of this production is everywhere to be seen.  The corrupt practice of laundering the profits from these drugs is distorting national and international trade.  Our inner cities especially are being preyed on to a horrendous extent.  We already have a drugs epidemic.  A constituent of mine recently lost her fourth child from a drug related illness.</P>
    <P>National Governments have a major role to play in dealing with this problem, but the EU as an entity also has a role. The EU should use a mixture of the <Col N="51" /> stick and the carrot to pursue this problem to source.  Why not trade sanctions against, or economic aid to those producing countries as an incentive to stop drug production?  Distribution countries within the EU must also be brought to heel.</P>
    <P>I will use every opportunity to put this matter on the European agenda and I have already raised it with the President of the EU Commission and with a number of my fellow members on the reflection group which is preparing for next year's Intergovernmental Conference. Ireland will hold the Presidency of the EU next year.  We have held the Presidency in the past, but this is the first occasion on which we will hold the Presidency of the Union.  If the EU remains a union of 15 member states, it will be some considerable time &mdash; seven and a half years &mdash; before we hold the Presidency again, if it is ever held again in this form.</P>
    <P>The EU is also a union with three pillars and we hold the Presidency at a crucial time in European history, in the second part of the year in which the Intergovernmental Conference on the future of the Union will consider all the institutions, the Maastricht Treaty and the whole question of enlargement.  We will have the chairmanship of the Intergovernmental Conference, because of our Presidency of the Union, at a most crucial moment in European history. This in itself should make us proud to be Irish in Europe, given what we have brought and can bring to the EU.</P>
    <P>As Ireland's member of the reflection group, I am anxious to hear the views of Senators, Deputies and the public.  The reflection group meets for the first time at the beginning of June in Messina and will spend the second six months of this year preparing for the Intergovernmental Conference next year.  It is important that we hear people's views, as next year presents an opportunity for us to influence European history for some time to come.</P>
    <P>We may be looking at a Europe with up to 30 member states.  There are those <Col N="52" /> of us who have seen this country change dramatically because of its membership of the EU.  I grew up in Inchicore, where the best road in the country was located nearby, the road from Newlands Cross to Naas.  It was the pride and joy of the country.  We did not get these motorways by accident; they were largely funded by EU contributions.  Before EU membership one could not get a phone and if one did.  an operator was needed in order to be put through to Naas. However, now we have one of the most advanced communications systems in the world.  In addition, the money we have used to train and educate our young people has largely come from Europe.</P>
    <P>A sum of £18.5 billion has been transferred to this country from the EU since we joined in 1973.  We are not merely in Europe to get what we can out of it; we are there to participate.  We are there because Europe is primarily about peace.  There cannot be prosperity without peace and the EU has brought peace to western Europe in the second part of this century and, through peace, prosperity.  We must now extend that peace and prosperity to the emerging democracies in central and eastern Europe.  Now that we have our good roads and telecommunications system, we cannot pull up the ladder for selfish reasons, nor for altruistic reasons.  If we want a Europe that remains at peace, we cannot allow those emerging democracies to return, nor can we ourselves return to the kind of selfish nationalism that caused two wars in the early part of this century.</P>
    <P>There will be difficulties and long transition periods ahead.  In addition, there will be problems for countries like ours in terms of Structural Funds and the CAP.  However, while enlarging the Union and as these countries are ready to join and as it is practicable to allow them join, we must build coalitions within the Union to defend at the same time our national interest.  They are not mutually exclusive.</P>
    <P>I am not for taking lectures from anybody about the transfers we have <Col N="53" /> received.  For example, it was believed of Austria &mdash; which I cite not as a country which lectures anybody &mdash; after the second world war that it was a country which could not succeed without almost perpetual Marshall aid.  This did not happen and Austria joined the EU on 1 January 1995 as a net contributor. Could this be the Ireland of the future? Let us not forget that many of the countries which are now net contributors were countries which received Marshall aid when they needed it and have built on that.  We are, therefore, not in the business of taking lectures from anybody on this issue.  We are good Europeans; we are in the club and we have paid the price.  In my own constituency, for example, the motor assembly industry was devastated by our membership of the EU, and that was part of the price.  In time to come we may be the Austria of the EU with, hopefully, employment and economic opportunities at the level which Austria enjoys.</P>
    <P>Will we always be on the periphery? What about the suggestion by the German Foreign Minister for a European free trade agreement and an American free trade agreement?  If there was an American and European free trade area we would not be on the periphery; we would be in the middle of it, ideally suited to exploit it.  We need not always be on the periphery.</P>
    <P>It is time we showed our good European credentials.  An issue raised by Senators was the need to communicate Europe.  Europe is not a <i>Bundesstat</i>, a fully fledged federal system, nor is it a <i>Statanbund</i>, an intergovernmental association.  It is an evolving, quadripartite system, where the Council of Ministers, the EU Commission, the European Parliament and the European Court of Justice have central and important roles, and an adjustment in the role of one can have serious implications for the roles of the others.  There are, therefore, serious problems and serious matters to be considered in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference, and no simple solutions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="54" /> The founding fathers of the EU &mdash; the original Six &mdash; made a major contribution to history and to the success of the Union by the unique role they choose for the EU Commission.  The position whereby member states have a member on the EU Commission is sacrosanct and we must ensure that interests of that kind are protected when the time comes &mdash; not just on our own behalf, but on behalf of all the other small member states, who are not members simply to take but to participate and make a contribution.</P>
    <P>Senator Enright spoke of the major importance of the environment, and this is an important point which needs to be considered and will be borne in mind. With regard to programmes such as Leader, since I am also Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach with responsibility for local development, I suggest that the House might interest itself in the local development programme, learn about it and learn what it can contribute to the community by empowering people to do things for themselves.  This is translated in one magazine, to which I do not contribute, as lecturing and hectoring local people. It does no such thing.  I am one of those local people and I do not need to patronise them from on high.  Local development is about empowering people to do a job for themselves; and I put down this marker to those magazines with their hidden agendas, that if this is the way they do their business they are not going to be taken seriously or assisted by me.</P>
    <P>With regard to the points made by Senator Lee, we must support the entry of central and eastern European countries. The question of the entry of Cyprus and Malta will also arise in the near future.</P>

      <P>The issue of central and eastern European countries will be addressed for the reasons I have stated when it is practicable to do so.  In the meantime, through the White Paper on <Col N="55" /> the Internal Market, we will try to assist these people to prepare their economies and to bring their laws up to the <i>acquis communitaire</i> so that they will be able to make the transition with the minimum disadvantage.  But, in the long term, and for some in the not so long term, and in the interests of peace and prosperity in Europe, we, as good Europeans, must grasp this nettle and welcome these emerging democracies into the European Union at the earliest practicable time.  I repeat, there may have to be long lead-in periods; we had to wait for some time.</P>
      <P>Senator Lee pointed out that the White Paper contains a number of aspirations. He is right, they are aspirations but it is important that we translate them as far as possible into reality and the Government is setting out to achieve this.  I noted the points made by Senator O'Kennedy, particularly those regarding the cost and staffing implications of the work of the different Oireachtas committees.  This is a difficulty but if we áre serious about having a Parliament which oversees the Executive, which has transparency and openness as one of its central objectives, we have to meet the cost.  We should also be concerned about the value of these committees.  I also note the points the Senator made about the number of languages into which EU documents must be translated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Calnan raised some interesting points.  It is necessary that information goes to local authorities and then to the people.  I recently published the report of the task force on communicating Europe and I have set up a small task force under my own chairmanship to see that its recommendations are implemented.  We may not continue to receive the rate of transfer we have received from the European Union.  It is easy to be good Europeans when we are receiving this sort of transfer but it is important that people understand exactly what the European Union is about.  People want to be able to sleep <Col N="56" /> at night and to feel secure in their homes.  A secure and safe Europe is a product of being in the European Union.  It is important that we communicate to people the relevance of Europe to their daily lives.  Senator Ormonde raised a similar point.  Many programmes are funded and run by the European Union, some of which I do not understand because they are not directly related to my Department &mdash; different Departments are involved &mdash; but it is important that we communicate this.  Oireachtas committees have a role in extracting that information and translating it to the general public.</P>
    <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn raised the role of the Committee on European Affairs; it will have an important role, including overseeing the implementation of directives and the speed of transposition as well as the examination of Commission proposals.  They will also have a general look at the important issues which will face us next year.</P>
    <P>Economic and monetary union is a very sensitive area and I note the points made by Senator Quinn and others.  A number of countries are not very enthusiastic about joining the economic and monetary union but they do, however, meet the qualifying criteria; their fiscal disciplines are aimed at meeting those criteria.  Thirty per cent of our exports go to the UK.  I have heard the argument that much of this is related to indigenous industry and more study needs to be done there, but 70 per cent of our exports go to other areas &mdash; 42 per cent to other European countries. We should not get too carried away about the anxieties which have been expressed.</P>
    <P>It is an interesting statistic to note that in the United States, which has a single currency, unemployment runs at 6 per cent.  Unemployment in the European Union is running at 11 per cent, almost twice the US figure.  It is not possible to simply attribute that discrepancy to the presence of a single currency in the US, but I believe research would show it is a contributing factor.  Senator Calnan pointed out what would happen <Col N="57" /> if IR £100 was exchanged for the currencies of each of the existing 15 member states of the European Union in turn.  If there were 30 member States, you would probably end up owing them money.</P>
    <P>We should be very careful about this because sometimes we can rush into simplistic arguments.  European monetary union is to Maastricht what the Single Market was to the Single European Act: it was the central part of the Maastricht Treaty debate.  I note what Senator Quinn said and I am delighted that he is so good at developing celery. He might send us some so that we could see if it is as good as he says; and I know he is as much in favour of salary growth as he is of celery growth.  All these points are interesting but a number of arguments must be considered.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly mentioned the committee of the regions and I will consider the points he has made in the context of my membership of the reflection group. Perhaps it is time to find a greater role for the committee of the regions, because we organise our European elections on regional basis whereas in other countries the list system is used.  I would like to see a greater role for the regions.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly asked whether MEPs will have the right to participate in the committee.  Under Standing Orders, Members of the European Parliament elected from constituencies in Ireland, including Northern Ireland, as well as members of the Irish delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe may attend meetings of the committee and its subcommittees. Other Members of the European Parliament may, at the invitation of the joint committee or a subcommittee, attend particular meetings.  This is an endeavour to involve MEPs in the important role of these committees and I hope the committees will avail of this opportunity.</P>
    <P>I note the points made in a non-party political way by Senator McGowan about the need for more rationalisation; he said there are too many groups and much confusion.  There is ring of truth <Col N="58" /> to the point the Senator makes in the broad sense.  We have to get the information across while, at the same time, allowing for democratic participation.  In the past in the Houses of the Oireachtas there has been the suggestion that foreign policy was made solely by Iveagh House, yet we have taken this process to the people by way of seminars and preparation for the White Paper.  The suggestion has been made that the Oireachtas does not have a role, we only rubber stamp legislation.  Yet here is a role for committees.  Too many cooks might spoil the broth but before the system is condemned it should be given an opportunity to operate.  However, I see the points the Senator has made.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to have had the opportunity to sit in on this debate and to listen to the contributions.  It has been an informative and useful debate and I would return from time to time and meet members of both committees so that they can help me in my work.  I thank all who participated.</P>

      <P>As I understand it, the European Community no longer exists and that it is now the European Union following the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that the previous legislation was the European Communities Act, 1972, but it was then the European <Col N="59" /> Community.  Some people might suggest this is a trivial point, but we must start thinking in terms of the fact that Ireland is a member of the European Union and not the European Community.  Perhaps there is an argument to be made for changing the Title of the Bill to the European Union (Amendment) Bill, 1995, and stating later in the legislation &mdash; for example, in section 2 &mdash; that the purpose of the Bill is to amend the European Communities Act, 1972.</P>

      <P>There are three pillars to the European Union &mdash; the Community pillar, the Common Foreign and Security pillar and the Justice and Home Affairs pillar.

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann notes the importance which has been attached by the Government to the need to improve services for people with a mental handicap, with a view to ensuring that they are enabled to reach the maximum of their potential and to live full and independent lives; commends the Government for its commitment of additional resources towards this end; and calls for the establishment of a statutory charter of rights for people with a mental handicap.</P>
      <P>I welcome Deputy O'Shea to the House in his capacity as Minister of State at the Department of Health with responsibility for mental handicap.</P>
      <P>We welcome the opportunity to debate this motion this evening.  The importance we give to people who are in a weak situation in society, such as those with a mental handicap, and the amount of resources we put towards their care and rights is an indication of the kind of society we are.  It is extremely important that we place the proper emphasis on the rights of people with a mental handicap.  Indeed, the Labour Party has been promoting their rights for a number of years.  In both this and the last Government, we have given them a great deal of funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A report which came from the Review Group on Mental Handicap Services in 1990, called <i>Needs and Abilities</i>, identified the need to put significant amounts of public funding into additional services for people with a mental handicap.  It contained much research and statistical information, and on that basis a commitment was made to increase the funding for those with a mental handicap.  However, only an extra £2 million was available in 1990 and an extra £1 million in 1991.  From 1992 onwards, the figures were increased substantially, to an extra £6 million in 1992, an extra £8.5 million in <Col N="61" /> 1993, an extra £12.5 million in 1994 and there was an increase of £12 million in the allocation of funding for this year. This additional injection of funding has enabled a significant number of additional residential and day care places to be provided, as well as services within the community, respite for carers and other support services that were identified in that document.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, that document is not up to date in terms of the number of people who need the services.  Therefore, I welcome the commitment in the health strategy document from the Department of Health towards setting up a database.  Unless there is a database from which we can get accurate information about the number of people who actually need services and the type of services needed, there will always be more of a need in the community than there are services to provide.  I very much support the setting up of a database. While the funding that was promised in relation to the <i>Needs and Abilities</i> document has been allocated, in recent years, there is still a sizeable number of people waiting for a service. I welcome the fact that the Minister has indicated that he intends to eliminate those waiting lists and that people would have their needs catered for and enjoy the maximum quality of life.</P>
    <P>A number of people have been identifying the problem.  There is a strong lobby group in my area called the Limerick Parents and Friends of the Mentally Handicapped Association.  It has been lobbying consistently for extra funding in this area.  I would like to pay tribute to the amount of pressure it has been generating but there are still a sizeable number of people in the community who need services.</P>
    <P>There is also an indication of capital injection of funds &mdash; this money is coming from European Regional Development Fund funding &mdash; with local matching funds.  It is the first time in the present structure of funding that this money has been put into training programmes that include both the mentally and physically handicapped.  There is a <Col N="62" /> commitment from 1994 to 1999 of £33.58 million in capital funding for the setting up of new training services and the updating of existing training services and I welcome that as well.  The health boards have also been asked to draw up a four year capital funding programme for this money and that is an indication of the commitment to providing the kind of services that are needed.  This special training is very significant for people with a mental handicap, as anybody would know from their personal experience of training programmes.</P>
    <P>Other areas of special need, such as helping people with autism and those with particularly disturbed behaviour, have been identified and I welcome the fact that there is also an indication of commitment to those people.</P>
    <P>The second part of the motion refers to a statutory charter of rights for people with a mental handicap.  There is already a strong commitment to legislation which is being drafted in the Department of Equality and Law Reform.  The Equal Status Bill and the Employment Equality Bill have both got a great deal of safeguards in them for people with a mental handicap, including rights to transportation, education, housing and so on that would be suitable for people with a disability, whether it be a mental or a physical one. There is a commitment from the Department of Equality and Law Reform that in addition to the safeguards in these two forthcoming pieces of legislation, additional statutory support may also be needed for people with disabilities and, if necessary, a Disabilities Bill would be introduced to cover other areas that would not be covered under the other two Bills.  I welcome the fact that there is that commitment to provide the kind of statutory legislative framework that is needed to guarantee people's rights.</P>
    <P>The concept of a charter is already in existence as far as health is concerned, but putting these rights into legislation may be more important than having a general charter.  There is also a Commission for the Status of People with <Col N="63" /> Disabilities, which is expected to report at the end of 1995.  It is looking at how a charter of rights could be drawn up, so we expect to have some results in that area as well.  A council for the status of people with disabilities will also be set up.  That will also give the kind of focus and attention that is needed and the kind of concentration from people who know the problems and are aware of the various areas which need to be addressed in relation to people with physical and mental disabilities.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to those who provide the services.  In my area the Daughters of Charity and the Brothers of Charity provide that service and there are similar service providers throughout the country.  Anybody who has come in contact with these bodies must pay tribute to the dedication and quality of service which they and those working in the area of mental handicap give.  As legislators and as members of Government parties, we must ensure the requisite funding is provided and that the financial and legislative support needed is given so as to ensure that service providers can get on with the job and plan for the future in co-operation with health boards.</P>
    <P>The fact that we will, I hope, have a database and up to date information on needs will enable us to provide for the future needs of people with mental handicap in a properly organised way. We have come a long way in the past few years in that both this and the previous Government have provided the necessary funding.  It has not always been easy because money has had to be made available out of existing resources. The fact that so much has been made available is an indication of the commitment to those with mental disabilities or handicaps and to carers, because they are in a difficult situation and need all the help they can get and it is up to us to provide it.  I have pleasure in proposing this motion and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Col N="64" />
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for his work on behalf of the mentally handicapped and those involved in their care and maintenance. I acknowledge the importance which the Government has attached to improving the level of services available to people with mental handicaps and their carers.</P>
      <P>I would like to comment on one aspect of the services &mdash; the provision of support to families caring at home for a son or daughter or brother or sister with a mental handicap.  It would be the wish of most families that their son or daughter with a mental handicap would remain at home for as long possible.  To do so, they need access to appropriate support services.  In particular, families need access to respite care on a planned basis and assistance from the home support services, either on an occasional or in some cases on an ongoing basis, to alleviate the heavy physical and mental burden which caring for a family member with mental handicap places on them.  The value of respite care has been overwhelmingly demonstrated in recent years in supporting families who want to care for their son or daughter but who find the burden of caring without a break too much.</P>
      <P>The home support services are an important addition to the range of support services available to the families of people with mental handicap.  This service aims to provide greater support to families in a number of different ways, depending on the individual needs of the family.  The service works in a flexible way and is specifically targeted at those who have no service or an inadequate one.  Agencies use the resources made available to them in many ways &mdash; for example, providing assistance at specific times of the day in a clients home, taking clients to leisure centres or allowing carers to take time off.  I understand the feedback from service providers and client families has been very positive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The home support services have taken some of the pressure off families <Col N="65" /> and service providers.  While home support is not the full answer to a client's needs, it has an important role to play in providing relief to families.  These services, taken in conjunction with the ongoing development of additional day care facilities, will greatly assist those involved in the care of persons with mental handicap in their homes.</P>
    <P>When account is taken of the ongoing development of services, the proposed implementation of the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities and the enactment of the new legislation to prohibit discrimination against people with mental handicap and those with disabilities, the situation looks positive.  I strongly commend this motion to the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I am amused by this motion in the name of Labour Party Senators because I do not know its intention.  I do not see any Government cohesion in this. It seems to be a patting on the back exercise by the Labour Party and an attempt to upstage its main partners in Government. That is my reading of it, but perhaps they have their own interpretation or reasons for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>An attempt has been made to take the credit for what happened in the past, which is, to some extent, misguided.  We must be realistic about these matters.  Renewed support and increased allocation for mentally handicap services began in 1991 and 1992.  The major increases in 1992, 1993 and 1994 of £6 million, £8.5 million and £12.5 million were provided by a Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance.  The co-ordination committees which were set up were given added public responsibility in that parent representatives were appointed by Fianna Fáil in 1991.  The home support service was established by Fianna Fáil in 1992.  No party has a monopoly <Col N="66" /> on this, although there is an attempt by the Labour Party to claim a monopoly as regards the care of the mentally handicapped, which is not the case.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to carers who have looked after people with mental handicaps over the years and to organisations like the Brothers of Charity, the Sisters of Charity, Western Care and the mentally handicapped associations in the counties, who have done trojan work. Services would not be at the stage they are at today had it not been for them.</P>
      <P>We should not believe that we have resolved the support system for those with mental handicaps.  There are approximately 25,000 people with mental handicaps in this country, but 3,000 do not have a reasonable service. Rather than patting itself on the back, the Government should provide a proper service for those people who badly need it, who are so vulnerable and dependent on others for maintenance, health care and education and so on.</P>
      <P>The Down's Syndrome Association of Ireland has approximately 2,000 members, who are parents and guardians, but the Government does not give it even £1 in support.  It has been in existence for many years and its contribution in promoting education, health and opportunity for people with Down's Syndrome or mental handicaps cannot be measured, yet it does not receive any State funding.  I call on the Minister to provide funding for this organisation.</P>
      <P>I understand a major international conference organised by the Down's Syndrome Association of Ireland will be held in this country this year.  It is an ideal opportunity for the Minister and the Government to respond to the positive work done by this association.  I call on him tonight to make a reasonable contribution to the Down's Syndrome Association of Ireland which will show the international community that we support and respect organisations which provide a service for an underprivileged section of our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="67" /> There are approximately 25,000 people with mental handicaps in this country and this can be broken down into three categories.  The first relates to those who are still resident in psychiatric hospitals.  It is disgraceful that so many mentally handicapped people are resident in psychiatric hospitals and institutions, which were not built for them, because they have nowhere else to go.  Last year there were approximately 800 people in that category.  This should be addressed immediately by the Minister because it is inappropriate that people who have a mental handicap should be incarcerated in psychiatric hospitals.  The number in such hospitals was greater in the past.  I compliment and thank the psychiatric nurses who looked after the mentally handicapped. It was not their wish to do so, but that service was imposed upon them by successive Governments.  It was inappropriate then and it should be addressed now.  Mentally handicapped people in psychiatric hospitals should be given alternative accommodation and the opportunity to avail of employment and training.</P>
    <P>The second category relates to mentally handicapped people who live with elderly parents.  Elderly parents are worried about what will happen to their mentally handicapped son or daughter when they pass away.  This matter must also be addressed by the Minister.  I am not sure of the exact number of people in this category, but it is approximately 1,500.  The provision of 60 or 70 residential places on an annual basis will not address this problem; it will only tinker with the system.  We need a comprehensive programme of residential care to help such people.</P>

      <P>The third category relates to people who need training and day care facilities.  This situation is being addressed to some extent, but we need more places.  We must develop services which answer the needs and promote the abilities of mentally handicapped people.  This must be our goal.  I ask the Minister to take that into consideration.</P>
      <P>Many parts of this country still do not have respite facilities for parents who wish to avail of them during a family crisis or holiday period.  Some months ago I was at a meeting in Ballinasloe for parents in such situations and 300 people attended.  At that time there were no respite beds available in the Ballinasloe catchment area.  The Brothers of Charity and the Mentally Handicapped Association in County Roscommon have applied for full-time residential beds.  I ask the Minister to respond to this request.  Funding is available for staff to look after these people, but there are no beds.  The County Roscommon Mentally Handicapped Association was set up in 1966 and its first collection amounted to ten shillings.  Up to the end of 1994 it had collected £1 million in voluntary contributions. This is the type of contribution we are talking about from voluntary organisations throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The Minister has a responsibility in this area.  I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this matter, although we need more time.  There is a lot of work to be done; it is not time to pat people on the back.  While I do not support the motion, I will not vote against it.  The Labour Party has tabled it for its own reasons.  The Minister must provide a proper service, backup and training for people with mental handicaps.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Government and all previous Governments for their commitment to the development of services for the mentally handicapped. Services for the mentally handicapped <Col N="70" /> and medical services generally should be above politics; they should embrace all political parties.</P>
      <P>We all support the view that health services should be improved.  The provision of an additional £12.5 million in 1994 and a further £12 million in 1995 has enabled the health boards and other service providers to respond to the needs of people with mental handicaps and their families.  The provision of capital funding for the development of training facilities and the changes which have taken place in training programmes under the Operational Programme for Human Resources Development, 1994-99, have also assisted greatly in providing training opportunities for young adults with mental handicaps.  These services are provided mainly under the following headings: residential and day care places, respite care, home support schemes, services for people with a mental handicap who also have disturbed behaviour, the transfer of persons with a mental handicap in psychiatric hospitals and other inappropriate places and services for persons with autism.</P>
      <P>As regards residential and day care places, the Department of Health has made available £32.58 million since 1990 to provide a range of extra services to people with mental handicap.</P>
      <P>Nationally, this money has provided 780 new residential places and 1,650 day care places.  In 1995, a further £12 million is being invested in mental handicap services.  Of this figure, £2 million is being invested in supporting existing services and £10 million in new services &mdash; £8 million for services and £2 million for capital.  This will provide 189 residential places and 418 day places this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Wall dealt with the home support and respite care service.  I wish to pay tribute to the parents of mentally handicapped children who keep them at home.  It is only right that the State should give them every support it can, allowing them to have a holiday during the year.  The value of respite care has <Col N="71" /> been overwhelmingly demonstrated in recent years in supporting families who want to care for their sons or daughters but who find that the burden of caring without a break is too much.</P>
    <P>The home support services are an important addition to the range of support services available to families of mentally handicapped people.  These services aim to provide greater support to families in a number of different ways depending on the individual needs of families.  Since 1990, £3 million has been invested in the home support services.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran mentioned the anxiety felt by elderly parents of mentally handicapped children, but as the number of residential places is being increased, their anxiety should be alleviated.</P>
    <P>I have a particular interest in the transfer of mentally handicapped persons from psychiatric hospitals to more appropriate care settings.  In the past, many mentally handicapped people were admitted to psychiatric hospitals who would not be admitted to such hospitals today.  I am pleased to note that in 1994 a total of £785,000 was provided to facilitate the transfer of over 150 people from psychiatric hospitals to more appropriate accommodation in the mentally handicapped service. Additional funding is also being made in 1995 to continue this programme.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran asked about exact figures and while I do not know the figures for the whole country, I have some figures for the Eastern Health Board area in which he might be interested. Approximately one third of funding for the mentally handicapped services has been allocated to the Eastern Health Board each year.  With the help of this funding the Eastern Health Board has made great strides in relocating the mentally handicapped from psychiatric hospitals.  For example, the children's unit at St. Loman's Hospital has been closed and replaced with a magnificent new unit at New Town, Maynooth. There are at present only ten mentally handicapped people remaining in St. <Col N="72" /> Brendan's and it is envisaged that they will be placed in a high support hospital this year, a move which will close St. Brendan's as far as the mentally handicapped are concerned.</P>
    <P>St. Joseph's mentally handicapped service at St. Ita's, Portrane, has been substantially upgraded.  The older units are being closed on a phased basis and alternative community facilities are being provided for those who are suited to such group homes.  It is intended to reduce the overall number of residents on the campus to 150.  These will be accommodated in bungalow style units and smaller group homes on the campus. Last year 47 people were moved to community facilities and this year it is intended to move another 24.  All this was achieved because of the extra funding made available to this project.</P>
    <P>The development of the appropriate programmes and the assessment of the needs of mentally handicapped persons still in psychiatric hospitals is ongoing and will lead to a further reduction in the number remaining within psychiatric hospitals in future.  This major achievement has led to the improvement of the quality of life of those who have been moved into more appropriate places in the service of people with mental handicap.</P>
    <P>This motion calls for the establishment of a statutory charter of rights for people with a mental handicap.  In December 1993 the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities was set up by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Mervyn Taylor. The commission has been given the task of advising the Government on practical measures to ensure that handicapped people can exercise their right to participate to the fullest extent of their potential in economic, social and cultural life. It is also examining the current organisational inadequacy of the existing services, both public and voluntary, to meet the needs of handicapped people. They will make recommendations setting out changes in legislation to ensure that their needs are met in a coherent and comprehensive way.  The commission <Col N="73" /> is due to report this year and I hope that, in its considerations, it will take into account a charter of rights for the mentally handicapped as requested in the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I must apologise because I had not intended to speak.  I came to listen and learn, which might in itself seem to some colleagues like action verging on the certifiable. However, I have been stimulated to say a few words by the contributions that have been made.  I am no authority in the area, so I am subject to correction on almost anything I say.  I welcome the increases in expenditure in this area in recent years and, frankly, I am not bothered about which party is mainly responsible.  I wish well whichever party contributes towards improving the treatment of the mentally handicapped.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Sullivan's tribute to the Daughters of Charity and the Brothers of Charity in her own constituency prompted me to say a few words.  I have no doubt that that well deserved tribute could be paid to all carers around the country, as Senator Finneran said. However, it moved me to think that if the Brothers and Sisters of Charity are going the way of most religious, they will be disproportionately elderly themselves by this stage, or going in that direction.  That is the way our society is going, so what will happen when those who have given their lives to that type of work are no longer there in such numbers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two or three contrary types of movement are happening.  As a people we have a bad record in our attitude toward mental illness.  I am not saying that as a general indictment because we have a decent record in our attitude to a lot of other handicaps.  However, historically, we had a fear of mental illness and we often isolated people who could have benefited from treatment and diagnosis, by simply pushing them away from us. In recent years there has been almost a re-education in our attitude towards the mentally handicapped, which is a great improvement.  However, at the same <Col N="74" /> time, the structures of society have been moving in the opposite direction.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the proposal for a charter and all the legislation Senator O'Sullivan referred to, both the family and the community &mdash; which are the bases on which solidarity with the handicapped was founded &mdash; are going through rapid changes.  I am not suggesting that all those changes are for the worse; some may well be for the better, but we all know that families are changing at an unprecedented speed.  Since the size of families is changing as well as the attitude of children towards their parents and vice versa how long can we continue to rely on the type of caring attitude which has been shown when the structures within which they are operating may well be changing adversely from their point of view?  That cannot be legislated for or dealt with overnight, but there is a poignant irony in a situation where we are bringing in a good deal of good and proper legislation at a time when the basic structures and ethos of society would be getting more individualistic in many ways &mdash; in many respects that is good.</P>
    <P>However, there are downsides to all of these developments.  I wonder if in a generation's time the fate of the handicapped, particularly the mentally handicapped, in our society will be better in emotional terms than it is today, despite all the proposed legislative improvements. I suspect the general ethos of society will have as much to do with the life experiences of these people as any legislation.  Insofar as we or the Government can do anything to influence it, we should be trying to think along those lines as well as along specific lines.</P>
    <P>I agree with what has been said about the dedication of carers and I agree all assistance should be given to them.  It is a case of grudging what is, in the context of the country's budget or the budget of the health services, a very small figure.</P>
    <P>In terms of attitude it seems that a good deal can be done in the educational system if we think of it as a source for the proper teaching of civics in society.  Civics tends to be a rag bag <Col N="75" /> into which everything is packed, but in terms of trying to think of ways in which we can influence behaviour and attitudes in these changing circumstances, it is an area to which some attention might be given.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I welcome the continued commitment of the Government to mental handicap.  I am in favour of a charter of rights for the handicapped, not just the mentally handicapped but all handicapped people.  It is essential that we accord to those with a handicap the same rights and privileges we enjoy.  Such a charter will focus the minds not only of the medical profession ordinarily involved in the care of the handicapped, but also of society in general.</P>
      <P>Society has a tendency to assume that because there are charitable organisations or other institutions or hospitals, society itself does not have a role to play.  Society needs to look at the range of facilities available to see how they can be adapted, enlarged or expanded to allow anybody with a handicap to enjoy the facilities other citizens have.  It is only right and fitting that all of our institutions, public or private, be open or accessible to anybody with a handicap.</P>
      <P>The recent Labour Party conference was addressed by a brave man who made a passionate plea on behalf of those who are blind.  That man is sadly no longer with us; he died in the last few days.  Anybody who was there would testify that the conference was spellbound by the passion of his plea for a right of recognition for those without sight.  Our sympathy is with his family. While he was alive he was a courageous man who fought for those without sight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A charter of rights for those with a handicap will focus the minds of all in society, not only the carers.  It will make people aware that the services they offer should take account of people with handicaps.  That may mean providing better access to public buildings or simplifying <Col N="76" /> procedures people may have to go through, for example, to go to hospital or get a television licence &mdash; sometimes the forms are complicated and are so phrased that somebody with only a slight handicap may be put at a disadvantage.</P>
    <P>The private sector has a big role to play.  It cannot view the provision for the handicapped as the responsibility of the public sector.  It must play its part. That may mean a large corporation or industry ensuring that there are posts reserved for handicapped people and the active encouragement of handicapped people to seek these posts.  They must be helped in every way.  If that means extra training then so be it.  The private sector has a role which it must be forced to play.  It is too easy for the private sector to think in terms of profit and loss and not consider its social responsibilities.  There is often a tendency to leave the responsibility to the public sector carers.</P>
    <P>As individual citizens we must also make sure that in every way possible we help and do not hinder those with a handicap, so that what we say and do does not add to their discomfort or handicap.  Many commentators mock the idea of politically correct language. Nevertheless, it is important that children and adults remember that it is unchristian to call anybody with a handicap a nasty name that highlights their handicap.  We can thus ensure that we and our children are sensitive in the language we use when speaking to and about those with a handicap.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister of State for his hard work.  If in years to come he is replaced by another Minister, I hope that Minister will continue the good work.  This has not been done over the years and it is high time for us to allocate resources to redress the balance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this motion.  I hope it will serve to highlight the ongoing plight of people with mental handicap.  There is no doubt that there has been a quantum leap in our attitudes <Col N="77" /> to people with such handicap. Unfortunately, that change in attitude has not been reflected in practice.</P>
      <P>I am particularly concerned about the situation of mentally handicapped children. All the available evidence points to the fact that children who have learning difficulties but who attend ordinary schools are far more likely to be integrated into mainstream society following their schooling than children who have been shunted into special schools. For this reason the parents of Down's Syndrome children in particular have campaigned for a system of integrated education where children attend mainstream schools but are supported in them by special teachers.  In 1988 the Down's Syndrome Association launched a pilot programme along those lines.  This was so successful that it was subsequently taken over by the Department of Education.  I would like to see more such programmes and their scope broadened beyond children with Down's Syndrome to include children with other forms of mental handicap.</P>
      <P>While integrated education is desirable in many cases, there will always be those children for whom it is inappropriate. In this regard I urge the Minister to provide increased specialised facilities for autistic children.  It has been shown that with specialised educational support, autistic children can attain a measure of independence, and as a society we owe it not just to these children but also to their families to provide such services.</P>
      <P>The motion refers to the provision of improved services for people with mental handicap.  We must also improve the services offered to relatives and carers of people with mental handicap.  The provision of adequate respite facilities must be a priority.  I look forward to the Government tackling this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion also refers to the establishment of a statutory charter of rights for people with mental handicap and such a charter would give people for the first time a legislative framework in which to operate.  I did some research into this some years ago.  We should <Col N="78" /> draw on the Swedish model.  On 1 January 1994 Sweden introduced a bill of rights for people with disabilities, drawing on the recommendations made by the Swedish commission on policies for the disabled.  The bill of rights was enacted into law.  This provides support and services for people with disabilities, whether mental or physical.  In preparing a programme the Minister should look at the Swedish model.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. I support the motion and congratulate the Labour Party for bringing it to the House.  The mentally handicapped are the most vulnerable people in our society and we have a duty to ensure they are assisted and facilitated in every way.  Society, and especially the Government, has a duty to the mentally handicapped to ensure they play as full a role as possible in society, that they reach the maximum of their potential and are facilitated in living their lives as independently as possible.</P>
      <P>I support the call to establish a statutory charter of rights for people with mental handicap.  Such charters have been a recent and positive development. The handicapped, both mentally and physically, should be the first group for which a charter of rights should be developed.</P>
      <P>I welcome the recognition over the past number of years of the importance of improving the situation of the mentally handicapped.  We have a very long way to go, but we must recognise that there have been improvements and that considerable funding has been made available over a number of years to assist the mentally handicapped.  The Minister must ensure that the momentum for improvement in services to the mentally handicapped is maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the additional funding of £1.209 million which has been allocated to the mid-west region.  This is the highest ever allocation of additional funding to mentally handicapped services in Limerick.  To date £0.751 of this money has been paid, which will provide an extra 19 residential places, three respite <Col N="79" /> places, 42 new day care places and 68 extra home supports.  I congratulate the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Noonan, who is our local TD and of whom we are very proud, for their contribution and their recognition of the needs of the mid-west.  However, there is a long way to go and further services will be developed in the region in the immediate future when the balance of £458,000 will come on stream.</P>
    <P>It is important that this programme of expansion continues, that the momentum increases and that extra funding each year is provided to improve the services.  There is a need to establish as quickly as possible facilities to cater for the immediate requirement of children and adults in the mid-west region.</P>
    <P>A report on the mentally handicapped services, which was published in 1992, identified that an investment of £6.295 million was required to meet the priority requirements of handicapped children and adults in the region.  It must be stressed that this was to cater for immediate and priority needs.  The report recognised that such developments and funding would not be provided over a short term and should be planned for over a period of five years. Additional funding in 1993, 1994 and 1995 will have amounted to £5.769 million, which is almost £6 million.  Targets were set and are being achieved.  We fully accept that the full requirements are not being met but the targets set in 1992 by the Mid-Western Health Board have been achieved by this and the previous Government.</P>
    <P>Like Senator O'Sullivan, I congratulate the service providers in our region of the mid-west.  In Limerick city we must recognise the excellent work over many years by Church bodies such as the Sisters of Charity and the Brothers of Charity before we had the benefit of the type of funding which has been provided over the past number of years.  We must recognise the work of carers and say we are not at all satisfied with the present position.  A great deal needs to be done.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="80" /> A reply to a question in the Dáil in 1993 stated that there were approximately 25,000 mentally handicapped persons in the population; about 15,400 have a severe or profound degree of mental handicap and require extensive support from the health service and the remaining approximately 10,000 have mild mental handicap and a minority of this group require ongoing support from the health services.  It must be recognised that of the 25,000 mentally handicapped people between 15,000 and 16,000 are in need of immediate service.</P>
    <P>The Minister at the same time identified that there were 45,000 physically handicapped people requiring services. We have debated, rightly, the mentally handicapped at least three times since I was elected to the Seanad three years ago.  However, we have not debated the physically handicapped.  That area requires a little more attention than it is has received.</P>
    <P>The budget will impact on the physically and mentally handicapped by impacting on the many organisations who collect moneys on a voluntary basis.  Voluntary organisations are great contributors to services for the handicapped. They foresee extreme difficulty as a result of the budget provision for special tax relief for contributions to Third World charities; it is welcome that such a relief is available to such charities. We have only to recall what happened in the past week to recognise that.  However, there is a belief that there will be a transfer of resources from home based charities to Third World charities because people will find it more attractive and will contribute more to Third World charities.  The voluntary organisations at home identified this aspect quite early and are extremely concerned that there will be a considerable reduction in contributions to national charities.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill is before the Dáil at present.  It can be amended by the Dáil but the Seanad may only make recommendations. I ask the Minister to look at this issue in the context of the mentally <Col N="81" /> handicapped.  There is a welcome increase in funding from this Government and the last Government for this area.  However, if there is a severe reduction in money contributed to voluntary organisations it will impact severely on the plans and progress that should be made given the level of funding provided by the Government.  I ask the Minister to ask his colleagues to look closely at that issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's attendance for this important Private Members' motion.  I realise the Minister has a keen commitment to this area and to the 25,000 people who suffer from mental handicap.  There has been a growing and welcome trend of increased funding for services for the mentally handicapped which, for many years, were provided by the various religious and voluntary organisations.  There is a more open approach in the community to bringing people with mental handicap back into the community and to having mentally handicapped adults living as part of the community in our towns and villages.  That development is welcome.</P>
      <P>I have a little experience of this development.  I live in a town near Moore Abbey, a centre in Monasterevin for mentally handicapped.  Six houses in our town are inhabited by mentally handicapped adults who were, until recently, residents of Moore Abbey. They live in the town as part of the community. Previously they went daily to Moore Abbey to work.  However, a premises was recently acquired in the town to provide training facilities and work opportunities for these adults. That is a welcome development.  The same developments are taking place throughout the country.  The benefits both to the individuals themselves and to the community are huge.</P>

    <P>This Minister's heart is in the right place: his commitment to the mentally handicapped is unquestioned.  The policy on mental handicap services is based on the 1990 &ldquo;Needs and Abilities: A Policy for the Intellectually Disabled&rdquo; report of the Review Group on Mental <Col N="82" /> Handicap Services.  When we last discussed the mentally handicapped in this House we talked about the numbers who were waiting for either residential or day care places.  When the needs and abilities report was published it was estimated that about 1,600 people were waiting for services.  However, in October last year the figures released stated that 1,200 persons with mental handicap were awaiting residential places and approximately 1,500 were awaiting day care services.  Obviously the original estimate of 1,600 was incorrect and the provision of funding that was estimated to be necessary at the time consequently must have been underestimated also.</P>
    <P>If, two years after the report was implemented and substantial funding had been allocated the waiting list is greater than was originally estimated, more funding than we had anticipated will be necessary to address the problem and to allay the fears of many people, particularly elderly parents who are concerned about what will happen to their mentally handicapped children after they, the parents, pass on.  About £12.5 million was allocated in last year's budget and about £12 million is being allocated this year.  There is also capital funding from EU Structural Funds which will amount to about £31 million over five years.  However, this funding is for both physically and mentally handicapped. Has the national data base on the needs of persons with mental handicap been established?  Has it provided ongoing information of the numbers of persons with mental handicap in each area, the number of people who are awaiting services and the estimate of future needs?  The former Minister, Deputy Howlin, said that the data base would be available by the end of the year.  Is it now available?</P>
    <P>Another question that arose at that time related to the development of plans for services for children with autism.  Services for children with autism are available in a crisis.  I understand that a commission set up by the Minister made recommendations at the <Col N="83" /> end of last year.  What has happened in relation to those recommendations and what progress has been made in establishing centres?  One recommendation sought the establishment of centres in Limerick, Galway and various locations throughout the country.  Could the Minister give us some information on that this evening?</P>
    <P>The charter of rights for people with mental handicap is being examined by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor.  The organisations involved with people with mental handicap appear to be satisfied that progress is being made in that area.  I am interested in hearing from the Minister if he is satisfied that the charter of rights will be put on a statutory basis in the near future.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to criticise the Minister; his heart is in the right place with regard to people with mental handicap. However, the original incorrect estimate of the demand for residential and day care places, for the establishment of centres for children with autism, the improvement of the support services for parents and for families of children with mental handicap and the transfer of people from mental institutions into more appropriate accommodation, must be addressed.</P>
    <P>A great deal of money and many changes are required.  However, the time has come for us to make a firm commitment that all the difficulties which were outlined in the policy document will be met, as outlined in the health strategy document which was prepared by Deputy Howlin when he was Minister for Health.  We all accepted that the aspirations in that document were very laudable but unless the funding is put in place by successive Governments, the changes which we would all like to see will not happen.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has our support in whatever measures he feels need to be taken to deal with the problems in this area.  I am particularly interested to hear what he has to say tonight and if he can give us the up to date report on <Col N="84" /> the national data base, the numbers who are currently awaiting residential and day care places and what is happening in relation to children with autism problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator O'Sullivan, Senator Wall, Senator Kelly and their colleagues for tabling this motion.  I also thank all who contributed to what has been a very constructive debate.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity provided by this motion to reiterate my commitment and that of the Government to provide, in accordance with the policy agreement <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> the highest possible level of services for persons with a mental handicap.  We aim to create an environment in which all persons with a disability, of whatever kind, can freely exercise their full rights as citizens in our society.</P>
      <P>Senator Kelly spoke eloquently about the late councillor Michael O'Regan. Michael was blind for a great part of his life.  However, this did not prevent him from living a full and active life and participating in a full range of public service positions.  In his capacity as chairman and member of Tralee Urban District Council, chairman of the board of management of Tralee regional technical college and Tralee Town vocational education committee, Michael displayed a resilience which is an example to us all.  Obviously, Michael had a particular interest in those with a disability and strove throughout his public life to improve services for those less fortunate people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed, it is both poignant and appropriate to recall that at his last Labour Party national conference a few weeks ago, both the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, and myself were in a position to advise him that, in response to a motion put down by his branch in relation to the rights of the blind community, the equal status Bill, which is to be published this year, and the Disabilities Act, which is to follow the report of the Commission on <Col N="85" /> the Status of People with Disability, will be addressing these issues in a substantive way.  Go ndeanna Dia trócaire ar a anam dílis.</P>
    <P>Services for people with a mental handicap have changed radically and for the better over the last 20 years.  The high standard of service provision which has been achieved is due to the sustained efforts of the voluntary and statutory sectors which have worked over the years to assist clients and their families. They have also worked to educate public opinion regarding the rights of persons with a mental handicap to develop to their full potential and to be integrated fully in their communities.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out that we in Ireland have established an international reputation in the field of mental handicap.  The role which the voluntary agencies have played in developing services for people with mental handicap is well known.  Initially, they received little support from the State for their efforts.  Today, however, the State provides almost the entire funding for the services.  The voluntary sector continues to play a leading role in pioneering new services and new approaches to service delivery.</P>
    <P>Parents and other family members play a vital role in the development of services for persons with mental handicap. It is through their demands for improved services that many of the advances have been made over the years.  The Government recognises the importance of their involvement in all aspects of the services.</P>
    <P>Since 1993, parent representatives, nominated by the National Association for the Mentally Handicapped of Ireland, are members of each of the regional mental handicap co-ordinating committees.  Parents' interests are also represented on these committees through the involvement of the many voluntary parents' and friends' organisations which provide services for persons with mental handicap.  In this manner, parents and families are involved in the overall development of services on <Col N="86" /> a regional basis, in addition to their involvement at local level.</P>
    <P>Further evidence of the recognition by the Government of the role of NAMHI and the interests which it represents was given in the fact the annual capital grant to NAMHI by my Department was increased by £20,000 in 1995. This will enable NAMHI to employ an additional staff member and improve services to its affiliate members.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated, the services which have been developed in this country for people with mental handicap are of a high standard.  However, I recognise that we still have much to do if we are to meet fully the needs of all persons with mental handicap who are on a waiting list.  It is important to understand the background to the challenges which face us in meeting the needs of people with mental handicap and their families.</P>
    <P>The fundamental problem which we face is that the number of people with mental handicap has been growing faster than the capacity of services to meet their needs.  The growth in the numbers is a result of increased longevity of people with mental handicap rather than a rise in the incidence of mental handicap.  As the life expectancy of people with mental handicap increases, fewer vacancies arise in existing residential and day care facilities.</P>
    <P>This factor has led to particular problems in that, in addition to the requirement for new services, existing services have had to change to take account of the needs of the growing number of older persons with mental handicap. The needs of this group mirror those of the elderly in the general population. The incidence of illness, increasing infirmity and the onslaught of senility with its associated problems mean that a much higher level of nursing and medical care is required in the management and care of this group.</P>
    <P>As the population of people with mental handicap still being cared for at home grows progressively older, so too do their carers.  It is not uncommon to find parents in their seventies caring for <Col N="87" /> a son or daughter in his or her forties.  I understand those parents' concerns about the future welfare of their son or daughter.  Those parents made great sacrifices to keep their children at home.  They need and expect the reassurance that their son or daughter will continue to be cared for when they can no longer look after them.</P>
    <P>It is imperative, given the substantial investment in the services, that we ensure that the best use is made of those resources and that new services are provided which meet the needs of clients who require them and are flexible enough to change as those needs change.  To do this, we must be aware of the extent and the nature of the challenge which we face.  One of the most important and basic factors required is information on the numbers of persons with mental handicap and their current and future needs.  To date, this information has not been readily available. The establishment of the national data base on the needs of persons with mental handicap will provide my Department, the health boards and other service providers with accurate information which will assist them to target the resources at the areas of most need.</P>
    <P>Since 1990, additional funding amounting to £32.58 million has been made available to develop services to persons with mental handicap.  Up to the end of 1994, over 780 new residential and 1,650 new day care places had been provided.  The home support services, which were initiated in 1992, have been expanded in subsequent years and are now established as an essential component in the range of services available to support and assist persons with mental handicap and their families.</P>
    <P>Assistance has also been given to agencies in recent years to meet identified needs in existing services.  These needs include the problems I have already mentioned concerning more elderly clients with greater medical and nursing requirements.  Overall expenditure on the services in the period 1990-94 <Col N="88" /> increased from £161 million to £238 million.</P>
    <P>The challenge which still faces the Government, service providers and the families of those with mental handicap is to develop services in a way which matches the needs and promotes the abilities and integration of people with mental handicap.  The Government has outlined its commitment to the development of services to people with mental handicap in the policy documents <i>A Government of Renewal</i> and the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and also in the health strategy, <i>Shaping a Healthier Future.</i>  It is my intention, as Minister of State with special responsibility for services to persons with mental handicap, to translate this commitment into a reality.</P>
    <P>Additional funding amounting to £12 million has been made available this year for the further development of services which will become part of the ongoing annual funding of these services; £2 million was used to improve the quality of existing services.  £8 million revenue and £2 million capital have been allocated to the health board regions and will be used to provide a broad range of additional services including: 189 additional residential and respite places; 418 additional day care places; further expansion of the home support services; additional funding for the improvement of services for persons with a mental handicap who are also behaviourally disturbed; implementation of my Department's policy document on services for persons with autism; provision of hepatitis B vaccinations for staff working in the mental handicap services and client groups who are considered to be at risk; and continuation of the programme to transfer persons with a mental handicap from psychiatric hospitals and other unsuitable placements to more appropriate care settings, and £600,000 of the £8 million revenue this year has been specifically earmarked for this purpose. Autism was raised by a number of Senators.  This year £300,000 has been set aside in what we might call a bid situation <Col N="89" /> where we are asking health boards to come forward with worthwhile proposals in the whole area of the care of those with autism.</P>
    <P>Senators will know the policy document was published last autumn and, rather than spread that money thinly, we are seeking innovation and better care.  In effect, some areas of the country will present a headline for others to emulate, so I look forward to the responses to that extra money this year. The precise services to be provided in each region will be agreed by the regional mental handicap co-ordinating committees within the guidelines issued by my Department and approved by me.</P>
    <P>Under the Operational Programme for Human Resources Development 1994-1999, funding is made available from the European Social Fund (ESF) and the Exchequer for training people with disabilities.  A new training programme is being introduced this year. This programme, called the Training Opportunities Programme (TOP), is a prevocational programme with particular emphasis on social rehabilitation of people with significant levels of disability, such as mental handicap and mental illness.  In addition, the Government is also providing funding for 600 training places which will cater for around 1000 trainees outside of the training provision in the operational programme.  Both of these measures are specifically aimed at providing opportunities for those who are not suited to placement in level 1, 2 or 3 training courses funded from ESF sources.</P>
    <P>Capital funding of £4.2 million has been allocated in 1995 for the development of vocational training centres for people with disabilities, including people with mental handicap.  The programme is part of the 1994-1999 Human Resources Operational Programme (OP) under the EU Structural Funds, which provides for a total capital allocation of £33.58 million for vocational training centres for the period 1994-1999. <Col N="90" /> European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) funding assistance of £18.2 million is being provided under the OP with the balance being provided by the Exchequer.  This is the first time that aid from the European Regional Development Fund had been approved for infrastructural investment in training for people with disabilities.  It is a welcome development which will ensure the availability of training centres of the highest quality for people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>In 1993, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Mervyn Taylor, established the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.  The commission is to ensure greater participation by people with disabilities in all aspects of life and to make recommendations setting out necessary changes in legislation, policies, practices and structures to help achieve that objective.  The commission has undertaken a comprehensive review of the current situation, including extensive consultations with people with disabilities, their parents and carers as well as other relevant interests.  It is currently engaged in specific consultations in the area of mental health.  It also established a working group on health with the specific purpose of bringing forward proposals with regard to the health needs of people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>The Government will take specific action to end discrimination and to ensure equal opportunity for participation by all citizens in Irish life.  In this regard, when the commission has reported, the Government is to introduce a Disabilities Bill to set out rights of persons with a disability, including persons with mental handicap together with means of redress for those whose rights are denied.</P>
    <P>As we approach the final years of this century, it is becoming increasingly clear to us all that disability and matters pertaining to it are no longer fringe issues.  Thankfully, disability is now very <Col N="91" /> much centre stage, both nationally and internationally.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities has given a new impetus to everyone in this country concerned with disability.  It is my belief that the work of the commission will turn out to be revolutionary in its impact on the lives of Irish people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>The two year period for its deliberation, which the commission was given in December 1993, has just a few months to run.  The listening exercises which the commission held throughout the country last year were a great success. The Commission for the Status of People with Disabilities offers us the best hope yet to have the place of our fellow citizens with disabilities acknowledged and to have their needs catered for as a valued and essential part of Irish life.  The Government is totally supportive of the commission and the work it is engaged in.  When its final report has been made, this Government will take its recommendations on board very seriously and will follow up with whatever actions required.</P>
    <P>The Department of Equality and Law Reform's legislative intentions insofar as disabilities are concerned are well known.  Late last year it published proposals which will significantly impact on the lives of people with disabilities.  In both employment and non-employment areas, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform is bringing forward legislation to extend legal redress against discrimination over a wide range of grounds, including disability.  Our intention is that this legislation will make discrimination unlawful in the work place but also in education and in the provision of goods, facilities and services. The legislation will comprise of two Bills: a new Employment Equality Bill, updating the 1977 Act which will deal with discrimination in the workplace and will provide protection for those <Col N="92" /> with disabilities, among a number of other categories; and an innovative and far-reaching Equal Status Bill, which will cover discrimination in non-employment areas.  With the enactment of these two pieces of legislation and the publication of the findings of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, the lives of Irish people with disabilities in the 21st century will hopefully be far more diverse and will provide far greater opportunities for pursuing a fuller lifestyle than has been the case in the past.</P>
    <P>In implementing the health strategy, the Government is making the clearest statement yet that our health services should first and foremost help those whose health needs are greatest.  The health strategy, <i>Shaping a Healthier Future,</i> outlines the way forward for the health services and emphasises three important principles: equity, quality of services and accountability.  This last principle, accountability, is especially important in the context of the necessary reorganisation of health structures and the strategy sets out the decisions which the Government has made in relation to structures.</P>
    <P>As part of these structural changes the independent identity of voluntary agencies, which play such an important role in the provision of services to persons with mental handicap, will be fully respected and they will benefit from formal agreements with the health authorities which clearly set out their service requirements and the associated funding. This will permit the development of services for persons with a mental handicap to be undertaken in an agreed, organised manner.</P>
    <P>Partnerships between the voluntary and statutory sectors must be strengthened, with recognition and respect on both sides for the other's point of view. It is only in this context that we will be able to provide services which are available when required, which meet the needs of the clients who use them and <Col N="93" /> which are flexible enough to change as their needs change.</P>
    <P>To conclude, I reiterate this Government's intention to continue the development of services to persons with mental handicap, our commitment to the implementation of the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities and the enactment of the necessary legislation to ensure all people with disabilities will be enabled to participate and contribute to the communities in which they live.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not speak for long because we all want to see the match.  I welcome the Minister's commitment to continue to develop the services.  He has the power to push the Government to make as much money as possible available to cater for the educationally disadvantaged. I know he will do so.  I do not criticise him in any way.  I simply ask him to ensure it is done.</P>
      <P>Not only this Government but past and probably future Administrations find money when a bank or insurance company collapses or a tribunal is set up.  The people we are discussing are those most at need in society.  I urge the Minister to continue to do what he is doing and to push for more; if £12 million is required now, he should ask for £200 million.  If a bank collapsed in the morning the money would be pulled from the sky, as the Minister knows as well as I do.  It would not matter who was in office.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to see his commitment to the service because we in Ireland are deeply committed to the educationally disadvantaged.  It is so different to the attitude in some of our neighbouring countries, where children who are born handicapped can be allowed to die by being starved for two weeks and given pain killers so they do not scream.  At least here we help and support them and allow them a full life.  I know many parents of handicapped children who are overcome with love for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="94" /> I welcome the proposed charter for the educationally disadvantaged.  When the Minister is drawing it up he should look at a document called <i>Enriching Lives</i>, produced by the Hospital Order of St. John of God, who are pioneers in this field.  They have set out a charter for these people, whom they term &ldquo;educationally disadvantaged&rdquo;.  They avoid the term &ldquo;mental handicap&rdquo;.  It is sometimes necessary to use that term because it brings the issue home to people, but it has a stigma attached to it.  In some of the services where I work we have removed the name &ldquo;St. John of God&rdquo; from the gates because the children used to be called &ldquo;Johnniers&rdquo;.  That is no longer the case because everyone now goes to the schools and we try to integrate the children as much as possible. Some of them are severely handicapped, both physically and psychologically, as well as being educationally disadvantaged.  Special provision must be made for them.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to help.  Some families in this city are dealing with adult handicapped people and they cannot care for them or cope with them on their own.  Other Senators will be aware of such cases.  Some of the people involved are highly disturbed; for instance, they smear walls.  I know one case where both parents are over 80 years old and are dealing with an adult man who is difficult to manage.  No services are available to them.</P>
    <P>Another aspect he should examine is cases where people who are termed mentally handicapped also get a mental illness.  They are incarcerated, as someone put it earlier, in psychiatric hospitals, where no provision is made for them.  I know the Minister will do his best.  I did not rise to criticise or complain, only to encourage him to continue what he is doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been a useful and interesting debate.  Above all else, the contributions have stressed the need <Col N="95" /> for flexibility in this area.  There are many different needs.  Senator Lydon mentioned the need to integrate people into ordinary schools and normal education. Many people will benefit from that; others who are profoundly mentally handicapped will need to be in situations where they receive fulltime care. Others are able to attend day-care centres; another group are able to stay at home; and yet more will need close attention and a great deal of care. Another area identified was elderly parents looking after people who are becoming elderly themselves.  A flexible attitude is therefore needed to cater for the various different needs.</P>
      <P>In that context there are local co-ordinating committees in the health board areas, with representation from the various interest groups.  This allows local health boards, in conjunction with service providers, the Department of Health and the parents, to work out the best arrangements for each mentally handicapped person.  That is the right approach.</P>
      <P>I understand Senator Finneran, as spokesperson for the Opposition, needing to act in the way he did, and he has done a good job from that point of view. However, he is not being fair to the motion in suggesting we are patting ourselves on the back.  The debate will indicate that while we have acknowledged the progress made in recent years &mdash; and it is right that we do &mdash; we are also acknowledging that the needs and abilities document was not up to date in regard to the needs in the community. Both Senator Honan and I indicated this.  We have all acknowledged there is a continuing need which must be provided for.  By no means can we say we have done enough, because there is more to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Lee spoke about the attitudes in society and said the service providers are mainly religious organisations.  Even their names, such as Daughters of Charity, <Col N="96" /> indicate that in the past it has been a charity approach.  In our reference to a charter of rights we are taking the approach that people have a right to a service.  Everyone has the right to attain their maximum capabilities.  We are trying to ensure finance and legislation will exist in the future to ensure everyone in our society &mdash; whether they have a physical or mental handicap, or with nothing to hold them back &mdash; will have the facilities they need.  That is why we call for a charter of rights.  That reflects the concern of Senator Lee that society's attitude is important, as is the legislation and the finance put into the service.</P>
    <P>All these issues dovetail together, so the debate has been useful.  The Minister indicated he will take all the issues into account.  He also asked me to indicate that he would be glad to act on the case referred to by Senator Lydon, if he was given the details.  There is obviously a need to continue to provide additional services for people with a mental handicap and to have the flexibility to respond to the various needs in our community.  There is a particular need to accept the contributions and advice of those caring for the mentally handicapped, who know what the needs are.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I am aware that the Department of Education has been contacted by Scoil an Chroí Ró Naofa Íosa in Huntstown regarding its request for an additional remedial <Col N="97" /> teacher.  It is a 820 pupil school and the principal said that 61 children require remedial help in English reading and 77 children require additional help in mathematics; 18 children &mdash; non-nationals, returned emigrants and children who enrolled mid-year &mdash; who received remedial support in previous schools cannot avail of remedial teaching here and at least 50 children whose learning is affected due to dysfunctional family situations are also in need of remedial help.</P>
      <P>The parish consists of a mixture of local authority and private housing and part of the parish catchment area for the school is designated as a disadvantaged area.  In addition, many of the families availed of the £5,000 grant to buy their own homes in the parts of the catchment area consisting of private housing and are under pressure financially, which puts additional burdens on the families concerned.</P>
      <P>In its submission to the Department of Education the school indicated that it has quite a large number of traveller children and it believes that there is an urgent need for integration of these children in the school.  The second remedial teacher would allow for the integration of traveller children in the school and would, in the words of the principal&mdash;</P>
      <P>... address the morally indefensible situation of unsupported integration in the cases of three children with special needs.  A child with a hearing impairment, a child with severe physical handicap and particularly a child with Downes Syndrome are not receiving any additional support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This school is one of a number in the Blanchardstown area which has gone out of its way to assist in this area and to take on any burdens placed upon them.  The Minister will probably be aware that there is a large population of <Col N="98" /> traveller children in the greater Blanchardstown area and that this is one of the schools which opened its doors immediately and welcomed those children.</P>
    <P>The parish has its own problems.  The school principal and the teachers to whom I have spoken feel that all their efforts will be in vain unless the appointment of an additional remedial teacher is made or they get some support from the Department in terms of concrete recognition of their work and assistance with what they are trying to do for these children who need their help.  Hopefully the Minister will respond favourably to the request from Huntstown primary school for an additional remedial teacher.</P>

      <P>As has been indicated to the House in the past, remedial education at primary level is a matter in the first instance for the ordinary class teachers.  The majority of pupils with remedial needs would, therefore, be helped within the scope of the normal teaching service. However, it is acknowledged that remedial teachers constitute the main additional resource for addressing the problem of under-achievement in primary schools.</P>
      <P>Substantial additional resources have been allocated to this area in recent years.  In 1994, an additional 100 remedial teachers were appointed to primary schools and 350 schools with approximately 34,000 pupils benefited from this allocation.  This brought the total number of remedial teachers in place to 1,133.  Of the 3,209 ordinary national schools throughout the country, approximately 2,061 now have the services of a remedial teacher, either on a full-time or on a shared basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Education, recently announced her intention to appoint an additional 55 remedial teachers in the current year. Decisions regarding the allocation of <Col N="99" /> these posts will be made shortly following the collection and analysis of information from schools by the Department's primary inspectorate.  The posts will then be allocated on the basis of priority of need, as indicated by the information collected.</P>
    <P>Of the 407 ordinary national schools in County Dublin, 308 now have the services of a remedial teacher, either on a full time or shared basis.  This includes 20 schools allocated a remedial service in the current year as part of the recent distribution of posts.  This means that 97 <Col N="100" /> per cent of pupils attending ordinary national schools in County Dublin currently enjoy a remedial service.  I can assure the Senator that the needs of Scoil an Chroí Ró Naofa Íosa in Huntstown will be considered in the context of the allocation of remedial posts in 1995.</P>
