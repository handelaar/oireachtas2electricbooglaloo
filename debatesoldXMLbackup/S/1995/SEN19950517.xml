      <P>I have notice from Senator Kelly that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to provide funding for a national Olympic sized 50 metre swimming pool which could be located in Limerick.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Fahey of the following matter:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Justice the proposals she has to change the appeal system in District Courts which allows known criminals a further six months period to continue committing crime; and if she will consider an arrangement with the Minister for Defence to make prison places available at a selected number of Army barracks on a pilot basis.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Dan Kiely of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to outline the reasons some social employment and community enterprise <Col N="814" /> schemes have not been approved by FÁS and his Department.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Cosgrave of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to establish a task force to tackle the increasing wave of crime as outlined in the recent survey carried out by RGDATA.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator O'Toole of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to guarantee that class size in a school is not worsened following the transfer of pupils with special needs on a temporary or permanent basis to a special unit, class or school as is currently being threatened in Inch National School, County Tipperary.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Kelly and Fahey as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On today's Order of Business it is proposed to take items 1, 16 and 17.  Item 1, the Committee Stage of the Arterial Drainage (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1995, will be taken until 6 o'clock.  There will be a sos from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.  If item 1 is completed before 6 o'clock, I propose to have discussions with the Opposition Whips to see if we could take Report and Final Stages as well.  That depends on having the agreement of the House and on how much progress has been made.</P>
      <P>Item 12, Motion 16 will be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.  Item 17, which might be more profitably transferred to a forum in Bray, will be taken after Private Members' Time and not more than 40 minutes will be devoted to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business as outlined by the Leader is agreed.  In <Col N="815" /> view of newspaper speculation and certain spokespersons suggesting that Sir Patrick Mayhew and Gerry Adams will meet next week, I would ask the Leader to arrange a debate on Northern Ireland.  I know the Leader is committed to such a debate, but I believe that now is the time for this House to take the opportunity of airing its views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to a matter that I have raised before with the Leader. This is European Nature Conservation Year and, in addition, the annual general meeting of the Whale and Dolphin Society is being held this month.  In 1991 the then Taoiseach declared all the waters within our jurisdiction as a sanctuary for whales and dolphins.  In view of these facts, I would ask the Leader for a discussion to coincide with the world meeting that is being held in Kilmainham. Perhaps we could welcome these people to Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Leader to convey my thanks to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment for his announcement yesterday, shortly after I had called for more money to be allocated to the community employment schemes?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>It was greatly appreciated and I am confident that the support of the Independent Senators was an important factor.  If the Leader wants an amicable arrangement in this House in future all he has to do is be as responsible as he was yesterday in every other matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to provide time and to ask the Minister for <Col N="816" /> Agriculture, Food and Forestry to come to the House to discuss milk sales, because milk is being retailed in Northern Ireland at a rate which is one-third cheaper than in the Republic.  This is the only food product which is totally out of line with its European price, to the extent that Strathroy Dairies, from Omagh, County Tyrone, are setting up in Dublin to take advantage of the £110 million per year milk sales in the city. This Northern firm is moving into the city because of the racketeering of those who price milk from a cartel position.</P>

      <P>A question for the Leader, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not speak on this subject if farmers were benefiting but they are not receiving the rewards of the high price of milk.  It is past time that the Minister told the nation how he can stand over a retail price of 110p to 116 p when it is one-third cheaper in Northern Ireland.  I feel obliged to raise this matter in the House and I ask the Leader to arrange for a debate.  I hope we receive an answer which satisfies the milk consuming public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to convey our congratulations, which I presume will be spontaneous and unanimous, to Mr. John and Mrs. Pat Hume on being once again selected as Europeans of the Year, in this instance by a prestigious French publication.  If all public representatives from all sides in the North showed the same commitment to peace, sincerity and courage as Mr. Hume, we could move together towards greater harmony and reconciliation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also raise again the issue I mentioned yesterday.  I hope the Tánaiste can make a public statement about the developments in Bosnia.  This morning the Secretary General of the UN made the outrageous statement that because the warring parties are not behaving reasonably and are not prepared to reach agreement, the UN is considering a withdrawal.  That is a shameful abrogation <Col N="817" /> of responsibility.  What about the women and children who are being killed every day?</P>
    <P>I ask the Tánaiste, representing the views of everyone, to totally disassociate ourselves from that shameful abrogation by the UN.  Hopefully, this will set the standard that we are concerned for human beings, even if the warring factions, whom we deplore, do not behave according to the standards we would expect from them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Tánaiste to convey to the Embassy of the United States the full and enthusiastic support of the Irish people for the continuation of the International Fund for Ireland, especially in the context of the Border counties and the peace process? Attempts are being made in the US by Senator Jesse Helms to cut off foreign aid in its entirety.  If that were to succeed, there would be a loss of £20 million to the IFI in the current year. That would have a subsequent impact on small Border towns and villages which receive the money.</P>
      <P>I hope that by rising today some publicity will be given to this matter because the support for the IFI in counties on both sides of the Border and by people from both communities cannot and should not be underestimated.  I ask the Leader to convey to the US authorities and the US Senate that the vote should succeed and IFI funding should continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GordonWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>To underline what Senator O'Kennedy said, I suggest to the Leader that this House send a note of congratulations to Mr. John Hume MP, MEP.  Even those who are politically opposed to him in Northern Ireland are beginning to realise the immense contribution he has made to peace, not just in the North but on this island.  It would be fitting if this House sent him our best wishes and congratulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I join with Senator O'Kennedy in <Col N="818" /> congratulating Mr. John and Mrs. Pat Hume on yet another accolade for peace.  I also support the comments of Senator Mooney on the International Fund for Ireland.  In company with the Tánaiste, Senator Maloney and Senator McGowan, I saw the difference the IFI makes to Border counties when I attended the opening of the heritage centre in Lifford last week.  It is a meaningful fund for Northern Ireland and the southern Border counties and it has and will continue to have the support of the Tánaiste, the Labour party and the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I congratulate Senator Roche on his selection as by-election candidate last evening.  If he had voted for himself, he would have had an even bigger margin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Wright asked for a debate on Northern Ireland.  The date remains to be confirmed but it is currently scheduled for 1 June, in two weeks.  The Tánaiste will be present.</P>
      <P>Senator Fitzgerald has on many occasions raised the European Nature Conservation Year.  I will almost certainly be able to make two hours available next week to debate that issue.  It is often appropriate to get away from pressing political matters to discuss an issue of more fundamental long term significance.</P>
      <P>I am glad Senator Kelleher realises the efficacy of the Seanad and I am sure the most pressing consideration in the Minister's mind when coming to that decision was the Senator's intervention yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McGowan raised milk sales, with which there has been a problem for some time.  My best information is that no one has a difficulty with Northern firms selling milk into the Republic, or firms from the South selling milk into Northern Ireland, because there is a free market.  If the Senator feels there is <Col N="819" /> racketeering or a cartel in operation I will try to make time available to air these matters.</P>
    <P>I am glad Senator O'Kennedy, supported by Senator Wilson and Senator Magner, mentioned the award to Mr. John and Mrs. Pat Hume because it gives us an opportunity to join in the congratulations on his achievement yesterday, an award he and his wife so richly deserve.  As Senator Wilson said, it is only now that many who were opposed to Mr. Hume realise he is one of the true statesmen to emerge from the troubles of the last 25 years, with great vision and a capacity to stand by that vision and bring people together. All Members will join me in sending congratulations and I thank Senator O'Kennedy for giving us the opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>I conveyed Senator O'Kennedy's views on Bosnia to the Department of Foreign Affairs, so it is in no doubt as to the views of the Senator and the House on the matter.  Not for the first time Senator Mooney raised the International Fund for Ireland.  I will convey his feelings to the US Ambassador this morning, I think she is aware of the view of the House.  It is a subject we should debate at an early opportunity.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 7 and 10 are consequential on amendment No. 1 and amendment No. 8 is <Col N="820" /> related, and all may be discussed together.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following definition:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;relevant works' means a watercourse, embankment, or other works that has or have been completed pursuant to a drainage scheme.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am perplexed by the way the Bill is drafted and I am prepared to listen to the Minister's response.  It would be preferable to have this definition included in section 1 with the other definitions.  Section 9 states that &ldquo;'relevant works' means a watercourse, embankment or other works that has or have been completed pursuant to a drainage scheme.&rdquo;  Section 10 tells us that &ldquo;relevant works&rdquo; has the same meaning as in section 9.</P>
      <P>It would be much tidier to have the definition in the definition section. However, I am prepared to listen to the Minister's explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have much the same difficulty particularly with regard to estuaries, coastal problems and culverts.  I raised this matter on Second Stage as I felt it would be desirable to include a provision in the Bill to make it clear that estuaries and coastal areas were covered, especially in locations where the Commissioners of Public Works already have some responsibility.  Some of these areas are now the responsibility of others but in some cases relief schemes had been put in place by the commissioners.  On Second Stage Senator Taylor-Quinn referred to an example of this at Leamore, County Clare, where the work was done by the now abolished Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although matters of this nature would appear to be covered by coastal protection legislation there is confusion arising from the failure of various authorities <Col N="821" /> to accept responsibility for problems that might arise quickly.  Representations are made almost immediately to have action taken and the matter is put on the long finger and is passed from one Department to another because it is not clear where the responsibility lies.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to have written in the Bill that coastal areas and estuaries, where culverts and sluice gates, for example, are involved, are included in the minor and remedial works schemes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. J. Higgins) Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. J. Higgins)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. J. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the points made by the Senators.  The definition of &ldquo;relevant works&rdquo; is included in section 9(1) and section 10(4) because it is referred to only in sections 9 and 10.  It is generally more appropriate to keep the definitions as close as possible to their point of relevance.</P>
      <P>Section 9(1) states:</P>
      <P>In this section &ldquo;relevant works&rdquo; means a watercourse, embankment or other works that has or have been completed pursuant to a drainage scheme.</P>
      <P>This gives the Bill a tidier presentation by putting the definition as close as possible to its point of relevance, where it specifies, in talking about works, what may and may not happen, what can and cannot happen.  That is the purpose of the subsection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it that, under section 9, the Minister would not have any objection to including coastal and estuarine areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>When we get to section 9, the Senator will see that there are amendments dealing with that issue and we will deal with those amendments when we get to them.  There is a broad definition on what is and is not included under section 9 and I will be quite specific at that stage.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate the extent and the nature of the regulations he will be putting in place?  We have all had experience with other legislation, and we know the regulations, which can be broad in their content, often escape us in the House and it is only when a problem arises it is brought to our attention that it is covered by a regulation under a section of an Act. Will the Minister give a broad indication the amount of regulation he proposes under this legislation, the extent of it and the areas in which it will apply?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is, for the most part, self-explanatory.  It seeks to empower the Minister for Finance to make regulations under the Bill which would prescribe in more detail the procedures to be followed by the commissioners in certain instances.  Section 12(5)(a), in particular, provides that a vesting order &mdash; an instrument used to facilitate the speedy transfer of land which might be required in connection with the execution of works &mdash; should be in the prescribed form.  This acquisition mechanism avoids the necessity for lengthy time consuming title research, etc.  Instances may also occur where, through unforeseen circumstances, procedures are not definitively laid down elsewhere, either in this Bill or in other enactments, and may require definition through regulations made by the Minister. None is imparted at this time as the Bill aims at eliminating any doubt.  Subsection (2) is necessary in order to give both Houses of the Oireachtas the opportunity to consider the terms of any regulations made.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <Col N="823" /> SECTION 3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) It shall be lawful for the Commissioners to execute works to prevent or reduce periodic flooding in an emergency without the necessity to prepare a drainage scheme.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that an emergency, where it is not possible and there is not time to prepare detailed schemes and plans, the commissioners would have the authority to move speedily and effectively to deal with a situation which may be deteriorating rapidly and where, if the procedures which are laid down in the Bill were to be followed, important time could elapse and serious damage could occur which would be almost impossible to deal with in the short term.  I wish to put on record that it is not the intention, in putting forward this amendment, that we would have free-for-all.  Senator Taylor-Quinn referred to free range bulldozers moving in to do &ldquo;quickie&rdquo; jobs and doing untold damage.  That is not what we have in mind.  When I was Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works I was involved in a situation where, because of the breakdown of a certain culvert, certain flood waters were rising rapidly and, unless remedial action was taken quickly, they would flood houses and cause untold hardship for the people living there.  It was necessary to make quick decisions on how to deal with this matter.  If, in that kind of situation, the procedure the Minister is proposing here were to be followed, it is likely that many houses would be flooded, irreparable damage would be done and lives could be lost.  The situation could develop where the cost of doing the work at a later stage would be much higher and extensive than was envisaged. That cost could be avoided if <Col N="824" /> these emergency measures could be taken.</P>
    <P>Yesterday afternoon, the Minister of State mentioned that the Local Authorities (Works) Act, 1949, was on the Statute Book and could be used in this kind of situation.  The Minister of State will be aware that the Local Authorities (Works) Act, so far as drainage problems are concerned, has not been used to any great extent for many years. Some schemes which were started under the Act were never completed because, as the Minister and the commissioners are aware, local authorities ran into difficulties because of the extent of their powers and some schemes had to be abandoned.  There were substantial claims made against local authorities which could not be met at the time.  It is not realistic to suggest that the Local Authorities (Works) Act could be used to deal with such a situation because the Act, in its present shape, is not being used to any great extent.</P>
    <P>Before I drafted the Bill I introduced earlier this year, I looked carefully at the Local Authorities (Works) Act to see if it was possible to extend and amend it rather than do what is proposed in this legislation.  I came to the conclusion that the Act would need to be extended and expanded so much &mdash; the additional powers were so involved and complicated that they would have to be taken from the 1945 Act and transferred to the Local Authorities (Works) Act &mdash; that it was far more advantageous and wise to do as the Minister is doing.  That is the advice he would have got from his professional advisers.  I am still not convinced by the argument the Minister put forward yesterday evening &mdash; that if we had this provision it would be used unwisely and in a manner that would create more problems than it would solve.</P>
    <P>The purpose and intention behind my efforts in moving this amendment are genuine.  It may happen next winter &mdash; hopefully it will not &mdash; that emergency remedial action will be taken to relieve flooding in a town such as Ennis or Carlow but because of the necessity to draft <Col N="825" /> schemes and designs and advertise them, a quick remedial job that would solve the problem without creating any further ones will not be within the powers of the Commissioners of Public Works because of the restrictions imposed in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see where Senator Daly is coming from but there are a number of inherent flaws in what he is proposing.  If an amendment as broad as this is inserted and applied across a number of situations, it could be open to serious misuse.  The necessary works that may be required in some instances could be demanded by people under this subsection if it were to be included in section 3 of the Bill. Each local authority has an emergency plan in place to deal with flooding.  The severity of flooding has varied from time to time and the capacity of the local authorities has also varied because, in many instance in recent times, they did not expect such severe flooding.  Nevertheless, they are in a position to respond.  The Minister for the Environment and his Department will have to look specifically at that aspect of local authority work.  It must be examined at a different level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where neither the Minister nor the Office of Public Works has responsibility, the Minister has the power under section 6 to enter into an agreement with one or more persons, including the local authority, whereby that person or persons agrees or agree to defray the costs incurred by the commissioners maintaining specified arterial drainage works.  Senator Daly specifically mentioned sluice gates and similar works.  In those cases the responsibility rests with either the Office of Public Works or the old Land Commission.  There are sluice gates around the country and the Office of Public Works should examine this matter.  There may have been negligence over the years and repair works may not have been done.  That is a simple matter of repairing an existing structure which has been neglected.  To move into a totally new area by including this <Col N="826" /> subsection would be fraught with danger and could not be tolerated. While I appreciate what the Senator is attempting to do, in the long term it would not be wise to include it in the Bill.  It would not relieve the situation anywhere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Daly's amendment.  He is concerned about the delay that would occur if a scheme had to be prepared in an emergency. A delay would first arise in the preparation of the scheme.  In addition, there is an obligation to put the scheme on public display after it has been prepared and allow a prescribed length of time for local authorities and others to make observations on it.  These further delays could exacerbate the emergency about which Senator Daly is talking.  His amendment is desirable but our intention is that it would only be used in extreme emergencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a difficult matter. On one hand we all wish to see hardship alleviated and immediate action taken to solve a problem but, on the other, the works required to alleviate the problem are of a more long term nature.  Having said that, I support the thrust of Senator Daly's comments.  However, the question is who is responsible where a flooding incident takes place?  What agency or agencies are required to intervene? Is the Office of Public Works required to intervene at that early stage?  If not, it should be allowed to intervene.  If that were the result of Senator Daly's amendment, it should be supported. However, it is a different matter from making a scheme which would require more time.  I can see the point about culverts and so on but would they be the subject of a scheme or would it be open to the local authority to go in and deal with that matter immediately?</P>

      <P>The effect of this amendment would be to insert an additional subsection.  It is worth bearing in mind that in executing works. many considerations have to be taken <Col N="827" /> into account, not least, as I stressed in the House last night, the danger or possibility of transferring the problem downstream and the necessity to assess the environmental considerations.  As Senator Henry said, there have been occasions in the past when waterways have been tampered with and this had a deleterious effect on local water schemes, water tables and so on.</P>
      <P>Emergency powers are already available to local authorities to relieve particularly bad situations as may be envisaged in this amendment.  It is not, therefore, considered necessary or appropriate to the current Bill.  Last night Senator Fahey mentioned that the last thing in the world people wanted was to have the early introduction of Hymacs willy nilly.  The danger is that when one includes a section like this, somebody will go in with Hymacs or JCBs without taking adequate cognisance or consideration of the environmental factors.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis asked a very valid question: what agencies are responsible in particular situations?  Senator Dardis gets it right when, in amendment No. 4 he states &ldquo;Before commencing work on a drainage scheme the Commissioners shall prepare and publish an Environmental Impact Study.&rdquo;.  The Principal Act and European legislation and directives make it imperative that before any drainage scheme or flooding relief is undertaken, environmental considerations must be examined.  There is, therefore, no question of the Office of Public Works making a substantial intervention in the area of flood relief or drainage without considering the environmental impact of the works envisaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dardis asked what agencies are responsible.  The Local Authorities (Works) Act, 1949, is the appropriate instrument for action when there is an immediate emergency.  Senator Daly, Senator Taylor-Quinn and anybody from an area where there was flooding this year knows it was the local authorities who acted in Sixmilebridge and <Col N="828" /> Cappamore.  They moved in with resources and the fire service for pumping, sandbagging, clearing of culverts and so on.  It is simply a case of moving in with the existing emergency services. The Act mentions local authorities so they are empowered to undertake specific works.  Introducing a section whereby the Office of Public Works could go in without preparing a scheme and could, without notice, intervene to relieve flooding would be a usurpation of the function of the local authority. One renders to Caesar the things that are Caesar's and to the local authorities the things that are the local authorities'. In this case the local authority is the agency that acts on the ground.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis hit the nail on the head again from the point of view of the remedial works themselves.  They must come under the jurisdiction of the Office of Public Works and the long term solution has to come under the aegis of the Office of Public Works.  One has to differentiate between the role of the two agencies.  I think it was Senator Daly who said that the Local Authorities (Works) Act has not been invoked.  It has been invoked very effectively and is one of the possibilities we are looking at for Sixmilebridge.  There is provision there and the powers are there, and it is a question of invoking those powers while leaving definite demarcation in the area of responsibility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>The thrust of this amendment should be supported.  The Local Authorities (Works) Act is on the Statute Book but it is not used to any great extent.  The problem is that a county manager immediately finds himself in a situation where he does not have the finance to back up works he wishes to do.  Whenever the Local Authorities (Works) Act is mentioned, the question of finance arises.  A small pumping job may be carried out but that is not what Senator Daly intends in his amendment.  He intends that the Office of Public Works carry out works in an emergency without having to draw up a <Col N="829" /> scheme.  In certain situations the former could be very practical but not in my county, and obviously it is not happening in many other counties. However, I accept what the Minister said about Sixmilebridge.  In my country we have not had the experience of county managers involving themselves to any great extent in the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  The question of finance has always arisen and it will continue to be a problem.  The legislation will not be effective in addressing the situation Senator Daly is attempting to address.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>My fear is that expectations have already built up as a result of the publicity this amendment has received. Everybody knows that there has been widespread confusion in this area for many years &mdash; it has not happened overnight. As Senator Finneran said, a certain amount of this is due to the absence of finance in State agencies, whether it be the Office of Public Works or the local authorities, to deal with these problems.  The result has been that particular problems which could have been remedied have been tossed from one agency to another and the situation has been allowed to deteriorate.  Expensive works will now be necessary to remedy something that could have been remedied at much less cost and inconvenience had the responsibility as to who should do what had been clearly defined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before the Oireachtas concludes dealing with this legislation it would be in the Minister's best interests to ensure that we are quite clear about where responsibility lies and who should do the job.  In this regard I am scared by what the Minister is saying.  I am interested in his new found enthusiasm for the Local Authorities (Works) Act. Since it was passed in 1949 most Governments have been anxious to forget about it; they appear to have hoped it would vanish.  There is no doubt that it caused problems for local authorities with regard to claims and they did not have the statutory powers to support the <Col N="830" /> Act.  It resulted in many claims for compensation against local authorities although, to the best of my knowledge, the Act has been in suspended animation since then and has not been used to any great extent.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is saying that it must be amended and extended, that is fair enough and I accept that he would have difficulty accepting this amendment.  I am prepared to give him time to see how he might deal with it on a later Stage.  However, I strongly suggest &mdash; and I am not being party political in this regard &mdash; that this matter must be cleared up while we are dealing with this Bill rather than leave the situation unclear.  Huge expectations have been generated with the introduction of this legislation and next winter the Minister will be faced with many demands, claims and requests for action and expenditure in problem areas.  There will be many disappointed people if they are told again: &ldquo;we do not have the power to do that under the Act introduced last year; it is not extensive or wide enough and we must draw up and publish designs and schemes&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the dilemma facing the Minister.  However, this matter must be clarified and stated clearly in the Bill.  I am prepared to give him extra time to examine this and, perhaps, deal with it on Report Stage or in the other House. In the interest of passing a proper Bill the Minister should look seriously at this matter before it leaves this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not doubt the spirit or the sincerity of purpose in what Senator Daly is trying to achieve.  We are all aware of the crises that arose across the country this year.  That was the reason for the introduction of Senator Daly's Bill and for the introduction of this Bill by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a new enthusiasm for the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  It has been under-valued, under-utilised and has not been invoked.  Senator Finneran said that managers have not used it until now.  The blame for that rests fairly and squarely with the managers.  There <Col N="831" /> might be a resource problem but that can be addressed.  However, the functions are clearly defined, the legislative powers are in place and it is simply a case of using them.  The fact that they have not been used does not reflect on the Office of Public Works but on individual local authorities.  In addition, until now, fortunately, the crises have not been on the same scale as the nationwide occurrences of last winter and spring.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly said that huge expectations have been built up.  Those expectations will be met.  I have already announced that the schemes prepared in Carlow where 70 houses were flooded, Kilkenny, Duleek, Newport and Cappamore, Sixmilebridge, Dunmanway, Williamstown and Belclare in County Galway and the town of Gort will go ahead. Those are the priority areas and all of them have been tackled this year.  We will eliminate &mdash; certainly reduce &mdash; the possibility of flooding in those areas.</P>
    <P>With regard to the appropriateness of local authorities, it is obvious that the local authority is more <i>au fait</i> with local situations.  It knows were there are sluices, outlets, culverts, gullets and services. The local authority has people on the ground and has its offices in the area.  On the other hand, the Office of Public Works is a national agency which has an intermittent spread of services throughout the country.  In cases of emergency it is appropriate that emergency intervention be left to the local authority under the works Act to intervene either by the provision of emergency services or by carrying out works. However, if a long term remedial measure is necessary it is obvious that the intervention of the Office of Public Works will be required, and that will take time.  If it is a short term problem, it is the responsibility of the local authority but if a long term solution is required it is the responsibility of the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>However, the absolute imperative for environmental consideration must be underlined.  That of its nature implies <Col N="832" /> that one cannot move in without doing some type of environmental impact assessment.  On a point of clarification, we are not talking necessarily about putting something on the long finger or the back boiler.  We are talking about carrying out an environmental assessment with a definitive deadline.  However, that involves time so there will be a time constraint.</P>
    <P>I hope I have made the relevant functions clear.  The Local Authorities (Works) Act has been under-used and under-valued.</P>

      <P>The Minister appears to accept that there could be situations in which it would be desirable to proceed with works with the least possible delay.  We would be reasonably happy if the Bill were to provide that it would be lawful for the Office of Public Works to defray the costs of works which would be undertaken in emergencies by local authorities under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  As Senator Finneran said, the main reason county managers and local authorities are reluctant to become involved in carrying out works under that Act is that there is no finance to support those works.  However, if it were lawful for the Office of Public Works to defray the costs of such works that would put a different complexion on the situation.  Would the Minister be receptive to that suggestion?</P>

      <P>I appreciate the fact that local authorities are under considerable financial constraints.  There are the pressures of roads and road maintenance and the various elements of service are constantly subject to debate, as it were, in terms of whether there are enough financial resources.  I will bring the issue of enabling local <Col N="833" /> authorities to undertake works before the interdepartmental committee which I chair and which consists of 12 Departments or agencies.</P>
      <P>We are considering the entire ambit of drainage, flood relief etc., and I am prepared to consider the business of refunding, to or by local authorities, of works undertaken in the course of emergency flooding relief works.  I hope to be in a position to add further clarification to this in the Dáil.  Local authorities have the powers; finance is another matter.  We will consider resources, but it is appropriate that the local authorities, which have the local knowledge and are on the ground, should fully utilise the provisions which are vested in them by the 1949 Act.</P>

      <P>Coming from an area affected by the floods, I am in agreement with the Minister's objective.  At meetings every year Carlow County Council and Carlow Urban Council consider estimates which provide money for relief in emergency situations.  Such relief work consists of putting down planks and sand bags and ferrying people through the floods.  It is an annual occurrence and money is provided. This year was especially bad. Houses and premises belonging to business people in Carlow were flooded last December and again last January and February.  The last thing the people in Carlow want is that a situation would be created where somebody would rush in, relieve the flooding in Carlow but make it worse in Leighlinbridge Bridge, Bagenalstown and other towns downstream. In view of this, the provisions in the Bill and the Minister's approach are correct.</P>

      <P>In support of Senator Mullooly's remarks, I detect that the Minister is moving a little bit in the Senator's direction.  If the local authority or a local co-operative group was <Col N="834" /> to come forward with a scheme which had been planned and was possible from an engineering viewpoint and if it could be shown that there was not any adverse effect on the environment or ecology of the area, would the Minister then accept this as the drainage scheme and defray the costs of carrying out the work by the local authority or the co-operative group?</P>
      <P>When co-operative groups attempt to reach agreements, whether they be over right of ways or wayleaves, and attempt to do a job, they can do so more cost effectively than the Office of Public Works.  By accepting the amendment and considering the possibility of using the local goodwill and the local proposals, the Minister could effectively get a scheme together which would be cost effective and much easier to implement from a practical viewpoint than if the bureaucracy were to undertake the job, which we all accept would be much more difficult.  There are umpteen examples now to be found in local authorities throughout the country where, with a little bit of local co-operation and local initiative, a local authority can undertake work far cheaper than the Office of Public Works.  Hopefully, the Minister will accept a compromise on the amendment.  If he does, we are happy on this side of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little wary that the Local Authorities (Works) Act, 1949, has appeared on the agenda at this stage.  This legislation has been in place for over 40 years and there are a number of problems with it.  The county <Col N="835" /> managers and the county councils are strapped for cash as it is, so they do not have the money to operate the Act in most cases.  There is also the claims factor.  Every county manager is running scared to carry out works under the Act because they are afraid that big claims will land on their desks.  This has already happened and payments have had to be made.</P>
      <P>There is also the problem of removing the short term flooding problems out of the Bill back to the local authorities and other Departments, including the Department of the Environment.  In fairness, the Minister will chair a subcommittee which is prepared to consider this issue.  Hopefully, the Minister will get his way and that the opportunity for relief of flooding in a temporary situation can be dealt with by what he has in mind, and I take in good faith his word on this issue.  However, if we are to go back to a situation that when temporary flooding problems arise the stock answer will be that a solution is to be obtained through the provisions of the Local Authorities (Works) Act, 1949, we might as well not put this legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Local Authorities (Works) Act, 1949, has not been used over the years and to attempt to transfer the responsibilities incorporated in that Act into this Bill by an amendment is unwise.  It is only in recent years, where the severe problem of flooding has arisen, that there has been a significant call on the 1949 Act. A number of local authorities have acted under this legislation, but the Department of the Environment and the local authorities have been restricted because of the lack of cash.  If this is the situation it must be examined, but to insert this amendment into the Bill would be unwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an opportunity for the Minister, in chairing the interdepartmental committee, to consider the matter and have it addressed by the relevant Department and the other Departments <Col N="836" /> dealing with the Department of Finance so that the local authorities, especially those repeatedly affected by flooding. will be provided with specific moneys to address this situation.  This is the road we should pursue rather than attempting to throw more responsibility on the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>The Minister rightly said that the local authorities are fully familiar with these situations because in each local authority area there is an area engineer who has detailed knowledge of every drain, culvert and the flow of every piece of water in the area, and can therefore act immediately.  The Office of Public Works has regional officers, but it only has a more general knowledge; and even if the Office of Public Works were to undertake work it would still have to work with the local authority in order to obtain the specific, detailed information of the local situation.  There are horses for courses and in this area responsibility must be left with the local authorities, but they must be properly funded to undertake their work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Townsend and Senator Kelly for their keen appreciation of what are and what are not the relevant functions of the different agencies, the Office of Public Works and the local authorities.  Senator Fahey appears to be somewhat confused with regard to the amendment and the purpose of section 6 of the Bill.  He rightly espouses the idea of a whole new dimension involving joint ventures, co-operative efforts and new initiatives involving a range of partnerships of agencies or individuals.  However, this is contained in the Bill.  Section 6 of the Bill says:</P>
      <P>The Commissioners may enter into an agreement with one or more other persons (including a local authority or authorities) whereby that other person or persons agrees or agrees to defray, in whole or in part, the costs incurred by the Commissioners in executing or maintaining specified arterial drainage works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="837" /> If one has, for example, a railway line which is under water, Iarnród Éireann, the local authority and the Office of Public Works could conduct a joint venture that could share the cost of the works.  If one has a group of individuals in an area who feel that their area has been neglected and unaddressed and one of them mentions the desirability of a co-operative effort, there is nothing to stop them coming up with some of the cost involved to assist the Office of Public Works in enabling those works to go ahead.  We have not set down specific ratios or amounts, but the principle enshrined in the Bill is that this is a new departure and the Office of Public Works, in conjunction and co-operation with local individuals or agencies, can go in.  Indeed, I saw the situation when I looked at the railway line at Ballycarra in County Clare, and this new dimension could be exploited to the maximum in such an area.</P>
    <P>I accept Senator Fahey's point on the desirability of having local input.  This is desirable in getting local goodwill, easement rights and rights of way, engendering maximum local support, eliminating possible local objections and having to dispense with the provision in the Bill which enables us to force access for the common good.  The ideal situation is to get consensus on the ground, which is the whole purpose of this section.  What Senator Fahey requires is enshrined in section 6 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>On the point made by Senator Finneran &mdash; this has been well countered by Senator Taylor-Quinn &mdash; it is a 40 year old Act.  The fact that it has not been utilised in no way impugns the Office of Public Works or the State.  It may impugn local authorities to an extent, or maybe it is a reflection that there was no need to use it up until now. We are enunciating the powers enshrined in the 1949 Act and encouraging local authorities to run with them.  I am also giving a solemn and categorical commitment to the House that I will take this matter up with the interdepartmental committee.  The Department of the Environment, who are the governing <Col N="838" /> agency and umbrella Department that handles the funding of local authorities, are on that interdepartmental committee and we will be on that level looking at the resources which will be available to local authorities from the point of view of using the 1949 Act when there is an application by a local authority to invoke it.</P>
    <P>If there is a problem with a particular situation, I encourage members of local authorities to bring it to the attention of the Department of the Environment to seek specific funding.  As I said when I was operating as chairman of the interdepartmental committee, I will be making strong recommendations and explaining same in the other House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but this may be the most important amendment in this Bill.  Senator Fahey does not get confused that easily and I am not confusing section 2 with section 6.  Section 6 refers to somebody else making a contribution towards the cost.  We are not taking about this here.</P>
      <P>Senator Daly's amendment is carefully worded.  It says &ldquo;to reduce periodic flooding in an emergency without the necessity to prepare a drainage scheme.&rdquo;.  That is not to say that somebody else cannot prepare a drainage scheme and submit it to the Office of Public Works.  While the local authority would certainly have an input, it should not have to prepare the scheme either because one would then run into the problem which Senator Taylor-Quinn mentioned of people making claims.  If the local group prepared the scheme, one could get over a lot of those problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer back to the Ballinderreen scheme.  In that scheme people began to dig without any reference to any agency, but it is an example of how the matter could be properly dealt with. If that group had prepared a scheme, <Col N="839" /> done its engineering work and environmental impact study or had it done for them professionally, it would have come up with a suitable scheme.  That has been proved because the job is now done, it is there.  I asked an eminent ecologist in the area if what had been done would have any harmful effects. He said that it would not, that it had only taken off the excess water.</P>
    <P>Last year the Office of Public Works prepared a report giving us the mapping and costing for a similar type of job costing £2 million.  Officials in the Office of Public Works have since told me that the Ballinderreen scheme does not solve the problem; it does not drain the area. We do not want to drain the area.  We simply want to take off the surplus water in the shortest period of time during winter if there is excess heavy rain, as has happened in the last few months. The Minister went there, had his photograph taken when standing on the banks of the floods and gave these people his support, and he was right.  I know the hassle the Minister has received, although I have no evidence of it, from within his Department.  I have seen the faxes that were sent down from different sections of that Department which said &ldquo;Don't do this.  Stop this.  Don't give the road an opening licence&rdquo;.  It is a good job that they did not arrive in time to the Galway county manager, because if they did the job would not have gone ahead.  This is the ideal example of a local initiative.  It was done by a Fine Gael TD, Deputy McCormack, and, fair play to him, I would not have the courage to do it.  How one can solve a simple flooding problem through a pragmatic approach that will not damage the environment is now on the ground to be seen by all.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister not to rule out this amendment.  I also ask the Minister to send his officials there again and look at what has been done.  It does work and has worked already.  It will work for the rest of south Galway if it is allowed; otherwise we will have to go through the same rigmarole that we have seen <Col N="840" /> from the Office of Public Works with regard to drainage in this country over the last 40 years.  I do not blame the Office Of Public Works because that is the way in which it has to do it, but it will cost millions of pounds and will take many years to solve this fairly simple problem.  A scheme has now been put in place by a Galway engineering firm, who have an environmentalist advising them, which can drain water from Killamoran to the sea without it costing a fortune and certainly without it having any major ecological impact. We are happy to have a full and thorough environmental assessment conducted on that area as part of that scheme. They could produce a scheme for the Minister in the next few months and could satisfy the Office of Public Works as to its workability and desirability, which is what we are asking for in this amendment.</P>

      <P>This proposal is fraught with danger and is courting catastrophe.  It is wrong to move in on the basis of what is envisaged in this amendment.  It is courting catastrophe because one must get the balance right. The Department of the Marine examined at first hand the possible implications of Deputy McCormack's scheme for the bay.  Galway County Council and our officials were also on the spot.  The nine schemes envisaged this year will tackle all the immediate emergency blackspot areas and we will put in place a second phase of schemes for next year. The fact that it would be done in an ordered and systematic way does not mean that it would cost millions of pounds.</P>

      <P>No, it is not.  I am not talking about sharing cost.  I am talking about a scheme being prepared by the local group, not by the Office of Public Works.  Such a scheme would have to be approved by the Office of Public Works and we are not suggesting for a moment that an environmental impact study should not be done.  It can be done; it is being done at the moment in south Galway.  A scheme similar to Deputy McCormack's could be carried out, but it would be prepared locally.  The Minister said that the Department of the Marine and the Office of Public Works visited Gort.  I know they did, but the scheme has worked.  What is wrong with doing that in an organised, properly planned way?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to draw this out or to be repetitive in what I am saying but it bothers me that the Minister seems to be implying that the Local Authorities (Works) Act, 1949, was not being used because the local authorities did not want to do so, or did not have the resources to deal with it.  The Local Authorities (Works) Act is not used because local authorities ran into legal problems with it.  They found themselves in the High Court with claims. They did not have the statutory cover that the Office of Public Works have under the Arterial Drainage Act.  The local authorities stopped using the Local Authorities (Works) Act because it did not give them sufficient power and authority to do what they needed to do. Resources are important, but we are dealing with the legislation here, with the power that will be available to the Office of Public Works and to local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="843" /> I appreciate that the Minister is chairing a committee and that the Minister for the Environment is on that committee. If the Minister says to me that he will ensure that the Local Authorities (Works) Act is legally extended to deal with these situations I am prepared to hear him out, but he has not said that. The Minister has said that he will raise this matter at the committee.  Unfortunately, by the time this is done this legislation will have passed through this House.  I am fully aware, as are his advisers, that the Local Authorities (Works) Act is not being used by the local authorities because their powers and authority under that Act are seriously deficient.  The difficulties have something to do with availability of resources, but they are mainly to do with the absence of statutory cover which local authorities require to save themselves expensive and extensive court challenges.</P>
    <P>Before we finally decide whether to press this or not, I want an assurance from the Minister of State that between now and Report Stage he will look very seriously at this amendment and see whether he can design a system that will satisfy him.  The Minister of State is being alarmist here this morning in some respects but there is no necessity to get alarmed about this.  Senator Taylor-Quinn did not deny that there is a problem here.  Whether it is a problem for the Minister for the Environment and local authorities or whether it is the Minister of State's and the Office of Public Works' problem, let us clear this here now before we go any further because otherwise we will not make any progress.</P>

      <P>Senator Fahey may not be confused, but I am getting very confused. My confusion can be cleared up by a simple answer to a simple question. Am I correct in understanding that there is nothing to prevent anybody anywhere from preparing a scheme and <Col N="844" /> submitting it to the Office of Public Works for adjudication under section 6?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing to stop anybody preparing a scheme, presenting it to the Office of Public Works and having it adjudicated on. Whether that scheme would then go ahead would be the subject of discussions between the Office of Public Works and the sponsors of the scheme itself.  In relation to Senator Daly's point, resources have been the problem. Three Opposition Senators have said this.  In relation to the powers conferred by that legislation, we are preparing to invoke the Local Authorities (Works) Act in Sixmilebridge, so that gives the lie to that.  The powers are there, but the fact that the powers have not been used until now has to do with the resources available to local authorities, the fact that from 1986 on there was a calculated decision in relation to recoupment of money to local authorities and the fact that local authorities are always afraid that if they intervene in such situations they will be left in the lurch.  That is a matter I intend to address very vigorously at the interdepartmental committee where we will have the Department of the Environment.  I want a situation to prevail that if a local authority wants to do emergancy work it will not be strapped for funds.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister could tell me what works will qualify. During the Second Stage debate I spoke about the maintenance of certain sections of rivers, particularly the River Shannon and River Suck.  Section 3 clearly states that the &ldquo;Commissioners are of the opinion that the execution of arterial drainage works is expedient in respect of any watercourse or any part of a watercourse&rdquo;.  Does the section of the River Shannon from Meelick to Athlone, which is full of silt as a result of Bord na Móna's drainage works, and the section of the River Suck from Ballinasloe to Shannon Harbour, which has suffered from lack of maintenance, qualify under this Bill?  Other rivers are maintained by drainage boards.  Perhaps the Minister could assure me that maintenance will be carried out on certain stretches of our main rivers, particularly the River Shannon which is the receptacle for Bord na Móna's drainage works in the midlands and west.  There will be little in this Bill for the people <Col N="847" /> living in the Shannon-Suck basin if it is unable to provide for such maintenance work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the programme of flood relief works envisaged in section 3 and the extension of the powers of the Commissioners of Public Works in relation to the execution of arterial drainage, the existing powers for the carrying out of such works are contained in section 4 of the Principal Act, which states:</P>
      <P>Whenever the Commissioners are of the opinion that the execution of arterial drainage works is expedient in respect of any catchment area for the purpose of preventing or substantially reducing the periodical flooding of the lands in that area or of improving by drainage lands in the said area, it shall be lawful for the Commissioners to prepare a scheme ... for the execution of such works....</P>
      <P>As regards Senator Finneran's question about whether work can be carried out on sections of the Shannon under this Bill, we are talking about the relief of flooding on a localised basis.  This scheme is a substantial undertaking and has been promised since the year dot, but it has never been delivered.  A scheme for the Shannon would be a major undertaking because it would need to be designed and put in place and the necessary finance would have to be made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Finneran was not in the House last night when I replied to his questions on the stretch of the River Suck south of Ballinasloe, which comes under the jurisdiction of the Shannon Navigation Act, 1990, introduced by my predecessor.  As regards the functions of the different agencies, bodies, organisations, semi-State bodies or otherwise, powers are devolved or responsibilities imposed on the ESB in the south Shannon area for example.  It has specific responsibility for controlling water levels, etc., which is a contentious issue in its own right.  Different powers and <Col N="848" /> functions are vested in different agencies and organisations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>This is bad news for the people of County Roscommon and it is a cop-out as far as the problems on the River Shannon and River Suck are concerned. The Minister referred to section 4 of the Principal Act, which has been in place since 1945, but nothing has happened under it.  I understand that stretches of the rivers can be maintained under this Bill.  The Minister mentioned an overall scheme, but that is not what we require.  The Leas-Chathaoirleach and I are aware that a scheme to carry out works on the catchment area of the Shannon is still as far away as it was 50 years ago.  Unless the Minister can assure the House that the Office of Public Works will carry out works to alleviate the blockages on stretches of the Shannon in south Roscommon, east Galway and Offaly, which are full of silt, this Bill is useless.</P>
      <P>The main problem regarding the Suck and the Shannon is the silting up of a section of the Shannon from Meelick to Athlone.  This is contributing to serious flooding in south Roscommon.  Unless the Bill is able to address this and the Office of Public Works is able, in co-operation with Bord na Móna if necessary, to carry out works on those sections of the Shannon and the Suck, there is very little in the Bill for people in that part of the county.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>When we discussed the previous Bill the Minister indicated that a schedule would be attached to the Bill he was going to introduce.  At the time I argued strongly against the provision of a schedule of priority areas in the Bill.  I made the point that the Minister may be confined to dealing with the catchments identified in the schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How many of the nine projects he has announced will be dealt with under this legislation?  Will they be mainly dealt with under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, as he indicated will be the case with the Sixmilebridge project?  We are becoming more confined and are <Col N="849" /> being told of the projects with which can and cannot be dealt with under the Bill. He has already identified areas where local authorities will have to be more active than they were in the past.</P>
    <P>What has become of the schedule on which he put such emphasis, not so much during the debate on the previous Bill but during a discussion we had on arterial drainage at the time of the severe flooding?  The Minister indicated there would be a schedule of priority areas attached to the legislation, similar to the schedule attached to the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  Would it be the intention to amend that Act to include these projects?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Finneran seems to miss the point about the powers and intentions of the Bill.  It is cost factors which have militated against the drainage of the Shannon.  The Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, includes provisions to enable the drainage of the Shannon to go ahead.  There was never an expectation that this Bill would provide for the drainage of the Shannon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1945 Act contains powers in relation to the drainage and the maintenance of the Shannon. Governments of the Senator's persuasion have been in power in the 1930s, 1940s, 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s and the situation has become progressively worse.  This power under the 1945 Act was never invoked.  The Senator must understand that Act remains in place.  We are adding to and amending it to enable the alleviation of localised flooding to proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Senator Daly's question, it is envisaged that one of the nine schemes will be carried out under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, 1949. For several weeks we have been in active consultation with Clare County Council in this regard.  It is hoped that the other eight projects will go ahead <Col N="850" /> under the aegis of this amended legislation. The schedule of attached works is not incorporated in the Bill.  However, parallel to the publication of the Bill, we issued to all Members of the Oireachtas a press statement committing ourselves to the nine schemes in question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is to some extent misquoting me because he says I am asking for drainage of the Shannon. I made it very clear on Second Stage I was talking about maintenance of sections which have not been maintained and need to be so on account of them being the main receptacles for Bord na Móna developments which are taking place over 50,000 acres.  We know as well as the Minister that there have been different Governments, that the Act has been in place since 1945 and that it has not addressed the problem of the Shannon.  We genuinely expected that this amending Bill would address the problem on the basis that it would provide for maintenance of sections of the Shannon which needed it.  If the Bill does not provide for maintenance, the alleviation of silt and the opening of cuts which are being silted up, and if it does not tackle the problems in the south Roscommon, Clonown, Suck and Shannon areas, it will be extremely bad news for and will not be taken too well by people who have suffered because of the lack of maintenance of the Shannon and Suck rivers over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>One cannot maintain a section of a river unless it is first drained.  Maintenance is a logical corollary and follow-up from drainage works.  Primary drainage works must first be undertaken.  The 1945 Act enables the Office of Public Works, provided the resources are there, to prepare a scheme, carry out the works and, as a logical consequence of this, there would be ongoing maintenance works. Did Senator Finneran honestly expect we were going to announce the drainage of the Suck and the Shannon?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill deals with the problem of localised flooding, which has been a phenomenon for a number of years.  It enables a localised scheme to be carried out.  If as a result of flooding in the Suck and the Shannon, towns, streets and households are under water in areas such as Portumna and Ballinasloe, we can tackle the problems in those black spot areas.  Up to now we could not do this because work would have to be done in the entire catchment area and this would involve a high cost. I am not making any grand claims about what the Bill can and cannot do.  I did not heighten any expectations about what it sets out to do.  I have been absolutely clear and specific that the Bill is enabling people to alleviate and, I hope, eliminate flooding in localised areas.  It seeks to do this and no more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>In his previous reply the Minister referred to the press release of 11 May and the nine schemes mentioned in it.  I am not clear whether or not these schemes will be attended to or just could be attended to, because the release says the Office of Public Works has identified nine high priority areas where the design of flood relief works could commence immediately.  That is different to saying they will commence immediately.  We need to clarify this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Clarification of the schemes is a question of terminology.  It is like the interpretation of the explanatory memorandum, when people felt there was a dilution of the staffing and financial commitments of the Office of Public Works.  The intention is that these schemes will start this year.  The design work is at different stages of preparation, but the schemes are being expedited and I have the assurance of the Office of Public Works that everything possible is being done to ensure that the paperwork is completed to <Col N="852" /> enable them to go ahead.  That is the intention.  In terms of resources, there is no constraint on the works going ahead. I have already received an assurance from the Cabinet that the money will be forthcoming and the Government has already agreed that a Supplementary Estimate will be moved to enable the works to go ahead.  You have my categorical assurance that the works will start this year, though I am not saying that they will be completed this year.  That is only phase one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the schedule, do I take it that you have identified 100 trouble spots nationally?  Will you publish a list each year of the ones that will be given priority?  How will priority be decided?  To take one example, Senator Howard will be familiar with the case of Mrs. Shannon from Carron.  She and her family have been out of her home since Christmas because of flooding.  She does not appear on a list and is unlikely ever to appear on a list because there no catchment there.  Her situation is catastrophic and she is dependent on the Red Cross.</P>
      <P>Could the Minister indicate how things will work out?  This section is making the main change to the 1945 Act and people want to know what the plan is likely to be for next year.  Nine schemes were announced and some have been started, and up to £1 million or £2 million is going to be provided, but can announcements be made on a regular basis rather than in the haphazard way we seem to have at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister clarify a point for me?  Under the 1945 Arterial Drainage Act, the Office of Public Works could only carry out silt removal from a channel of the Shannon &mdash; such as the channel between Meelick and Athlone or short channels further up river, such as the Carrigeen Cut &mdash; in the context of a drainage scheme for the overall catchment.  Under this section, if the silting seriously impeded the flow of water in a particular channel, is the Office of Public Works entitled to <Col N="853" /> remove that silt under a scheme prepared for that particular channel rather than under a scheme prepared for the entire catchment of the river?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the point made by Senator Daly regarding the schedule, the fact that specific schemes were not included and that these were done by way of a Government press statement.  The inclusion in the Bill of a schedule of works to be carried out would, by definition, exclude any other areas which might require attention. The Bill, therefore, intends to confer powers on the commissioners to work in any area where it might be necessary.  In other words, we do not want to tie our hands or confine ourselves too much.</P>
      <P>In relation to the programme of works for future years, the Senator is right.  Approximately 90 to 100 areas have been identified as having recurring flooding problems.  The intention is that these would be tackled on an annual basis taking the very serious cases this year, and then moving on, depending on the degree of gravity or the consequences of further flooding in the interim.  The idea is to take on approximately nine or ten schemes each year and to do them on a phased basis.  This would considerably reduce the ongoing hardship for people over a nine or ten year period.  That is the purpose of this Bill and I have received a commitment from the Department of Finance that they will honour our commitments in that regard.</P>
      <P>Senator Mullooly raised the question of silting of certain sections of the Shannon. It is possible to carry out desilting in certain places but a scheme has to be prepared which must take all the other aspects into consideration.  There is little point in desilting one portion of the river thereby flooding another area downstream; all the downstream effects have to be taken into consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it is not outside the bounds of this Bill to allow a scheme to be drawn up to deal with a section of a river that has silted up.  The Minister says you cannot do maintenance unless you do drainage but I do not follow the logic of that because we have joint maintenance boards that carry out maintenance but not drainage; such boards are not allowed to do drainage. One such is the River Suck Joint Drainage Board, a joint authority of Galway and Roscommon County Councils.  That board is not legally entitled to carry out drainage yet it maintains part of the channel of the River Suck as well as a designated number of tributaries flowing into it, and it has to remove silt continuously.</P>

      <P>The joint board of the Suck continuously removes silt yet is not legally entitled to do any drainage and would be in breach of its terms if it did so.  This point has been outlined on numerous occasions when people have attempted to extend the activities of the board to removing fords, rock basins and banks.  Such attempts have been opposed by the engineering and administrative sections on the basis that the board does not have a legal entitlement to do it.  Despite this, every year, the board has continued to remove silt from blocked drains and from the River Suck itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maintenance of a river is separate from drainage.  There are channels of the Shannon which are interfered with in a number of locations.  I have identified one and Senator Mullooly has identified another.  Currently, there is up to seven or eight feet of silt at Meelick Weir.  According to local people and members of the Shannon Forum, the removal of that silt would alleviate <Col N="855" /> flooding in the Clonown area.  At any time of the year, up to 70 or 80 families in that area can be cut off from the town of Athlone.  The legislation should allow for a scheme to remove the pile of silt at Meelick Weir, and if it does not, then I believe the spirit of the Bill would not be implemented.  Such a move would not involve the drainage of the Shannon, nor do I want the drainage of the Shannon because that is not within the bounds of possibility.  Surely this Bill will leave us in a position to remove what happens to be a mound of peat which has flowed down small rivers and channels which have drained 50,000 acres of bog and formed a large pile at Meelick Weir and at Carrigeen Cut as a result of drainage from the Mount Dillon bogs?  It is reasonable to expect the legislation to do this.</P>
    <P>If the Minister can give that commitment, agreement could be reached with Bord na Móna, the Office of Public Works and the local authorities to remove such mounds of silt.  We would then have taken positive action to relieve the position along the bank of the Shannon at Clonown and along the Suck at Taughmaconnell, Creagh and Culliagh.  The people in those areas have been silent and allowed Bord na Móna to drain 50,000 acres of peat into those rivers.  They are now suffering the consequences and no one has come to their rescue.  They believe this legislation will help them in a small way.  If we cannot address the problem by removing two heaps of turf mould from the river bed at Meelick and Carrigeen Cut, we are reneging on the people in the catchment area of the rivers.</P>

      <P>As I stated before, section 3 proposes to amend the Principal Act to provide the powers necessary to enable the Commissioners of Public Works to undertake drainage works and schemes for the relief of localised flooding <Col N="856" /> from rivers and other watercourses, in addition to their existing powers to undertake arterial drainage schemes in the entire river catchments.  In doing so, however, the Bill must also provide that it will be a requirement that any scheme for the relief of localised flooding must have regard to conditions elsewhere in the catchment concerned and any works done must have regard to their possible effects throughout the entire river catchment.</P>
      <P>It is fine for Senator Finneran to say we only need to remove a mound of turf residue.  However, in doing that it is crucial to put in place a scheme to determine whether there will be downstream effects.  Such schemes are not inconsistent with the recommendations of the Browne drainage commission of 1938 to 1940, which are still valid.  The commission said: &ldquo;All future arterial drainage operations should be conducted on the basis of a comprehensive scheme embracing entire catchments and not otherwise&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In the execution of localised schemes it may not be always possible to guarantee that changes in the flow characteristics of a river arising from works will not result in a worsening of conditions elsewhere.  It is however the intention to ensure that any unavoidable adverse impacts are taken into account before an order confirming a drainage scheme is made and that such impacts are kept to the absolute minimum.  It will therefore be necessary to establish that the benefits accruing from works undertaken in one area are not greatly outweighed by the adverse affects which might occur otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Finneran raised a problem which essentially arises from bogs and Bord na Móna.  There is nothing in the Bill to prohibit a joint venture by the Office of Public Works and Bord na Móna to de-silt a river but it must be done in the context of the wider catchment area.  That is not a catch, but it is provided that due cognisance must be taken of the downstream effects and what is likely to happen in the immediate area and the entire downstream <Col N="857" /> area.  Under section 6 it is envisaged that there will be a joint approach to de-silting; it mentions local authorities and other agencies, individuals and bodies.</P>

      <P>The silting of rivers as a result of the activities of Bord na Móna has been raised.  I come from a downstream area.  If water is released from Senator Finneran's area it will flow down the Shannon and Senator Daly and myself will be confronted with a problem, but I will leave that aside for the present.</P>
      <P>The Minister said Bord na Móna and the Office of Public Works could work together on these operations.  I cannot understand why Bord na Móna does not have responsibility for removing an obstruction it created.  The Minister mentioned the Browne Commission, which met in the late 1930s.  Bord na Móna's activities started later than that and in the years since and it is those which caused the problems.  If I put an obstruction in a drain or river flowing through my land and flooded someone upstream, I would be responsible for it. I am, therefore, not satisfied.</P>
      <P>Senator Finneran seemed to indicate that the Minister was in some way responsible for this problem, despite the fact that relieving the problem in Roscommon might create another problem for those of us further down the river. Nonetheless, if Bord na Móna caused the problem, is it not legally responsible for rectifying the damage it has caused? Why are we skirting around the problem and providing Bord na Móna with a shield?  If the silt came out of the bogs, the organisation responsible should remove the silt, irrespective of what may happen afterwards.</P>

      <P>The connection between what we are discussing and section 4 of <Col N="858" /> the Bill is tenuous.  I find myself in agreement with Senator Howard.  I am familiar with the area from Meelick Weir to Shannon Harbour because I spent many summers as a young person fishing along that stretch.  I recall when that water was clear and one could see the bottom of the river, but it is quite a while since salmon were caught below Meelick Weir.</P>
      <P>My point is related to Senator Howard's.  Surely someone can intervene to prevent the passage of silt into the river?  Those of us who farm beside rivers have responsibilities to prevent pollution, which are enforced by statute, and rightly so.  I can understand chemicals getting into a river because they are in solution, but it is extraordinary that suspended matter is in the river.  There must be a technical way to remove suspended matter from a watercourse, but I suspect those procedures have not been put in place.  Has the Office of Public Works a role to instruct, prevent or stop Bord na Móna allowing this to happen?  The damage has now been done, but if it can be stopped it should be.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the drafting of section 4 on the effects on the catchment. The section is not specific about what the defined effects are.  Does it include the effects on the people?  We can assume it refers to the environmental and other effects, but it may be subject to challenge at a later stage in the courts if it is not defined.  What effects does the Minister envisage are covered by section 4 of the Bill?</P>

      <P>If one takes the Minister's argument to its logical conclusion it would appear any temporary flooding problem in the catchment of the Shannon or the Suck cannot be addressed under this Bill.  Where will the water from the Williamstown drainage scheme go?  The water would normally flow into the catchment of the Suck, but on account of that adding to the problem at Meelick or the lower areas of the Suck or the Shannon, it cannot go ahead, according to the Minister's reply <Col N="859" /> when I asked him if he could draw up a local scheme for the removal of turf residue at Meelick.  If that cannot be done because it would interfere with an area downstream, how does the Minister propose to intervene in Castleplunket or Williamstown to take the water from there?</P>
      <P>The Minister's argument cannot hold up for the implementation of any scheme, no matter how small, in the catchment area of the Shannon or the Suck.  He has steadfastly refused to say that a scheme can be drawn up for the removal of a small amount of silt from the channel on the basis that it might impact downstream.  This legislation will run into severe difficulties unless the problems I have outlined are dealt with.</P>

      <P>No. Senator Kelly asked a specific question.  I know the Senator has tabled amendment No. 4 and we will debate that in due course.</P>
      <P>Senator Burke raised the question of whether one can take action on portions of the Moy, Corrib or Robe catchments drainage works &mdash; these have been valuable in bringing into agricultural production lands which were sodden or waterlogged &mdash; which were not included originally.  One can.  The explanatory note to section 8 of the Bill states that: &ldquo;More than one drainage scheme may be prepared in relation to a catchment area or watercourse.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to the points raised by Senator Howard and Senator Dardis, the problem with silt on the Shannon is not entirely the responsibility of Bord <Col N="860" /> na Móna, although it is a factor.  Wherever there is water flow there is silt.  We must look at the problem areas.  If we can show that it is a Bord na Móna problem we can use our powers of persuasion as a statutory authority to encourage the offending agency to address the problem.  However, a lot of the silt has accumulated having come downstream.  Bord na Móna is obviously part of the problem and we will take up the matter with it to see where the balance lies in relation to the degree of responsibility.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, there is nothing to stop a scheme being done for a specific area provided cognisance is taken of the downstream effects.  Not to take into consideration or evaluate such implications would be foolhardy.  It has to be done.  It would be irresponsible not to do so.  It is not simply a case of alleviating the problem in County Roscommon and moving it downstream to County Clare, for example.  One has to look at all the effects.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis asked what was meant by the effects on the catchment area. We have deliberately left the terminology loose because the effects can vary and circumstances and conditions can change.  Primary effects would be possible flooding effects, environmental effects or any deleterious effect on an area.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran made the point that it is not possible to do the Williamstown area in isolation.  It is possible to do any scheme.  The scheme has to be drawn up first of all; one has to examine the possibilities. If it is a question of controlling water flows, than one does so.  The Belclare scheme is up and running at present and we are controlling the sluice and the water levels.  As that scheme was about to start we discovered there was problem with a wildlife sanctuary and bird watch in the area.  We had to hold back and get the go ahead from the environmental agencies as to what could and could not be done.</P>

      <P>This section is to be welcomed.  It proposes to take significant steps in relation to the time factor. We have heard extensive argument in relation the time needed to prepare a scheme and the difficulties that might ensue.  This section reduces from one month to 14 days and from three months to one month the periods of time for the preparation of the scheme and the consultation with local, authorities. It is significant progress.  It puts the onus on the bureaucracy to act speedily and on the local authority to respond quickly and positively.</P>

      <P>Under section 5(1) of the Principal Act the commissioners are obliged where they have prepared an arterial drainage scheme for an entire catchment, first, to send a copy to the council of every county in which an existing drainage district to be affected <Col N="862" /> by the scheme lies and, second, to publish in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and one or more newspapers circulating in the area a notice to the effect that such a scheme has been prepared and will be placed on public exhibition at specified locations for a period of at least one month.</P>
      <P>Section 5 (2)(c) of the Principal Act allows the county councils a period of three months within which to submit their observations to the commissioners in relation to such schemes.  In the context of large-scale arterial drainage schemes, which often involve huge areas, the periods allowed for exhibition and consultation are reasonable.  Where it is felt that they are too long, in the context of the smaller schemes envisaged for localised flood relief and in view of the urgent nature in many cases of these more restricted schemes and their more local extent, it is considered that one month in case of county councils and 14 days otherwise should be more than adequate.  These issues affecting county councils have been discussed in detail with the Department of the Environment, which has raised no objection to the proposal.</P>
      <P>Section 5(a) of the Bill deals with the reduction of the general publication and exhibition period in respect of schemes for the relief of localised flooding &mdash; as Senator Taylor-Quinn said &mdash; from one month to 14 days.  Section 5(b) deals with the reduction of the time in which a county council will be allowed to submit its observations in respect of such schemes from three months to one month.  There has been considerable curtailment.  No change is proposed in relation to the publication or exhibition of catchment schemes.  It is envisaged that the previous provision would apply to large catchment schemes.</P>

The major problem I have about unnecessary delays is in the run up to the preparation of the scheme before it is ready for exhibition.

      <P>The point is well made by Senator Daly about the desirability of eliminating delays where possible. One has to differentiate between the two types of schemes.  The schemes envisaged in this Bill relate to relief of flooding which does not involve large catchment areas.  We are not talking about large scale arterial drainage works but about areas where there is evidence of recurring flooding.  That is why it was decided to shorten considerably the exhibition and consultation periods.  However, the Principal Act relates to arterial drainage and large scale catchment works.  It would not be desirable to propose any changes to the publication of or exhibition time for catchment schemes because they are larger, more complex, more detailed and more costly.  We are tailoring the exhibition requirements to the needs, provisions, extent and impact of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 4, before section 6, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;6.  The Commissioners shall, when constructing drainage or flood protection works, take such precautions and make such provisions <Col N="864" /> as the Minister for the Marine and the Environmental Protection Agency may consider adequate for the protection of, and the avoidance of injury to, fisheries and the environment during or in consequence of the construction of such drainage of flooding relief works.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The amendment provides that the commissioners should consult with the Minister for the Marine on fisheries matters and with the Environmental Protection Agency to ensure that no damage to fisheries or the environment arises from these proposals.  Section 3 provides that the commissioners will take account of environmental and other matters.  I believe this amendment is necessary.</P>
    <P>Under the Arterial Drainage Act, the commissioners are not obliged to comply with fisheries legislation.  This cannot be entertained any longer.  The provision in the Act was that before undertaking works the commissioners would have to consult with the Minister for Agriculture who had ministerial responsibility for fisheries when the legislation was enacted in 1945.  To the best of my knowledge the commissioners are not obliged to comply with the fisheries laws.  It would be inconceivable that the commissioners would breach the fisheries legislation; nevertheless it is desirable to include this provision as a safeguard.</P>
    <P>There has been an amount of consultation, discussion and dialogue between the fisheries authorities and the Commissioners of Public Works over the years.  There are professional people here who were involved in the Feale drainage a few years ago.  At the time the fisheries board objected to the issuing of the completion orders on the grounds that the fisheries had not been restocked to a desirable extent and this had left the Feale fisheries in a very depleted state.  When the full effect of drainage on the Feale was felt, there was sizeable damage to the fisheries in the Feale catchment.  However, as has been shown over the years, drainage <Col N="865" /> does not necessarily damage fisheries irreparably.  With proper restocking and account being taken of the fisheries during drainage, works can be put in place which enhance the fisheries.  The Department of the Marine, in consultation with the Office of Public Works, eventually got the Feale salmon fishery back into a healthy state.  The commissioners deserve some of the credit for the healthy state of that fishery today.  It is probably one of the best-selling fisheries in Ireland.</P>
    <P>However, that is the point I wish to make about this amendment.  In the construction of schemes, especially minor schemes, where spawning beds and the removal of silt might be involved and where there might be damage to spawning stock at critical periods, it is vitally important that the commissioners consult and agree with the Minister for the Marine before any such works are undertaken.  The Minister may well say that there is a contradiction between what I said previously about another section and what I am saying on this section.  There is no contradiction &mdash; we are talking about two different things.  Dealing with a flash flood in Sixmilebridge, where some sandbags or walls are urgently required to protect houses from being flooded, is totally different from undertaking a drainage scheme in a small catchment where there might be spawning salmon, or undertaking that work at a critical time.</P>
    <P>This amendment seeks to ensure that the Minister will consult with the Minister for the Marine.  I was tempted to put down an amendment repealing the power of the commissioners to undertake work without necessarily complying with the Fisheries Acts.  There have been cases where damage has been done to fisheries during drainage work. There is no doubt that if an individual or a farmer or somebody living by the banks of a river carried out such work they would be prosecuted by the State. Perhaps this is a relic of the 1945 legislation, but it should be looked at carefully. <Col N="866" /> That is why I propose this amendment. The Minister should accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will know that amendment No. 3 is in my name as well as Senator Daly's.  This is the most important amendment that has been put down.  I am amenable to suggestions that it be inserted in other parts of the Bill or that the substance of the amendment be inserted.  However, it is extremely important that we institutionalise a requirement in law to protect the environment.</P>
      <P>We are all aware that although historically the Office of Public Works did good work on the drainage schemes, there were serious environmental consequences in the large catchment schemes.  Earlier the Minister made the point that the <i>raison d'être</i> for the schemes was to bring agricultural land into production.  I do not dispute that. At the time there was a tremendous national drive to increase agricultural productivity; the ethos of farming was to produce as much as possible from the land.  There was, therefore, pressure on land, and people wanted more land.  A good way of improving the land was to engage in these schemes.  However, we must accept that there were serious consequences. In these days of set aside and so forth the pressure on land is not nearly as great and for that reason we must be careful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I view this matter from the perspective of angling.  I am aware, as is the Minister, of what happened to the Moy from that perspective.  It is only now that the Moy has resumed its place as one of the premier fisheries in Europe. This matter is also relevant to amendment No. 6, which deals with the problem of spoil.  The environmental damage to the landscape caused by some of these schemes was considerable and the Moy is a case in point.  Another one that comes to mind is the Barrow, near Monasterevin. Huge mounds of earth were built up beside the stream and were just left there.  There must be some way of disposing of it.  Farmers in some of these catchment areas have approached me to <Col N="867" /> ask what can be done about it.  The local authority, the joint drainage board and the Office of Public Works have washed their hands of the problem, so it appears to fall to the farmer to spread the spoil.</P>
    <P>One could argue that the land has been improved and that as a result farmers are gaining land.  Nevertheless, from a national point of view it is highly undesirable that these canals should be created and that banks of spoil should be left and not disposed of in some way. I am flexible about this, because it is difficult to draft a suitable amendment to outline how it should be done.  I have suggested a minimum depth that could be spread across land, but I am amenable to suggestions as to how the matter could be dealt with.  However, it should be dealt with.</P>
    <P>With regard to consulting with the Minister for the Marine and the Environmental Protection Agency, the Minister will say that European regulations or directives impose a requirement on us to carry out an environmental impact study before a scheme can go ahead.  That is not good enough.  I want the provision to be included in legislation. I can think of several instances of the EU directing us to do certain things which were not done.  It can take years to bring the Government to fulfil those requirements.  Senator Norris would have particular experience of this problem in another area.</P>
    <P>I realise that this is related to what is contained in section 3.  However, section 3 only states that &ldquo;it shall be lawful for the Commissioners to prepare a scheme...and...to make such engineering, environmental, valuation and other surveys of the said area as shall appear to them to be necessary or expedient.&rdquo;.  That is too broad for my liking.  The phrase &ldquo;as shall... be necessary or expedient&rdquo; gives them great scope to decide what they regard as necessary or expedient.</P>
    <P>There appears to be an enormous inconsistency between what might be proposed under a drainage scheme and our promotion of, for example, tourism. <Col N="868" /> We regard our waterways as a premier tourist asset; and from a purely economic standpoint, apart from an environmental standpoint, it makes eminent sense to ensure that the resource is protected. I would be flexible about whether it should be the Minister for the Marine or the Central Fisheries Board who should be consulted.  I will await the Minister's response with interest.</P>
    <P>There is a remarkable inclusion in the compensation proposals submitted by the south Galway flooded victims action group.  The proposals talks about drainage as the ultimate solution to all the problems.  The submission discusses certain procedures and one of the them &mdash; this is suggested by people who have been directly and catastrophically affected by flooding &mdash; is the &ldquo;compiling of an environmental impact study on the proposed scheme and the consequential necessary amendments to the scheme&rdquo;. It is quite remarkable that people in that situation should think of including such a provision in the proposals they have made.  They are to be complimented on it.  After being so close to a disaster, they could see that even in those circumstances there must be protection. They deserve enormous praise for including that proposal.</P>
    <P>We come back to the point about the necessity to do something that is rapid and effective and to achieve a balance between that and protecting the environment. Senator Honan and I did not vote for amendment No. 2, proposed by Senator Daly, although we were in the Chamber.  I accept all of what the Senator said, including that there must be a rapid response.  I also accept that he was speaking not of large schemes but of specific local problems.  However, I accepted the Minister's explanation that it was a matter for the local authority to deal with this matter rather than have it included under the scope of the scheme.  From that viewpoint we abstained from the vote on the amendment because it states: &ldquo;...without the necessity of preparing a drainage scheme.&rdquo;.  I do not see how the safeguards <Col N="869" /> can be built in unless the drainage scheme is prepared.</P>
    <P>However, I appeal to the Minister to ensure that it is enshrined in law that there is a solemn responsibility imposed upon those who are preparing these schemes to see to it that the environment is protected because apart from the citizens who live in our country, the environment is an enormous asset from a tourism and every other viewpoint. Furthermore, on the basis of what was done to some of our waterways, I am fearful of the consequences.</P>

      <P>We are all very concerned with protecting the environment and ensuring that the main priority with regard to any work undertaken by any public body would be that no aspect of the environment is damaged. This is something which permeates all public authorities.  The level of awareness among the public with regard to environmental issues has increased dramatically in recent years and must be commended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am surprised to see Senator Daly's name appended to the amendment, because it is contradictory to amendment No. 2 in his name, regarding emergency situations.  The Minister outlined in the course of the debate this morning the necessity of not doing something in a rapid response situation because of the danger of impacting detrimentally on the environment.  I understand what Senator Dardis and Senator Daly are about and the thinking behind the amendment.  However, it does not make any sense.  It states: &ldquo;The Commissioners shall, when constructing drainage or flood protection works...&rdquo;. Construction involves construction work on the ground and that is not the time when the Minister for the Marine or the Environmental Protection Agency should be consulted.  All these aspects must be examined beforehand. It is important, therefore, that an environmental study be undertaken prior to construction work commencing as it would be ludicrous to consult afterwards. This aspect is covered under <Col N="870" /> section 3 of the Bill, where the Commissioners shall &ldquo;...make such engineering, environmental, valuation and other surveys of the said area as shall appear to them to be necessary or expedient.&rdquo;.  In addition, under EU Directives, this environmental assessment work must be undertaken, and the role of the Environmental Protection Agency is to ensure this.  To accept the amendment in its present format would be very unwise in the interests of the environment because consultation should take place prior to construction.</P>
    <P>Even if all these mechanisms and safeguards from a variety of areas &mdash; whether they emanate from EU Directives, the Environmental Protection Agency or section 3 of the Bill &mdash; were not in place we must consider the record of the Office of Public Works with regard to environmental matters, where it is apparent that except in the most isolated of instances it has had a very fine record with regard to protecting the natural, physical, architectural and heritage environment.  In view of this it would be unwise to proceed with the amendment.</P>

      <P>I support the concept behind the amendment, although I do not know if the wording is the most suitable. The Minister cannot but be impressed with the extent of the concern for environmental issues regarding the Bill within the Seanad.  Again, Senator Dardis has pointed out the concerns of the inhabitants of the various areas which are to be drained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is most important to remember that not only are our wetlands important for us; they are also very important internationally. For example, they provide some of the most important winter feeding grounds for the brent-goose and other ducks and geese which migrate here to get over the harsh winter in Greenland and so on.  In addition.  Senator Daly's point with regard to the fisheries is very important.  I understand that unauthorised drainage in the area near where the Senator comes from had a disastrous effect on oyster beds because <Col N="871" /> there was a rapid flood of fresh water into an area where it was essential that salt water continued.  The conflicting interests in the Bill must, therefore, be carefully considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support the amendment, together with amendments Nos. 4 and 6.  Amendment No. 4 would take care of Senator Taylor-Quinn's reservations regarding the amendment as it calls for an environmental impact study to be prepared before the commencement of work.  Section 3 provides for an environmental impact assessment to be undertaken, but our concern is that it is only &ldquo;... as shall appear to [the Commissioners] to be necessary or expedient.&rdquo;. If they did not believe it to be necessary or expedient, it would not be carried out.  This is why these amendment have been put down.</P>
      <P>All of us are of the view that it is essential, where drainage works are undertaken, that the immediate purpose of flooding relief does not outweigh the environmental impact and the danger to fishlife in rivers.  In my own area, the Barrow Drainage Board has come into conflict with the fisheries board and local angling groups, because in its rush to relieve flooding it has destroyed large sections of the river and has caused damage further downstream at Monasterevin and Carlow.  In addition, it has destroyed much of the fishlife in the rivers which has been built up over the years by fishermen.  Even where such fish life has been destroyed due to pollution kills and so on, the fishermen have returned again and again and tried to build it up, but now they are seeing much of this work being destroyed by flooding relief works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a pity to see local authorities and bodies on behalf of local authorities being in conflict with the likes of angling groups and environmental protection groups because all of us should be concerned about protecting our environment for future generations.  I am aware that the Minister is especially concerned about this area, but when <Col N="872" /> introducing legislation we should enshrine these provision in the Bill rather than leaving it to the discretion of individual bodies who may or may not do what we want.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to consider the historical heritage, including archaeological sites which may be along the banks of rivers, because many of the earlier settlers in Ireland deliberately used river banks as locations for the establishment of habitations.  Some of these areas would, therefore, be in need of protection.  It is not mentioned in the Bill and I ask the Minister to give an undertaking that the Commissioners will take these factors into consideration when carrying out studies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>There appears to be some confusion, especially with regard to the views expressed by Senator Dardis, as to what exactly is intended in the Bill. The Bill deals with localised flooding as opposed to major drainage of a catchment area, which is provided for already.</P>
      <P>Section 3 states &ldquo;... for the execution of such works and for that purpose to make such engineering, environmental, valuation and other surveys of the said area as shall appear to them to be necessary or expedient.&rdquo;.  Obviously an environmental impact study would have to be carried out in all cases and I do not see the need to state that any further than is stated in the Bill.  While I had some concern with Senator Daly's amendment, all he is asking for is a discussion with the Minister for the Marine. I cannot see why the Minister would not accept that because that discussion will take place in any event; it would be absolutely necessary that it would take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister a specific question because we should try to get to the nub of the issue.  We are not dealing with any major drainage of catchment areas that are not included under the 1945 Act and we will not be doing any major drainage works for the next ten years.  What new major drainage catchments <Col N="873" /> will, be dealt with over the next ten years based on the progress that has been made over the last decade?  Since we have not been allocated any money from the European Structural Fund for new major drainage works, we can conclude that drainage is at an end.  Work has been done on a few catchments over the last number of years at a slow pace, mainly because of lack of money.  We have come to the end of major drainage works in this country.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to draining the River Shannon; indeed, the Dunkellan was drained in my part of the country.  If this were done, it would require a major environmental impact study because, as Senator Henry said, there could be a danger to the oyster fisheries.  However, I want to point out to the Senator that there is absolutely no evidence that any damage has been done to the oyster fisheries in Clarinbridge as a result of the small amount of work that was carried out there.  I have no doubt that if a major catchment area drainage programme was conducted on the Dunkellan River, one would need a major environmental impact study because it would impact negatively on the Rashane in Turlough, which is one of the most important wildlife sanctuaries in the country.</P>
    <P>We would also need to conduct a major study of the effect it would then have on the oyster beds in Clarinbridge because of the higher volume of water. However, that is a totally different issue from what we are discussing in this Bill. Senator Dardis is mixing up two points. While we all agree that there must be a careful examination of the impact of such work on the environment, it is not necessary to have a study.</P>
    <P>I have heard a number of contradictions since this debate began and I had to smile at some of them.  The Minister has argued that a scheme must be prepared and that all these matters must be taken into account.  We all agree with that, but the Minister did what I am suggesting in these nine areas.  However, that is not consistent with what he is saying in this Bill about ecological and <Col N="874" /> environmental impacts and the downstream effects.  What the Minister will do in Gort this year will have a downstream effect just as taking silt from the spots in the River Shannon will have a downstream effect, but this effect has been used repeatedly by the Office of Public Works as an excuse not to do things when it did not suit them &mdash; which meant if the money was not available.</P>
    <P>Work has been done on a scheme in Belclare and the Minister is planning eight more such schemes.  He is doing exactly what I am advocating.  When such a job is done in Gort, there will be a downstream effect on the swallowholes and when these swallowholes are tackled this summer, that too will impact on certain things.</P>
    <P>With a common sense approach and careful planning, there does not need to be a negative effect.  As Senator Dardis said, there is no need for an environmental impact study.  The Minister did an environmental study in Belclare and was satisfied, and rightly so, that the impact would be minimal.  The water is being controlled rather than being drained, which is all I ask for south Galway. Consequently, I ask Senator Dardis to carefully consider whether he should push this amendment because I do not believe it is necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>An earlier point today someone accused Senator Fahey of being confused and he said he was not. Now he said I am confused on this matter. I am not confused.  As far as the contradictions are concerned, if the Senator accepts that there is a downstream effect, I do not see how he can then say that there should not be an analysis of what its effects might be, which is what we are asking for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I meant downstream from the river.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course; I do not mean anything else.  I am also aware of the fact that this Bill is talking about local flooding and not large catchments. <Col N="875" /> There can be just as a serious an effect from dealing with that matter as there can be from a large catchment.</P>
      <P>For instance, Lough Conn is within a large catchment, but it has been proven that phosphate levels in that lake have increased and the finger has been pointed primarily, not at the local authority sewage scheme, but at agriculture. I went fishing in Lough Conn last weekend and it was good, but I also fished in it last September when there were filmentous algae all over the lake.  There are many small holdings around the lake where the drains have been lowered thus making it much easier for the water to get into the lake, which is desirable from an agricultural point of view. However, it could also be argued &mdash; and I do not know the answer &mdash; that it makes it easier for the phosphates to get from the land to the water.  Somebody somewhere can and should attempt to answer that question.  I am not at all confused about the difference between a large full catchment scheme and a smaller one but I am saying that a smaller scheme can also have detrimental effects.</P>
      <P>I do not know if Senator Fahey was here when we proposed the original amendments, but I did say that I accepted what the Minister told me earlier. The local authority could deal with the immediate problem and then it was a matter to prepare a scheme which, by definition, would take somewhat longer to set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all <i>ad idem</i> on what we are trying to achieve here, which is to get the correct balance in terms of what the law seeks to do and in protecting the environment as a consequence of any works that might be carried out under this provision. Senator Henry put it well when she talked about the need to ensure that wetland preservation should be an integral part of any of our considerations henceforth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there is no need to go ahead with any of these three amendments. <Col N="876" /> First, on the need for an environmental impact assessment or study, the point has already been made by Senator Taylor-Quinn that this is already provided for, in clear terms, in section 3; it is also provided for in European legislation and directives and that these impact, impinge and have had to be taken on board by the Principal Act.</P>
    <P>Article 16 of the European Communities Environmental Assessment Regulations, 1989, amends section 4 of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  The terms are clear and specific:</P>
    <P>The Arterial Drainage Act 1945 is hereby amended by</P>
    <P>(a)  the substitution for &ldquo;engineering evaluation surveys&rdquo; in section 4 (1) of &ldquo;engineering environmental and evaluation surveys&rdquo;, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the insertion after section 4 (2) of the following section:</P>
    <P>Every drainage scheme which would involve the execution of drainage works of a class or time specified under Article 24 of the European Communities Environmental Impact Assessment Regulations, 1989, or under any provision amending or replacing the said Article 24 shall contain as a schedule annexed thereto, in addition to the matters set out in subsection (2) of this section, a statement of the likely effects on the environment hereinafter in this Act referred to as the environmental impact statement of the proposed works.</P>
    <P>It goes on to be more specific.  Subsection (c) says:</P>
    <P>The insertion after paragraph (a) of section 5 (1) of the following paragraph:</P>
    <P>Where, in accordance with section 4 (2) (a) of this Act, the scheme contains an environmental impact statement, it must send a copy of the statement to such bodies <Col N="877" /> as maybe prescribed by the Minister by regulations indicating that observations may be sent to the Commissioners in relation to the effects on the environment of the proposed drainage works within such period as may be specified, not being less than one month after the sending to the body concerned of the statement.</P>
    <P>That is part of the Principal Act, the 1945 legislation, and we are tied by it. Senator Dardis mentioned the commitment of the European Union to the enforcement of environmental considerations and provisions.  Anybody in a local authority will tell the Senator that where there is an environmental consideration now people look to Brussels. One local authority disregarded a particular environmental regulation and found that the powers of Europe in relation to the enforcement of environmental provisions were so wide that the road allocations for the county involved came under threat.  Once a European regulation is infringed, the possible penalties, costs and consequences can extend beyond the environmental considerations to any aspect of funding that comes from Brussels.</P>
    <P>The provision contained in the amendment is already in the Principal Act as amended and in sections 3 and 4 of the legislation before the House.  The intention of the amendment is quite clear but I do not see much point in taking it on board if it is already provided for under European and national legislation. The Bill itself will be enforced rigorously.  Where there is a downstream consequence the Office of Public Works is obliged to ensure that all aspects of the regulations, environmental and otherwise, are complied with so that no infringements take place and our heritage is preserved.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelly asked whether we are obliged to take cognisance of all sites, historic, architectural and so on; of course we are.  That is prescribed by the Bill.  Both the wildlife and heritage aspects of our culture are now under the <Col N="878" /> aegis of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Michael Higgins. I should have made it absolutely clear that this provision is copperfastened within the existing legislation and that we are tied by European and national legislation.</P>
    <P>In relation to Senator Daly's amendment which deals with the possible consequences of drainage work for fisheries, the Office of Public Works is also obliged under sections 7 (1) and 10 (2) of the Principal Act to consult widely, including with the Ministers for the Marine and for the Environment and specifically &mdash; it is important to understand this &mdash; to take &ldquo;such precautions and make such provisions as the Minister for the Marine may consider adequate for the protection of and avoidance of injury to fisheries.&rdquo;.  It is clear that there is a consequent obligation to consult with the Minister for the Marine.  The obligations which will be imposed will be clear, specific and binding and they will be adequate to protect fisheries, fish stocks, spawning beds and so on.</P>
    <P>In relation to the issue of spoil, which is the subject matter of amendment No. 6, Senator Dardis is correct to an extent. People have seen mounds of spoil on riverbanks but that is a thing of the past. If the Office of Public Works carries out works then it must make provision for the spreading of spoil.  In some cases the owners themselves, because there is a compensation element, spread the spoil. The Senator ties in the level of spoil&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  It is very difficult to be specific about amounts because of humps, hollows and quarries in the landscape so I do not think it is possible to be tied to that.  However, mounds of spoil on riverbanks are a thing of the past.  Now it is spread environmentally; we are obliged to spread the spoil from now on.  While the intention of the amendment is clear and <Col N="879" /> good, the obligation to do so is already part of our remit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to amendment No. 3, while I appreciate that there is a consultation process in section 7 of the Act, it is not adequate and needs to strengthened.  I will be pressing this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept a lot of what the Minister says but we could all cite cases where regulations or directives were not complied with and people had to go to the European Court to seek recourse and it still took years for them to be implemented.  I am also aware of the fact that a regulation is different from a directive and does not have the same force.  I am not worried about the EU's commitment to protecting the environment but I am worried about our commitment and how that will be exercised. I am confident that the EU would come after us if some of the regulations or directives were not complied with, but that process takes time and the damage is done at that stage.  If, as the Minister suggests, the amendment is not necessary then the provision at the bottom of section 3, which I have already said I do not like, is not necessary.  What is the nature of the obligation in respect of spoil?  Is it a legal or a moral obligation? Who is responsible?  Am I correct in assuming that it is the Office of Public Works's responsibility to clear the spoil and not the landowner's, unless he agrees?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to take Senator Dardis's measurement of the level of spoil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>We are prepared to be flexible on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>Then that is not necessary. I want to discuss what is implied here by Senator Daly and Senator Dardis.  Before pressing these amendments, both Senators should cast their minds back to the many occasions earlier <Col N="880" /> this year when we discussed the subject of flooding, which has resulted in this legislation.  Pressure was greatest when people were flooded out of their homes and their belongings destroyed. The water has now gone from their homes, although there are cases in Senator Fahey's and in my areas where people will never again be able to inhabit their homes.  If I, or anyone, suggested at that time when legislation was being sought to deal with the situation that we should build in a raft of reservations and opportunities to delay the implementation of what was intended, Senator Daly would be the first man to take me on.</P>
      <P>What is being sought here is more than adequately provided for.  I am concerned that there are too many opportunities for organisations &mdash; some will say rightly so &mdash; and for individuals, even crackpots, to avail of the option provided to prevent the people whose homes have been flooded from being dealt with.  I believe that is an unreasonable attitude to pursue.  I believe the concerns of the Senators are more than adequately catered for.  It is not fair on those whose homes have been flooded and who stand that risk again unless remedial action is taken, that we are attempting to include clauses and amendments which would provide for the further delay of the remedial action required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how often we have to say this, but I repeat again that there is no dispute about the need for remedial action.  The legislation is not about remedial action; it is about preventing this from recurring, which is a different issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not dispute what Senator Dardis is trying to achieve.  We should have made it clear on Second Stage that it is provided for in existing legislation.  The 1945 Act did not include it, but subsequent statutory instruments imposed from Europe necessitated the amendment of it.  Therefore, they are <Col N="881" /> now enshrined and copperfastened in that Act and they effective.</P>
      <P>As regards the disposal of spoil, we have acknowledged what happened in the past but we cannot revisit past sites. We are talking about future operations. The business of environmental assessment automatically looks after that. There is a commitment on the part of the Office of Public Works that where works now take place, the entire aspect of spoil and spoil distribution levelling will be dealt with.  As regards the method itself and the defect in the amendment, although its spirit is all right, it is too prescriptive in relation to copperfastening the levels and amounts at 50 cm and so on.  The Senator will appreciate that on that basis we cannot accept it.</P>
      <P>As regards Senator Daly's amendment, surely this is not the time to press an amendment?  As I pointed out earlier, a consequent obligation is already written in stone in relation to what we have inherited from other legislation. Under sections 7 (1) and 10 (2) of the Principal Act the commissioners are obliged to consult widely, including the Minister of the Marine and the Minister for the Environment.  It states: &ldquo;to take such precautions and make such provisions as the Minister for Agriculture may consider adequate for the protection of and the avoidance of injury to fisheries&rdquo;.  Nothing could be more clear, prescriptive and effective.  I do not see the need to press this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be necessary <Col N="882" /> to do this if the commissioners were obliged to comply with the Fisheries Acts, but they are not.  I do not have the Act before me but a section specifically provides that they are not obliged to do so.  I am not satisfied with this vague situation. If the Minister has time to look at it he will see I am correct.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>

      <P>Notwithstanding the exemption conferred by the foregoing subsection of this section, the Commissioners shall, when constructing drainage works in pursuance of a drainage scheme, take such precautions and make such provisions as the Minister for Agriculture may consider adequate for the protection of and avoidance of injury to fisheries during or in consequence of the construction of such drainage works, provided that the said Minister shall, in consultation with the Commissioners, satisfy himself that taking such precautions and making such provisions will not cause substantial detriment to such drainage works or substantial hindrance to their construction.</P>

      <P>The purpose of putting down amendment No. 5 was to endeavour to define clearly that it was possible for the Minister to enter into arrangements to undertake joint ventures with other agencies, individuals or local authorities. As the Minister has been well aware from the debate here, there has been an amount of discussion on the involvement of Coillte, Bord na Móna and other State agencies in works of various kinds which create some environmental and drainage problems. The section clearly sets out that the costs of dealing with some of these problems can be organised between agencies.  Departments, individuals and the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>Can a joint venture be put in place between, for instance, Bord na Móna, the Office of Public Works and a local Leader programme to undertake a scheme?  While it could be possible to organise the funding of it, it is not clear that the execution of it can be undertaken. This was why I suggested that it be specifically written into the Bill that the preparation, maintenance and execution of schemes could be undertaken under this section and the actual physical work done.  Therefore, if the Office of Public Works organised a scheme and called in the local authority, who would provide plant and machinery, and if Coillte and Bord na Móna could deal with some of the problems in the midlands, they should be able to physically co-operate together to get the work done rather than defraying the cost of doing it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister envisage that joint drainage boards could have arrangements or agreements with the Office of Public Works for specific works?  In most if not all cases &mdash; certainly in the cases I know &mdash; the responsibility, obligation and terms are confined to maintenance.  Local authorities <Col N="885" /> and joint drainage boards have identified and are identifying sections which need dredging and are contributing to flooding.  The authority does not lie with drainage boards to remove, say, 30 yards of rock in a river.  Does this section allow an arrangement between the Office of Public Works and a joint drainage board?  If it does, it could be very beneficial to the works which are being undertaken by some of those boards and would complement them very well.  I am sure the Minister's officials can confirm that there are scores of requests made to the Department of Finance, the Office of Public Works and the Minister for some funds to alleviate certain areas of flooding. The stock answer which has been given is that responsibility for this lies with drainage boards.  These boards are only responsible for maintenance.  They cannot legally remove a rock section from the bed of a river.  Such rock sections are destroying all the other good work being done by boards in many of the rivers I know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I have similar problems with drainage boards.  There are a number of rivers in County Leitrim where drainage boards are carrying out work, but problems are being caused further down the line because they cannot dredge and remove rock.  It would be beneficial if there was anything in the Bill which could alleviate this problem. I welcome the way the Minister has handled the legislation.  The sort of large of drainage works which have been carried out previously, such as the Bonnet in County Leitrim, which resulted in a large cost to the Exchequer, possibly will not happen again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is always a great deal of water in the Owenmore-Arrow River in Sligo, with which Senator Daly is familiar. Rather than having a huge drainage scheme carried out, the farmers of the area would be happy if the river was just dredged.  It would alleviate a huge problem. This is the kind of thing the Bill is about.  Under this section the local authority or some of the semi-State bodies <Col N="886" /> may be able to co-operate in a drainage scheme like that which would be useful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The points raised by Senators Daly and Finneran are directly related in that they seek clarification as to who can enter into joint ventures in terms of the spirit of section 6 of the Bill.  Senator Daly asked specifically whether for example, agencies such as Bord na Móna, a Leader group and local co-operative groups could do so. That point was also raised by Senator Fahey.  The answer is yes, and I gave the same reply to a query by Senator Dardis.  The intention is that once the work is being executed in consultation with the Office of Public Works, provided approval has been obtained from the Office of Public Works, we can either authorise people to do the work themselves or by way of joint venture involving the Office of Public Works or agencies.  There is no problem in doing works.</P>
      <P>In relation to Senator Finneran's related query as to whether or not joint drainage boards could be involved, the actual section refers to &ldquo;one or more persons&rdquo;, so one can deduce from that that a drainage board is composed of more than one person.  There is provision in the Bill to enable drainage boards to enter into joint ventures with the Office of Public Works or other agencies to undertake works.</P>
      <P>As I pointed out earlier following a query from Senator Burke, section 8 of the Bill specifies that more than one drainage scheme may be prepared in relation to a catchment area or a watercourse. It is worth going back to section 43(1) of the Principal Act, the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, which says</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whenever the Commissioners are authorised by or under this Act to execute any drainage or other engineering or building works they may, in lieu of executing such works themselves or by their officers or servants, contract with the sanction of the Minister with any person for the execution of whole or part of such <Col N="887" /> works by such person and may for that purpose enter with the sanction of aforesaid into such contracts and agreements as may be requisite.</P>
    <P>So the Act prescribes that, and we inherited this legislation in terms of what we are enshrining in the Bill today.</P>
    <P>Senator Reynolds asked if large catchment or arterial drainage works were a thing of the past.  In my contribution to the House on Second Stage I said that they may not be a thing of the past, not that the Office of Public Works wants to get involved in heightening people's expectations.  We made the point forcibly that, from the point of view of drawing down EU financial support, the days of bringing huge catchment areas into agricultural production is a thing of the past.  But there is a general acceptance that from the point of view of environmentally friendly organic farming there may in future be merit in designing such schemes which could well come back into vogue and become part and parcel of the Office of Public Works's remit.  It is something that many us would not object to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to clarify the situation in relation to estuaries.  The Minister will be aware that erosion problems have arisen in many estuaries.  Tidal movement over the years has seriously undermined protections that were built 30 or 40 years ago.  In the case of some coastal culverts which have also been affected by erosion, there is not a huge amount of expenditure involved. However, because some of them were carried out under the old Land Commission schemes, with the participation of local farmers, it has not been possible to define precisely who was responsible for their maintenance and repair.  Several culverts on the west Clare coast have been severely affected by erosion, and the irreparable damage has left many hundreds of acres of land flooded in winter and springtime.  Up to now nobody has taken responsibility for them.</P>
      <P>The Minister will quote the Coastal Protection Act, which has not been used to any great extent, mainly due to its cumbersome implementation.  Only when a local authority passes a motion can work be undertaken on these coastal sluices.  At that stage the Coastal Protection Act comes into play and its sections are used to deal with such matters. However, it is cumbersome and involved, and is a tiresome way of doing things.  That Act is also the responsibility of another Ministry, the Department of the Marine, which adds to the confusion.  Can the Minister clarify that under this Bill it will be possible, in specified and precise cases, to take responsibility for having some of these works done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCalnan" hpid="Mr. Calnan Mr. Calnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the position of people downstream from an improvement <Col N="890" /> work?  How will they be notified what improvements will be made?  In his press release the Minister mentioned high priority areas, one of which is Dunmanway, my home town.  I have had inquiries from people who live downstream from where it is hoped works will be carried out to alleviate flooding. How will these people be notified?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 9 is designed to deal with situations which arise from time to time, where modifications are made or proposed by landowners and others to channels and embankments which form part of schemes undertaken by the commissioners and for which they now have maintenance obligations. Section 9(1) introduces a new definition applicable only to this section and section 10 &mdash; that is, a definition of the term &ldquo;relevant works&rdquo;&mdash; and simplifies succeeding references in both sections to watercourses, embankments and other areas on which works are being carried out pursuant to a drainage scheme.</P>
      <P>Section 9(2) introduces a new provision lacking in the Principal Act, whereby the commissioners may consent to the alteration of channels or embankments where they have previously carried out a scheme.  In view of the changing uses of land, the extent of development of housing and industry and other urbanisation not envisaged 50 years ago, such changes may be desirable and I think we must cater for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 9(3) deals with the issues which might arise in circumstances where the commissioners have or have not given their consent under the previous subsection to the alteration or modification of works.  It allows them to either reinstate them or maintain them as modified.  The apparent contradiction in the modification of the provision for reinstatement, even where prior consent to modification, etc., had been given, is easy to explain.  Unforeseen and changing circumstances between the granting of permission and the execution of the change in the regime &mdash; such as developments elsewhere, or increased <Col N="891" /> unforeseen flooding &mdash; might therefore necessitate reinstatement at a future date.</P>
    <P>The remaining parts of section 9(3) permit the commissioners to maintain any works modified, relocated or altered as if they were part of a drainage scheme carried out by them and applies the provisions of the Principal Act to such maintenance.  Among the main provisions of that Act are sections 31 and 38 under which there is an obligation on the commissioners to maintain completed schemes in proper repair and effective condition.</P>
    <P>Section 9(4) and (5) provide a mechanism whereby the costs incurred by the commissioners in reinstating what we call relevant works &mdash; those modified, relocated or altered without their consent &mdash; can be recouped from the offending parties.  For this purpose the owner of the land where the modification took place will be deemed &mdash; unless and until the contrary is established &mdash; to be the person who carried out the modification in question.  In this connection it is reasonable to assume, in the absence of any contradictory information, that such owners would at least have consented to the modification in question without reference to the commissioners. The method of recovery of costs &mdash; for example, by means of a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction &mdash; is a standard provision.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly mentioned the confusion about coastal protection.  Unfortunately this happens in many Acts where several agencies interface with each other and one has to hark back to previous legislation to see who has power to enforce and where obligations arise.  In this area, if the amendment put forward earlier by the Senator was accepted, it would require a transfer of functions from the Minister for the Marine to the Office of Public Works and would, therefore, involve amending the previous legislation.  People will acknowledge the main authority on <Col N="892" /> coastal affairs has to rest with the Minister for the Marine.</P>
    <P>In answer to Senator Calnan, the Bill provides for a consultation process and an exhibition period, albeit a shortened one, to deal with emergency flooding problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to go back over our discussion on the operation of the Local Authorities (Works) Act, 1949, and the relationship between the local authorities and the commissioners in this instance.  However, establishing where responsibility lies between the Department of the Marine, the Office of Public Works and the local authorities in the coastal protection legislation involves another day's work.  Since the Minister is chairing the sub-committee, will he see whether the Coastal Protection Act can be modified to deal with these circumstances?  I would be satisfied if he could give an assurance to do that.</P>
      <P>This area is not easy to deal with because of the multiplicity of legislation and the various responsibilities of different Ministers.  Nevertheless there is an acute problem which will not go away and will involve huge expenditure in the next few years unless immediate action is taken.  The Coastal Protection Act is cumbersome and needs a drastic overhaul to make it more effective.  I ask the Minister to indicate he will discuss with the Minister for the Marine how this can be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has my assurance that that will be one of a number of considerations actively pursued by the committee in due course.  As the Senator said, this is an ideal agency to examine where the provisions of the various Acts concern the Office of Public Works's actions on drainage and flooding relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other aspects which impinge on flooding will also be considered.  For instance, we might consider whether it is worth putting a proviso in the planning regulations that regard should be had to a potential impact on flooding, particularly <Col N="893" /> from the point of view of the location of domestic dwellings.  It may also be considered whether large scale afforestation, &ldquo;vertical ploughing&rdquo; and growing forests too far down the slopes of mountains and too near houses affect flooding.</P>
    <P>All these matters will be addressed and in due course we will make our considerations and recommendations known.  Afforestation, planning, coastal protection and the interaction of legislation will all be examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I am confused about section 10(2)(a) and (b).  If, under section 10(2)(b), the commissioners are given rights to enter immediately by virtue of necessity, why is there a 24 hour stipulation in section 10(2)(a)?  Either would be acceptable but why is one there to override the other?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 10 is a natural extension of section 9 and details the circumstances in which the commissioners <Col N="894" /> may enter on land and do all such things as they consider necessary to prevent flooding or other injurious consequences arising from the unauthorised modification, relocation or alteration of what we term relevant works.  Such powers may be exercised when the commissioners are of the opinion that there is an imminent risk of flooding.</P>
      <P>Section 2 provides that before entering onto land a minimum of 24 hours previous notice must be given to the owner or occupier of the land in question, unless the commissioners are of the opinion that it is necessary to enter on the land immediately.  There has always been doubt as to the circumstances in which the commissioners might enter on lands for the purpose of reinstating works interfered with by third parties, or the notice which must be given before doing so.  The matter has been the subject of litigation on a number of occasions.  The problem is that there is no provision in the Principal Act which adequately covers the various situations which may arise.  In view of the high risk of flooding in cases where unauthorised interference has taken place &mdash; for example, the removal of stretches of embankments &mdash; it is considered expedient to make a provision in this Bill.</P>
      <P>Section 10(3) confers an entitlement on third parties to compensation where they suffer damage or loss as a result of the commissioners entry on their lands for the purpose of reinstating works where they were not responsible in the first place for the unauthorised interference and the Office of Public Works has to enter in the interests of executing a protection mechanism.</P>

      <P>I am concerned about changes proposed for the commissioners relative to the operation of legislation.  There appears to be a proposal to transfer responsibility for the canals system to a new agency.  It is another issue, but I would be anxious to have clarification as to whether the canals system has been taken into <Col N="895" /> account.  This may not be the appropriate section for this matter, but would the Minister of State give an indication of the ministerial position in relation to changes contemplated with regard to the navigation system and the transfer of responsibilities?  I favour the present system.  The Commissioners of Public Works have done an excellent job on the development of the inland waterways. It would be unwise to readily contemplate changing it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Daly's point as to the work done by the Office of Public Works on our waterways, in particular, the canals system.  It has been exemplary.  Senator Daly brought in the Shannon Navigation Act, 1990, when he was Minister, which enabled work on the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal to go ahead.  These have been enlightened developments in enhancing our tourism potential and exploiting the natural environment.  The Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht now has responsibility for the canals system and the waterways.  The Office of Public Works is involved, but the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht is the policy maker.  The Office of Public Works is the executive agency responsible for the work on the canals.  The functions are split.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  Many of the provisions in the amendments, such as putting in place an advisory committee, would not involve charges on the Exchequer.  They would be advisory positions; some of the personnel already employed by the State could be involved.  A committee of professionals drawn from Government Departments to advise and assist the Minister in the operation of the legislation would not impose a major charge on the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>I would have preferred to have an amendment which inserted a new section before section 11.  Section 11 deals with the determination of the amounts of compensation under the Principal Act.  The major difficulty I have with this amending Bill is there is no provision in it to pay compensation to those who have experienced hardship because of the flooding which occurred through no fault of theirs and which in some cases was quite inexplicable.  I mentioned the example of Carron in north County Clare earlier, where houses were flooded out of the blue, people had to leave their homes and they have not gone back since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many debates in the House the Minister gave us an outline of the way he felt these matters could be dealt with, which did not necessitate the introduction of legislation.  I disagree with the Minister's position.  I have put forward reasons why putting a mechanism in <Col N="898" /> place under this legislation to deal with such situations would be far superior, far more streamlined administratively and, ultimately, far more cost effective. A mechanism should be put in place for people who had serious problems arising from arterial drainage or periodic flooding caused by poor drainage and where the flooding was not as a result of their actions.  Many of them were unable to avail of insurance cover as they were in locations subject to flooding.</P>
    <P>We went into all of this already and I do not wish to labour the point at this stage of the debate.  On a matter of principle, it would be far more advantageous for all the Members of these Houses to set down a formula for dealing with this type of situation, specifically covering it on a statutory basis, where people would be entitled to make their claims, have them adjudicated on and have compensation paid where it was felt they were entitled to it, or, otherwise, have their claims rejected. This would be far more important than having a haphazard arrangement in place involving various agencies, Government Departments and bodies such as the Irish Red Cross Society &mdash; however good they may be.  I do not want to be misinterpreted.  I have the highest regard for the Irish Red Cross. They have done tremendous humanitarian work, not only in Ireland but also abroad.  Nevertheless, in this respect it is the Government's responsibility to put in place an arrangement which would enable the examination and discussion of claims at official level.</P>
    <P>It was in this regard that I put forward a number of amendments which set down systems for the Minister, because I was aware it would be impossible for the Minister to deal with all of these matters.  It would be far better to have an advisory committee which could also advise him in relation to priorities and the causes and effects of flooding.  It would be of great benefit to the Minister in dealing with his everyday work on the general issue of drainage.  I still feel, even at this stage, that this could <Col N="899" /> be extended by the Minister to insert a provision under section 11, which is a section designed to determine amounts of compensation in places where the commissioners are going in to acquire property and to have installations etc. We on this side of the House cannot do it because of the procedures of the House, but the Minister can do it.</P>
    <P>We are affording the Minister this opportunity to indicate why it is his decision to allow a haphazard, complicated, complex arrangement to remain in place between agencies and Departments and officials and organisations, rather than setting down a precise formula to deal with this himself.  He would have a committee at his disposal to advise him on a number of issues, to adjudicate on claims and to apportion compensation, if a case were genuine, or else refuse it.  It is not my intention to have an open-ended committee or function in place which would necessitate huge expenditure by the Exchequer. For that reason, what I have proposed is tightly contained and under the direction of the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, which by any standard cannot be regarded as being overgenerous.  People have suffered severe hardship.  While the prospect has been held out that something will be done for them, they are still unhappy with the situation we have.</P>
    <P>As late as this morning, arising from the discussion in the House yesterday, there were people from flooded areas on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;&mdash; honest, decent people who are beginning to feel that there may be sleight of hand involved somewhere here &mdash; who are looking forward to this legislation.  At any of the meetings I attended &mdash; and I attended some with the Minister of State &mdash; the people were clearly interested, first and foremost, in dealing with the problem and, secondly, endeavouring to get compensation for the hardship cases or some indication of what it is proposed to do for them.  In some cases it would be less expensive if the Minister relocated the people concerned.  This is an <Col N="900" /> issue on which the proposed committee would advise him and help him decide. I do not wish to highlight particular cases, but there was an instance where two houses were flooded and where the cost of undertaking a drainage scheme was estimated at £500,000.  In that kind of situation it would be preferable to make some arrangement with the families to relocate their houses to safer places that would not be affected by flooding than to attempt to put a major £500,000 drainage scheme in place. People would be willing to have these matters discussed with them.  In the absence of a statutorily defined mechanism to deal with this, we are left with this haphazard arrangement.</P>
    <P>I wish to put on the record that I appreciate the work done by the Minister of State since he took up office and by his predecessor, Deputy Phil Hogan, who went down to Sixmilebridge during his early days in office.  I believe that the Minister of State genuinely wishes to assist in these cases, that he is anxious to help and will help at the end of the day.  In an effort to assist him, I suggest that it would be far better had he a framework and a formula with which he could do this, an established procedure, an advisory committee to assist him and an appeal mechanism, where cases could be examined in the same manner as an appeal for a social welfare claim. This should be done on a statutory basis in the same way as we deal with social welfare or any other payments.  This is why I am not satisfied with section 11.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I can appreciate Senator Daly's concern.  One of the aspects that has gained most publicity in the flooding crisis has been the element of compensation and whether or not people will receive it.  I again make the point that we have already received £260,000 from Brussels.  That is only part of the compensation package.  On behalf of the Government I am giving a commitment to the House that it will honour its obligations in relation to the other element that is required.  An adequate compensation package will be <Col N="901" /> put in place.  It is a valid expectation that if we are to determine the amounts of compensation, we should look at the degree of insurance that is applicable or in force in individual cases.  That is why I have called on the insurance companies to discharge their obligations as a matter of urgency, because we are anxious to discharge ours.  Insurance companies should not be let off the hook.  The insurance companies should not be standing back waiting for a Government response.  The insurance companies have a primary responsibility to honour their obligations to their clients.  I have called on them to honour their obligations so that we can honour our complementary and subsequent obligations.</P>
      <P>In relation to building a statutory compensation provision into the Bill, this Bill is not a compensation Bill; it is flooding containment and relief Bill.  Its purpose is to eliminate or alleviate the occurrences and consequences of flooding. Building in a statutory compensation fund gives people false expectations. If we build it in, somebody in a place such as Ballyhaunis, where flooding is unlikely to occur, could decide that flooding was one element of their insurance cover they were going to leave out because the State was going to pick up the tab for all flooding.  In addition to that, as has been proved in the past, where compensation was required we were able to provide it under the aegis of the Red Cross.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make the point very forcibly in relation to south Galway that the report is almost completed. As soon as the report is completed and we have the details of the insurance available, I will be going before Cabinet as a matter of urgency, making a presentation and we will then draw down the Supplementary, on which we have received agreement in principle from the Government. As regards the people from Glenbrack who featured on television last night, I was in the houses in question and I saw the structural damage.  There is quite obvious subsidence.  The foundations <Col N="902" /> are gone and there are considerable structural cracks.  The Office of Public Works has made a report to us on that. At this moment engineers are examining those houses.  If relocation is required, relocation there will be.  If these houses cannot be put back into a reasonable state of repair &mdash; quite frankly some cannot &mdash; then relocation will occur.  I will be bringing a report before the interdepartmental committee which will subsequently go before the Government.  I am anxious that this be done as a matter of urgency.  I do not want to see these people left hanging in suspense as to whether they have to go back and do sticking plaster and patchwork repairs.  I want the matter clarified once and for all.  If relocation is necessary, it will be delivered.  That is a binding obligation that I, as Minister of State, will discharge because people are entitled to a very early answer as to where they can go or stay from now on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a certain sympathy with the Minister's remarks.  I listened to what he said on the radio this morning. I am not sure if the lady to whom he was speaking was speaking to us from under water but she was certainly disconnected at an early stage in the proceedings.  The Minister is right in saying that where insurance companies have a responsibility, it should be discharged and the State should not be required to pick up a debt which more appropriately belongs to the insurance companies.  What the State can do is ensure they expedite proceedings and, by persuasion, ensure that payments are made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard an insurance broker say that a policy covers one for everything except what happens, and I think there is an element of truth in that.  Some legal entanglements might arise from delays in payment and I am sure the Government and the Minister will look at this area.  Relocation is urgent and I accept what has been stated in that respect.  We should be careful to distinguish between the two types of compensation, that which arises as a result of the flood and <Col N="903" /> the type of compensation in the Bill which relates to the consequences of a scheme.  They are not the same thing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assure the Minister that while I have been trenchant in my criticism, it is not personal.  He seemed to take it a little personally last night.  Everything I have said is factual and I will stand over each remark.  I was at the function in Gort, even though the Minister did not meet me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I was in the building while he was there but missed him, otherwise I would certainly have welcomed him. The Minister has been toiling for the past ten weeks with a problem which is not his but rather a consequence of the fact that there is no structure to deal with the tragedies in south Galway and other places throughout the country. There must be some system, either under legislation or regulations, whereby we can deal with situations similar to that which exists in Gort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was critical of the Minister of State's decision to have the Red Cross deal with this problem because I believed it was far too serious.  The Minister of State argued at the time that the Red Cross could distribute the money without red tape and delay.  That has proved to be wrong because there have been delays and many householders in Gort still have not got one penny to help them through their difficulties.  Several families have been paying mortgages for houses they moved out of 14 or 15 weeks ago and are also paying for rented accommodation or living with in-laws to whom they have to make a contribution. Everybody knows it is not easy to move in with in-laws.  These people have been left in the lurch.  The Minister said that if relocation is required, it will be done.  Engineers are currently examining the relevant houses.  However, irrespective of their reports, there is no way people such as Mrs. Shannon in Clare will take the <Col N="904" /> chance of moving back into their houses because it is likely that those areas will be flooded again next year.</P>
    <P>There is a farmer living in Gort who has not featured on television or anywhere else but he has been out of his house at least five times in the last 15 years.  He takes it for granted that when the flood arrives and comes in his front door, he leaves.  The Minister might have visited his house; his name is Mr. Kilcooley.  No insurance company will look at that man.  He lives in his farmhouse and has accepted that this is normal. The damage done to a number of houses means that people have to relocate. However, in some cases where houses are not structurally damaged beyond repair, the owners still have no option but to relocate because it would be silly to risk spending £20,000 doing up their houses while being unable to get insurance cover.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that he does not want people left hanging in suspense. I do not know how they are hanging at the moment if they are not hanging in suspense.  I know the Minister is genuine.  He said again today that he will give a very early answer.  The day for giving a very early answer is long gone.  This is 17 May and these people left their houses some time in January. We have heard commitment after commitment that the Red Cross will pay this money.  As far as I am aware, no money will be forthcoming for at least another ten days or two weeks which will take us into June.  If what some of these people say is correct, they will be very disappointed unless the Minister comes up with a substantial sum of money to supplement the support they are already getting.</P>
    <P>I do not see why it has been necessary to go through this rigmarole.  Why was it not possible for the Government to agree that where houses have been flooded for eight to ten weeks people will be compensated properly for the damage?  There is no question but that the insurance companies should be made responsible and pay their clients what is rightfully theirs.  Nobody is arguing <Col N="905" /> with that.  Everybody agrees that the insurance companies must pay out the claims.  However, the reality is that they will pay out claims even in cases where they write off the houses but it will not be enough &mdash; I have checked this with a number of insurance companies &mdash; to allow people to buy a new site and build a new house.  Consequently those people still do not know what their position is.</P>
    <P>I asked a number of people in Gort to check the small print on their insurance policies.  I found that quite a number of them included a clause which stated that they were not covered for damage resulting from a rise in the water tables. It seems that is a fairly common condition in insurance policies for houses. What will happen where insurance companies have told some people that they will pay them but will not reinsure the house?</P>
    <P>I repeat a point I made last night.  The Minister mentioned people in Ballyhaunis. Where damage is caused by a natural disaster which would not normally be covered adequately by insurance, the Government must pick up the tab to support those people.  That should be either written into legislation or put into regulations.  The Minister's problem and the reason I have been critical of him during this period is that he has no structure and no parameters under which he can operate and he must take the rap.  Some effort should be made, if not in this Bill certainly in some other way, to recognise that a problem exists and that we must put structures in place to tackle it in the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that the report on the houses, the Red Cross and so forth, is almost ready and that proposals will soon be put to the Government.  I have been listening to the people who own those houses.  On 16 May those people are no more knowledgeable than they were on the day they left their houses.  The Minister has been sympathetic and has visited their houses.  He has told them that the Government will be supportive in their relocation.  However, that is all general: there is no clear commitment <Col N="906" /> about what exactly they will receive at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>The Minister says he will give early answers.  The time for answers is long past.  Where a person had to move out of their house and where there will be a shortfall in the amount of compensation they will receive in order to build a similar house in a similar location, the Minister should be more definite in saying that they will receive the amount of money required to bridge that gap.  That should have been said to those people three months ago but it is still not being said to them.  The Minister has only given a general promise.</P>
    <P>It is the principle that is important at this stage.  I appeal to the Minister to return to the Government with legislation or regulations to deal with a natural disaster.  There should be some arm of Government, whether it is an interdepartmental committee or a committee such as that proposed by Senator Daly, to provide answers the morning after a man's roof is taken off by a storm instead of having people running around like headless chickens and recruiting a few volunteers from the Red Cross.  The Red Cross does not have the ability, manpower or the organisation to deal with what happened in Gort and it was wrong to ask them to do so.</P>
    <P>A number of businesses throughout the country were badly affected.  At least two of them were in the Gort area. In one case a sawmill was closed last year for almost three months and it was closed this year from 1 January until very recently.  Three or four people were employed there.  As soon as the flooding occurred it had to be closed down.  The proprietor of that little sawmill, having had to close his building after Christmas and having had to let his employees go, did not insure the building as he normally would on 1 January because he was in dire financial circumstances and he did not insure his employees because they were not working. During the flooding the place went on fire as a result of an electrical fault. He suffered serious losses and, of <Col N="907" /> course, it was because of his own negligence that he was not covered by insurance.  He is still wondering if he will ever get back on his feet again.  Surely somebody could have gone to him and said &ldquo;give us an indication of your losses and we will try and come forward with some compensation for you&rdquo;, but no, we are waiting and waiting and waiting. People are at the end of their tether now.</P>

In this day and age it is not good enough that we must put people through such suffering.</P>

      <P>The Minister is to be congratulated on his efficiency in introducing this complex Bill which deals with complex areas.  The Minister has said that this is a flooding containment Bill. However, it goes further.  It allows us to drain parts of catchment areas.  Senator Daly brought his own Bill before the House and I congratulated him for doing so.  I have no doubt that his Bill prompted the Minister to bring this Bill before the House as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated that over £240,000 will come from Europe and that it is only part of the compensation that will be paid.  The Government is committed to and will honour the Supplementary Estimate the Minister has introduced.  I welcome that.  I have no doubt that the Minister will ensure that <Col N="908" /> those funds are dispersed as a matter of urgency to alleviate the problems in the flooding blackspots throughout the country.  The Minister also stated that he will call on the insurance companies to comply with their duties.  I agree with that.  The insurance companies should not renege on their responsibilities.  Just as we and the Government have a responsibility to carry out our duties as elected representatives, the insurance companies have specific responsibilities and they should honour them.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that relocation will be dealt with urgently if required.  I have no doubt that he will act immediately when the details of the report are available.  I welcome this Bill and I congratulate the Minister on the efficient manner in which he has introduced it in the Seanad.  The Bill will allow us to make great progress in this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>We are coming to the conclusion of our discussion on this Bill. The provisions in section 11 mainly refer to amendments to an Act which was introduced around the time of the Famine; it is 150 years old.  This is an ideal opportunity for the Minister to put new life in the Bill by inserting the amendments we have proposed.  I did not put down those amendments lightly. I put a great deal of thought into them and examined other legislation.  When I was appointed Minister for the Marine a campaign was being conducted by former employees of Irish Shipping who felt, rightly, that they had been denied proper and adequate compensation.  In fact, many years afterwards legislation was introduced to the House to address this situation.  If the Minister considers the Irish Shipping legislation, which dealt with a specific problem relative to Irish Shipping, he will see similarities with these amendments.  Indeed, apart from a few variations, their provisions are almost identical, as I discovered when finalising them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These amendments have not been dragged down from some rooftop and put together in an attempt to embarrass the Minister.  There is no question of <Col N="909" /> that, because the Minister would be in a much sounder position if there was a statutory body in place to deal with these problems.  They are not going to go away because of this legislation.  This was admitted by various speakers, including the Minister.  If the weather conditions were to continue over the coming winter, many of the problems will not be dealt with, many of the schemes will not be finalised and further problems will arise.</P>
    <P>The Minister still has an opportunity to consider the matter carefully again and tighten up the section before the Bill goes to the other House.  In the provisions of the Irish Shipping legislation he will see that there is a realistic, sensible, straightforward method of dealing with a problem which is going to be in existence for some time and which will be a recurring one for him and his successor. He should not have any doubts about this.  If he has, he is not going to learn from the experience of the past, which illustrates that there will be problems of this nature.  In this respect, the section proposes to change the Land Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845.  This legislation is over 150 years old and changes to it are welcome.  However, new legislation is required in this specific area.</P>
    <P>I have no brief for the insurance companies. They have a responsibility to their clients to deal with their claims, and they and we must ensure that these responsibilities are honoured.  If we find evidence that insurance companies are not honouring their responsibilities in dealing expeditiously with claims of this nature, we have methods of raising and dealing with this in the House under existing legislation.  In addition, I have no time for anybody who may attempt to evade their responsibilities to their clients in the belief that somebody in Government will share the responsibility with them.  People paying their premiums are entitled to cover and to have their claims fully paid for and met.</P>
    <P>However, there are a number of genuine people who did not have insurance or were unable to get it, and <Col N="910" /> there will be many more in this latter category arising from the events of last year.  I am aware of some people who have been advised by their insurers that while they are currently covered, they will not provide cover or quote for cover next year if they remain in their present locations, and one of the Minister's officials was informed of this when he visited one of them.  I do not wish to go into people's private affairs, but there is an opportunity in the legislation to put a mechanism in place which can be sufficiently adjusted to ensure that there are no abuses.  In the absence of a commitment from the Minister on this, we must consider opposing the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the possibility of opposing the section, it is a stand alone section and it deals with the amendments which are necessary with regard to the Land Clauses Acts. As a former Minister with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, Senator Daly will be aware that the only sections of the Land Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845 referred to in the 1945 Act are sections 69 and 83.  This is why we are bringing into operation the other relevant sections of the Act, and these are set out in section 11(1)(a)(iii) which states: &ldquo;any loss or damage referred to in section 15, 16, 32(2), 34(3) or 46(4) of that Act,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the point made by Senator Daly and Senator Fahey regarding compensation, Senator Fahey said that he has been listening to the people on the ground.  However, I have been meeting the people on the ground. In addition, I have met the south County Galway IFA, whose members have unanimously endorsed the action I have taken, not once but on two occasions.  I have also met the ICMSA, whose members have unanimously endorsed and have been quite loud in their praise for the measures I have taken.  In addition I have met the individual householders in Glenbrack, and if that lady had been given a chance this morning she would have spoken her mind because they are realists and do <Col N="911" /> not expect miracles.  They are also pragmatists and know that when somebody is making a genuine effort there is an obligation on them to acknowledge it. I have given them an assurance that if relocation is required it will be delivered upon.  I can do no more than that.</P>
    <P>From the moment I raised the possibility, by way of a debate in the House, of introducing the Irish Red Cross Society, Senator Fahey has undertaken a campaign of disparagement, villification, ridicule and denigration against an organisation which has been internationally recognised&mdash;&mdash;</P>

When we asked for advice on this, it was recommended that the Irish Red Cross should do so.  It is an international organisation.  Other countries take this course of action and it was suggested that we do likewise.  The Senator mentioned that there are considerable examples on the ground of people suffering from trauma and mental stress and so on.  I cannot think of any agency better fitted to deal with this kind of situation than the Irish Red Cross Society.</P>

      <P>The Senator threw the Bill in the air yesterday and said it was not worth a whit and that this was the reaction of people on the ground.  Yet the Bill addresses a problem which has been staring successive Administrations, including that in which the Senator was Minister, for a considerable period of time.  Now, at last, the Bill contains provisions which will deal with the flooding problem in the Senator's town of Gort and the work will be undertaken this year.</P>
      <P>In addition, I have effectively addressed the problem of compensation, and it will be delivered upon. There is no need to put an infrastructure or superstructure in place on this basis because there is already one in place.  Last but not least, I have addressed the issue of relocation for the first time ever &mdash; no past Government has ever done this.  As I have said, if relocation has to come about, it will.</P>
      <P>I also pointed out &mdash; and this point was also made by Senator Dardis and Senator Burke &mdash; that if people are insured and have paid premia, by all means we will go after that.  When it comes to the balance, we will certainly not be found wanting.  That has all been done in the space of three months.</P>
      <P>On the points made by Senator Daly, particularly on the need to put a structure in place, we should not even be discussing that amendment since it has been ruled out of order, which is not my fault&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Senator Daly's amendment was putting in place a committee consisting of the two commissioners of the Office of Public Works, an officer of the Minister nominated by the Minister, a county manager and a representative of the General <Col N="914" /> Council of County Councils.  We now have in place a permanent structure &mdash; the interdepartmental committee.  I am prepared to look at the composition of that committee as being the agency or the committee from which compensation will be dispensed henceforth.  If it means tagging on a few extra members &mdash; for example, the Irish Red Cross &mdash; I am prepared to look favourably at ensuring that the final composition of that committee, from the point of view of a compensation element or remit, will have all the various agencies, interests or individuals who would be competent to deal with this aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have tried to be fair to the Minister by not accusing him of being responsible for the difficulties that have arisen, but when I referred to the Irish Red Cross I did not say the kind of words the Minister used.  I said that it should not have been asked to do this job because it is not in a position to do it.  I have met volunteers from the Irish Red Cross who were trying to do a job that they did not have time to do because of their other work.  It is a fine organisation and there are good people in it, but all I said was that they should not have been asked to take on a job that a Government agency should have done.</P>
      <P>What I find unacceptable is the Minister's continuing attitude that if relocation is necessary, it will be given.  Take the example of Mr. Kilcooley in Ballylee. He has been out of his house at least five times in the last 15 years.  He cannot get insurance.  There is no question about if relocation is necessary; that man must be relocated.  Can the Minster not tell him that he will be relocated and pay him enough money to build a house on another part of his farm where he will not be flooded again next year?  I can assure the Minister &mdash; I will come back to him personally on this point &mdash; that if we get even a quarter of the rainfall we got this year in the future, Mr. Kilcooley will have to leave his house again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>When we started this debate the Minister indicated that he would be forthcoming in looking at some of the amendments we put forward. The Minister, when he announced the introduction of the legislation on national radio a week ago, publicly stated that he would be willing in this debate to work in partnership with the Opposition and to frame amendments to make it a better Bill.  At the start of this debate, I acknowledged the way in which the Minister had dealt with the matter and the fact that he had included in the Bill some of the intentions we had in the previous Bill.</P>
      <P>Section 11 largely covers the determination of the amount of compensation to be paid under the Principal Act.  The Minister could embody in this section some provision which would cover a mechanism to deal with the question of compensation.  I will deal with the committee on section 15.  I also acknowledge that the Minister has made some concessions there.  However, it would be within the Minister's power to put in some of these sections to deal with the compensation issue in hardship cases.  I am not saying that the Minister should put all of them in, but we will not oppose this section if he can assure us of that.  I am not talking about people with insurance or those who are capable of meeting their liabilities arising from these damages, but about a small number of people suffering from hardship who do not have the necessary finances to deal with this crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not as if the Government does not have any responsibility for this situation. We all share the responsibility for the fact that this legislation has not been updated for the past 50 years, but these incidents occurred because of the <Col N="916" /> failure of a system of drainage to meet these problems, whether they be in Cavan, the Burren, Gort, Carlow, Kilkenny or in Ennis, where many people were put out of business and the town was turned into another Venice for a week during the floods.</P>
    <P>The Minister did say publicly that he would be forthcoming on how we could improve this legislation as it proceeded through this House.  Since the Committee Stage of this debate began the Minister has not given us a commitment that he would even look at any of these matters on Report Stage.  In spite of the Minister's good intentions, we have seen nothing by way of compromise on his part to meet some of our fears.</P>
    <P>We fear &mdash; this is a point of principle &mdash; that the absence of a mechanism to pay compensation to people who are suffering hardship will continue and will not be resolved.  We may well see a similar situation arising next year and the year after.  I am referring to problems arising from the failure of an arterial drainage system to meet the demands placed on it with the result that people are flooded out of house and home.  We are not talking about huge expenditure here; we are talking about a confined, specified and controlled area with a controlled mechanism that, from the Minister's point of view, would be far more streamlined and sensible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said previously, I fully appreciate the anxiety of the Senators on the element of compensation. However, this is a Bill specifically designed to deal with the effects of flooding.  When the provisions in this Bill are acted upon, and nine of them will be this year, it will certainly curtail flooding in these areas.  The Senator's anxiety about compensation would then be considerably diminished and reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point of the legislation is to untie my hands in relation to what the Office of Public Works can do.  We are carrying out nine schemes this year.  If one looks at the list of claims that have come in from around the country, one will find <Col N="917" /> that the bulk of them are from the affected nine scheme areas.  South Galway, as I have explained before, is a separate situation and that is being addressed.  If this Bill and the schemes are successful &mdash; the Bill will be made law by the summer and the schemes will be in operation within months &mdash; nine blackspots, where considerable claims for compensation are being justifiably made, will no longer require compensation. The primary purpose of this Bill is to address flooding problems.</P>
    <P>Enshrining statutory compensation in legislation like this would be wrong because there is no need for it.  Compensation has been delivered by the Government in the past, present and the future.  There is no need to enshrine in this legislation any statutory provision for determining compensation.  One of the Senator's sections is included in this Bill as is the spirit of the legislation which he introduced.  I have given the Senator a commitment that the interdepartmental committee will be assigned specific responsibility in relation to determining compensation amounts from now on and I am prepared to consider strengthening the membership of that committee, the composition of which I hope to announce shortly.  The <Col N="918" /> point at issue relates to a committee, an agency to do the work.  I am putting that agency in place.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly's amendments were ruled out of order but not at my behest. They were struck down because of their financial implications.  Had they been included, I would have been prepared to discuss them.  I am prepared to take on board the Senator's main point and to set up a committee.  The committee is already in place but we will strengthen its membership; we might decide to draft in a county manager or a representative of the General Council of County Councils.  However, I cannot include provisions for the allocation of compensation in the legislation.</P>
    <P>The Senator has indicated that he might vote against section 11.  There is very little point in striking down section 11, which contains considerable provisions relating to compensation for agricultural disturbance, in order to make the point about an amendment which was deemed to be out of order. We have taken the spirit of large parts of the Senator's legislation and enshrined it in this Bill.  The terminology is somewhat different but the spirit and thrust are the same.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I return to these contradictions as regards the delay in getting works completed.  Before the commissioners make vesting orders they must notify the Land Commission or the Revenue Commissioners if there are charges arising from land annuities.  I understand the Land Commission has been abolished and land annuities have, by and large, been bought out.  This provision will only further delay the expeditious carrying out of vesting in this section.  Is it necessary in view of the fact that land annuities have been bought out under the purchase scheme introduced a few years ago?  As far as I know, the Land Commission has been abolished and the work it did is now being done by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  I am not sure whether this section is necessary because it will only cause further delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the section is to expedite the conveyancing of land.  The section outlines the procedure to be followed by the commissioners where land is compulsorily purchased under the Principal Act.  The acquisition is done by means of a vesting order which is a simplified method of conferring an unencumbered title on the commissioners.  It obviates the necessity for taking conveyance of land and the associated problems of showing good title which often happens and it strengthens the powers in relation to the vesting of lands.</P>
      <P>Section 12 (1) permits the commissioners, when acquiring land under the Principal Act, to do so by means of a vesting order.  Section 12 (2) states that a landowner whose land has been acquired by vesting order is entitled to be paid compensation and the provisions of the Land Clauses Acts shall apply to the determination and payment of that compensation.</P>
      <P>Section 12 (3) states that where the commissioners become aware before the vesting order is made that the land or part of it is subject to any obligation to the Land Commission or Revenue Commissioners, those bodies will be advised of the commissioners' intention to make the order.  This protects the interests of those bodies by giving them an opportunity to take remedial action, if required, before the vesting day. There are equivalent provisions in other legislation.</P>
      <P>Section 12 (4) provides that where the commissioners make a vesting order they shall, within 14 days after making the order, post a notice containing a copy of the order on or near the land &mdash; we discussed this yesterday evening &mdash; and give a copy of the order to every owner and occupier of the land who can be identified by reasonable inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 12 (5) (a) states that the form of the vesting order will be prescribed <Col N="921" /> by the Minister for Finance and it will have the effect of transferring ownership of the land to which it relates to the commissioners in fee simple; in other words, free from any encumbrances or burdens, for example, rights of way, etc. Ownership is conferred on the commissioners on a specified date, but not earlier than 21 days after the making of the order.  Section 12 (5) (b) states that the commissioners must pay any annuities due to the Land Commission on the land acquired from the date on which it is vested in them.  Section 12 (5) (c) states that as soon as the land is vested in them, the commissioners are obliged to register their title in the Land Registry Office.</P>
    <P>The manner in which a copy of the vesting order may be given to a landowner is specified in section 12 (6).  It may be delivered, left at the last known address or sent by registered post, and these are standard procedures.  Section 12 (7) is self-explanatory.</P>
    <P>As regards Senator Daly's query, the Land Commission is still in existence in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, but with diminished responsibilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister made that last point because I thought the Land Commission was in a state of suspended animation or had become a disembodied spirit.</P>
      <P>I apologise for again asking the Minister about the legal definition which may apply to &ldquo;near the land&rdquo; because I raised this matter on Second Stage, but I did not hear the Minister's reply.</P>
      <P>The Cathaoirleach will recall my campaign on the &ldquo;in relation to&rdquo; disease. There has been a refreshing absence of it in recent legislation and this is the first section of the Bill where it occurs.  The section states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commissioners may, as respects land that is being compulsorily acquired by them under the Principal Act, complete the acquisition of such land by making an order under this section (in this section <Col N="922" /> referred to as &ldquo;a vesting order&rdquo;) in relation to the land.</P>
    <P>Why could it not say &ldquo;for the land&rdquo;? Perhaps the Tánaiste has something to do with the spread of this disease because he frequently uses the phrase.  I am sorry to introduce this irrelevancy to the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This section has been taken directly from Senator Daly's Private Members' Bill.  It is worth recalling that section 30 of the Principal Act obliges county councils to submit annual reports on the maintenance by them of drainage districts within their jurisdiction to the Commissioners of Public Works.  Section 13 of this Bill places on the councils a further responsibility in that such reports must now be published in at least one newspaper circulating in the area.  That was not a requirement up to now.  This is being done from the point of view of greater accountability and public awareness. This provision is phrased in the same way as in Senator Daly's Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what the Minister said but I would like him to extend this provision so that we could get a report each year from the commissioners on drainage activities.  A report is published, <Col N="923" /> but I am not sure there is a specific one on this area.  This amendment means that the Commissioners of Public Works will now be involved in smaller schemes.  I suggested in section 16 of my Bill that a committee should advise the Minister on certain aspects of drainage, that it should issue a report and perform functions which the Minister might ask it to do.  I felt it was necessary for the Minister to have some mechanism whereby the public could be made more aware of the commission's activities.  A lot of its work has not been highlighted and its annual reports have been concerned with detail rather than specific outlines of its performance.  Section 13 of this Bill means that drainage committee reports will be published at local level.  Perhaps it would be possible to publish national reports on an annual basis.</P>

      <P>This section increases the penalties under the Principal Act and states that a person can now be fined £200.  Has the fine been increased to £200 because I do not know how much the penalties were in the Principal Act?  Can a penalty be imposed for deterioration of a watercourse?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Any interference with a watercourse is subject to penalty.  As regards the Senator's query about the increase in penalties, the original fine was £5.  The purpose of this section is to increase what were outdated and derisory fines in the context of modern situations. These substantial increases were <Col N="924" /> not decided by me but by the drafting office.  A general review of penalties is taking place in consultation with the Department of Justice.  These penalties appear to be the norm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>There are severe penalties in other legislation if watercourses are interfered with.  The farming community is subject to severe penalties under legislation and industries could pay fines of £10,000 or more.  This section states that the penalty should not exceed £200.  Yet, during the two day debate in the House, a number of Senators stated that the quality of the water and watercourses in many rivers have been seriously interfered with.  The Senators had good reason to make these statements and I concur with them.  I made such a statement and I instanced two rivers, the Shannon and the Suck.</P>
      <P>I know why Bord na Móna does not have to worry about legislation dealing with arterial drainage, that is, the Principal Act or this Bill.  If there is a maximum fine of £2,000 it can continue dumping hundreds of thousands of tonnes of silt because it will not have any effect on its finances.</P>

The ESB has prepared a report on what the consequences of this would be for Poulaphouca reservoir. The mean flow on the river is 190 million gallons a day.  Thus, there is a proposal to take virtually half of the mean flow from the Liffey.</P>

      <P>The passage of this Bill gives me enormous satisfaction because a very serious commitment was given by this side of the House and the Minister that the Bill would clear this House by the end of May.  It has now been concluded on 17 May and will be in the other House next week.  This means we are ahead of schedule and the important work can begin.</P>
      <P>I wish to pay tribute to Senator Daly. By introducing his own Bill he undoubtedly concentrated minds and brought the matter to public attention.  He handled his own Bill and this Bill over the last two days with extraordinary skill, tact and courtesy.  It was a model parliamentary performance.  I pay tribute to him and all those on the other side.</P>
      <P>I want to pay tribute to the Minister of State, Deputy Higgins.  It was his first Bill and he handled it with tremendous urgency, a great grasp of detail and a willingness to mix it with Members of the other side, which is part and parcel of parliamentary practice and procedure. This Bill is a great credit to him and I hope the other House gives it the same attention and urgency of dispatch which this House gave it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I also pay tribute to Senator Dardis?  His informed contributions enlivened this debate.  I thank the Independent Senators who rapped us on the knuckles last week for the tardy arrival <Col N="927" /> of the Bill.  Their efforts in focusing minds was appreciated.  There were times three months ago when I felt we should have been wearing Wellingtons so great was the emphasis on flooding; we seemed to have been discussing almost nothing else at one stage.  This has been good parliamentary work and I compliment all those involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express my sincere thanks to the Leader for his kind remarks and to express my appreciation to my colleagues on this side for their co-operation during the discussion, especially Senator Finneran and Senator Fahey, who have been here all day.  I thank the Minister for the expeditious way in which he dealt with this and I wish him well in the work that has to be done; I also wish his officials well.  They were among my former partners in the Office of Public Works and I am glad they are still looking fit, healthy and well in spite of the floods.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for the way he dealt with this legislation.  He has been very open with us and has answered our questions in detail.  Not every Minister who comes to the House does so.  Like Senator Manning, I was impressed by his grasp of detail and I am sure his officials deserve some of the thanks for this.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Senator Daly.  It was because of his intervention in introducing his own Bill that this Bill is with us now.  Senator Quinn should probably be linked to this because he helped to bring the legislation to us.</P>
      <P>It is a compliment to the way the Bill was drafted that it did not require much amendment.  I am sorry I could not support the proposition that section 11 should be deleted.  Not only would I like to see people given compensation for the immediate effects of flooding but I would like to see them get compensation when the commissioners arrive on their land, which would have been the effect of deleting this section.</P>

      <P>To everybody involved in the debate over the past two days, I want to say a sincere word of thanks, particularly those who contributed on Second Stage and went through it in considerable detail.  I wish to express special gratitude to those who contributed today and sat through Committee Stage because this requires a certain amount of concentration, application to detail and analysis.</P>
      <P>I join with the Leader of the House and Senator Dardis in paying a special tribute to Senator Daly, who is getting almost as much credit from this as I am. It is credit that is well due because he did, as the Leader said, help to concentrate minds wonderfully.  Senator Daly also helped my cause when it came to emphasising at Government level the need for urgency in relation to the Government's attitude to this measure.</P>
      <P>I thank Senators who spoke in favour of the Bill and who saw the reason in what we were trying to do.  I accept the spirit of what Senators were trying to do, who were not in a position to support the Bill through all its Stages.  By and large, however, there was consensus on the finer details of the Bill itself.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works, Senator Daly's former mentors, are considering taking this up as a full-time occupation because they have seen so many Ministers through their hands over the last number of years.  They have been as courteous and efficient with me as I am sure they were with all my predecessors. I would like to thank the draftspeople who put flesh on the bones of the Bill. They did a tremendous job in drafting it, particularly the heads of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am confident that we have got it right; and, while one cannot always say that a Bill is 100 per cent right, this one is as near to perfection as you will get. After the very detailed in-depth analysis that was carried out in this House there <Col N="929" /> is not much meat left on the bones for the Lower House.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to reverse his decision to suspend the operation of the Control of Farmyard Pollution Scheme, and demands that sufficient funding and the necessary administrative personnel be made available so that applications under the scheme can continue to be accepted and processed and grants paid as they become due, particularly in view of the importance of farm pollution control to the operation of the REPS scheme.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister on his first visit to the House.  I hope he heeds what we have to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil feels it is incumbent to move this motion because of the outrageous unilateral decision taken by the Minister to suspend a scheme demanded by farmers so they can continue in farming and meet the highest possible standards and so that the Irish food industry can increase its market share and provide produce of the highest standard in the most environmentally friendly way possible.  Our motion asks that the Minister's decision to suspend the scheme be reversed.  We demand that sufficient funding be made <Col N="930" /> available to enable every farmer seeking grant aid under this scheme for necessary works to be paid promptly.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the haphazard way approvals have been given throughout the country that, depending on the level of personnel in the farm development service in each county, there is great discrepancy between one county and another.  The farm development service determined the numbers approved under the scheme until it was unilaterally suspended on 27 April by the Minister.  More personnel are needed through the reallocation of resources, but that is the Minister's job.</P>
    <P>We seek the proper administration of this grant scheme and ask that the total mismanagement this Minister has overseen over the past four months since he came to office should stop immediately. We insist on the farm pollution control scheme continuing and being properly administered because of its crucial importance to the take-up of over £450 million available from Brussels over the next nine years under the rural environmental protection scheme.</P>
    <P>I will deal with each objective outlined in the motion and give reasons why Seanad Éireann should support them.  The operation of the control of farmyard pollution scheme should not have been suspended.  This scheme was brought in under the operational programme as part of on-farm investments up to a total of £235 million, and was agreed under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>
    <P>Some £100 million was made available for the control of farmyard pollution scheme.  That was a five year scheme which was unilaterally suspended by this Minister within six months of it coming into operation.  This flies in the face of all logic.  We have heard much about the need to meet the demands of farmers and to prioritise spending in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  It is clear, given that 18,600 people applied for the scheme since September and that there have been only 6,000 approvals, that this Minister is cutting off a scheme being <Col N="931" /> demanded by farmers throughout the country.  So much for the Minister's claim that he wanted to run a Department which was consumer friendly for farmers.</P>
    <P>This scheme was demanded by farmers in unprecedented numbers.  Grant aid under the scheme, which allows farmers to carry out this necessary environmental protection work, does not add one penny to the profitability of farmers.  It is investment which must be carried out by all progressive farm enterprises to ensure we continue to have produce of the highest quality emanating from our farms as a raw material for the food industry, which is crucial to national development and responsible for 40 per cent of our exports.</P>
    <P>So short sighted is the Minister that the only way he can deal with the increased demand for this scheme over and above expectations is to suspend it arbitrarily.  There are a number of options open to him if he has difficulty providing cash for the scheme.  There is nothing to stop him coming forward with a national control of farmyard pollution scheme to augment the present scheme.</P>
    <P>There has been huge excess expenditure since the Government came into office on 15 December last.  Public expenditure has increased by 12 per cent in the first quarter of 1995; £260 million has been made available for equality payments; £10 million has been spent to return the community employment scheme to its previous strength of 40,000; and £12 million was paid to maintain jobs in a private company at Shannon Airport.  I have no objection to these expenditures but why is this Minister totally impotent in getting funds at the Cabinet table for a necessary scheme which farmers are demanding?</P>
    <P>We call for sufficient funding for necessary administrative personnel so applications under the scheme can continue to be accepted and processed and grants paid as they become due.  The Minister has been totally responsible for <Col N="932" /> the mismanagement of the scheme. Over 18,600 applications came in since last September.  The scheme was suspended on 27 April.  Therefore, over the six months in which the scheme has been in operation an average of 3,000 applications per month came into the Department.  That means approximately 12,000 applications were received since the Minister was appointed and he did nothing until 27 April to deal with the situation.</P>
    <P>Only 6,000 people have been approved for the scheme.  He now seeks to bring forward what he calls &ldquo;conditional approvals&rdquo; for 220 farmers who already received the first instalment of REPS, 100 farmers who have received section 12 notices for local authorities to do immediate and necessary pollution works, and 3,000 others whom he says will be approved for the scheme.  These will receive conditional approval, bringing the total approvals up to 9,000 out of the total of 18,000 applicants &mdash; 50 per cent of the total applicants.</P>
    <P>Of those approved, 6,000 have the approval as available already and 3,000 others will get conditional approval. Over one-third of the approvals will therefore be conditional, which means the people will be told to do the work but the Minister cannot tell them when they will be paid.  He hopes they will be paid by 1997 and in 1997 they will be paid thereafter.  Does the Minister not realise that on a practical level no farmer is in a position to do the work unless he knows he will get prompt payment of his grants as they fall due?</P>
    <P>As I said, these works do not add one penny to the profitability of a farm enterprise in Ireland.  Farmers are already suffering cash flow problems as a result of the disastrous price situation in the sheep industry and great uncertainty is being created in the cattle industry because of the Government's failure to establish proper access to continental markets for the live export trade through our ports.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Minister reverses his decision to suspend this important scheme.  The scheme is <Col N="933" /> important for the environment, and the control of farmyard pollution is demanded by environmentalists.  The farmers will not make a penny extra in profits.  They carry out this work for the sake of staying in business and so that their farms would be a credit to the country.  I appeal to the Minister to reverse his decision to suspend the control of farm pollution scheme.  The Minister will get the money if he argues for it at Cabinet.  There appears to be money for everything else, but the Government seems to be anti-farm.  Perhaps it is being controlled by a junior partner.  It is up to the Minister to ensure the farmers get what they deserve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion with a degree of confident anticipation that, having reflected on the reaction to his announcement last week, the Minister will be able to tell us that he has reconsidered the position.  I am confident we will hear positive news of this necessary programme.</P>
      <P>We have seen reconsideration &mdash; that is a kind word for it &mdash; by the Government twice this week and we will see it again this evening.  The punitive and criminal associations being attached to certain professions in the Finance Bill have been reconsidered.  There has been a reconsideration in relation to the community employment programme because the Government, which does not like to face even the mildest breeze of unpopularity, has seen the reaction to the changes in this programme and, as a consequence of a Seanad proposal, it has reconsidered.  I am reasonably confident, because the facts are unarguable, that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry will do the same.  My question is why were the wrong decisions made in the first place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to put in context the reason for this programme and its importance, and analyse the reasons given last week by the Minister for suspending it.  In August 1989 I announced what I had negotiated with the Commission as a matter of priority in our anti-pollution <Col N="934" /> drive.  We extended to the country what I had previously negotiated in the western package &mdash; farm pollution grants. Those grants were agreed by the Commission in advance of the operational programme of the Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>The Commission and the Council endorsed the application in advance of the passing of the operational programme because they accepted my argument that this was of such priority in Ireland that we needed to have this extracted from the other elements in the overall Structural Funds programme in order to put it in place immediately.  The response of the farming community throughout the country, the Minister's constituency included, was immediate and positive.</P>
    <P>The focus of the advisory services up to that point was to increase productivity without any awareness of the consequences of much of the enhanced productivity for the environment, particularly our waterways.  Hence, silage pits were constructed near to houses and water flows.  That was the main reason I was able to negotiate what I announced in August 1989 &mdash; the introduction of farm pollution programmes in advance of the sanction of the overall Structural Funds programme.</P>
    <P>The scheme has been successful.  It is vital not only for the agricultural industry but for tourism and the economy overall.  I am gratified the programme has been so successful.  I was concerned when I read the Minister's announcement. I know one has to adhere to budget disciplines, and the Government will have our support when it does so. However, it is a question of what its priorities are at any one time.</P>
    <P>In his statement of last week the Minister said that his analysis of the on-farm investment schemes showed an underfunding of at least £60 million.  He said, in effect, that since the launch of the scheme last September over 17,000 applications had been received.  He mentioned that the demand was driven by the fact that a control of farm pollution scheme had not been in operation since April 1992; the need for some participants <Col N="935" /> in the REPS to have pollution work done under the CFP; the fear that funds would run out; and pressures from local authorities and fisheries boards to address pollution problems.</P>
    <P>I welcome such pressures.  I would have been disappointed if there had not been such pressures from the local authorities and fisheries boards.  I would have been disappointed if they were not aware they had obligations to take action immediately to deal with what was becoming a critical problem.  The Government makes decisions on the basis of the Minister's proposals and I would have assumed it would have anticipated a major demand for this priority programme.  The Minister and I are from rural constituencies and we know there is a critical need for the programme.</P>
    <P>I would have been happier if twice as many farmers had applied.  I would have been happier if the Minister had said there would have to be a reallocation between this programme and, say, the afforestation programme.  Many small farmers have problems in trying to compete with the funds available to private foresters and Coillte.  That element should have been reallocated to this programme.</P>
    <P>Coming from an agricultural constituency, the Minister will have got the message.  What Minister responsible for agriculture would ever say to the farmers to whom a programme has been advertised, &ldquo;Sorry, too many of you have applied.  It is too successful and we cannot cope with the applications to the programme&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>I do not know what it is like along the Slaney, but Lough Derg on the Shannon, where I live, is being polluted and changed in character.  Farm pollution is but one element.  In fairness to the farmers, they have responded positively as the custodians of the environment in controlling the amounts of fertilisers under the advice of Teagasc.  This is not the way to show our appreciation of their response.  In anticipation of a change of mind from the Minister this <Col N="936" /> evening &mdash; he must know that there will be a positive response from the farmers &mdash; I am happy to second the proposal by our spokesman on Agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>Due to unprecedented demand for aid under the control of farmyard pollution scheme and in the light of funding set aside for the scheme under Structural Funds, the Minister was forced to suspend the scheme on 27 April.  From that date no CFP applications are being accepted until further notice.  Similarly, formal approval of existing applications also ceased on that date.  Under the on-farm investment section of the operational programme for agriculture, rural development and forestry, an allocation of £195 million of Structural Funds was provided for the period 1994-99.  Approximately half of this amount was earmarked for the control of farmyard pollution scheme.  An analysis of the on-farm investment scheme shows an underfunding of at least £60 million.  This was, of course, legislated for by the previous Government <Col N="937" /> and the shortfall is clearly the cause of the current problem.  It was anticipated under the national plan that £245 million would be allocated.  We have heard a lot of crying from the Fianna Fáil side, but let us be clear that they as the last Government, are totally responsible for the present situation. While we had arguments on the Structural Funds in respect of the £8 billion, the £6 billion and the £5.4 billion, the truth was that the scheme that suffered was that particular scheme.  As a result we have a shortfall of £60 million, which is a serious situation and we all know that now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>There were 18 months lost at that time and that is a serious loss which has resulted in the present influx of applications at this time.  The need for <Col N="938" /> some participation in the rural environment protection scheme, and to have pollution work done under the CFP; the fear that funds would run out and pressure from local authorities and fisheries boards to address pollution problems are all issues that I wish to discuss.  I call on the authorities, the county councils and the fisheries boards to restrain from applying too much pressure unfairly. There was a situation in Wexford where an officer of Wexford County Council called on a farmer three months ago. The farmer got such a fright from what he was told about the conditions of his farmyard that he proceeded to contact his auctioneer and sell his herd of 25 cows.  I inspected that farmyard last week, with another member of the county council.  That was a wrong statement to make and led to a serious situation, which I have taken up with county manager and the county engineer.  It is unacceptable for that type of pressure to be put on anybody.  I want to tell the Minister about this situation, which is unacceptable.  When there are heavy rains an ordinary dwelling house causes more pollution than a farmyard.  People have an obsession that the only place that causes pollution is a farmyard.  That is incorrect.  I am not saying that the official intended that the farmer sell all his cows and leave himself in that position, but it happened.  He sold his 25 cows and leased his milk for quota for approximately a year.  He is in a serious situation because he has to buy his cows back next year and he will not be able to carry out the necessary works to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By 27 April about 6,000 of the CFP applications received had been approved for the commencement of work.  To make the payments resulting from these approvals and to make some into inroads into the backlog described earlier requires the bringing forward into 1996 of some of the moneys previously earmarked for later years.  This will need European Commission approval and Department of Finance approval.  I encourage the Minister to ensure that the approval is forthcoming. <Col N="939" /> I understand that he is pursuing this matter and am confident that he will be successful.  As well as endeavouring to have Structural Funds payments brought forward from future years, I understand that the Minister is making a strong case for additional funding &mdash; this is the important point &mdash; under the review of the community support framework which will be carried out by the Commission in 1996.  In addition, when the funding is secured, it will be possible to reopen the scheme for new applicants. I ask the Minister to consider this.</P>

One cannot close the scheme entirely in this situation.  As Senator O'Kennedy has said, it is a top priority.  It is also a top priority with the Commission.  I understand that the Minister is anxious to establish procedures which would enable as many as possible of the 12,600 unapproved applications currently on hand to proceed with work.  In order to deal with unapproved applications it is his intention to grant conditional approval.  I encourage him to do that.  He has stated that the conditional approval will allow people to start the work and to make the necessary preparations.  I must point out that there is only a certain number of contractors in each area and it essential that we have them working fulltime.  The contractors have told me that during the 18 months while the scheme was suspended <Col N="940" /> by Fianna Fáil, they had no work to do.  That was a serious loss.</P>

      <P>There are no inaccuracies. It is absolutely true.  I call on the Seanad to support the Minister in trying to bring forward Structural Funds from future years to allow the processing of the remainder of 19,000 applications; to ask the Minister to secure additional funding under the review to allow all to participate in the control of farmyard pollution programme; and to ask the Minister to contact the necessary authorities, county councils and fisheries boards to be fair where they send an official into a farmyard.</P>

      <P>I support my colleagues, Senators Rory Kiely and O'Kennedy, in the motion tabled this evening.  It is a serious motion which concerns our most important industry, agriculture.  I am <Col N="941" /> annoyed that the Minister, being a practical and modern farmer himself, has been let down by his colleagues.  It shows that not only does a rainbow suggest rain but it also brings poor Government, particularly when it applies to our most important industry and all the jobs created by that industry.  In any business one cannot plan without firm commitments. I pose the case of a young farmer who might have taken over a farm in the last six months or so.  Having made his application under this scheme and gone into his bank manager for a business loan, he is told that the Government has changed its mind.  Conditional approval is of no use to any bank manager, as we all know.  I do not remember any Government ever pulling the rug from under a scheme that involves such an important industry as agriculture, as has been done by the present Government. I am disappointed that the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Yates, as a farmer, has allowed himself to be let down badly.  It has shattered the belief held, not only by farmers young and old but also by financial institutions, that whenever there is a farm development plan, the money will be forthcoming from the Government, whatever Department it may come from.  With this Government the rug may be pulled at a minute's notice, and that is very sad.  Some 75 per cent of the funding comes from the EU and the Government is so weak-kneed it believes it will not get sufficient funding to continue the programme.</P>

      <P>There are 18,600 applicants. There are press releases all over the constituencies saying that the Minister may not pay the grants to those who have applied or that applications have not been processed.  A business, <Col N="942" /> whether it be a farm or anything else, cannot be run in those kind of uncertain circumstances.  It is very sad and damaging to an industry that needs to be supported and to be competitive.</P>
      <P>Agriculture and tourism go hand in hand.  Farmers are a responsible body of people, who over the years have spent vast amounts of their own money updating their farmyards, silage pits, slurry tanks and slurry container units at enormous expense.  They are also pressurised by local authorities to ensure, in the interest of public health, that streams are not affected by run-off from farms. This Minister allowed himself to be used by a weak-kneed rainbow Government, who pulled the mat from under him and told people to hang on for another five years.</P>
      <P>People who took over farms and drew up plans with an ACOT adviser have to go back to their bank managers and say that while they thought they would get a grant, this is no longer the case because the Minister, Deputy Yates, says the money is not there.  If one lives horse, one gets grass.  That is very sad and damaging and it is an indication of who is running the show.  The tail is wagging the dog.  This will affect the job creation which flows from progressive modern farming.  Much lip service has been paid in recent times to job creation.  Fianna Fáil had to horsewhip the Government into keeping the FÁS scheme and they ran around the corridors of the Cabinet in the last fortnight and dug out £10,000.</P>

This Government has a mishmash approach to running the affairs of State.  It took over from a Government which left the country's finances in a better state than they had been for years.  They were far healthier than what Fianna Fáil took over in January 1987.

    <Speaker pid="JimTownsend" hpid="Mr. Townsend Mr. Townsend">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Townsend</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  There are problems in the current farmyard pollution scheme and in the REPS but they are <Col N="944" /> not of his making.  For many years we have spoken about rural Ireland and population decline.  We demanded that we keep telephone boxes open when few people were using them.  We spoke of keeping post offices open when the people remaining in rural Ireland do their business and get their pensions in the nearest town.  We tried to keep schools open when most local children went to schools in the big towns where they thought they would get a better education.  We even tried to keep Garda stations open while forgetting that technology had passed us by.</P>
      <P>There are now a number of schemes in place which will halt the decline in rural Ireland and reverse this trend if we make a determined effort and put our shoulders to the wheel.  The rural environment protection scheme has £240 million for rural Ireland.  The control of farmyard pollution scheme has another £100 million.  We also have Leader II, the country enterprise boards, the community employment scheme and a national tourist promotion scheme.  If all these schemes are taken seriously, we can do something for rural Ireland and perhaps open some of the schools and bring the gardaí back to rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>I would be less than honest if I did not admit that there are problems with the rural environment protection scheme.  Up to 20 April only 1,839 applicants were paid a total of £6 million, which is the first of five yearly payments out of £240 million.  At that rate it will take us a long time to draw down the £240 million.  I happen to have some figures from Wexford, and it is not because the Minister is from Wexford.  In that county alone it is estimated that 1,000 farmers could benefit from the REPS, but up 20 April only 148 had received their first payment.  That was the second highest in the country, so there is definitely much room for improvement.  It is worth noting that out of a total of approximately 150,000 farmers in this country only 50,000 are viable.  We are fast approaching a situation where 50 per cent of all farm income will come in the shape of a cheque in the post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="945" /> We have heard much about control of farmyard pollution and it is one of the areas which is delaying applications for REPS.  Some 10,000 farmers have applied and these applications have been delayed.  A large number of farmers are trying to remedy farmyard pollution because they are anxious to join the REPS.  It is a condition of REPS that pollution control work be completed within 12 months acceptance for the REPS.  The Minister has a simple problem. There are not sufficient staff in the farm development section to handle the applications or do the office and field work.  It is difficult hard to know what the Minister will do.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Hamilton recommended in the beef tribunal report that people be taken on to supervise intervention.  A large number were employed.  As a result of what took place at the tribunal the meat factories did what informed journalists had been urging them to do for a number of years &mdash; they went out and sold beef.  They are doing that now and in the past couple of years no meat has been put into intervention.  Now I understand that the staff in that section have no work to do.  It just goes to show that if one reacts to a certain situation by employing people one can find oneself in trouble later on.</P>
    <P>It is clear that, at the present rate of progress, we will be unable to draw down the £240 million available for REPS.  It would dramatically change this country if it were drawn down.  There are other reasons, apart from the farm pollution programme, people are not applying for REPS, or at least are not encouraged to apply.  It has been brought to my notice that due to the assessment procedures of the Department of Social Welfare many smallholders are reluctant to undertake a REPS plan.  They are afraid that money they receive under REPS will be deducted from their social welfare.  We should exclude REPS payments from social welfare assessments in the same way as family income supplement has been exempt from income tax and for other State entitlements.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="946" /> I am concerned that REPS is not suitable for people engaged in fruit production. It discriminates against them. These people have not added to the pollution problem down the years.  I can offer an example.  I am aware of fruit producers who are using mushroom compost to increase the humus content of the soil.  Under the REPS programme it cannot be used because it is high in phosphorus &mdash; 20 tons of mushroom compost is equal to one ton of 10:10:20. It appears to be a good way of using mushroom compost because one would complement the other.  The Minister should look at such problems.</P>
    <P>I had hoped to have detailed proposals today for the Minister on the implications of REPS for the soft fruit and horticultural industry.  Unfortunately, I could not get them so I will forward them to the Minister later.  It is unfair to criticise the Minister.  Any steps he takes to improve the REPS to ensure that we receive the full amount of money over the next four or five years will have the full support of the Labour Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House for this important debate.  I support the motion.  I read the answers given in the Dáil yesterday to parliamentary questions on this matter.  I also read the Minister's reply to Deputy Tom Foxe when he raised the matter on the Adjournment on 9 May.  It was depressing reading.  I cannot square our rhetoric about producing our food in a clean environment and selling it on international markets with the stamp of environmental approval, so to speak, with what has happened in this instance.</P>
      <P>The control of farmyard pollution scheme was suspended on 27 April and &ldquo;no further applications are being accepted until further notice&rdquo;.  Under the on-farm investment section of the operational programme for agricultural and rural development and the development of forestry it is anticipated that we will draw down £195 million.  Half of that was to go to the scheme for control of farmyard pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="947" /> In the context of a charter of farmers' rights the Minister went to Warrenstown to tell the media about the marvellous things that will happen within the Department.  I am prepared to give him time in that regard because I do not expect these matters to happen overnight.  However, I cannot understand how, in these days of modern communications, there was an overrun of 12,000 applications before the shutter came down and we said &ldquo;no more&rdquo;. About 6,600 were processed but 12,000 were in the system before the shutter came down.  How can that happen in this day and age?  A total of 12,000 people are faced with disappointment and uncertainty.  That is incomprehensible. That does not sit squarely with the charter of farmers' rights.</P>
    <P>The Minister told the Dáil yesterday that he had received a report on the immediate administrative aspects and that he would speak about it in the Seanad this evening.  I await his comments with interest.  He also said that he had received the report the previous night, which was the night before last. How does that fit with a communications system where 12,000 people are excluded from a scheme?  How does it take until the night before last for a report of that gravity to be prepared?</P>
    <P>The list of counties and of applications, payments and so forth under the rural environment protection scheme is comprehensive.  It shows the amounts paid by county, the area of land farmed, the number of applications received and the number of applications approved.  However, the statistics in relation to the control of farmyard pollution are far less comprehensive.  There is a list of the applications to date and approvals to date and little more.  I concede that the Minister produced a total figure of £3.5 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to understand how the analysis of one scheme <Col N="948" /> can be so detailed while that of another is less detailed.  The fundamental point is the connection between REPS and the control of farmyard pollution scheme and the number of people who will be excluded from availing of the £450 million under REPS as a result of being unable to comply with the requirements of that scheme and who need the support of the control of farmyard pollution scheme.</P>
      <P>We are told that the mid-term review will solve all our problems.  Regardless of what is in the Structural Funds, the mid-term review will produce this magic money.  The Minister must get on his bike and talk to the people in Brussels and try to extract extra funds from them.  If the bicycle to Brussels does not work he had better go to the Minister for Finance to see what can be done.  It is unfair that people should be asked to enter a scheme when there is not enough money available to back up the scheme.  There is also the issue of conditional approval.  Who will pay the interest on the bill for the conditional approval?  Who will pay while people make the investment, draw down the money from the bank if they are given it and wait for this ephemeral approval to fall out of the sky?  These are fundamental questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that we have a consultative group.  This is the latest fashion.  If we are in difficulty we set up a consultative group &mdash; bring in representatives from the IFA and the farming organisations, put them around the table and attempt to mollify them.  A consultative group is not the way to deal with this matter. How do we square what is happening with the rhetoric of promoting our food with CBF by saying that this is the food of Ireland produced in an environmentally friendly way on the land of Ireland and that these schemes ensure that the food is produced properly?  I am prepared to accept that there have been huge improvements, that food is produced in an environmentally friendly way and that we are not intensive by European standards but I think we can put an even greater stamp of approval <Col N="949" /> on our products when we send them to the market.</P>
    <P>The money should be sought at EU level.  In this respect, there is the question of the shrinking billions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Senator Farrelly intervened because I was thinking earlier of what he would have said a few months ago on this side of the House if a Fianna Fáil or a Labour Minister were taking this debate.  I am constrained in comparison with the rhetoric we would have got from that quarter.</P>
      <P>Since up to 75 per cent of this money is from the EU and 25 per cent is from the Exchequer, there is room to improve matters by looking for the money in Brussels.  The suggestion of bringing forward the five year tranche requires EU approval, but it should be considered.  However, with regard to the shrinking billions, I have a suspicion that the delays and obfuscation attendant on these schemes are an attempt to find them.  The National Development Plan is based on the original presumption of what we would get, but now that there is a shortfall questions are being asked about how we are going to fill the gap.  I do not wish to lay this at the Minister's door; I will grant him that much. This is a very serious matter which has profound implications for agriculture and the REPS, and I expect the Minister to do everything in his power to ensure that it is corrected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Details will be provided later regarding aspects of my remarks, but at present I am speaking <i>ad lib.</i> Ministers are accused of not consulting from time to time, but when they do consult, they are also criticised.  I am sorry Deputy Dardis did not take the opportunity to attend the launch of the charter, as did the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on Agriculture, Food and Forestry. If he had, he would have heard me make specific reference to the on-farm investment schemes, to the shortage of funds and to the fact that the charter would not deal with this aspect of the issue.</P>
      <P>The serious misunderstanding to which I referred relates to the fact that the entire negotiations for the total amount of money involved in the scheme &mdash; as is the case for the FIP, the animal welfare scheme, the dairy hygiene scheme and the CFP scheme &mdash; was undertaken by my predecessor and the previous Government.  Even they would acknowledge at this stage that there was a very serious shortfall of £60 million on these schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how people could be under the serious misapprehension that the row was about the £5.8 billion or that there is more money to be got from Brussels.  The only option is to take money from headage, from FEOGA for the food industry, or, as Senator O'Kennedy said, from forestry.  These are not options I am actively considering, but there is only the prospect for this room for manoeuvre; there is no prospect for more money from Brussels.  We have signed off on the Structural Funds, as have the other Objective One regions. The only prospect of more money is if <Col N="951" /> Spain, Portugal or Greece do not draw down their money in the mid-term review of October 1996, which is highly unlikely.  Therefore, I am not promising that there will be a pot of gold out of this, indeed I am quite sanguine about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <P>The amount of money for this scheme left by my predecessor is £3.7 million, and I was negotiating today with the Department of Finance to pull £30 million into the scheme to keep it operational.  Whoever was involved in drawing it up and who thought that £3.7 million would meet the needs of the scheme bears far more culpability than myself on this issue.</P>
      <P>I answered various questions in the Dáil yesterday and I indicated that I would be making announcements this evening arising out of the first analysis of the situation.  The scheme started last September and 18,400 people applied. Up to 27 April 1995, 6,000 applications had been approved, 12,400 had not.  I am interested in those who wonder how we could have let so many people make applications.  The clear implication is that they wanted the shutter pulled down earlier.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Dardis clearly implied this.  Did he want me to pull down the shutter in November 1994 so that those 12,000 people, who I intend will get a grant, would not get a grant? Is this what is seriously intended?  Or is it intended, as Senator O'Kennedy remarked, that I should not have suspended the scheme at all, so that we keep receiving 3,000 applications per month with no money to pay them? That would be farcical.</P>

In order to bring some kind of order to this chaos, where only £3.75 million was provided for next year, I have had to suspend the scheme to see how we can proceed on an orderly basis.  However, the 6,000 applicants who have been approved are in no difficulty.</P>

People in County Laois applied a long time ago but because of administrative and staffing shortages they did not get approval. I am pleased to announce that we are going to start issuing approvals again on a conditional basis for 3,000 applications, bringing every county up to 31 December 1994.  The Department will begin to process these as of tomorrow.</P>

Subject to meeting the conditions of the scheme, that is, standard approval on completion of the works, such applicants will be given conditional approval in writing to proceed with the specified works.

I am satisfied to give an assurance of payment in 1997 following consultation with the Minister for Finance. The conditional approvals will issue on a month by month basis in order of receipt.  This will enable my Department to bring into line applications from counties where progress was particularly affected by staffing difficulties in my Department.  I should add that good progress with regard to the resolution of these difficulties has been made in recent months.  I am having further discussions with the EU Commission.</P>

      <P>I was faced with the prospect of not being able to guarantee payment of the applications if I continued to receive them and the existing approvals would have exhausted the highest amount of money that we could have put in for 1995 and 1996.  Therefore, we called a halt to it at that point. We then thought about how we could bring some order to the other 12,500 applications and I am now proceeding to do that.  In September I will make an announcement about the remaining thousands of applications.  We will deal with the matter on an orderly basis and of getting the EU Commission's approval for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From listening to the Opposition one would think that this was the first time an on-farm investment scheme had been suspended.  I remind the House that the <Col N="955" /> last Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Walsh, suspended the farm improvement scheme last December before he left office.  I do not hear too many crocodile tears being shed about that.  My predecessor also suspended &mdash; Senator O'Kennedy would be aware of this &mdash; the CFP scheme in April 1992 due to the fact that funding had ran out and the farm modernisation scheme was also suspended in the 1970s.  It is a lot more common than unusual that these schemes would cease when their moneys are exhausted and that is the only way to proceed.  Does one cease before the moneys are exhausted or proceed in this way?  I am glad to have the opportunity to clear up these misunderstandings. Senator D'Arcy raised the important point of the local authorities.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator D'Arcy raised the point of the local authorities and the fisheries board and I totally agree with him in this regard.  Where section 12s have been issued prior to 27 April, I would be looking to give them conditional approvals irrespective of their date and my Department would be sympathetic to those cases.  In view of the overall situation, I am anxious that local authorities will be sensitive to this matter and I will ask my officials to communicate to them in this regard.  Some 2,181 REPS applications have been paid at cost of £7.6 million and we are hopeful of getting agreement to having REPS payments excluded from the exemption for means assessment for social welfare purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am as concerned as anybody else that we would have the maximum level on farm investment schemes, which is why I was able to secure an increase of 40 per cent in the resources this year when compared to last year for all the on-farm investment schemes.  I am anxious to facilitate the cash flow difficulties of farmers in that regard.  On the conditional approval for payment in 1997, I will be having discussions with the banks so that the type of alarmist comments heard earlier about it not being worth the paper it was written on will be dealt with.  Banks will be told <Col N="957" /> exactly what its value will be so that farmers will be able to obtain the necessary bridging finance.  We are giving the farmer the choice.  A farmer will be given the conditional approval so he can go ahead with his works where necessary, but it is on the explicit and transparent understanding of when he will be paid.  If he says that he cannot afford the bridging costs, he does not have to go ahead with the works and that puts the ball back in his court.</P>
    <P>We have undertaken a preliminary assessment of the REPS scheme and 60 per cent of its cases do not require CFP related work.  However, it is true to say that 30,000 farmers over recent years have availed of pollution related work and they would be eligible.  The investment over recent years has been over £400 million.  It seems that demand in this area is infinite, but funding is finite. It is as simple as that.  I cannot make a silk purse out of the sow's ear that I inherited.  I am trying to ensure that the maximum number of cases can be facilitated, the maximum amount of money can be brought forward and that those who apply have a proper and reasonable prospect of payment.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the timing of the suspension of the scheme was in line with the assessment of the cost of those approvals.  At that time the assessment was £6,800 per application and was based on a fall-out rate of approximately 10 to 15 per cent of those that do not go through the works.  That was the time we put the shutters down on the scheme.  What were my alternatives? Should I have carried on merrily and kept on receiving applications and not suspend the scheme, with no hope of paying these people, but mislead them instead; or should I have suspended it on my arrival to the Department, at which time some of the people who would be entitled to a grant would not get one?  I did all that I could have possibly done, given that there was not enough money, which I very much regret.  I want to be realistic about the question of money.  I am not promising that there will be more money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to smile to myself on the business of going to the Minister for Finance for money.  There is no precedent whatsoever for a 100 per cent grant aid scheme paid for by the national Exchequer and there will never be one.  Senator O'Kennedy was boasting that he negotiated the arrangement where Brussels promised to pay 75 per cent of the funding for every 25 per cent paid by the Department for this scheme. If Brussels will not give any more money, there is no prospect of a 100 per cent scheme and we should be realistic about that.  Those who are criticising the Government most severely about growth in public expenditure are the ones who are now weeping these crocodile tears for a direct Exchequer funded scheme.  I have to deal with the real world.</P>

Those who are approved will get the full co-operation of my Department and I hope their works will be carried out at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  Tonight's debate takes place against the background of a very serious situation in the agricultural sector of the economy in this country.  As the Minister and the House are aware, the discontinuation to a great extent of live exports poses a great problem, as does the disastrous situation in regard to the price of lamb.  Last week farmers protested outside this House at the inability of the Government to secure a proper live export arrangement with the shipping companies.  We are here tonight to discuss the control of pollution grants and their effect on the rural environment protection scheme.</P>
      <P>I have a number of worries about this issue.  We have seen the Minister's intent in this area to some extent tonight.  I was interested to hear that he is in negotiations with the Minister for Finance for £30 million.  That is the most important statement the Minister for Agriculture made this evening.  I agree with Senator Dardis.  The Minister was slightly unfair to him when he spoke about cutting off the grants altogether. That is not what Senator Dardis meant; I hope I will not be misrepresented. Although the Minister is ultimately responsible for everything that happens in his Department, somebody should have told him months ago that a crisis was developing.  Why was he not told until late April?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>That was known long ago. It was known when there was a hole in Albert's bag.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>That kind of comment will not please the farming community. The farming community sees £60 million going to Irish Steel in Cork and wonders how Irish Steel can get money if the farmers cannot.  That type of argument does not wash at all.  The farming community feels, rightly or wrongly &mdash; I think rightly &mdash; that it is under threat <Col N="960" /> from this Government.  That may not be so.  This Minister is very supportive of the farming sector, but is he in a position to persuade his Government colleagues to his view?  I do not know.  He may have trouble in that area.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said that he will allow approvals of grant applications received up to 31 December 1994.  In my county to date one fifth of the applications under this scheme have been approved.  Scores of people have entered into contracts and made arrangements, people have done soil tests and made commitments.  This scheme is very important to farmers who wish to avail of REPS; it is very important for the country and the farming community.  Money invested in the farming community is ploughed back into the economy.  Up to £500 million may be available under REPS over a period of eight or nine years if we are able to avail of it.  The Minister said that it was his intention to try to have REPS extended from 1999 to 2004.  In the period from 1990 to 1999 about £250 million is available and that money would develop our economy further.</P>
      <P>The farming community is up in arms. Farmers were asked to forward applications to the Department of Agriculture, but now they have discovered that the scheme has been suspended. The Minister has said that he will clear applications up to 31 December.  What about the people who applied in January and February?  He has said that he will make a further announcement in September.  This will not wash with the farming community.  I expect the Minister will witness another protest outside the gates of this House next week or the week after.  Farmers feel, and I agree with them, that this Government is not responding to their problem.  Our spokesman on Agriculture has emphasised that those receiving hygiene grants do not receive one penny for themselves. They have to make a contribution towards the work done.  They are upgrading their farms for all the reasons we put in front of them today, to reduce pollution and to develop tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="961" /> The Minister has said he is working towards approval for those who need the grants to avail of REPS, but while the Minister's statement tonight is a step in the right direction, it in no way addresses the serious situation we have to deal with.  I believe there will be protests. The Minister will have to do better than this, he will have to get the money. We must send a message from this House that the sooner he gets his agreement with the Minister for Finance on this matter the better.  The farming community do not take kindly to being left without money, when other groups seem to be supported.  Other groups seem to be getting finances at a time when we are told that money cannot be found.</P>
    <P>People look at the Government's overrun and the amount of money being spent on the public sector.  I have attended many public meetings and the general feeling within the farming community is that farmers seem to be coming out second best in 1995.  I spoke to farmers from every county in Ireland when they protested outside the gates of Leinster House last week and that was the view from genuine full-time farmers who took the day off at their own cost to come up here on account of the seriousness of the situation.  I believe that they will be back again to protest.</P>
    <P>The Minister must get funding from the Minister for Finance and he must of course involve the EU to whatever extent he can.  I understand that the Government has to choose which scheme to take on, but to put all these schemes on the long finger as has been suggested here tonight is not the way to treat the Irish farmer at this time.  Farming is our main industry and it is the Minister's responsibility to support that industry, in particular where the measures being implemented are for the good of the country at large and not for the farmer alone.  Control of farmyard pollution is of benefit to the whole country.</P>
    <P>Since tourism, farming and the public benefit, the Minister has a grave <Col N="962" /> responsibility in this area.  We must not turn our backs and lose out on major EU funds under the rural environmental protection scheme over the next few years, because this Government is not able to allocate adequate funds to a scheme which has been publicly advertised and to which farmers have been asked to apply.</P>

It is incredible to watch Opposition people fall on their own swords.  They speak with no conviction. How could they have any conviction in criticising the Minister for various shortfalls in his ministerial capacity?  The proposer of the motion accused the Minister of being short-sighted, impotent and of mismanaging the scheme.  If Opposition Members spoke to the farming community they would find it would not agree.</P>

He is seen as a Minister who has a tremendous interest in farming and who has brought verve and vision to his ministry.  He has substantial achievements under his belt to date.  By working with senior people in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, the Minister has changed the <i>modus operandi</i> there, although that has probably been unnoticed by Opposition Senators.

    </Speaker>
    <P>This mess was started when the former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, was in a flamboyant mood in Europe and talked about £8.8 billion.  He said it was in the bag, but he did not realise the bag had an aperture in the bottom.  A substantial amount of the £8.8 million fizzled away and, as a result, the operation programme with which the Minister is dealing was slashed.  The people are aware of that and whatever they may criticise this Minister for, they cannot criticise him for that.  The problem with this scheme began at that point.  If <Col N="964" /> anybody is to deal with this mess, this Minister will because he has proved his ability in those respects and he will deliver if possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister made some further announcements this evening which will go a long way to make farmers relax a little and to help them do a little forward planning.  Farmers are happier with this Minister than they have been for a long time.  He is putting great effort into this ministry and everybody recognises there is action in Agriculture House which did not occur before.</P>
    <P>It is hollow to scream and shout about a scheme which was so successful that it had to be capped.  It is silly of Senators who supported a Government in 1992 which suspended the scheme.  Before Christmas the farm improvement scheme was suspended by the former Minister, Deputy Joe Walsh and that is why there are so many applicants now.</P>
    <P>The Minister and Members agree that farmers are concerned and anxious to be involved in this scheme.  They are interested in controlling farmyard pollution and improving efficiency.  This Minister has motivated farmers to think in a new way.  However, this has interrupted his vision of a modernised agricultural sector.  That is a shame because he provided the motivation that was lacking for a long time.  The morale of the fanning community and the industry is better than it was and the road ahead has been brightened somewhat by the efforts of the Minister.  As far as I am concerned, the system has been rejuvenated.</P>
    <P>I expect that in the next week or so the Minister will make an announcement as regards the shipping of livestock. I am informed that negotiations are proving successful and a solution will be announced soon.  Those who tabled this motion should have been more circumspect and should not have done so.  It is a hell of a spectacle to watch them fall on their own swords. The public knows the cause of the problem lies elsewhere and that this debacle which was handed over to this Minister is in the best hands.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  If it was not so serious, this episode could be described as a comedy of errors.  It is disingenuous of the Minister to come here and say this has landed on his lap because of his predecessor. He has been Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry for five months and, as Senator Cotter pointed out, he is on top of his job.  He would have known some time ago that this scheme was over-subscribed given the amount of money available.  A long time ago the Minister would have gone back to the negotiating table in Brussels or to his Cabinet colleagues, but he did not.</P>

The Minister did not suspend the scheme until 27 April, but he did not inform the farming community until the time of suspension.  It is disingenuous of my colleagues on the opposite side of the House to say this was landed on the Minister by the previous Administration; that will not wash with the farming community.</P>

We tabled this motion tonight to highlight the dismay among the farming community at the suspension of this scheme and the fact that it could place the rural environment protection scheme in jeopardy.  Modern intensive agriculture contributes significantly to the growing problem of pollution, but there is a heightened awareness of it among the community, particularly the farming community.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate him on the excellent work he is doing.  His presence has restored confidence in the agricultural sector, and this is accepted by everyone involved in farming and the food industry.  When he completes his term in office, he will have made as big a mark as Mr. Mark Clinton, who is still revered by farmers and the agricultural community as someone who contributed most to the development of agriculture in this country.  We look forward to his work over a longer period of time than some people forecast here tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's approval for the processing of the 220 control of farmyard pollution applications from farmers who already received the first year's payment under the rural environment protection scheme.  They were required, as a condition of REPS, to carry out pollution control within 12 months.  This is important for the 220 people involved.  I also welcome his announcement that he is arranging for the processing of all the remaining applications, approximately 3,000, received up to 31 December 1994, subject to meeting the conditions of the scheme, that such applicants will be given conditional approval in writing to proceed with specific works.  The Minister said that is the fairest and most transparent way to deal with the unapproved <Col N="971" /> applications.  He has given a firm commitment that payment will be made in 1997 and I welcome this assurance. He does not doubt this and we should not either.</P>
    <P>It is important that the suspension of the control of farm pollution grants will have minimal impact on participation in the rural environment protection scheme.  The Minister has given the go ahead for approval of the 120 participants. I wish the Minister every success with the European Commission in the coming months in his efforts to relax the condition relating to the 12 month deadline for carrying out pollution control works.</P>
    <P>We should pay tribute to the consultative group, consisting of officials of the Minister's Department, farm organisations and other interested parties, which has advised the Minister on this and has reported to him in the past few days.  It has obviously played a key role in the welcome announcement here tonight.  It is important to note that we can expect further announcements in September.</P>
    <P>The Minister will continue to work at every opportunity to overcome the difficulties being experienced by farmers who have applied for these grants.  All public representatives are being contacted by farmers.  When one explains fully the problem to them, they understand it; but are not happy about it.  It is important that this situation is continually looked at and I look forward to the announcements in September.  I am sure the Minister will continue to examine the situation.</P>

He has made specific commitments for now and an announcement will be made in September.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and compliment him on his efforts in the Department of Agriculture in the very short time since he became Minister. This is a pure example of the shrinking billions we heard so much about over the last 12, 18 or 24 months. When allocations were made to the different schemes, following the exact amount being made known, the scheme was underfunded by 50 per cent.  If any farmer has been told anything different, the people who told him did not inform him of the real facts, despite their knowledge of the problem.</P>
      <P>Were it not for the incredibly poor staffing levels in many Department of Agriculture offices throughout the country, many more applications would have been approved long before the date on which this scheme had to be suspended. Certain former Ministers were in recent weeks trying to make capital out of the serious problem in some offices not too far away from where I live.  When they were in office, they did nothing about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The farmers and the Minister, in coming together to try the solve the problem, are only doing justice to those who made applications.  Some Senators have asked why it has taken so long to find out the exact position.  Staffing levels were one reason.  I know exactly what the position was in the office to which I am nearest.  What would some of my colleagues have said if the scheme had been suspended on 1 February?  They would have said there was no proposal to try to secure from Europe the extra funds required to help the many farmers who find themselves in difficulty and need help to solve the <Col N="973" /> problems on their farms.  It is shallow for many on the Opposition to be critical, especially when some of them are advising us to wait until everybody gets a hold of us at the next election.</P>
      <P>In the recent past all of these things were debated and we know the results. In the near future we will have another opportunity to see the results from the people as they speak.  People expect to be told the facts and do not accept being told it will be all right on the night.  It is not all right.  The last Government did not leave it all right.  The Minister will rectify the situation and all those who made applications will be paid.</P>

      <P>I am giving the Senator four minutes of my time.  I welcome the Minister.  He is receiving a great deal of criticism from my colleagues and this is right because he is in a position of power.  Over the last few weeks when I have spoken on issues, a least ten different excuses were given in replies from Ministers as to why things could not be done.  When a person is in a position of power, his job is to solve problems and find the money to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must admit there is a huge outcry in the farming community at the moment about this scheme. <Col N="974" /> Senator Kelleher stated that when the Minister received 18,500 applications, he should have seen there was a serious problem and sought extra moneys to be made available for the scheme.  On the one hand we are trying to promote tourism and must protect our environment and maintain a green image.  On the other hand important schemes like this have been suspended at the drop of a hat.  What will happen to streams and to our green image?  The Minister must admit there is a will among farmers to rectify problems on their land.  Local authorities are prosecuting farmers for polluting streams and waterways.  Small farmers in particular cannot make large investments to counteract this problem without some help from the State.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a great deal of work to do.  He must obtain the necessary finance. Yesterday £10 million was found at the drop of a hat because pressure was brought to bear.  If the Minister has not a good relationship with the Minister for Finance, I suggest he should take the Minister for Finance out to lunch or dinner some evening &mdash;</P>

In 1987 a Minister, before he left office, approved housing reconstruction schemes costing £220 million without having a bob in the kitty.  He then left it to Fianna Fáil, when they came back between 1987 and 1989, to fork out £70 or £80 million a year to repair the damage.  I must admit that it was a good scheme, but it was a pity that he did not arrange the finance for it before he left office.</P>

The farmers are screaming and you are going to have deputations to Dublin the likes of which no Government has ever seen before. Not alone are you going to get it from the farmers but you are going to get it from the general public as well, because these schemes will have to be implemented and brought back.  The Minister mentioned a figure of £30 million that is being negotiated with the Minister for Finance at the moment.  Is that £30 million 25 per cent funded from your own resources and 75 per cent from Europe?  I would like to know whether the Minister is going to provide 25 per cent of the £30 million.</P>

      <P>We would do well to recall December 1992 when the then Taoiseach came back from the Edinburgh Summit announcing that he was on the pig's back with £8 billion for the coming five years.  But that £8 billion <Col N="976" /> has consistently been reduced and is now down to £5.2 billion now, a shortfall of £2.8 billion.  This the first casualty of the shortfall in funding from Europe.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for his honesty and forthrightness in coming clean with the farmers and the public on the disastrous situation in which he finds himself with a £60 million shortfall for grant assistance under the farmyard pollution control scheme.  He must be complimented for taking a stance in letting farmers know, honestly and transparently, what the situation is.  He has been very straightforward with the Department.  £60 million is a major deficit and was the assessment of his predecessor, who must be condemned for misleading the farmers.  Senator Kiely said that if Fianna Fáil were in Government they would have approved the sum.  That is precisely what they would have done, approving it and continuing to lead farmers up the garden path.  By forcing farmers across the country to borrow money on high interest while awaiting grant cheques, the Fianna Fáil Minister would have put many of them out of business with a major debt hanging over their heads.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret very much that I only have a couple of minutes because it is a debate that I would like to have had more time to contribute to. <Col N="977" /> I join with other Members in congratulating the Minister for the positive steps he has taken since entering the Department of Agriculture.  He took over a mess in many areas, one of which we are discussing now.  Another thorny question that the Minister inherited was the question of support for the live cattle export trade.</P>
      <P>However, as Senator Taylor-Quinn said, the difficulties we are talking about have arisen from the miscalculation of the amount of money that was coming as a result of the Edinburgh Summit and the failure of the former Minister for Agriculture to secure sufficient moneys to finance projects which would seek grant applications from the Department for pollution control.  That is the situation that we are faced with and, unfortunately, the Minister is faced with solving it.  It is a problem that will have to be solved and it is one that arose not just from the previous Minister but also from officials in the Department.  This is the first time in 14 years as a Member of the Oireachtas that I have had to say that, and I want to put it on the record. A situation has arisen in Roscommon where out of 1,000 applications, only 120 have been processed, simply because sufficient staff were not in the office to do it.  Some of those staff have been missing since 1992 and were not replaced.  The officials in the Minister's Department must accept full responsibility for the fact that the farmers of Roscommon are now lagging way behind farmers in other parts of the country where offices were properly staffed.  Let us put that clearly on the record.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the steps that the Minister has taken regarding people in other categories, but every application up to Christmas should be dealt with and should be grant aided.</P>

      <P>I appreciate your situation, Acting Chairman, I have been in it many times myself.  In Roscommon there is an office which normally has a staff of three but since 1 February there has only been one and consequently no schemes have been processed.  There should be a special category for those affected, and wherever the Minister can get the money he should try to get it. Unfortunately, the Minister has inherited the situation and I appreciate the efforts he is making; but there has been a failure, both by the previous Minister and by the officials in the Department, to ensure that the local offices were properly staffed.  They cannot deny that responsibility.</P>

      <P>I cannot understand what Senator O'Kennedy was congratulating me about but I suppose it was for tabling the motion to highlight this injustice to the farming community.  In the Dáil yesterday at Question Time I heard the Minister say that he would make an important announcement in the Seanad today.  He did make an announcement, but I am really disappointed with it.  The control of farmyard pollution is very important not alone to farmers but also for the environment.  I have a copy of the application form here, which makes it clear that you have to carry out a farmyard pollution control scheme according to special specifications. I know that when Department officials visit you they look for great capacity, which is only right.  The Minister says he will approve £30 million for applications made to December last and that they will be paid by 1997, but what other section of the community would be asked to wait three or four years to <Col N="979" /> be paid?  Who would accept that, only the poor farmers?</P>

I was driving fairly fast and went through a foot of slurry pouring out a farmyard gate.  Are we going to allow that to continue?  It was a disgrace but it will continue if nothing is done to ensure farmers get the grants they are due, because the provision of storage facilities can be expensive, as the Minister is aware.  As I said, farmers will not make any extra money through this scheme; they will do it for the sake of proper farming and to compete and maintain the standards expected of Ireland by the EU.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann once again records its concern at the ongoing difficulties being experienced by the elderly residents at Clonmannon Retirement Village, Ashford, County Wicklow, and requests that all Statutory Authorities, State Agencies and Departments involved to take all possible action to bring this matter to finality.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator Ross for his generosity. I assure him I will take a bus load of voters to his convention on Sunday week, although I do not think he will need it.</P>
      <P>The facts of this matter have already been put on record in the House in five separate debates.  Those debates had two specific purposes &mdash; to highlight the issues and to press the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and his Department to use company law to relieve the suffering of the residents in Clonmannon.  It may seem strange that company law should be used in this case, but when the Clonmannon problem arose it became clear there was only one way to solve it &mdash; to seek a full investigation through company law and, ultimately, to seek the liquidation of the companies that were operating there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To an extent, the first of these objectives has been achieved: we have highlighted the plight of the surviving residents of Clonmannon.  We must recall that no fewer than 11 people have died <Col N="984" /> since this dispute started.  Unfortunately, the second of our objectives has only been partially achieved.  The response which we have received throughout this long saga from the Department of Enterprise and Employment and from successive Ministers can be described as disappointing to say the least.  Where actions were expected we got, first, a series of prevarications.  It took almost a year to get the Department of Enterprise and Employment to advise the then Minister that it was appropriate to put an official, designated under section 19, in place and to examine the affairs of these companies.</P>
    <P>That official appointed reported to the Minister, who is in the House tonight, on 10 March.  The report was published last month and the actions which have flown from that report are, in my view, disappointing.  We have had a referral of all the papers in this case to the Director of Public Prosecutions. That gives a fair indication that something is seriously wrong.  We have had the Minister's agreement that all the papers will also be referred to the Revenue Commissioners.  I made substantial allegations of fraud, tax avoidance, tax evasion and excise duty abuses in Clonmannon. Those papers have also gone to the Revenue Commissioners.  We have also received the assurance &mdash; almost inevitably &mdash; a committee has been appointed to consider such further action as is needed for retirement homes.  It is widely accepted that there is a lacuna in the law and that we do need to extend the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990.  The reality is that we seem to be still in something of a bind: we have not had effective action nor have we had an effective response.  The Minister has, in effect, passed the buck to two other statutory agencies and is not fully exploiting all the possibilities which are available to him under company law and of which the Minister of State present is fully aware because he worked hard with me on the company law Bill committee a number of years ago.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="985" /> It seems that there are three possible reasons the Minister might be reluctant to take action in the courts on this case. The officials may be too timid or too fearful of a rebuff in the High Court, as happened to their original efforts in the County Glen case.  If this is the excuse, it is not good enough.  Company law gives the Minister certain powers.  The Minister should not simply sit on his hands; he should not wait for the Revenue Commissioners to act; he should not wait for the Director of Public Prosecutions; he should act to the full extent of his statutory capacity and should operate in parallel with those two statutory agencies.  The report was made to this Minister and he should act on it in addition to making the referrals &mdash; which he has done and which are welcome &mdash; arising from it.</P>
    <P>The Minister has suggested that he is reluctant to go for liquidation because of the additional hardship that this could conceivably heap on the surviving residents at Clonmannon.  He should set to one side any fears he has on this account.  Through their solicitors, Joynt and Crawford, the residents of Clonmannon have already written to one of the Minister's Democratic Left colleagues to explain, as I have repeatedly done to the Department, that it is their wish that the Minister should act and to make it clear they believe no greater harm can come to them through a liquidation than they have already received at the hands of the management of these companies.  The residents feel, as I do, that it is impossible that nature could throw up more than one such set of unprincipled thugs like the people who run Clonmannon in any one generation. What has happened in Clonmannon is unspeakable, by any measure of human activity.</P>
    <P>The third possible reason for the Minister's inaction would seem to be that he is hoping the Revenue Commissioners and the Director of Public Prosecutions will do the work for him. This is what I call the Pontius Pilate scenario.  What we have seen thus far from the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, <Col N="986" /> is a classic piece of buck-passing, which will have the effect of removing from public scrutiny the quality and the validity of the official response to the report of the public official appointed under section 19 of the Companies Act. The fact that the Minister has chosen to publish his own sanitised version of the report &mdash; I understand fully and accept his rationale for so doing &mdash; means that the public will never have the full facts on the systematic fraud which has been a feature of the operations of all the companies associated with the Clonmannon retirement village.</P>
    <P>The fraud goes back over a long number of years: it is not a recent event.  It will mean that the evidence of fraudulent trading, abuse of company law, tax avoidance, failure to meet social welfare returns, asset stripping, common theft &mdash; including common theft from a corpse &mdash; and excise fraud is shielded from the public eye.  That is not what any Member of this House, or this Minister, would wish to be the case.  The Minister has the power and, in my view, the obligation under company law to take action and not to pass responsibility to other statutory bodies.  As far back as last December, I wrote to the then Minister, Deputy Quinn, and I put it to him that, if the Minister for Enterprise and Employment is provided with <i>prima facie</i> evidence that any or all of the circumstances touched on in section 8 of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990, exist in a case, the Minister has a statutory obligation, and not a discretion, to apply to the courts and present the evidence.  This Minister has been provided with copious evidence of systematic and continuous fraud.  Even though the investigating official comes to the conclusion that not all the allegations have been sustained, it is my view that the Minister has the obligation to present the facts in this case to the courts, so that a court can exercise its jurisdiction under the Act before further loss is caused to the unfortunate residents of Clonmannon.</P>
    <P>The residents have invested so much of their life savings in a retirement village <Col N="987" /> which, at the outset, we all saw as some kind of idyll and which has become, in reality, a nightmare.  I suggest that the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, show some of the steely resolve he showed while in Opposition and that he use the statutory powers he has under company law to provide the relief to the unfortunate residents of Clonmannon that every civilised person in this country would wish for.</P>
    <P>There is no question but that <i>prima facie</i> evidence of fraud has been produced. The fact that the Minister has sent the documents to the Director of Public Prosecutions speak volumes.  It is worth recording some of the evidence provided to the examiner, and I do so only by way of summary.  The examiner was provided with written evidence regarding transactions involving cars &mdash; a Mercedes 190, a Mercedes 560, a Mercedes diesel, a Rolls Royce, a minibus, a Ford Escort and a Bentley Mulsanne. We have provided the Minister with the names of the current owners of those vehicles, with the names and telephone numbers of the garages that handled the transactions, with evidence that transactions took place, through the accounts of one of those companies, which were illegal and fraudulent and which avoided paying excise duty.  We also provided the Minister, the Department and the investigating official with evidence that assets were illegally transferred between companies for the purpose of preparing a fraud.</P>
    <P>We pointed out, in evidence that was supported, that one company was closed to be replaced by another in the classic Lazarus fashion.  We also pointed out that there were no professional audits carried out.  False books of account were prepared.  I take some pleasure from the fact that one of the professional bodies responsible took serious action last week against a person who was purported to act for an auditor, under the law of this land, for these companies. We also pointed out and provided physical evidence of the encashment of cheques outside this jurisdiction as a <Col N="988" /> means of fraudulently converting cash away from the company and as a means of avoiding accounting for cash.  We provided evidence of false returns to the Revenue Commissioners: evidence that two separate sets of books were kept for the nursing home at Clonmannon.</P>
    <P>We provided evidence that company meetings were not properly convened according to company law; there has been a court judgment on this matter. We produced evidence of false documentation being produced in a court action &mdash; a most serious matter &mdash; and, again, the professional body involved is taking a serious view of the actions of the accountant in this case.  I believe the accountant will be struck off; I hope the accountant will be struck off.  We provided evidence of a series of actions where creditors and small traders were systematically milked by the Clonmann companies and by the Corneill families. We provided evidence of criminal trespass. We provided evidence that goods in cottages where people had died were stolen.  I personally provided testimony that when an unfortunate lady died, the manager of this estate sat in the room with her body, ate the tea that had been delivered to her and, when he left, £300 was missing from the room.</P>
    <P>I provided evidence of blatant breaches of planning law and Wicklow County Council accepted that this is a fact.  I provided evidence of false declarations to the Valuation Office.  The management of the company delivered these valuations and suggested that bungalows being transferred between individual companies were valued at only £10,000 each.  As late as last week an advertisement appeared in one of our local newspapers advertising these bungalows for £35,000.</P>
    <P>The question must surely arise: what special immunity does the thug who runs Clonmannon have?  How is it that an individual can run a coach and four&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have not mentioned Mr. Corneill all that often but I will refrain from doing so for the balance of my contribution.  However, everybody knows the thug involved.  The question that must surely arise is: what special immunity does this individual and these companies have?  If a constituent of mine went into a shop and stole a packet of cigarettes, he would find himself before the court and could end up in jail.  Why do we tolerate what has happened in Clonmannon?  Why is this extraordinary scandal continuing 18 months after we first highlighted it?</P>
      <P>Is the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, aware that one of the companies, Home Affairs Limited, has been struck off the register of companies in the last ten days?  This means that the company is now in the charge of the Minister's Department.  That company was declared insolvent by Amorys, the company's solicitors, in a letter to residents of Clonmannon in 1992.  Subsequently, that insolvent company.  Home Affairs Limited, &mdash; and I provided evidence of this &mdash; was involved in illegally transferring major assets to the company.  Hilltop Catering Limited.  The directors of both companies are the same.  The addresses however in the case of Hilltop Catering Limited are outside the jurisdiction, in the Channel Islands which, incidentally, is the place to which some of the cheques disappeared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Home Affairs Limited has substantial tax liabilities which have not been discharged. Due to ministerial inaction, the assets of that company have been illegally transferred.  The Minister and the Administration have a responsibility to the taxpayer and the residents of Clonmannon to retrieve these assets. The harsh reality is that the Clonmannon affair is a growing scandal.  It is a cancer in our society which we should <Col N="990" /> cut out.  The management deserves to be behind bars and anybody who, through inaction, sustains that management should accompany it.  Will the Minister use all the existing powers under statute and the Companies Act?  The Minister is fully aware of those powers because he debated them at length when the legislation went through committee a few years ago.  I ask him to use all available powers in addition to going through the DPP and the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Those statutory bodies will take a long time to reach any conclusion and we will never know the basis of it. However, the Minister is entitled to take this matter to court which would facilitate an early liquidation.  I understand fully that the Minister would not, and indeed I would not, wish the route of liquidation to be used as a means of settling disputes.  However, there has never been and there is unlikely ever to be a dispute as unique as this.  This is one off and we should use every power and every statutory agency to bring the scandal to an end.</P>
    <P>I intended to ask at the outset if I could give two minutes to Senator Dan Kiely as he has some connection with the estate and wants to say a few words.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be able to accommodate Senator Kiely.  I congratulate Senator Roche on several things but mainly for leading the charge on this issue and for championing it conspicuously over a period of 18 months.  Tribute should be paid to him for not only exposing it but for continuously pressing Ministers on all sides, when it was not so easy for him to do so, on an issue of great importance in Wicklow.  At times when he was in Government, he had to take a stand on it.  He was not popular with his own people for doing this but he did so fearlessly.  He is now doing so in a possibly easier position but with a great deal of energy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="991" /> The disturbing features which he so eloquently spelt out to this House are in themselves extremely important. However his main point is that while what has been happening is unforgivable, it is impossible to explain to the people in Clonmannon the delay in taking action.  I impress on the Minister of State that this is an emergency.  We do not understand why redress has taken so long.  It is a terrible reflection on the apparatus of this State that we cannot solve what is after all a human problem.</P>
    <P>The problems which Senator Roche addressed so well concerning difficulties with books and cheques and the dubious practices are subsidiary to the health and welfare of the people affected by what is going on there.  They are important in themselves.  This matter has gone to the DPP and should not provoke a great deal of specific comment in this House but that is far less important than the problems of the old people who have been affected.</P>
    <P>The people of Clonmannon and any elder citizen in this State are entitled to a certain amount of comfort and security in their later years.  The people of Clonmannon have been deprived of this and have been living in fear for a significant length of time.  Their savings have been eaten up in a situation which they believe is out of control.  In Leinster House they see ministerial impotence accompanied by what they perceive as ministerial unwillingness to tackle the problem.  That is not fair but that perception exists and we have done absolutely nothing to remedy it.  The people have seen the matter debated in this House several times but have seen little action.  They have seen numerous committees set up and inspectors appointed to report.  They now see the matter going to the DPP.  I ask the Minister, in light of the stress and the extraordinary number of fatalities which are probably not unrelated to this, to regard it as an emergency and act on it now.  That is a simple plea.  It is a human problem and not really a problem for the courts at all.</P>

Many of the residents are under huge stress and strain and something will have to be done to rectify the situation. I call on the Minister to use all the resources and avenues available to him to bring this to a conclusion on behalf of the residents.  I congratulate Senator Roche on highlighting this matter not only for the current Minister but continuously and without fear for the past 18 months.  Something must be done immediately to draw this to a conclusion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>In responding to the various issues raised by the Senators on this unfortunate case, I want to say that my sympathies lie with the residents, or more particularly the residue of the residents, who have been abysmally treated. At this stage in their lives and having, as they thought, prudently organised their affairs to cater for their declining years, they have for a variety of reasons been caught in a terrible bind.</P>
      <P>The affair has been well recorded both in contributions in this House &mdash; indeed as recently as 9 March last &mdash; and by various reports in the media. These contributions give a flavour of what has happened in Clonmannon.  In addition, my colleagues, the Minister for Health and the Minister responsible for Housing and Urban Renewal have been apprised of the concerns of the residents as to their unfortunate situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to put the contribution of my Department in context.  I do not have any responsibility, in any shape, make or fashion, for the regulation of retirement homes, nursing homes or sheltered accommodation.  Neither do I have any responsibility for issues of contract <Col N="993" /> law or lack of provision of services, if such is being contended, either by the health board or the relevant local authority. However, lack of responsibility does not connote lack of sympathy or awareness of what is happening.</P>
    <P>The unvarnished facts of the matter are that neither I nor my Department, notwithstanding our best efforts and great intent, can remedy the difficulties in Clonmannon.  In so far as I have responsibility, I am only too happy to exercise it in the public interest.  The Clonmannon dispute has raised issues in three areas: the level of compliance by the companies involved in the ownership and management of Clonmannon with their duties and obligations under the Companies Acts; what is still the central issue, questions relating to performance and enforcement of the service contracts between the village residents and owners of, and service providers at, the village; and the position of the residents of the village today, many of them very old and infirm and all of them people who entered into their contracts believing them to be arrangements that would give them a place of refuge and access to a range of services to the elderly.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that my colleague and the then Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, commissioned a report into the company law aspects of this matter last October.  I recently received that report and following extensive thought and advice, including legal advice as to how to proceed, decided to disclose the report to the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Revenue Commissioners for such actions as they feel appropriate.</P>
    <P>The report conducted under section 19 of the Companies Act dealt with, and could only deal with, the first issue I referred to earlier.  The other issues are for other Ministers and statutory authorities as well as for individual action by the residents themselves.  I must say that I am inhibited in what I can say in relation to what I learned from the <Col N="994" /> section 19 report, or indeed in disclosing other actions, if any, flowing from my reading of the report.  I am inhibited from disclosing what is in the report for one very good reason.  The Oireachtas in its wisdom decided that a report such as the one I received may only be published to competent authorities or with the prior approval of the companies concerned.  I sought the permission of the companies concerned to publish the report.  The companies have declined to permit the publication of the report. Senators will be aware of the import of the legal advice I received by means of the papers that were lodged in the Oireachtas Library on Monday, 24 April last.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that, regrettably, it was not possible within the terms of reference specified in section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990, to solve the type of problems presented in the substantive dispute between the residents and management of Clonmannon village. Moreover, I am also of the view that there is no legislation within the remit of my Department which could rectify the position to the satisfaction of either party to the dispute.  However, I feel it is open to me to indicate my deep unhappiness with the current and, indeed, past state of affairs in Clonmannon. The House should be aware that convictions were obtained by the Registrar of Companies in relation to breaches of the Companies Acts, both against the companies concerned and, importantly, against a number of its directors.</P>
    <P>I am advised that the Eastern Health Board has been providing for some years a public health nursing service to those residents requiring it, in the same way in which it would provide a service to any other elderly person residing at home in the area.  The residents similarly receive general practitioner care and the board has not received any recent communications from general practitioners requesting any special items for residents in the retirement village. The board's environmental health staff have from time to time carried out <Col N="995" /> inspections and submitted reports-recommendations to Wicklow County Council.  I gather that the Minister for Health has asked that Clonmannon be checked on the current position regarding risk to public health.</P>
    <P>Registration of retirement villages should, in the view of my colleague, the Minister responsible for Housing and Urban Renewal, Deputy McManus, help to prevent another Clonmannon in the future.  She holds the view &mdash; Senator Roche and Senator Ross probably concur and I would have sympathy with it &mdash; that operators of retirement villages should be regulated.  The more fundamental issue relates to the Nursing Homes Act.  The apparent anomalies in relation to complexes that formerly had a nursing home require a review, and as such any views on this matter might be better addressed to the Minister for Health.  I draw Members' attention to the activities of the working group which is currently reviewing the implementation of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 which is expected to report to the Minister for Health shortly.</P>
    <P>Liquidation has been presented as the solution to the Clonmannon problem. Liquidation is the formal closure of ownership of a particular enterprise, in this case the Clonmannon companies.  In itself liquidation does not provide new ownership or remedies for past or current difficulties.  In my position, cause and effect must be looked at, and I am sure this House will recognise that.  The effect that I wish to avoid as a Minister is uncertainty as regard the future of the elderly residents of the retirement village. They have suffered too much uncertainty to date.  Half solutions or precipitate solutions are no solutions, especially as regards the future for the villagers.</P>
    <P>Moreover, if we go for liquidation, it must be clearly understood that neither I nor my Department will have care responsibilities for these people in a post-liquidation situation.  I would be within my rights, as has been argued, to <Col N="996" /> petition the court to seek the official liquidation of some or all of the companies on &ldquo;just and equitable&rdquo; grounds, the public interest in effect.  However, I must ask myself would the public interest, justice and equity in the broadest sense be secured by this course of action in this case?  From this point of view there are a variety of matters that should be considered in examining this option.</P>
    <P>Creditors have their rights to petition the courts where they feel it is appropriate to do so.  There is no doubt that the affairs of the two companies concerned have not been well administered, to the possible detriment of the residents of the bungalows, and are to a substantial extent a public scandal in that the filing of statutory documents and the retention of required documentation has not been adhered to.</P>
    <P>However, the other aspect of liquidation is to what extent it is the public interest.  The most recent case in which my Department was involved, County Glen pie, does not present the same features as arise in Clonmannon.  The courts would not lightly be convinced that compulsory liquidation was in the best interests of all affected parties.</P>
    <P>In the event that the companies involved in Clonmannon are liquidated, what would happen to the residents? This is not a matter for company law, but since there is a considerable number of elderly residents involved, the outcome is, for obvious reasons, crucial. What we have to ask ourselves is whether on balance official liquidation is really a viable option and ought to be proposed on the public interest grounds of justice and equity.</P>
    <P>Finally, I repeat my view that company directors have their care and duty responsibilities under company law.  I continue to ask myself whether the saga as it has unfolded in Wicklow is in line with the proper running of a limited liability business.  I suggest it is not and take it that this House and the proposers of this motion concur.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  It is a national disgrace in 1995 that Ireland does not possess a swimming pool of an Olympic size and standard.  Michelle Smith from Dublin has emerged as an international swimmer, but to do so she had to move to Holland, where she had access to two 50 metre swimming pools within easy distance of the town in which she resides. That a 50 metre pool is essential for Irish athletes to compete internationally can be verified from her remarks made in an article in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> of 26 February 1995 when she said:</P>
      <P>I've always performed better in a 50m pool.  I don't worry about translating the performances.  Some people, noticeably, swim better in the smaller pool and then just flop in the 50m.  It's like putting Christy O'Connor Jnr on a Pitch and Putt course and then asking him to play a round of golf or having Sonia O'Sullivan run on the roads for six months and then ask her to race around a track.  When you get half way down the pool, you begin to wonder where the wall is.</P>
      <P>It is vitally important that international athletes have access to a 50 metre pool. As Gary O'Toole before her has proved, there is talent among our Irish swimmers, but without proper facilities this talent will go largely unrecognised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to urging the Minister to undertake funding of this pool, I wish to <Col N="998" /> make a special plea to have it located in Limerick.  The University of Limerick is home to the only physical education course in Ireland for teacher training, with 150 undergraduates at present. They will become the teachers of physical education and trainers of our young people in the future.  In addition, there are 65 students studying sports science, a course designed to enable these students to become coaches and trainers of teams in a variety of sports.  As the location of the national coach and training centre is already at the University of Limerick, the administrative structures are already in place.  Michelle Smith has already shown that competitive swimming requires not only a 50 metre pool but access to general fitness training, and these facilities are provided in the University of Limerick in the form of gyms and training facilities.</P>
    <P>Another reason for locating the pool in Limerick is that the diving pool currently located at the university is already used as the venue of the Irish diving team when it needs to practise for international events.  The existing pool in the university, which is fortunately longer than average, but not quite 50 metres, can still be used as a standby exercise pool and perhaps a junior training pool for the younger swimmers.</P>
    <P>With an internationally sized pool, international competitions could be staged in Ireland.  Given that Limerick, which has easy access to international destinations in North America, South America and Europe, with plans for further afield, there is no reason why international competitors cannot travel easily to Limerick.  In addition it is not that far from national destinations, especially, for example, if the primary routes are used to Dublin, Cork, Galway, Waterford and Rosslare.</P>
    <P>Not only could Limerick be used, therefore, as a fitness and exercise venue for our emerging swimmers, but it could also be seen as a potential tourism attraction to the mid west area and would add greatly to a regional balance within the country.  In this respect, it is <Col N="999" /> suggested that the pool would be better located in Dublin, but too many events are already staged in Dublin and not enough in the regions.  There is no good reason why this pool should not be located in Limerick.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to reply to this debate on the question of the provision of a national 50 metre swimming pool.  Senator Kelly has made an eloquent case regarding the needs of our swimmers and a specific case regarding the needs of Limerick.</P>
      <P>In June 1994 the Department of Education commissioned a feasibility study to examine all of the options for the provision of a national 50 metre swimming pool complex.  The main requirement of the study was to determine the facility which would best cater for the training needs of Ireland's elite swimmers and which would also cater for national and international competitions in addition to serving as a community swimming pool.  In the course of the study the consultants had detailed discussions with all of the interested parties, including the Irish Amateur Swimming Association, local authorities and third level institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The feasibility study was completed in December 1994.  The consultants recommend that the national 50 metre swimming pool should be built in the Tallaght town centre on a site which has been made available by South Dublin County Council.  The consultants identified this site as the best location; and it has particular advantages, including availability in size, public awareness, accessibility and a large catchment population.  It is also recommended that the complex should include a highly flexible 50 metre eight lane pool with floating floors and bulkheads to divide the pool into two 25 metre pools as required so as to maximise its use and revenue potential, a 25 metre warm up pool so that Ireland will be in a position to host a wide range of international events and a wide range of additional <Col N="1000" /> revenue generating health and leisure facilities, including a leisure pool.</P>
    <P>The Dublin International Sports Council (DISC) in consultation with the International Swimming Hall of Fame based in Florida has also formulated proposals for a 50 metre swimming pool and a diving pool to full international standards with seating accommodation for 3,000.  This proposal also includes an international swimming hall of fame museum and other ancillary accommodation. The DISC report states that such a facility would be located in Dublin and four possible sites have been identified.  This project is estimated to cost £24 million and it is envisaged that it would be funded by a combination of public and private sector sources.</P>
    <P>The University of Limerick, in consultation with the National Coaching and Training Centre, has developed a sports village development plan which includes the provision of a 50 metre swimming pool to international standards on its campus.  These proposals were submitted to the Department of Education in late 1992 and the consultants considered these proposals in the course of the feasibility study.</P>
    <P>No decision has been made by the Department of Education with regard to the provision of a 50 metre swimming pool or with regard to its location.  As the Senator will appreciate, the development of such a major project requires very careful and detailed examination before any decision can be made on the matter in view of the overall capital and operating costs involved.  In addition, because of its implications for Exchequer funding, it is not possible to say when a decision about the project can be made.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank Senator Kelly for raising the matter.  I will bring the points she has made to the attention of the Minister for Education.  She made a very strong case with regard, first, to the needs of swimmers and the fact that we are now producing numbers of swimmers who are doing very well in international competition and whose needs are pressing.  Second, she pointed out to the revenue and tourism potential and <Col N="1001" /> community facilities which international pools of this size would provide.</P>

      <P>The fight against crime in Galway city is being seriously hampered by the criminal justice system which all too often favours the hardened criminal.  The Garda force in Galway does an excellent job in preventing crime and apprehending criminals.  However, it is hampered in its efforts to reduce violent crimes and larceny by a relatively small number of ruthless criminals.</P>

    <P>There are approximately 20 hardened criminals operating in Galway city who are regularly brought before the courts by the Garda.  Their ability to use an outdated criminal justice system stacked in their favour, allows them to be responsible for the majority of criminal activity in the city.  Such criminals are charged before Galway District Court with larceny, theft and criminal damage. Cases are adjourned to allow the accused get free legal aid, and may not come back to the District Court for a further month, a month in which the criminal will continue his crime spree.  If convicted in the District Court, the criminal invariably appeals to the Circuit Court.  This may involve a waiting period of up to six months for a Circuit Court hearing during which time the criminal is again set free in the knowledge that crimes committed during this appeal period will more than likely receive the same punishment as the <Col N="1002" /> original crimes of which he or she was found guilty.  The Garda will oppose bail but this request is usually refused and the criminal will receive the sentence for crimes committed while on bail that he received for the original crimes.</P>
    <P>When he is eventually sent to jail, his sentence is reduced, mainly because of pressure on prison space.  A criminal sentenced to six months in prison can end up in an open prison such as Loughan House within a matter of days and be back on the streets of Galway within a matter of weeks, thanks to early release.  We have had several examples of that happening to some well known Galway criminals.  There have been recent examples of criminals taunting gardaí on their return to Galway following early release.</P>
    <P>Following my research during the last number of months, I am satisfied that much of the crime in Galway is committed because of this highly unsatisfactory system of justice which is being abused by hardened criminals and which places the Garda in an impossible situation. There is an urgent need to change the system so that criminals are locked up quickly on conviction and are kept in prison until the end of their sentences. The laws on bail should be changed and indications of a constitutional change in this respect are welcome.</P>
    <P>Legislation in respect of the right to silence must also be changed as a matter of urgency.  A criminal must at least be forced to account for his movements. His right to stare a spot on the wall and remain silent makes Garda investigation virtually impossible.</P>
    <P>Where there are previous convictions and where the Garda recommend that a full sentence should be served, any form of early release should be ruled out. That will invariably create a demand for more prison spaces.  The possibility of using Army barracks as a temporary measure for less difficult criminals should now be explored, with a view to creating extra places in secure prisons.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1003" /> Many appeals to Galway Circuit Court by people with criminal records have no merit.  Criminals are abusing a court system, which has broken down.  I ask the Minister to appoint a permanent Circuit Court judge in Galway to cut appeal delays of up to 12 months.  For example, there are currently 1,800 civil cases awaiting appeal to Galway Circuit Court.  This is in addition to family law and criminal cases which are also significant. The list system involves a minimum delay of six months for criminal appeals from the hardest criminals who are constantly committing crime in Galway. These appeals have no merit and convicted persons are being apprehended by the Garda while they are out on bail or while awaiting hearing of the appeal.</P>
    <P>A further deterrent against frivolous appeals would be to remand the person on a minimum bail of £1,000.  The Minister must take decisive steps such as I have suggested to deal with the chaotic situation in Galway where justice delayed is justice denied.</P>
    <P>In regard to the proposals on Army barracks, the Minister should seek Government approval to enable the Minister for Defence to enter into negotiations with the Army authorities and PDFORA to put in place a plan for the provision of a number of prison places in a selected number of Army barracks. Extra financial resources should be made available to the Army to adapt and update barracks to provide the appropriate level of security and also to remunerate Army personnel for their role as prison warders.</P>
    <P>Barracks can be upgraded and adapted successfully.  For example, Dún Uí Mhaolíosa at Renmore in Galway has a number of under-utilised buildings which are ideal for secure prison accommodation and which could be adapted for that purpose.  The services required, such as catering, medical services etc. could be expanded cost effectively to cater for a further 30 people.  Additional security and protection structures could be put in place to secure an already <Col N="1004" /> secure facility.  Such a development would take the most notorious criminals off the streets of Galway and would substantially reduce the present unacceptable levels of crime.</P>
    <P>We have 20 violent criminals in Galway who have committed larcenies, housebreakings, stealing of cars etc. in recent months.  They have been put in jail, returned from jail to Loughan House and to the streets of Galway within a matter weeks.  They are again being apprehended on the streets of Galway.  They will go through the same rigmarole, which means that they may not reach a prison again for another 12 months.</P>
    <P>A Galway drug dealer and dangerous criminal was given a four month sentence in Mountjoy Prison but within a matter of weeks, he was in Loughan House.  He escaped from there and came back to Galway, where he started to steal cars one weekend.  He was apprehended by the Garda in a stolen car and sent back.  That practice has got to stop.  There was a robbery in Clifden a few months ago, in a high profile case. Three robbers broke into a supermarket. The owner heard the commotion during the night, grabbed his shotgun and injured one of them with it.  Two of those criminals were out on early release from prison at the time and the third one has a record of crime in Dublin. However, they have taken a case against this man for personal injury which occurred as a result of him trying to protect himself and his premises.</P>
    <P>The criminal is now on top and until such time as we take radical initiatives such as those I have proposed, we will not come to grips with crime.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Ms Burton) Austin Currie">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no proposals to change the appeal system in the District Court.  A basic and integral feature of our court system is that the decisions of a court may be appealed to a higher court.  The law provides that there is a right to appeal decisions of the District Court and in accordance with the Courts of Justice Act, 1928, as <Col N="1005" /> amended by the Courts of Justice Act, 1953, every appeal in a criminal case of an order of the District Court lies to the appropriate Circuit Court.</P>
      <P>Appeals of decisions of the District Court are generally returned for hearing at the next Circuit Court sitting.  Persons appealing decisions of the District Court can apply to the District Court for bail pending the hearing of their appeal.  The decision to grant bail and the terms and conditions on which bail is granted are a matter for the judge.  The Government's policy document <i>A Programme for Renewal</i> provides for &ldquo;an examination by the Law Reform Commission of legislation to allow courts to refuse bail when the court considers it desirable to do so.&rdquo;  The Minister has asked the Attorney General to ensure that the Law Reform Commission's review takes into account the terms of the Programme for Government.</P>
      <P>In relation to the provision of additional prison places, I am proceeding with plans to provide 210 additional places in two purpose built institutions &mdash; 150 for male offenders at Castlerea, County Roscommon, and 60 for female offenders at Cowley Place, near Mountjoy.  Construction of these two prisons is expected to commence later this year and completion is expected early in 1997.</P>
      <P>My Department has examined the question of empty Army barracks being used as places of detention in the past and, generally, has found surplus Army accommodation to be unsuitable for adaptation for custodial purposes.  In particular, such premises have not readily lent themselves to providing the type of secure cellular accommodation that is the most necessary requirement at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it does seem an attractive idea, the reality is that it would require excessive investment of public moneys to make most of these barracks secure and manageable for the detention of prisoners.  If the required money were available, it could be used more cost effectively in either building from <Col N="1006" /> scratch or extending existing civilian prison buildings.</P>
    <P>This Department has, in the past, adapted military detention barracks at Cork and Arbour Hill in Dublin for use as civil prisons.  This was feasible in both of these cases because the high perimeter wall, the cell block and the exercise yards were already in existence and they needed only the upgrading of sanitary and electrical services.  Buildings for education, work training, recreation and staff facilities were also added.  The costs incurred in adapting these two barracks in 1975 was approximately £10.8 million, which if updated to today's values would represent approximately £41 million to provide 272 prison places.</P>
    <P>The only attempt by the Department to adapt conventional Naval accommodation at Fort Mitchel in Spike Island as dormitory accommodation for low risk category prisoners ended disastrously when the prisoners rioted and set fire to their accommodation within months of occupation in 1985.  Alternative arrangements and adaptation works to provide secure prison accommodation had to be undertaken subsequently.  A proposal to use Collins' Barracks in Dublin was examined by my Department in 1993. The conclusion was reached that the barracks were unsuitable for adaptation and that the costs involved in adapting would be excessive.</P>
    <P>In summary, the accommodation which would materialise from adaptation of Army barracks would generally be of limited value.  Within the constraints of the existing buildings, only open type dormitory accommodation is generally feasible.  This is totally unsuitable for the vast majority of offenders who require a much higher level of security.  The risk of riots in such situations is greatly increased with potential danger to life and limb as well as extremely costly material damage to the buildings.  Extraordinarily high staffing levels would be needed.</P>
    <P>Overall, I am satisfied that the provision of 210 additional prison places together with a major ongoing programme for the refurbishment of existing <Col N="1007" /> accommodation and the adoption where appropriate of non-custodial measures, such as community sanctions and measures at the court stage, as well as programmed and structured early release under supervision, will go a long way towards solving any current deficiencies in the prison service.</P>
    <P>I will take the points the Senator made in relation to the barracks in Renmore and will ask my officials to examine that proposal.  The comments made by the Senator in relation to the current crime wave related for the most part to drugs.  This experience is reflected in many towns and cities throughout the country.  The Senator will be aware that a series of co-ordinated measures to address all the different complex elements of the problem was announced by the Minister for Justice in the debate in the other House.</P>
    <P>These waves of both small scale and large scale robbery are extremely damaging to our enjoyment of the economic and social progress which the country has made.  Everybody is particularly sensitive to the question of the availability of arms in the context of the very welcome peace process.  A number of factors are contributing to the problems we are experiencing.  I will take the specific points in relation to early release raised by the Senator into account.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1008" /> I am sure the Senator recalls that, despite the many efforts made to address the situation when Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn was Minister for Justice, the problem of crime has unfortunately continued to grow in society.  This problem is complex and is linked to social deprivation.  I have been involved in many community initiatives in Galway which deal with the problems of deprived communities in and around Galway city.  Substantial progress has been made by community groups in addressing the needs of their own area in co-operation with institutions ranging from church bodies to University College, Galway.  However, all that positive and very welcome progress will come to naught unless we, as a society, are able to address the crime issue.  I thank the Senator for raising the matter.  I will take up the specific points he raised with my officials.</P>

      <P>Perhaps officials in the Department might respond to the other issue, that is, the appointment of a Circuit Court Judge.</P>

      <P>Yes.  The Court and Court Officers Bill is being finalised in the Department and one of the issues to be addressed is additional judges.  I will raise that point.</P>
