      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is items 1 and 2.  Item 1 will be taken from now until 1 p.m., with ten minutes for each speaker.  The Minister will speak later in the debate as Statements on the Economic Conference are taking place in the other House.  Item 2 will be taken at 2 p.m., with a sos from 1 p.m. until 2 p.m.  The proposal is 20 minutes for the first speaker from each group and 15 minutes for each speaker thereafter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Leader provide 15 minutes for the first speakers from each group on item 1?  Our spokesperson has indicated that he would like a little longer than ten minutes to deal with this important matter.  Is it proposed to deal only with Second Stage of the Minerals Development Bill today? Would the Leader be in a position, perhaps next week, to indicate the Bills which will be taken between now and the summer recess?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the point raised by Senator Mullooly that it might be better if the first speaker had 15 minutes on item 1.  Could the Leader confirm that next week's business will include Report Stage of the Civil Legal <Col N="1738" /> Aid Bill?  When this Bill was previously discussed, the Leader said he expected it would be taken around 14 June.  I wish to establish that this is the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Leader ask the Minister for Social Welfare to clarify the situation regarding the application of means tests to the summer jobs scheme? Many young people are deprived of work on this scheme because of the rigid and unbalanced way in which the means test is applied.  In some cases the children of people on high incomes qualify, while in other cases they do not qualify.  The system is being applied most unfairly.  It is also creating problems for some of the groups organising schemes because of the difficulty in getting young people to take up available positions.  This scheme operated most successfully over the last number of years.</P>

      <P>A question to the Leader, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Social Welfare to clarify the position?  Perhaps the Minister could make a statement either publicly or in the House in relation to how the means test will be applied this year.  Perhaps he could ensure that there is some flexibility to enable many young people, who are now out of school and looking for work, to take up available positions on the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>An Adjournment debate might be more appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I always seem to ask about the Harbours Bill, but I am anxious that it is put through the House. It was speeded up considerably by the last Minister for the Marine, Deputy Coveney.  Could the Leader find out whether the Bill will definitely go through the House before the summer recess?  Second Stage has been completed in the other House.  It is an important Bill and much work could be <Col N="1739" /> done over the summer holidays if it has passed through both Houses.  Will the Leader ensure that this Bill is dealt with by both Houses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Leader give the House any news on the progress of promised anti-discrimination legislation? I ask this question for two reasons; first, I was disturbed by a case involving a man who had lived with another man for 20 years, which was reported in the newspapers.  The relationship was not recognised and the man was expelled from his house as a result.  This seems a highly discriminatory and regrettable practice and suggests that relationships between persons of the same sex should receive the same degree of legal recognition that they receive in some other jurisdictions in Europe.</P>
      <P>The second reason involves a related area of prejudice.  I am sure the House will join me in expressing utter abhorrence of what is taking place in Moate, County Westmeath.  I do not want to make specific points about the issues involved as I am sure they are complex. However, I am sure most people felt a shudder of horror when they heard somebody on the radio this morning describe a family, who are originally from the travelling community, as &ldquo;inferiors&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Senator making that point because he has a particular interest in this matter?  It is in his part of the country, but I expect he feels just as ashamed as I do.</P>

      <P>Senator Norris, a question to the Leader.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Senator could communicate that to his constituency in Moate, County Westmeath, unless he agrees with them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Daly's call for a statement from the Minister for Social Welfare regarding the summer jobs scheme.  It seems to have come unstuck this year insofar as that some of the decisions that have been made as regards students are hard to understand.  I know of one family who had one of its members included in the scheme and another who was not, even though both of them were third level students.  There have been a lot of queries and the matter should be cleared up.  I fully support the call from Senator Daly that the Minister for Social Welfare would either make a statement on the matter or get it clarified.</P>
      <P>The chairperson of the private nursing homes association stated she thinks that many of our nursing homes will have to close because of the inadequate supports that are being provided by the Government.  This would be a retrograde step and I ask the Minister for Health to make a statement on this.  I know that the Minister is due in this House &mdash; we have been waiting for him for a good while on a number of issues &mdash; but this is a matter of great public importance.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>There are over 10,000 beds in the private nursing homes sector. It cannot be left to paddle its own canoe at this stage.  It needs the intervention of the Government and the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I would never disagree with any ruling that you would make, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, but I support Senator Norris.  If this House can discuss discrimination or oppression in East Timor or in any other place, it is an apt subject for this House on the Order of Business when we subject our own people to oppression.  It is a matter of concern to this House that 300 people would block the main highway between Galway and Dublin to oppress one family. It must be a terrifying experience for that family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is more appropriate for Private Members' Business but it is certainly not appropriate for the Order of Business, Senator.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I raise my own issue, I concur with and support Senator Norris's statements.  It is terrible to hear, as we heard this morning, anybody being described as inferior.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are certainly not discussing that issue now, Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope common sense will prevail in Moate.  We had this problem in Galway and it is terrible to see the treatment this family has got over the last few days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would the Leader allow time next week for a debate on our escalating crime situation?  There was a horrific crime committed against an Australian lady in Galway two days ago.  I raised the crime problem in Galway in this House two weeks ago.  During that Adjournment debate, I asked the Minister <Col N="1742" /> if she would consider, on a pilot basis, making a number of detention places available at the Renmore Army barracks and that we would look at the possibility of creating a number of detention places at selected Army barracks around the country.  In view of the unsatisfactory reply that I got to my motion, could the Leader arrange for a debate on our general crime situation to be held as a matter of urgency?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support Senator Fitzgerald's call for some movement on the Harbours Bill.  We have a serious number of problems in County Donegal with our harbours and piers. This is an urgent matter and I ask the Leader to raise this matter with the Minister for Defence and the Marine and to have this Bill moved as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader if he would consider giving time for a discussion, at the earliest opportunity, to the major problems that are facing the <i>Irish Press.</i>  This paper has had an influential voice in Irish affairs since the 1930s and 60 jobs are now at risk.  The Minister has failed to act adequately in this regard.  Could the Leader bring the Minister to the House so we could put our views to him and be able to hear his current position on the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Members who have condemned the attitude of certain people, both at county and local levels, in County Westmeath.  Could I ask the Leader for a discussion in this House on discrimination and if the Minister would discuss the application or non-application of the regulations on the settlement of itinerants or people of disadvantage?  Various matters could be discussed under that heading and we might be able to get over your problem of not being able to take questions on it in this way, a Leas-Chathaoirligh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Could the Leader ask the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to come to the House and explain the absolute disgrace of the cost of cellular <Col N="1743" /> phones in this country?  One can buy a certain cellular phone in Northern Ireland or the UK for £19.99, but Eircell and various Dublin retailers are charging £352 for the same phone. Equally, mobile phones that cost £45 in the UK are costing £520 in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are certainly not discussing mobile phones on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to ask the Minister to come to the House.  I am looking for information from the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is looking for a phone for Senator Roche.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been stated that the cost of phone calls in the UK is higher than here.  I disagree with that.  It is about time that the rip off by Telecom Éireann and the sellers of these mobile phones was stopped and we should get an indication from the Minister as to what will be done about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Mullooly raised the question of time for the first debate.  I have no difficulty with allocating 15 minutes for the first speaker, but I was trying to ensure that as many Members as possible contributed to the debate.  If there is pressure on time later, perhaps Members may share their time.  We are discussing only Second Stage of item 2 today.  I will have a fairly complete list of the Bills to be debated for this session, but this depends on when the session ends and that date has not yet been fixed.</P>
      <P>For the information of Members, the House will be sitting on by-election week and by-election day.  This is a break with the past but I think Members will deem it appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1744" />
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is how serious the Government is taking it.  It is throwing in the towel already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>That is simply an indication of quiet confidence.</P>
      <P>I am fairly certain that the Legal Aid Bill is coming to the House next Thursday but I will confirm that with Senator O'Toole after the Order of Business. Senator Daly raised a question about the applications of means testing.  I will communicate with the Senator on that matter some time today.</P>
      <P>The timing of the Harbours Bill is out of our hands.  The Bill is currently on Second Stage in the Dáil and is then moving to one of the Dáil legislation committees.  I understand that this committee will be sitting in July and September. That would seem to indicate that it might not come back to us until we meet again after the summer recess, but I will keep Senator Fitzgerald informed of any developments there. However, I will convey the urgency which both the Senator and Senator Maloney have indicated about this Bill.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris has raised an important point on discrimination.  All of us find what is happening in Moate to be disturbing and saddening.  I do not think any of us know enough as to the specific causes, but we hope that this issue can be sorted out as quickly as possible and in the proper spirit.  I am not aware of the progress on anti-discrimination legislation but I will find out for the Senator.</P>
      <P>I raised the point Senator Norris made yesterday about the alleged apology to the ASEAN ambassadors.  The Minister has confirmed to me that no such apology was given nor was there any reason to give one.  The discussions were entirely on the matter of trade. Senator Norris can be assured that what he was doing was regarded by the Minister as being totally legitimate and within his rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Finneran raised the question of private nursing homes.  I am genuinely trying to get a major debate on health organised as soon as I can.  The <Col N="1745" /> Minister is willing.  There is a pile up of legislation but I am keeping it in mind.</P>
    <P>As regards Senator Fahey's proposal on crime, we cannot do it next week because the time for that period has already been allocated.  However, I will certainly try to organise a debate on that between now and the end of the session.</P>
    <P>Senator Cassidy raised the question of the <i>Irish Press.</i>  My own views on that are well known.  All of us regard it as a tragedy that a newspaper with the traditions and place in Irish life of the <i>Irish Press</i> should be under threat.  I do not agree with Senator Cassidy that it is the Minister's fault, because the fault lies elsewhere.  Everyone knows where the fault for the failure of the <i>Irish Press</i> lies.  However, it is not an issue for point scoring.  My own view is that at the present time the most hopeful sign for the <i>Irish Press</i> would be if some consortium or some other investors were seen to be around.  The Minister does not really have a role in that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, hopefully, that; but jobs are jobs, Senator.  I think that those people who are out of work might not be terribly concerned about the colour of the investor's money.  Anyway, I am trying to answer your question.  All of us would hope that some sort of investment package will be made available to try to save that newspaper.</P>
      <P>I will communicate the points made by Senator Lanigan.  The figures that he has given would seem to indicate an outrageous rip off.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the presence in the Gallery of two very distinguished Americans, Mr. Bill Flynn and Mr. Bill Barry, who have played an important part in the peace process so far.  Both men are very deserving of the thanks of people on both sides of the Border for the work they have done in helping to further the peace process and also in helping to encourage economic investment in this country.</P>
      <P>In many ways they are typical of so many of the friends that this country has found over the past number of years. Without any doubt whatsoever the peace process would not have made the progress it has were it not for the stimulus given from friends of both sides of Ireland, externally, who could do and say things that often were not possible for politicians here to say and do.</P>
      <P>The huge volume of support from politicians, not just in the US but also in Britain, is something that has not happened by accident.  It is the result of long years of hard diplomatic work by ambassadors, politicians and leaders over the years who persuaded and encouraged people to take a positive role.  One of the more encouraging things for any of us as politicians visiting Capitol Hill today is the number of senior distinguished Senators and Congressmen who are deeply and often critically informed of events here and who are willing to be helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same is true of the House of Commons, and it is appropriate at this stage to pay tribute to the work of the <Col N="1747" /> British-Irish Interparliamentary Body. This body has been in existence for about five or six years and has helped a great deal to break down the barriers within the House of Commons, thus ensuring that MPs are fully informed on all the complexities of the issues here.  I am sure that Members would like me to pay tribute to Mr. Peter Temple-Morris, the leader of that group in the House of Commons, for his work over the years.</P>
    <P>We have had a year of almost miraculous normality.  So much has happened, and so quickly, that there is a tendency to take it all for granted and to behave as if it had always been thus.  We must never take what has happened for granted.  It may be growing in strength and solidity, but the process is still precarious and its roots have not gone deep enough yet to ensure that it will remain firmly in place.  There are still people who are either opposed to, or doubtful or worried about, what is happening. There are still people who can put a stop to the progress and they must now be firmly in our minds as we move ahead into the next phase of the process.</P>
    <P>It is no harm in this debate to thank God and thank all those people who made possible the joy of peace which we have had for almost a year.  It is a pleasure to travel to Northern Ireland today and see people with the burden of fear lifted from their shoulders.  It is a pleasure to see the new openness which is slowly beginning to inform the relationships between the different communities in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The priority now for the Government, this House and for all involved, is to continue the building of trust.  This will be done not by any manifestos, major pronouncements or grandiose statements, but by quiet dialogue and the coming together of people in whatever shape or form this takes place.</P>
    <P>A great example of that took place in the last few weeks at the Washington Conference on Economic Investment in Ireland.  I did not have the pleasure of being there but I have spoken to many <Col N="1748" /> of my colleagues, to journalists and others who were.  By every account it was a total success in that it will almost certainly mean an influx of economic investment on both sides of the Border which will help to underpin the peace process.  Much more importantly, it was a success because it provided a forum for people to come together who would never normally come together on this island.  People came together, saw each other as human beings, discussed each other's problems and, most of all, they enjoyed each other's company.</P>
    <P>It is perhaps significant that a major event in the Irish Embassy was called a party, while in the British Embassy it was called a reception.  I gather that there was a difference between the two events.  Nonetheless, to see loyalists &mdash; and loyalists perhaps with a very doubtful past &mdash; enjoying the hospitality of the Irish Embassy and feeling that they were genuinely welcome, was something which impressed and touched all of those who saw it.  People were similarly impressed to see republicans &mdash; and again people over whose own past and background perhaps many question marks hang &mdash; enjoying the hospitality of the British Embassy and mixing in a way that is not possible at home.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the work of the Irish Ambassador in Washington, Mr. Dermot Gallagher, and I am sure that Members of the House would like to express their appreciation of his work. It is through events like that, although they will not all be as grand as the Washington Conference, that the trust-building process must go on.  Whether it takes place in town twinnings, cross-Border discussions or people coming on holiday, those are the most fundamental ways in which progress will be made.</P>
    <P>The agenda of the peace process itself is long, and it is well known by now.  It is not my intention to look now at the issues which remain to be tackled, though on the question of the release of prisoners a great deal of progress has been made.  There probably never will be a time when all prisoners can be released in a hurry because some of the <Col N="1749" /> crimes that have been committed on both sides were too heinous to allow for early release.  Nobody could think that any political act could ever have justified the killers of Greysteel, nor would anyone want to see the early release of such people back into the community. But there are other areas where people who were politically motivated and idealistic are no longer any threat to society and where the early release process should be taken very seriously indeed.  I am glad to say that our Government has taken a positive lead in this direction.  We would all like to see the pace stepped up considerably on the other side of the Border and in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>I will not go into all the issues raised by parity of esteem, but the agenda is by now fairly specific and detailed. Nobody is in any doubt as to what republicans mean by parity of esteem as translated into specific acts and concepts.</P>
    <P>There are some worrying signs about the question of policing because policing will be at the centre of any stability in Northern Ireland.  Most people in the South would like to see a more rapid rate of progress there.  There are other issues and worries on the loyalist side. The reassurance to people &mdash; a reassurance we have given and over which we will stand &mdash; that their sense of Britishness and their freedom to remain within the UK is as secure as any other promise and must be respected.  There is, above all else, the fear of the unknown. We in the South have to be conscious and sensitive to the fact that people have lived in what was often described as a laager mentality for almost 30, 50 or 100 years.  They treated the outside and the unknown as the enemy.  Their thinking was inward bound.  They must now come to terms with changes &mdash; changes greater than any of them could ever have anticipated two or three years ago &mdash; happening so quickly.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of arms, with both sides fearing the presence of large arms dumps on the other side.  We <Col N="1750" /> have recently seen the importance of listening, of according respect to other people's points of view and to their fears, and of realising that any solution has to be big enough and capacious enough to accommodate all of us.  I have personally met with Sinn Féin on a number of occasions since the ceasefire.  A year ago I did not think that would have been possible.  I would not have wanted to meet with Sinn Féin a year ago.  I was impressed, when I met the Sinn Féin people, by their sincerity and goodwill.  I believe they are honest people honestly seeking a way out of the problem.  They are honestly trying to find a fresh start to build an Ireland in which they will have their full legitimate part.  They honestly want to see the fears of Protestants and Unionists respected and to see that they are also given their chance to breathe freely in whatever new arrangements are made.  I hope that when they spoke to me and to my colleagues in Fine Gael, they accepted our goodwill and our sincerity on the matter. I believe they did.  We have seen much of the mistrust and suspicion that built up over the past terrible 25 years swept away quicker than anybody could have imagined.  If these meetings can be continued and replicated and if they can take place between communities, towns and groups, we are making real progress which will not be easily overturned.</P>
    <P>I have one big worry with all that is happening, and it is a worry which other politicians here share.  To a certain extent, the middle ground is being squeezed out and the genuine worries of people on the middle ground are not being taken account of.  I am speaking in particular of the positions of the SDLP, the Official Unionist Party and, to a lesser extent, the Alliance Party. The SDLP is a party which has shown extraordinary courage and resilience over 25 extremely difficult years.  It has shown extraordinary physical and moral bravery.  It is a party which has lived in a political vacuum for much of that time.  It has demanded huge sacrifices from its members.  There is a danger, in the adulation and the novelty of Sinn <Col N="1751" /> Féin being within the political process, that we ignore or marginalise what the SDLP has done.  Everyone knows and appreciates the achievements of Mr John Hume.  People like Mr. Séamus Mallon, Dr. Joe Hendron in the Falls Road in West Belfast, Mr. Eddie McGrady and the dozens of councillors and local representatives, who have carried the SDLP message at lonely times throughout the last 25 years, have paid an enormous price.  It is important that the role of the SDLP would not be minimised in any way.  They must not be squeezed and they must be recognised. Their form of nationalism must be seen to be at least as equally representative and as important as any other.</P>
    <P>Much the same is true of the Official Unionist Party.  It is difficult for a Southern politician to speak warmly or well of Official Unionism, but there are some extraordinarily fine people within the Official Unionist Party who have fought hard with their own traditions and prejudices &mdash; and often with the prejudices of their own supporters &mdash; to try to bring about change.  The last thing we want to see at this stage is that these people are either ignored or that their contribution is marginalised or minimised in some way.  The same is true of the Alliance Party.  The danger is often that &mdash; like the prodigal son or Mary and Martha in the Bible &mdash; those who are labouring in an unglamorous but worthy way and without whose presence the entire system might have collapsed are pushed to one side at a time like this.  These are the people who have always been democratic, who have always acted constitutionally, and who have always been brave.  We must ensure that they, above all, are not marginalised in what is happening.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by saying that this is and will be a happy debate.  It is a debate that none of us could have envisaged taking place in this spirit a year ago.  There will be disappointments and setbacks; it is part of the human condition. Things will go wrong.  But it is my firm belief at this point that so much <Col N="1752" /> progress has been made, that the reality of peace has been so powerful, with the possibility of economic rejuvenation and development and the quiet miracle of ordinary life, that the prospect of all these things is so great that there will be no going back.  In that context, it is vital that we in this House maintain the bipartisan approach which has characterised both Houses for the past few years.  Northern Ireland must never again become an item on the domestic agenda of any political party here.  If we can maintain that sense of unity, then the debate today will be another step which will have a happy outcome for our country.</P>

      <P>I warmly welcome the opportunity to make statements on the current situation in Northern Ireland and I welcome the Minister to the House.  Hopefully, as the Leader of the House said, our debate will be harmoniously constructive.  That is a tremendous achievement and I am entitled to feel pleased at the developments over the last 12 months.  I am a little disappointed that when Senator Manning was complimenting so many people and including the SDLP &mdash; all of which I agree with &mdash; the former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, was not included in his list. Everyone in Ireland knows that nobody made a greater sacrifice.</P>

That is as clear as a bell to everybody in this country, whatever side they come from.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to join with Senator Manning in complimenting the various sections of the people.  I will start with our former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds.  The British Prime Minister and all of the British public representatives had a major role in the process and it was easy to see how enthusiastic the British electorate were about resolving the Northern Ireland problem.  I want to put on record our appreciation of the major contribution that President Clinton has made, because he held steadfast in spite of criticism.  He brought the parties together and held conferences.  He sent Mr. Ron Brown, his personal representative, Senator George Mitchell and several other envoys to the North to keep the peace process on line.  We owe a great debt of gratitude to the President, Congress and people of the United States, not only for their contribution to the peace process, but also for their major contribution through the International Fund for Ireland, to alleviate the serious deprivation experienced over the past 25 years.  This House could not do any better than to send them our good wishes and thanks.  If we have the procedure to do so, we should send to America our deep appreciation of the assistance and contribution which the President of the United States and all of the American people have made to the peace process in Northern Ireland, as such thanks is long overdue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody in this House could be more pleased than I am about the present developments.  I come from a small farm on the Border.  The nearest town is Strabane, where I go three or four times every day.  I have a deep knowledge and concern about this matter.  I have lived through the times when we had a commercial Border &mdash; it has now, thank God, disappeared &mdash; where somebody coming from the North to the South with a load of sand or gravel would have to wait four hours to get their book stamped.  We had commercial, psychological and political borders.  The commercial and psychological borders are gone bringing about a tremendous new <Col N="1754" /> situation; but the people of my county have suffered greatly.</P>
    <P>For 25 years, all public representatives, myself included, would not make a contribution or a statement in case we rocked the boat.  We kept our heads down and did not make any statements which might aggravate the difficult situation prevailing in the North.  Most of us were uncomfortable or unsafe.  I changed my car every two years because on coming through checkpoints, where one is known only by the number recorded in the computer, I would be told that I had had a car too long.  The situation was very serious for those living in the Border area.</P>
    <P>The peace which we now have in the North has opened up new horizons.  I want the support of all of the people who have been far away, especially our own Government.  I suggest that as many people as possible from the South go to the North and find out the situation on the ground.  We have had to listen to contributions and opinions expressed by people who were far from the North.  Those people had very little knowledge about the situation, but they had theories and simplistic answers and solutions.  I have no political flag to wave, but in my book nobody contributed more than Deputy Albert Reynolds, because the day that he was elected Taoiseach he put it at the top of his list and he succeeded.  He will be remembered by history.  When the full story is revealed it will be understood what he did to keep on side some of those who are now to the fore.</P>
    <P>In 1981 the Economic and Social Committee of the EC made a study of deprivation in the area.  They published a map which showed a black area and it was not very encouraging for me to see the whole of County Donegal in that black area.  The study showed that Strabane had the highest number of unemployed in Europe.  The towns of Strabane and Lifford are divided by the Foyle river and they work very closely together.  We have a Strabane-Lifford commission and cross-Border co-operation. The high level of unemployment <Col N="1755" /> in the Strabane area was a serious problem for County Donegal as well as for County Tyrone.</P>
    <P>That whole area has lost its base industry and deserves special focus and attention.  The garment industry, the whole of the shirt industry, was a traditional industry in Derry, Strabane, Lifford and Buncrana and provided high levels of employment.  Boys and girls leaving school had good prospects of getting jobs in the garment industry because the manufacture of shirts and pyjamas provided high levels of employment. All of that was lost and there was no training, modernisation or input. While there are one or two survivors which specialise in high quality shirts, very little remains.  Third World countries have relabelled their products, which now sell in Dunnes Stores and supermarkets, and shirts costing £4 or £7 have taken over.  My region suffered serious deprivation and consequences, with very large numbers of young people unemployed.  I am glad that the serious deprivation shown in the study by the Economic and Social Committee of the EC in 1981 is over.</P>
    <P>We should look at the agreement which was reached prior to the peace settlement.  On 21 October 1987, the Irish and British Governments agreed at a meeting of the Anglo-Irish InterGovernmental Conference to initiate a study of the north west region: County Donegal and the areas covered by the district councils of Derry, Strabane and Limavady.  What they said was important then and it is important today.  They stated &ldquo;Both Governments have decided to press ahead with the study because they recognise that the problems of the area are enormous and cannot be effectively tackled by either Government acting in isolation&rdquo;.  That was an honest recognition of the serious economic problems which prevailed in that area.  However, despite the peace process and our hopes and aspirations, and although that agreement is on paper, no serious attempt has been made by the last Irish Government and <Col N="1756" /> the current one.  The north-west cross-Border study produced a very positive plan, but there has not been a single pound of input from the Irish Government.</P>
    <P>I have a letter from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, dated 20 August 1985, which states:</P>
    <P>The lack of financial additionality is a major drawback from the Government's point of view in so far as an integrated operation is concerned.  It would, in practice, lead to a situation whereby the existing receipts from the Structural Fund would be over concentrated in certain areas at the expense of the broader, national development priorities.</P>
    <P>In other words, not one pound note was on offer at that stage, when it was not even safe to go out.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning is right.  Part of the reason why the British are pulling back and are so anxious for an agreement is that the North costs them £9 million a day, and Britain has plenty of financial problems.  In fairness to the British, they compensated for everything which happened in the North; when property and goods were damaged and destroyed, they paid for everything.  The British did a marvellous job in very difficult circumstances and pumped in a great deal of money.  I am sorry to say that the Irish Government did not pump in any money.</P>
    <P>I am the chairperson of the north-west cross-Border group, which consists of four local authorities, three in the North and one in the South.  We have established an office in Derry city and we employ a development officer.  It costs £80,000 per year to run that office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Government has not contributed £1 to date towards the maintenance of that office. Surely that is an indication of its concern. The crocodile tears are great, but in politics an ounce of performance is <Col N="1757" /> worth a ton of publicity.  The only reason we have a cross-Border office which accommodates elected representatives &mdash; the only structure comprised of elected representatives from both sides of the Border &mdash; is that EU INTERREG funding contributes £80,000 per year to keep our office open.  Pious platitudes, appreciation of the peace process, complimenting each other about it &mdash; all these things are great; but a year has passed and it is time we were seen to perform.  Public representatives in the Border areas are not as vocal as they should be.</P>
      <P>There are 400 American companies in Ireland, but the six Border counties in the South have only 16.  No companies have located there recently.  We have experienced deprivation which we have not been able to record &mdash; we have kept our heads down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to speak on Northern Ireland.  I join in the welcome which the Leader of the House extended to his two friends from America.  I also welcome four <Col N="1758" /> other Americans who are here this morning.  They are from Pittsburgh and are heavily involved in reconciliation work in that city.  They could not have chosen a better morning to visit Seanad Éireann.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, at the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland in Belfast, Dr. Godfrey Brown, a sound man for whom I have a great deal of time, talked about the new &ldquo;feel-good&rdquo; factor in Northern Ireland as a result of the ceasefires.  I feel good.  I feel that quality of things being great because of the ceasefires.  I am optimistic that they will hold.  Every morning I wake up, listen to the news and do not hear of another death or bomb, I feel that is a great morning.  The longer it goes on, the harder it will be for the men of violence to return to violence.  Those who have been affected by the troubles feel good.  The unemployed in Northern Ireland feel good.  Young people in Northern Ireland feel good because they have had their fill of violence during their young lives and they are glad to be able to walk about in safety.</P>
      <P>However, there are vast numbers of people in Northern Ireland, mostly of the Unionist tradition, who are in employment, are comfortable and who were not and are not affected by the social unrest or the violence we have suffered.  They appear to be disinterested, perhaps even complacent.  I was saddened when my daughter, a primary school teacher in a school located in the heart of Unionist/Protestant Northern Ireland, told me two nights ago that in the staff room of her school the peace process has never been mentioned. There are about 27 staff members.  The ceasefires have never been mentioned among them.  She is amazed, as I am, that that should be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must ask myself: why is this so?  Do they feel helpless?  Do they feel there is nothing they can do?  Do they want to leave it to their politicians?  Do they feel that having, as it were, held out before and having maintained their position, they will do so again?  Are they afraid <Col N="1759" /> that the British Government cannot be trusted?  Are they even more afraid that the Irish Government wants to rule them?  These are decent honourable people, pragmatic to a fault.  They are down-to-earth and honest.  I can but appeal to them, in love, not to feel frightened.  Nobody wants to frighten them; nobody will frighten them.  I appeal to them to realise that change is in the air.  Changes have taken place. This is 1995; we are heading for the 21st century and 1690 was three centuries ago.  The opportunity for a lasting peace was never as good as it is right now.</P>
    <P>I appeal to them to acknowledge the peace dividend, which will show itself in so many ways &mdash; in the economy, trade, tourism and employment.  I appeal to them to encourage their politicians to come to the table &mdash; any table &mdash; to present their case.  The Unionists have a case.  I wish they would come and present it.  I say to those politicians that reconciliation is not a negative factor; it is a positive attitude.  Compromise is not defeat.  Here is a people, largely Protestant, rich in values &mdash; determination, enterprise, forthrightness, wit and a great cultural heritage.  They are needed in our society and in any solution.  Do they not feel sad that so many of their bright young people are crossing the water for higher education and are not returning?  We will miss those young people.  We need them.  Do they not want to be part of a society which will create a structure where their children can live in peace and harmony?</P>
    <P>Dr. Godfrey Brown at the same meeting in Belfast said:</P>
    <P>Yet the peace is still an unstable thing.  There remains the paramount need to convince our politicians and our people of a genuine commitment to democracy, and this clearly requires that former paramilitaries face up to the will of the majority that their weapons of destruction should be convincingly decommissioned.</P>
    <P>He is right.  This must happen, and it must happen soon.  If it did, then the <Col N="1760" /> people of whom I have been speaking would and will be convinced that we and they are truly on the road to peace. I will finish with something said in Dublin city last night by the Primate of All Ireland, Dr. Robin Eames, who is perhaps the nearest we have to a visionary in Northern Ireland, if not in the whole of Ireland.  He urged those involved in the peace process to seek new ways of understanding age old problems and he warned that the cost of failure would be too terrible to contemplate.  I would say amen to that.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;on a temporary basis. I welcome the decision of the House to make provision for a series of statements on Northern Ireland.  This is a time of hope and opportunity in Ireland. Since last autumn, the guns have been silent.  No one on this island has died in the name of any political cause.  Now, however, we must translate the cessation of violence into a just and lasting peace.  That means availing of this unprecedented opportunity to address in a new way the underlying divisions which allowed violence to develop and to persist for so long at such tragic human and material cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been many encouraging and positive developments over recent months.  Indeed, as I have said on a number of occasions, we seem to have a perverse tendency to underestimate what has been achieved so far.  Many obstacles which loomed large at one time or another have already been overcome. For me, the fact that these difficulties have been resolved is an indication <Col N="1761" /> of a collective goodwill working towards the success of a process which is vital to all of us in these islands. Rather than taking courage from the many important milestones which have been reached in the process so far, the debate immediately concentrates on the next obstacle in view, as if that were the only reality.</P>
    <P>I think the sense of the peace process being composed exclusively of a series of hurdles does not do justice to the transformations which are happening, as it were, below the headlines.  I draw great hope from the new culture of dialogue and mutual respect which I see taking root in both traditions, even if it has not yet made itself fully felt at the formal political level.  There are good grounds for hope that, in a climate of peace, a true opportunity exists for us to move forward towards a lasting political accommodation on this island.  The overriding goal of both Governments is the launch of an inclusive talks process on a three-stranded basis.  Dialogue must be developed at every level, but clearly as a contribution to this goal, and not in any way as a substitute for it.</P>
    <P>For our part, the Government will do everything in its power to achieve the earliest possible commencement of comprehensive negotiations involving the two Governments and the relevant political parties in Northern Ireland.  We will seek to advance that goal in every way in our dialogue with the parties and the British Government.  As the House will be aware, the Government has recently invited the political parties in Northern Ireland to engage in bilateral discussions with us.  These discussions would take place on an informal basis and on an entirely open agenda.  I hope that all sides will feel able to respond positively to this invitation, completely of course without prejudice to any position they may adopt in future talks. Against the background of what we have been through in Ireland and the opportunities now open to us, dialogue is a duty and not a form of concession.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1762" /> The British Government has also over recent weeks issued invitations to bilateral discussions and a number of such meetings have already taken place. I have already warmly welcomed this development and the meeting between Sir Patrick Mayhew and the president of Sinn Féin held on the margins of the Washington conference last month.  It is my hope that the present meetings between the British Government and Sinn Féin will lead to early and genuine progress so that all relevant parties can move on to full comprehensive and inclusive talks.  We hope, equally, for a positive outcome from the talks which British Ministers are holding with loyalist representatives.</P>
    <P>Another encouraging development in recent months has been the bilateral contacts which some of the Northern Ireland political parties have established among themselves.  There is no alternative to dialogue, and such contacts hold the promise of enhanced understanding across the political spectrum for the differing viewpoints.  I especially welcome the recent meeting of a joint delegation of the UUP and the SDLP with the Prime Minister, Mr. Major, to discuss a range of economic and social issues of concern to both parties.</P>
    <P>The urgent objective for all sides now must be to transform the absence of violence into a lasting settlement.  This means we must painstakingly construct a new set of political arrangements which address all the relationships and embrace the concerns of both communities in Northern Ireland so as to be capable of winning the allegiance and consent of both traditions.  This will not be lightly achieved.  Difficult or not, we in Ireland have no choice but to embark on this journey.</P>
    <P>The Opsahl report put well the salient fact of political life in Northern Ireland when it said both communities have &ldquo;the critical mass to resist imposition&rdquo;. Many practical consequences flow from that reality.  It means the choice for both communities is either the politics of co-operation or the politics of mutual frustration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1763" /> The politics of frustration, of two communities locked in mutual denial, is already familiar.  It has borne bitter fruit in the past and will always do so.  It is also becoming clear that it leads to a dangerous erosion of the stuff of politics itself.  Young people who in more promising circumstances would enter creatively and constructively into the world of politics turn aside in disgust if they feel that a mainly negative agenda has usurped a positive goal of building for all.  The political process, to be healthy, must constantly renew itself.  That will not happen while parties are deadlocked in some kind of zero-sum-game. It is important to break out of that mould, not least for the health of the democratic process itself.</P>
    <P>If, as I believe, the politics of co-operation is the only viable alternative, then the qualities of consent, mutual respect and parity of esteem become something more than moral ideals.  They are also simple political necessities, since neither community will in practice co-operate without them.</P>
    <P>I sense on the Unionist side a deep-seated fear that the agenda of equal treatment and parity of esteem is merely the ante-chamber of the transition point to new forms of domination, and that if they concede equality they will then be asked to concede more than equality.  I believe that, properly understood, this agenda is both morally right and a valuable and impartial protection for both communities.  Moreover, returning to Opsahl's point about critical mass, Unionists have the capacity and strength in negotiations to ensure that these principles are applied in their proper sense and not as code for some future subservience which will leave Unionists with less than equal treatment.</P>
    <P>The goal of creating a &ldquo;new beginning in relationships&rdquo; is an ambitious one.  It is a goal that has the full support of everyone in these islands seeking a way out of the present impasse.  There are challenges in our collective path that are clearly difficult but I remain convinced that these are amenable to rational and <Col N="1764" /> reasoned resolution.  The key is to discard for good the old politics of assertion and denial, in whatever form, and to relegate to history the failed expedients of the past.</P>
    <P>The only realistic way forward is to be found in accepting that, virtually by definition, there is as of now no consensus among the people of Northern Ireland on the fundamental constitutional issues at stake.  We must instead proceed by reaching agreement on how to manage and overcome the underlying divisions through developing new forms of constructive engagement and interaction.  If we cannot realistically expect consensus on the fundamental constitutional issues themselves, we can aim for agreement on generally acceptable ground rules on how to handle this lack of consensus, so that diversity enriches rather than destabilises the political process.</P>
    <P>It is now obvious to everyone that there can be no stable or lasting agreement that does not win the allegiance and consent of the Unionist community. That viewpoint is accepted without reservation by all sides in this House and increasingly by all shades of Nationalist opinion on this island.  Equally, political consent is a coin with two sides.  As the joint declaration puts it, &ldquo;stability and well-being will not be found under any political system which is refused allegiance or rejected on grounds of identity by a significant minority of those governed by it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have said on many occasions that the Framework Document was designed by the two Governments to challenge both sides.  We deliberately set out to outline a possible accommodation that could address two sets of legitimate rights, not just one, and that would be fair to the concerns of all.  The close partnership between the Irish and British Governments, exemplified by the joint declaration and the Framework Document, represents an enormous asset in reaching the fair and balanced compromise which is indispensable for a lasting settlement.</P>
    <P>Both Governments have made clear at every stage that nothing will be <Col N="1765" /> imposed.  There is however a clear distinction between ignoring the Framework Documents and ignoring the underlying realities which they seek to reflect.</P>
    <P>We will actively welcome any alternative proposal which deals with these realities in a different and better way. What would not be acceptable, however, would be to solve the problem by suppressing that part of the equation which relates to the rights of the other side.  We know from history that this kind of solution is no solution at all.</P>
    <P>Northern Ireland is a conflict of two sets of rights.  A precondition for any new understanding must be a general acceptance of the legitimacy of both traditions. Nationalists must accept the right of the Unionist community to be Unionist and the legitimacy of their tradition. Unionists must, in turn, offer an unquestioning acknowledgement of the right of Nationalists to be Nationalist and of the equal legitimacy of that tradition.</P>
    <P>The shared approach by the two Governments in the Framework Document rests on our assessment that only an accommodation that is fair and reasonable to the concern of both sides has any prospect of lasting success.  This involves constructing a political framework which adequately deals with the complicated realities of the relationships between both traditions on the island and between both islands.</P>
    <P>The Framework Document is built on this reality and on the shared assumption of both Governments that a new beginning in relationships requires flexibility and compromise on all sides.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that most Unionist political leaders unhesitatingly accept that there can be no return to the days of majority rule.  When applied to a deeply divided society, majority rule cannot succeed and is incapable of providing the potential for change which is an indispensable attribute of a healthy democracy.  The task now is to agree a workable accommodation that both sides accept as fair and honourable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1766" /> This involves not only agreement on new arrangements within Northern Ireland but new patterns of interaction between both parts of the island.  It is necessary to say clearly that the development of North-South structures is desirable not just because of their obvious economic and social benefits. They are also an essential dimension in obtaining the assent of the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland for any new accommodation.</P>
    <P>In the Framework Document the two Governments have done a great deal to take on board long-standing Unionist concerns in relation to the operation of future North-South structures.  We state in very clear terms that this could be done with safeguards of unanimity; through democratic accountability to an Assembly representing the people of Northern Ireland and by criteria of clear and defined mutual interest.</P>
    <P>There is now a unique window of opportunity.  It is, therefore, important to proceed with all urgency to inclusive negotiations involving the two Governments and the relevant political parties in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>In deference again to Unionist concerns, we have sought to put the best possible safety-net under what some might fear to be a &ldquo;high-wire act&rdquo;: both Governments have made clear in the Framework Document that we intend that the outcome of future negotiations will be submitted for democratic ratification through referenda, North and South.  All the parties have, therefore, the assurance and the safeguard of the people's will as we seek a shared and agreed conclusion to future dialogue.</P>
    <P>It is accepted by all sides that the issue of paramilitary arms is an important element in the quest for a settlement.  It is an encouraging starting point that all sides accept that the goal is to remove the gun forever from Irish politics.  It is impossible to envisage a lasting peace without the objective of the removal of paramilitary arms having been achieved.  I have said on many occasions that we must avoid a circular argument on whether prior decommissioning <Col N="1767" /> is the condition for political progress or political progress for decommissioning.</P>
    <P>We must avoid making the resolution of any one factor of the equation a precondition for negotiations, or viewing the peace process as a one-item agenda. Progress in one area will create a dynamic of confidence which will unlock new possibilities in areas which might otherwise be intractable.  It is important to make progress on each and every element as soon as we can and in whatever way we can, treating the process at all times as a shared journey towards mutual trust.</P>
    <P>Anyone from this House who was present at the Washington Conference last month can only have been moved and impressed by the sight of Irish representatives, North and South, working together for the good of all the people of the island.  It showed how quickly even entrenched barriers to dialogue can crumble in the face of the shared goal of economic development, which I believe is common to every responsible politician on the island.</P>
    <P>With the achievement of peace, there is now an enormous opportunity to use the resources of our island in the interests of all Irish people.  Such co-operation can only serve to advance the welfare and prosperity of all, Unionist and Nationalist alike.  We have to take advantage of the real, tangible benefits to be gained by such co-operation for both parts of the island.  I believe that there is widespread acceptance that this was one of the main themes to clearly emerge from the Washington Conference.</P>
    <P>The economic benefits of the conference will of course depend to a large degree on the quality of the follow-up to it, especially by the business community itself.  The Government for its part will be pursuing this vigorously over the coming months and I look forward to discussing progress with Senator Mitchell when he visits Ireland towards the end of this month.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1768" /> I believe the conference has also, without any damage to its central economic goal, advanced the political process by giving a significant boost to the culture of dialogue on all levels.  I have already put on record on several occasions our deep appreciation of President Clinton, his Administration and the friends of Ireland on both sides of Congress, for the signal assistance they are giving to us in consolidating the peace process by developing a dividend of peace for the communities on the ground.</P>
    <P>In the course of a visit on other business to Belfast the day before yesterday, I was able to make time to avail of an invitation given to me some time ago to visit Harland and Wolff shipyards.  It is a visit I would commend to anyone still tempted to view the Northern Ireland situation through the prism of ancient myths.  This was not some tribal bastion, obsessed with politics.  I met an intelligent and outward looking management, fully supported by their workforce, determined to make a success of their enterprise in conditions of acute, and to some extent unfair, international competition.</P>
    <P>The concerns voiced to me had nothing to do with political agendas. They were rather that all of us should see their industry as a valuable resource for the whole island, and that we should be mindful of that both in terms of any orders we might be in a position to place in the future and in terms of various developments in the European Union, or in economic diplomacy generally, where the Government could support measures to ensure a fair competitive environment for shipbuilding generally.</P>
    <P>It is contacts such as these, by how happily the norm rather than being something newsworthy, which are perhaps the real story of the peace process, rather than sagas about handshakes, or the apparently endless obstacle race which we see reflected in the media treatment of it.</P>
    <P>The potential for co-operation in the economic field, entirely without prejudice to anyone's political position, is <Col N="1769" /> now more or less universally accepted. We must build on that for our common prosperity.  I believe the same potential exists in the political field, only that it is not yet so widely recognised.</P>
    <P>The two traditions in Ireland are poised at the threshold of a new relationship.  The Nationalist tradition has the capacity, and now also, I believe, the will, to confer on the Unionist tradition something that that tradition, however proud and independent, can never achieve by itself alone.  I mean a fully recognised and accepted role for their tradition in its integrity in a new political dispensation across all three strands of our relationship.</P>
    <P>We must all work to ensure this unique opportunity is not squandered by a failure of courage and vision, or even of a simple tendency to see myths rather than the reality on the part of either of our traditions.</P>
    <P>For both North and South, there are important new levels of trade and business co-operation to be developed and the prospect of important advances to be made in attracting new inward investment.  To do this, we must work together in trust and partnership.</P>
    <P>On the political front, the need is for all sides to sit down together and seek a new way forward for the people of this island.  We must seek to build on what binds Irish people, in our diversity, together.</P>
    <P>Our shared task on this island must be to build and to heal.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Tánaiste on his wide ranging speech, in particular on his reference to a democratic assembly with unanimity as a system of protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Wilson made a point earlier which struck me as being vital to what is happening in the North at the moment. <Col N="1770" /> Members of the House will be aware that I have an office in Belfast and spend quite an amount of time addressing this issue in Belfast.  I have been working for a long time to encourage progress at ground level in schools and staff rooms.  Senator Wilson gave us the example that his daughter is worried that in her staff room the ceasefire has not been mentioned at all.</P>
    <P>I recently asked the teachers in a staff room in the North on the Nationalist side why I was not hearing from them on the issue.  I challenged them at some considerable length because we have been attempting to address this issue in a broad way.  Eventually a member of the staff asked me what I knew about it and told me that until the day I have to sit in a staff room held at gunpoint by terrorists while the pupils are taught how to make bombs in the laboratory, I will not understand.  I was told that it takes time to come out of all this, that they need more time.  Senator Wilson and I are well aware that this is a true story.</P>
    <P>On a positive note, this morning before I came here I opened my post in my INTO office.  I received a letter from the general secretary of the Ulster Teachers' Union which is probably the union to which Senator Wilson's daughter belongs and which comes from a very strong Unionist tradition.  It broke away from the INTO in 1920. That letter confirmed that the Ulster Teachers' Union at its executive meeting on Tuesday has agreed, following negotiations with me, to be present at the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation on 30 June when education will be discussed. For those who know the North, that is an extraordinary move forward and, for me, it is the most significant thing which has happened for a long time.</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister of Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, has joined the debate.  Her presence in the North on a number of occasion has been more than helpful in a number of areas.  Work needs to be done in the education area in terms of recognition of qualifications, <Col N="1771" /> something for which the Minister has shown support.  It is recognised that education has work to do.  I believe that process is moving down through the system, but people are afraid to make the first move.  The Ulster Teachers' Union has shown great courage in taking this decision.  We will move forward in the North by considering how education might make an impact not only at staff room level, but at class room level.</P>
    <P>Difficulties have been experienced by teachers from the Unionist and the Nationalist side.  I am careful about the terminology I use.  I notice the Tánaiste never confuses republicanism with nationalism, and I compliment him on that.  Teachers on both sides are involved in the implementation of education for mutual understanding.  It seems to be working well, but more progress needs to be made.  We come up against a number of practical problems. For example, the involvement of pupils in certain activities does not create problems, but it does in others.  It is easy for two twinned schools from both sides of the community to meet for a game of soccer, but difficulties arise when trying to get them to agree to a game of cricket or Gaelic football.  Parents ask questions and there is uneasiness in the community. Schools cannot move ahead of the norms of the community which they serve.  There is a difficulty in breaking that down.  Schools can only move in tandem or in parallel with opinion.  That is how we want to move forward.  We must ask each other what price are we are prepared to pay.</P>
    <P>The only part of the Tánaiste's speech which caused me concern was when he spoke about the two sides.  That is an irritant to a lot of people in Northern Ireland at present because they do not consider themselves to be on one side or the other.  I hope that the views of those who do not see themselves as Nationalist or Unionist would be subsumed into what I would see as republicanism, although most people would not see it as that.  I regard Senator Wilson as a true blue quintessential republican <Col N="1772" /> in that he sees the need to bring both sides together to be subsumed into a new area where, in terms of the original definition of republicanism.  Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter would work happily together with parity of esteem. As Senator Wilson will be aware, parties like the SDLP and the Alliance Party are vociferous in the forum in asserting themselves as not being on one side or the other but as being in the middle or in a third place where there is room for everybody.</P>
    <P>As regards parity of esteem, an opportunity was lost during the visit of the Prince of Wales to deal with a number of outstanding issues.  It was a time, if enough courage had been shown, to respond to the Mullaghmore bombing and Bloody Sunday.  We could have shared apologies and made a comment which would have lessened uneasiness for people.  May I share my time with Senator Lee?</P>

      <P>I reiterate the points made earlier as regards work done by many people and I support what was said about the former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds.  I would like to single out Mr. John Hume, who took a lot of stick over many years and not only in recent times.  I recall discussing with him in this House in 1987 or 1988 the difficulties he faced and the lack of support from politicians in the South when he first began talks with Sinn Féin.  The greatest danger is that people will become remote from the peace process, a point made by Senator Wilson.  If teachers and others do not talk about it and leave it to politicians, it will not develop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the process of violence began in 1969 through a sense of alienation, non-participation and remoteness from where decisions were being taken. We must move forward and learn to accommodate difference and that parity of esteem is broader than just recognising Unionists or Nationalists.  It also <Col N="1773" /> means recognising Muslims, atheists, those with no views and those with different coloured skins and attitudes. We discussed the attitude towards travellers in County Westmeath on the Order of Business.  It is the same issue. I heard on the news this morning that a child with an Irish accent was attacked in England.  This shows a lack of tolerance and a need to accommodate difference, which can only be addressed in homes and in schools.  When children become adults they must understand that others are different because that is a <i>sine qua non</i> to parity of esteem, which must felt as well as acted.  We should celebrate the ethnicity and the various views and beliefs on this island. We should be proud of them and not submerge them.  As Mr. Ken Magennis asked many years ago, why should an Irish person not be able to wear the shamrock on St. Patrick's Day and also march on 12 July to celebrate another aspect of culture?</P>
    <P>The most hopeful aspect of the Tánaiste's speech was his commitment to an Assembly to which there would accountability.  As somebody who works on a day to day basis in the North, I know that whatever rows and differences I have with the Minister for Education or the Government, the fact that there is a political process is extremely important.  Those of us who take it for granted should recognise that there is a great void in the North by not having that interaction, tension or argument between those with political responsibility and the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá fáilte roimh an Aire.  I hope I will not intrude on this love-in between Senator O'Toole and the Minister for Education.  I agree with the Tánaiste, who said that we must avoid making the resolution of any one factor of the equation a precondition for negotiations or viewing the peace process as a one item agenda.  Both Governments since last August have handled the peace process well, better than the British Government, although by its own standard, it is learning.  We <Col N="1774" /> are going in the right direction at the right speed.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste was right to welcome the economic potential of the various American and European developments.  I hope, however, we will not become more dependent.  However, I hope we will not become more dependent on a dependency mentality and that we can accept whatever directions we receive without becoming further mired in the assumption that our serious problems be resolved elsewhere.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I was interested to hear the Minister refer again to diversity of identity.  In that context, and partly taking up what Senator O'Toole said about the visit of Prince Charles, I have no doubt about the resilience of Unionist identity.  I would not respect Unionists if they were to abandon their identity, or move any significant distance in that direction, in order to conciliate a Nationalist identity.  I would be far more concerned about the resilience of a Nationalist identity on this part of the island.  When we talk about diversity of identities, I look at how the Republic of Ireland is developing and wonder what diversity of identity will remain in a very short time.  In that respect, it is worthwhile to draw attention to Mary Holland's column in today's <i>Irish Times</i> which expresses, in a responsible and restrained way, sentiments of unease which many people felt about the official tone for the reception of Prince Charles.  Without in any way endorsing the counterproductive and discourteous protests against that visit, I felt very close to being demeaned by part of the tone adopted.  It was quite unnecessary. I do not see how it can earn any respect, either from across the Irish Sea or from north of the Border, for attitudes of an undue sense of deference.  It may be that the Irish wolfhound is an unduly belligerent symbol of the new thrust toward conciliation, but I hope it will not be replaced by the poodle.</P>

      <P>When the issue of Northern Ireland was addressed in this House in the past, it tended to be at times when there had been a dramatic breakthrough, whether it was the ceasefires, the Framework Document or other steps being taken in the current progress.  This is a difficult time because there are no obvious steps in that progress. The Tánaiste referred to this and it underlies the contributions of Senator Wilson and Senator O'Toole.</P>
      <P>It is a difficult time but it is more important, or at least as important, as the more dramatic breakthroughs which have been made.  It is a time when the peace is being cemented, when the politics of fear &mdash; politics which were established for the past 25 years in Northern Ireland &mdash; are gradually being replaced by the politics of trust and co-operation. That cannot be done quickly.  It takes time, patience, balance and agreement. I appreciate that, with the need to take time and have patience, there is also the need to maintain a momentum and avoid the kind of disillusionment about which Senator Wilson, in particular, was concerned, that people are afraid that nothing is happening.  A lot is happening, though not, perhaps, in a dramatic way.  The Tánaiste referred to a series of meetings which are taking place between the British Government and various political parties, the Irish Government, which is seeking to meet with various political parties, the political parties themselves &mdash; notably the Official Unionist Party and the SDLP &mdash; and a variety of organisations in Northern Ireland and on this part of the island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most central tenet of the Framework Document is the tenet of agreement. That agreement will not happen quickly where there are two main traditions with directly opposed goals, either full integration with Britain or a united Ireland, which cannot be achieved at the same time.  What we are seeking is something which will not fully <Col N="1776" /> satisfy either side; we are looking for a compromise.  Senator O'Toole correctly referred to what is sometimes called &ldquo;the third strand&rdquo;&mdash; or the middle ground &mdash; which is growing.  It is probably the greatest sign of progress that more people are showing a willingness to try to understand what others want and to try to accommodate them.  That central ground is growing which is, perhaps, the greatest sign of hope.</P>
    <P>We need to ask ourselves what we should be doing at this time.  We should be encouraging dialogue, inter-community co-operation and trying to analyse what kind of society we hope to have at the end of this process.  In that context, the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation is fulfilling an important role.  There have been contributions from many different organisations working together, between north and south and within Northern Ireland &mdash; communities, women's groups, farmers, industrialists, trade unionists, etc.  In the kind of dialogue which we, as representatives of the political parties north and south, have had with these organisations, an understanding has developed about the complexity of relationships and the potential for co-operation.  It is very important to encourage and facilitate this.  Structures need to be worked out that will accommodate a bottom-up as well as a top-down approach so that people feel &mdash; whatever their contributions might be or whatever organisation they belong to &mdash; that their views are being listened to and that they can contribute in some way to whatever kind of society evolves from this period of discussion.</P>
    <P>The contribution made by Boyle and Hadden to the forum referred to the need to have policies which bring people together rather than policies which divide.  Our concentration should be that whatever policy we support should encourage people to come together, not keep them apart.  I would like women to be encouraged to become more involved in politics, particularly in Northern Ireland.  Very few women have been involved as public represenatio <Col N="1777" /> tatives in Northern Ireland because it has been particularly difficult.  It is difficult enough for women to participate in politics but it has been particularly difficult for them in Northern Ireland.  Some people, such as Brid Rogers and Annie Courtney &mdash; with whom I have had personal contact and who was mayor of Derry two years ago &mdash; have made their contribution as have the leaders of the political parties.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste also referred to young people.  We need to ensure that the voice of young people is heard.  There has been a sense of glamour about some of the more dramatic events, be it handshakes or whatever.  However, the more important work is done quietly and consistently, on a long term basis, and achieves more than handshakes.  This work should be given the kind of recognition it deserves.</P>
    <P>Many parties have referred to the need for a bill of rights when discussing the sort of society we want to create. This is an important point.  The Labour Party would like to see a bill of rights and some basic understanding of what people's &mdash; individuals and communities &mdash; rights are in the society that develops from the ongoing discussions in Northern Ireland.  I would like to see that issue addressed.  The other main issues are policing, the release of prisoners and arms.  These are difficult issues and discussions are ongoing.  It might be useful, in relation to the arms issue, to have an individual from outside act as an honest broker.  That proposal should be examined.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, there is a need to balance, a need for momentum, a need to move forward and take steps in the process of building peace and developing new structures.  There is also a need to appreciate the fact that time must be taken.  Current discussions need to be in-depth and ensure that everybody's fears are taken into account.  It must be ensured that what emerges is a process of genuine agreement, that people have the time to relinquish some of the things they may hold dear to accommodate other people, that there can be parity of <Col N="1778" /> esteem and that the firmly held beliefs of all people in the various communities in Northern Ireland &mdash; I would not say just two communities &mdash; can be taken into account.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  The people of Northern Ireland and the Border counties have lived in changed times during the eight months since the ceasefire.  I come from Donegal and can feel the difference in what is happening there at present.  The ending of political violence gives us all a clear possibility of looking each other in the face again and of presenting ourselves without the fear that our views, identity, history and feeling will be rejected.</P>
      <P>The question which everybody on this island would love to have answered is whether the violence in the North is over.  Politicians have grappled with this problem over the past 25 years.  We all hope at this stage that the future is geared towards peace.  I have to commend the British and Irish Governments on their dedication and commitment to the peace process and for their joint and open ended search for a solution to this problem.  Consolidation of the peace process is now the crucial priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Progress has been dramatically illustrated in recent days.  A week ago we had the visit of Prince Charles.  This would have been unheard of this time last year.  A few weeks ago we had the Washington conference on trade and commerce in which President Clinton played a major role.  These are only the latest in a series of significant events on the road to further peace.  I was privileged to attend the conference.  It gave us all great hope of what we can achieve by working together.  This conference was not about hand outs but an opportunity for business people to come together to see what marriages could take place in trade and commerce to push the peace process forward.  It also brought together political representatives of every major political party in the Thirty-two Counties under the one <Col N="1779" /> roof for the purpose of seeing that the peace process is given a chance and to see what can be done to help people who have suffered over the past 25 years.  People have suffered at the hands of the paramilitaries and have paid an extremely high price in lives and destruction.  At the end of the day for what have they paid this price?</P>
    <P>I am extremely pleased at the way meetings have taken place between southern and northern political groups over recent months.  I am pleased to have been a member of the Labour Party delegations which went to the North on a number of occasions.  We had constructive meetings with all the political parties in Northern Ireland and I hope this process will lead to a better understanding.  There is now an onus on all political parties to foster relationships in every way possible with our friends North and South of the Border.</P>
    <P>I hope the dialogue between the British Government and Sinn Féin will gain momentum.  They are two of the major players in finding a final solution.  The issues of decommissioning and punishment beatings must be addressed by all sides.  I have no doubt that both parties will play their part in seeing that the talks continue and that progress is made at a steady pace.  To engage in talks is important to the development of true understanding between the two traditions on this island.  I believe all political parties now see and will grasp this opportunity to inform all the people at first hand of the efforts being made to achieve a just and lasting peace and reconciliation on the island.</P>
    <P>At present we are at an impasse because of the position of the British Government on the decommissioning of arms and the position of Sinn Féin on the release of prisoners.  What can be done to achieve movement on these issues?  What can any of the politicians from opposite sides of the fence do to move from their strongly held positions? The former President of America, Mr. Jimmy Carter, said that the single major problem is the first step of <Col N="1780" /> getting parties to recognise the status and integrity of the other side.  He believed the key requirement for movement towards a resolution is mutual recognition of each other's existence and rights and a mutual reassurance, involving a new relationship, between former enemies.</P>
    <P>Are people willing to sit down with the criminals and terrorists they denounced for the past 25 years?  In effect, we are asking a political tradition, which has experienced a state of siege for many years, to suddenly turn around and accept the legitimacy of their former enemy.  We have only to look to the remarkable example of South Africa where Mr. Nelson Mandela and Mr. F.W. de Klerk struck up a whole new political relationship.  Why can this not be done in Northern Ireland?  I believe it can be done if the will and courage are there.  I feel the war in Northern Ireland is over and that Unionists must sit down with Nationalists and negotiate an agreement which will work.</P>
    <P>In Northern Ireland at present each party views the other as the enemy and it is hard to move the peace process forward without the parties connecting with each other and understanding from where the others are coming.  This is an area in which we can help if we continue to have dialogue and build up trust with the parties in Northern Ireland.  We can help them to resolve their problems.  It may be slow and take a long time but I feel we are capable of this and that it is well within our reach.</P>

      <P>The first and most important thing to say about this subject is thank God we have reached this point in the history of these two islands. Maybe it is sufficient to simply say we have reached this point and are grateful for it.  Too often during our regular statements in this House on Northern Ireland we have been marking tragedies and atrocities.  We have marked great events like the Downing Street Declaration and the Framework Document but, as often as not, we have marked <Col N="1781" /> tragedies like Loughinisland, Greysteel, the Shankhill and others which I cannot think of now.  They became regular occurrences.  It is important that we continue to remember the people who suffered, were slaughtered and died.</P>
      <P>We have shown a tolerance and moderation in the language we use in the Seanad.  This sends out a good and positive message of hope.  It is important that we continue to debate Northern Ireland at regular intervals because it would be easy in the context of the peace process to sit back and relax and not try to drive matters forward.</P>
      <P>I endorse the sentiments expressed at the start of the debate by the Leader and others about the importance of the quiet work of peace and building reconciliation. It is appropriate we should mark the contribution of our Government and the British and US Governments but there are many quiet heroes who are not publicised and whom we do not know.  They have brought us to this point as much as the work of Governments. Each of us, as ordinary citizens, has a role to play through social, business, sporting and religious contacts with both parts of the island, to foster peace and reconciliation and this can be done effectively.</P>
      <P>An instance, of which Senator Wilson will be familiar, is when the rotary club of Enniskillen visited Newbridge before Christmas.  They visited the Dáil the evening before Deputy Albert Reynolds resigned from the position of Taoiseach. They chose a historic moment to visit us.  This is an important part of the work which must be done on the ground.</P>
      <P>According to press reports this morning, the Leader of the Alliance Party, Dr. Alderdice, has expressed worries about what he has termed a blockage in the peace process.  He has been one of the moderate and tolerant voices which stood alone at times over the past 25 years and we must listen to what he has to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I think it is not unreasonable for people to just breathe the oxygen of peace and to be given time to enjoy it.  There must not be too much <Col N="1782" /> impatience about trying to solve overnight things which have taken many years to get to the stage of even being talked about, let alone solved.  We must remember it has taken 25 years to reach this point and it is only nine months since we had bombs and bullets.  We have made great progress and for that we are grateful.  While I understand that impatience and the worry that a consequence could be a slide back to violence, I think it is reasonable to say that people should be given space and allowed enjoy being able to go about their business and make social contacts in the knowledge that they are safe.</P>
    <P>We must also accept, as the Tánaiste accepted in his speech &mdash; it is a speech I would commend &mdash; that there are aspects of the principles of unionism and nationalism which are irreconcilable. This does not mean that compromise and political settlement are impossible and that the process cannot best be advanced by talks between moderate unionism and moderate nationalism. I was pleased that the Progressive Democrat conference in Galway was attended by Senator Wilson, Mrs. Bríd Rogers, Mr. Ken Maginnis, Dr. John Alderdice and Lord Home.  It was crucial for our members to hear what those people had to say because their message is important and as many people as possible should listen to what they say.</P>
    <P>The question of arms is central to future progress.  There are people in the North, as there are in the Republic, who believe concessions have been won by the implicit threat of violence which exists as long as arms are present.  I welcome the intervention of President Clinton who asked the paramilitaries to put away their arms.  I wish to avoid the circular argument mentioned earlier by the Tánaiste but it is imperative that arms be decommissioned.</P>
    <P>I object to the inordinate attention given to Sinn Féin by RTE and the media, when one considers the SDLP enjoys much more support from the electorate and the Alliance Party enjoys an equivalent level.  Those of us who attend the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation <Col N="1783" /> wonder why there is such a rush by the media to interview Sinn Féin representatives when they emerge from meetings while others with a more moderate and balanced message are left to one side.  Sinn Féin is critical to the process but it is not the only important element in reaching a solution.</P>
    <P>The arms are in the background of all the coverage; the disproportionate attention afforded to Sinn Féin may be due to the knowledge that it can fall back on supporting the campaign of violence if events do not go as it wishes. As Deputy O'Malley said at our conference, Sinn Féin will become a normal party with the same rights as other parties when it furnishes evidence that it has no intention of returning to violence as a purported political weapon.  In that context punishment heatings by the paramilitaries must be addressed and must come to an end.</P>
    <P>I appeal to Unionists to come the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation. They have nothing to fear; it is not a pan-Nationalist forum and there is no intention on the part of any of the participants that it should become one.  We want to hear, listen and know.  We have had major contributions from the Presbyterian Church, we will receive one from the Methodist Church and we have had contributions from individuals from a Unionist perspective.  They have put their case well and clearly but we need to hear the parties of the Unionist tradition at the forum and it would be a great step forward if they would come to tell us what they believe.  In that context, it is regrettable the Catholic Church has not put its point of view to the forum when the other Christian churches have.</P>
    <P>As we come into the marching season there is a need for moderation.  Provocative displays do not help and people who have peace at heart should be conscious of that.</P>
    <P>There are eight principles for a permanent solution.  There should be, first, a total commitment to exclusively peaceful policies and politics by all <Col N="1784" /> sides; second, a recognition that Northern Ireland is in a real sense both Irish and British and not a homogenous society; third, acceptance that the current status of Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom cannot change without the freely given consent of a majority of the people there, as enunciated in the Downing Street Declaration and the Framework Document; fourth, genuine equality of esteem and of rights for the two parts of the community and the two traditions of nationalism and unionism within Northern Ireland; fifth, a written constitution underpinning such equality of rights and aspirations in Northern Ireland and affording a means to vindicate them; sixth, a devolved power-sharing Government in Northern Ireland; seventh, as part of the overall package, changes in Articles 2 and 3 of our Constitution to recognise that the aspiration to Irish unity will only be achieved on the freely given consent of a majority of people of Northern Ireland; and eighth, new North-South institutional links to underpin the Irish aspiration and allegiance of Northern Nationalists and optimise practical economic and social co-operation between the two parts of the island. There should also be inclusive talks with all parties involved to chart the way forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Wilson's contribution reminded me of the most depressing memory of the violence, watching on television the funerals of those who died.  That has now stopped and I share the &ldquo;feel good factor&rdquo; he mentioned.  I also join in Senator Manning's tribute to Mr. Peter Temple-Morris, the Co-Chairman of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body.  I have been a member of that body for the last three years and I will confine my remarks to its work, especially in relation to the International Fund for Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The economic and social committee of the body, of which I am a member, recently held its first substantive meeting on this subject with the intention of providing a preliminary overview of the <Col N="1785" /> operations of the IFI, as well as an opportunity to visit a selection of projects and meet those involved.  As Members know the IFI is an international organisation established by the Irish and British Governments in 1986. Its objectives, as set out in article 2 of the founding agreement, are to promote economic and social advance and to encourage contact, dialogue and reconciliation between Nationalists and Unionists throughout Ireland.</P>
    <P>The agreement requires that the fund spend about three-quarters of its resources in Northern Ireland and about one-quarter in the South.  The fund is financed by international contributions from the United States, the European Union, Canada, New Zealand and, most recently, Australia.  These contributions represent a major international recognition of the joint efforts of the Irish and British Governments to seek a peaceful solution to the conflict in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>To date the United States has committed a cumulative figure of approximately $229 million to the fund.  As part of the recently announced US package of assistance to the peace process, President Clinton has proposed to increase the contribution in 1996 and 1997 from the current $20 million per year to $30 million.  The US Congress is following a policy of retrenchment of foreign aid but in view of the peace initiatives I hope it will concur with the President and give approval.</P>
    <P>The EU has contributed 90 million ECUs to the fund between 1989 and 1994.  In the aftermath of the Joint Declaration and subsequent ceasefire, the Commission brought forward a draft regulation which provides a legal base for the EU contribution and proposes that it be extended for a further three years, from 1995 to 1997.</P>
    <P>The fund's most recent report, published in September 1994, showed it had approved assistance for some 300 projects during the period in question, the year October 1993 to September 1994. This brings to 3,000 the total number of projects assisted by the fund.  The input <Col N="1786" /> has stimulated investment of about £800 million, of which the fund's contribution was approximately £230 million.</P>
    <P>The projects offered support during the past year are expected to help in excess of 1,700 direct full-time jobs plus substantial part-time jobs.  Cumulatively the fund has assisted in the creation of some 25,000 full-time jobs since its establishment in 1986.  While the fund's geographical remit covers the six counties of Northern Ireland and the six border counties of Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Louth, Monaghan and Sligo, it gives top priority to areas of particular disadvantage and on average has committed more than 70 per cent of its resources in these areas.</P>
    <P>Special stress is laid on cross-community projects and cross-Border co-operation, including projects of an all-Ireland nature.  Reconciliation and improvement of community relations are central to the fund's work and are promoted through all its activities.  For example, under its disadvantaged areas initiative, the rural programme of the fund assists cross-community groups in developing regeneration projects for their areas.  Under the business enterprise programme, those groups are helped develop enterprise centres to act as a focus for the promotion of local enterprise.</P>
    <P>The International Fund for Ireland has supported three major flagship projects which will provide great benefits to the areas in which they are located and which are of immense symbolic importance. One of these is the £30 million restoration of the Shannon Erne waterway. This project has received £6.1 million from the fund to date and is the largest single project approved by the fund. The second flagship project is the development of the Navan Fort interpretative centre in County Armagh, which has been successful in attracting visitors to this historic area.  It is encouraging to note that since the ceasefires a significant number of visitors to Navan Fort are from the South. The third flagship project is the regeneration of Strabane and Lifford.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1787" /> The Shannon-Erne waterway was constructed in the middle of the last century and was then called the Ballymore-Ballyconnell Canal.  It linked the two largest waterways, the River Erne and the River Shannon.  It was designed to serve as a way in and out of Counties Cavan, Leitrim and Fermanagh.  Its construction began in the years preceding the Famine and was a great source of employment in the area.  The canal became uneconomic when it was unable to compete with the rail transport which opened up the region shortly after its construction.  By the middle of this century it had fallen into disrepair, its lock gates were broken and its banks had collapsed and were overgrown.  Instead of opening up the area, it formed a physical barrier which divided farms and communities.</P>
    <P>Five years ago the International Fund for Ireland became involved in the restoration of the waterway.  Old skills and new talents were employed to repair 30 miles of the waterway and 16 locks.  The charm of the 19th century is retained, while 20th century engineering standards and technology are cunningly concealed.</P>
    <P>The work of the International Fund for Ireland in Derry cannot be underestimated. At one time there was virtually no private investment in the city. Its four hotels had ceased to enjoy good custom and any investment was the work of local community groups which had little access to resources.  Today the city is a new showpiece of urban and community development.  The objective of any construction is the creation of pride and self-worth among the community and individuals.  The fund is involved in the development of community owned shopping centres and the establishment of a strong tourism infrastructure for the city, which was once a proud regional capital.  The status of a major tourist destination will be added to the city's reputation for regional trade.</P>
    <P>The value of property in Derry increased significantly following the <Col N="1788" /> recent ceasefires in Northern Ireland. For a long time the fund has supported local groups in their endeavours which meant that when the ceasefires were announced a lot of the infrastructural work had already been carried out.  Credit for this work must go to Mr. Paddy Doherty, chief executive of Inner City Trust, and Mr. Glen Barr, manager of the Maydown Ebrington Centre.</P>
    <P>In the disadvantaged housing estates which accommodate many, if not all the city's unemployed, new commercial centres have been opened or developed with the support of the fund.  These centres are community owned and have an attractive prestige anchor tenant because they are community focal points.  The state and local authorities have also located public facilities, such as libraries, there.</P>
    <P>Almost every project undertaken in the city includes a number of people who, in one way or another, have been affected by the troubles.  This is a creative venture which not only restores their sense of worth, but stimulates their productive skills and ensures that they can identify with the newly emerging Derry which is now a place of hope.  The International Fund for Ireland has played a major part in achieving this.</P>
    <P>On the southern side, the main initiative is to use the fund for those towns and villages closest to the Border which have been affected by the troubles.  I had the privilege of visiting Newtowncunningham, County Donegal, where the local shirt factory, which had closed, has now reopened and is employing 30 people as a result of support it received from the fund.  I also had the privilege of seeing the regeneration project in Lifford, County Donegal, which transformed the old courthouse into an interpretative centre.  This will be a great tourist attraction.  These are only a few of the beneficiaries of the International Fund for Ireland.</P>
    <P>I ask for a little latitude to speak about another aspect of the fund which has a Dublin dimension because it is one of the most remarkable programmes in which the fund is involved. <Col N="1789" /> The training and reconciliation programme in west Belfast, Tallaght and Dublin, called Springboard, has brought together 337 young people since November 1991 and hopes to bring together a further 540 young people from the three different communities and to offer them vocational training, which is deemed to be the best anywhere. Springboard began as an experiment in an attempt to find a vehicle which would enable young people on both sides of the so-called peace line, which divides west Belfast Catholic and Protestant communities, to come together.  The peace line was a psychological and physical barrier separating near neighbours. West Belfast has suffered significantly from the violence of the past 25 years.  This scheme trained people from west Belfast and Tallaght in America and Europe.</P>

      <P>I welcome this opportunity to speak about the situation in Northern Ireland.  We must acknowledge that a dramatic transformation has taken place since the ceasefire.  This underlines the urgency of pressing ahead to find a long term lasting solution to the Northern Ireland question. This House has on many occasions expressed its views on the unfolding developments in the North.  There was a great sigh of relief throughout the country and internationally when the ceasefire was announced after 25 years of death and destruction and 100 years of conflict and disunity.  We are now taking the slow painstaking steps to peace and a lasting solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the support we have received from the international community for the peace process.  I compliment the Irish in America, particularly President Clinton for his unswerving support throughout this campaign.  The recent conference in Washington not <Col N="1790" /> only indicated political support from the United States, but it also demonstrated a keen willingness on the part of powerful American industrial and economic interests to backup the peace effort by investing in Ireland.  I pay special tribute to these people who have expressed their interest in the search for peace.  I also pay tribute to the Irish American political leaders who have kept this burning issue to the forefront of American public opinion.  I compliment the American Ambassador, Mrs. Jean Kennedy-Smith, for her contribution to the peace process, particularly as regards east-west relations.</P>
    <P>As a member of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, I had the honour of being present when the United States delegation addressed the forum in Dublin Castle.  It is encouraging and rewarding to know that we have such powerful backing from the United States.  I also want to put on record the volume of work done under the chairmanship of Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness.  For the past nine months a range of submissions have been made by a variety of organisations and interest groups, political leaders, Church leaders, community workers, etc.  The central message was peace. Each committed themselves to working for the betterment of the community, North and South, and resolved to play their part in making the island of Ireland a better place to live.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the British Government's vacillation in its acceptance of the ceasefire and its adoption of a more lasting trust between Sinn Féin, the SDLP and those taking part in the ongoing discussions.  Pressure should be put on these people to take the lead during the ceasefire.  I cannot let this occasion pass without again referring to the strength of Gerry Adams, John Hume and the Government under former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, in their initial painstaking effort to bring about the peace.</P>
    <P>We expect that the British Government will try to adopt a more trusting approach than heretofore and use its <Col N="1791" /> influence to persuade the Unionists to join the process as part of the final component towards a lasting solution.  We can go around in circles with talks, but if we cannot bring the Unionists on board we will not reach such a solution. I call on the British Government and all our leaders to do whatever possible, North and South, to persuade the Unionists, be it at leadership or middle rank, to come to the table and, if nothing else, to listen to us.  It is the only way forward and the forum is the golden platform for that to take place.</P>
    <P>The British Government should also review the issue of Irish prisoners in custody in the UK, especially in view of the fact that we have been willing to release some of our prisoners.  A similar gesture by the British Government would be another movement on the road towards peace and reconciliation.  In addition, the decommissioning of weapons is another issue of concern and is a precondition to discussions.  While it must be on the table, the issue should not be as absolute as when the ceasefire commenced.</P>
    <P>The British and Irish Governments must also follow up on the Downing Street Declaration and the Framework Document with a clearly focused political and constitutional timetable to advance the issues with regard to constitutional change and relationships between the two countries.  It is important that we move forward and focus our attention on how best we can bring about constitutional change in order to achieve a long term settlement.</P>
    <P>The debate in the House today should indicate a unified approach to this issue. The improvement which has occurred in the past six months augers well for the future and for political co-operation between the two countries.  This was reflected in the visit last week by Prince Charles.  It was another indication of the process of normalising relationships and an acknowledgement that there is a mood for this process which we should always bear in mind.</P>
    <P>Parity of esteem is taking place and many submissions have been made to <Col N="1792" /> the forum as to how best cross-Border co-operation can be achieved with regard to tourism, trade and other areas. It is only when we start building up these links between the two countries that we will create more employment and better prospects.  We will also create a better relationship, which we have not had for the past 500 years.  This is a golden opportunity for all of us to work together as a united front, to hold the peace and to do everything we can to bring the Unionists on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Leader of the House and other speakers who have heaped praise on all those involved in initiating the whole process and who have continued to try to develop contacts and processes which were designed to bring about a lasting solution.  It is interesting to hear the views expressed in this House and the other House on this matter.  People have an incisive understanding of the difficulties in the North.  There is a greater understanding and greater sensitivity on this side of the Border towards the problems that exist, and their complexity is well understood. In this respect, debates in the House will not do any harm because people now approach the problem from a position of knowledge and they are showing a remarkable sensitivity towards the issue.</P>
      <P>We probably have a great expectancy, which is perhaps pitched too high.  We expect much political movement, and we expect it to happen very quickly. However, it is expecting too much to ask people to change their clothes entirely, move into a new situation and perhaps leave themselves open to losing their support.  People are naturally afraid of moving out of the positions they have traditionally held.  It will be a long time before this fear is worn down and before people get the confidence and the feeling that no matter how far away they move from their traditional positions, they will take their people along with them.  Indeed, it will probably happen that as time goes by, people will propel politicians rather than the reverse.</P>

      <P>I attended the Washington Conference along with a number of other representatives from the Oireachtas.  I was a bit cynical on my way to the conference in that I was expecting a kind of political send up with little substance.  However, I was most surprised and returned happy in the knowledge that it was an historic and substantial event.  This little country got an incredible amount of advertising across the USA as a result of the conference and of the very strong input from the political side in America.  The President, the Vice President and all of the &ldquo;heavies&rdquo; from his team attended the conference.  As a result it received incredible coverage on television and that alone was a great reward for us.  In addition, many business contacts were made and many business people were present, working very hard to make contact.  It is important that these contacts be followed up and that some job creation derives from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The underpinning of the peace process, whereby people see that peace is <Col N="1794" /> good and brings about prosperity, must be visible on the ground.  In this regard, is it appropriate that the kind of national policies we have established with regard to the sectoral areas should form the basis for investment in the Border counties?  We do not have control over the North, but we do have control over the Border counties.  Is it appropriate that such policies should be the guiding influence on the way investment is made in the Border counties? They are not.  We have special funding for the Border counties, and Northern Ireland development, because this region lagged behind development in the rest of the Ireland.  Given this, the two Governments, and especially our Government, should find a way of allowing local conditions in the Border counties to dictate the way the grant aid is applied.</P>
    <P>Take the tourism industry, for example.  Who would go on holidays to Beirut?  Nobody.  That is why there was such a small return from tourism in the Border counties and, indeed, in Northern Ireland over the last 25 years. Nobody wanted to go there.  It was a dangerous place.  We are being forced to follow a national policy with regard to the application of funds in the Border counties and that is quite inappropriate. Tourism and development would be much better served and development if the policies were tailored to suit the needs of the area.  I impress that on the Minister and I hope the Government will listen too.  If a body was set up to handle the funds in the Border counties and given a free hand more or less to set their own guidelines, we would achieve what I am looking for without any difficulty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to be in a position to make a small contribution to the debate today.  We had statements on the Framework Document in the House when it was published.  The document was well received, not just here but in the other House too.  It was generally well received by the vast majority of the people of Ireland, North and South.  The question now arising is what progress, if any, is being made to implement the findings and proposals of the joint Framework Document.  The two most significant events in the meantime were the Washington Conference and the visit of His Royal Highness, Prince Charles.  I will begin with the latter.</P>
      <P>It is easy to write off the visit of His Royal Highness, Prince Charles, as simply a personal or a token one.  We must remember that he holds a meaningful constitutional position in the UK system. He is the son of the monarch, who is at the apex of the pyramid that is the UK structure.  The United Kingdom, of course, does not have a written constitution; it is a constitutional monarchy. We should note the Prince's visit.  I am delighted it went off well.  In particular, he was received not so much in a formal but in a friendly way.  Frankly, the Prince and the British people may well have learned more about Ireland than we learned about Britain as a result of his visit.  The British people will have learned there is a feeling of peace, &ldquo;forgive and forget&rdquo; and moving on to the next business.  If that is the outcome of the visit and if there can be an increased normalisation of relations, it will help move the peace process along.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the Washington Conference, I am reminded of the fact &mdash; and I hope my colleagues will not laugh in any way &mdash; that Deputy Albert Reynolds, as one of the principal architects of the current peace movement, was always about business.  His vision was that business and commercial activity would be an impetus toward closer co-operation, North and South.  The Washington Conference was a good idea and it was obviously a successful conference.  It put business and commercial activity, the <Col N="1796" /> way we all make a living and manage to sustain ourselves, at the top of the agenda.  Of course, that is at the top of the agenda under normal circumstances.</P>
    <P>I read with interest the position paper which the leader of my party, Deputy Bertie Ahern, submitted to the conference. It contained three important proposals.  First, the IDA and the IDB in Northern Ireland should jointly market Ireland as a location for industrial projects and agree on specific targets for unemployment black-spots.  Second, priority development should be given to the Belfast-Dublin economic corridor; and, third, development agencies and business organisations should develop greater linkages between firms, North and South.</P>
    <P>It cannot be said often enough that the problem will not be solved by any grand, sweeping gesture, final solution or great document signed in ink, blood or whatever.  The solution will emerge through ordinary people co-operating in business ways.  If I can be a little critical of the Government, the wind appears to be leaving its sails.  I ask the Government to redouble its efforts and try to get the economic integration and co-operation to the level the architect of the process, Deputy Reynolds, would wish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to add my voice to the peace process that has continued since last autumn. I congratulate the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the rest of the Government for their efforts over the past number of months.  It has been a difficult time for the Government in the sense of holding the balance of the peace process and moving it forward without upsetting the balance of ideas or fears people have.  The latter is a major factor; it is always foremost in people's minds.  The Government and, indeed, the British Government are always conscious of this point.  While it is easy to criticise and say it is not moving forward fast enough in certain ways.  all reasonable people understand how important it is <Col N="1797" /> to hold that balance and move forward in a progressive way.</P>
      <P>The Washington Conference and the benefits that will flow from it are a welcome step along the way.  There is no doubt that the Irish people, in the North especially, have been known for their business and industrial initiatives.  Given the right atmosphere and opportunity, I have no doubt that will continue and add an overall dimension to the island. It will improve the lot of people, North and South.</P>
      <P>On the tourism front, the visit of His Royal Highness, Prince Charles, can only give the right signals to people, not alone in the UK but in the rest of the world too.  A vast number of holidaymakers had reservations about visiting the island and the Prince's visit erased those fears.  I compliment the Government, the security forces and everybody else who were involved in showing that normal circumstances prevail on the island.</P>

    <Title>Minerals Development Bill, 1995: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg) Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been prepared in response to legal advice to the present and preceding Ministers for Transport, Energy and Communications that certain gaps in the Minerals Development Acts, 1940 to 1979, should be filled as quickly as possible.  The main purpose of the Bill is to give specific statutory cover for certain long standing practices for renewal of minerals prospecting licences and for charging fees for applications for certain State mining facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second purpose of the Bill is to maintain an effective deterrence against illegal mining and other offences by updating the original penalties in the <Col N="1798" /> Minerals Development Act, 1940, and applying them to offences by companies and other organisations.  That Act already provided for offences by individuals.</P>
    <P>Since the detailed financial and explanatory memorandum published with the Bill deals with all provisions of the Bill in some detail, I propose to concentrate my remarks on the general background to the Bill and the reasons why, with the assistance of this House, the Bill should be enacted soon.  I shall also refer to the development of a national minerals policy, to which the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications is now giving priority attention.</P>
    <P>Since the Minerals Development Act, 1940, came into operation thousands of minerals prospecting licences have been granted by successive Ministers following public newspaper advertisements of the intention to grant the licence and consideration of any representations made.  Representations are very rare, which is hardly surprising given the responsible way in which holders of minerals prospecting licences generally go about their business.</P>
    <P>Many of these licences were renewed, in some cases a number of times, by successive Ministers in good faith, including hundreds of licences currently in force.  The long standing practice of renewals and successive renewals has not given rise to any difficulty or challenge. However, legal advice has drawn attention to the lack of statutory provision for licence renewals and put the case that fresh licences should have been granted after the term of the original licence expired.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there is a pressing need for legislation to validate all renewals to date and to specifically empower the Minister to renew any of those licences and any other licences granted in the future where the Minister considers that renewal is justified in the particular circumstances of each case.  Clearly, without the legislation now proposed to effectively safeguard the <i>status quo</i>, there would be considerable disruption <Col N="1799" /> to the renewal process for all concerned. Sections 2 to 4 of the Bill refer.</P>
    <P>I draw the attention of the House to section 2 (d) which, in the interests of transparency, imposes the same obligation on the Minister to publicly advertise the intention to renew a minerals prospecting licence as applies in all cases when such a licence is proposed to be granted for the first time.</P>
    <P>There are currently 431 minerals prospecting licences in force of which about 300 would fall due for renewal in 1995 and the rest would fall due for renewal in 1996 or later.  The Minerals Development Acts, 1940 to 1979, require the Minister to give details of minerals prospecting licences in force in a twice-yearly report to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Minister's report for the six months to 31 December 1994 was presented to this House and to Dáil Éireann on 2 February 1995.</P>
    <P>The essential focus of minerals prospecting activity is to identify as quickly as possible all commercially viable deposits which could be developed.  All holders of minerals prospecting licences are encouraged to undertake minerals prospecting in a very active and systematic way.</P>
    <P>Renewals of minerals prospecting licences are considered strictly on a case by case basis.  Thus, whether the licence will be renewed in a particular case will depend, first, on whether the licensee seeks renewal of the licence.  About 100 licences are surrendered each year by licensees, some of whom seek licences for other areas perceived to be more prospective.</P>
    <P>If renewal is sought, the exploration and mining division of the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications would give particular attention to actual performance to date by the licensee, including the submission of required work reports, whether all of the other conditions of the licence have been complied with and whether the undertakings given by the licensee have been honoured.  If actual performance to date was satisfactory, the licensee <Col N="1800" /> would have to enter into a commitment to undertake a specific further programme of exploration in the area in question before renewal of the licence would be agreed.  If, however, actual performance was unsatisfactory, the licence would not be renewed.  Indeed, if the circumstances warranted it, the licence would be revoked before its term expired.  Hence, licence holders are encouraged to perform.</P>
    <P>Geologists from the exploration and mining division of the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications closely monitor exploration activity and conduct many site visits throughout the State.  Licensees are obliged to give to the division at least two weeks advance notice in writing of proposed borehole and shaft sinking to a depth of more than 20 feet below the surface and to obtain the division's written approval at least 20 working days in advance for proposed trenching operations.  These requirements provide opportunities for the division's geologists to conduct particularly focused and detailed site visits, the outcome of which could have a direct bearing on whether the particular licences in question or other licences held by the particular licensee ought to be renewed.</P>
    <P>In short, the exploration and mining division of my Department maintains close liaison with licensees with a view to encouraging them to explore thoroughly for commercially viable deposits and to bring forward sound development proposals as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>A special incentive to encourage minerals exploration in unexplored ground was announced by the Minister in conjunction with the annual May licence competition.  The ground in question represents over 400 licence areas, or about one half of the total licence areas in the State which have never been explored or have not been explored for at least four years.  The incentive takes the form of a reduced fee of £1,000 for a six year licence as compared with the standard fee of £2,500, and less onerous work and expenditure requirements <Col N="1801" /> than apply to explored ground.  The incentive has been welcomed by the minerals industry as an attractive one.</P>
    <P>Subject to meeting the requisite technical, financial and environmental criteria, and certain specific procedural requirements where privately owned minerals are involved, a successful licensed minerals prospector would be favourably considered by the Minister for the grant of a State mining facility. Every encouragement is given by the Department to licensees at minerals prospecting stage to work assiduously so as to identify commercially viable deposits for development.</P>
    <P>The Department also assists licensees in identifying as early as possible all steps needed to be taken by the licensees to secure the necessary permits for the development from the relevant authorities, that is the Department itself, the relevant local planning authority and the Environmental Protection Agency.  The Department works closely with other permitting authorities in order to ensure that applications are comprehensively and speedily examined by all concerned, having due regard to the specific and separate statutory code applicable to each of these authorities.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, as national licensing authority for mines, must ensure that all proposals for mine development are thoroughly and expertly examined before permission is granted to proceed with them.  The Minerals Development Acts, 1940 to 1979, specifically require the Minister to satisfy himself or herself that the public interest would be served by the granting of a State mining lease or licence in any particular case.</P>
    <P>There is no question of rubber stamping any mining proposal from any developer. The Minister must ensure that valuable national minerals resources are effectively and efficiently developed and State revenues therefrom assured. In addition, in accordance with the obligation on each Minister to protect the environment, the Minister must also be satisfied before permitting the development of national minerals resources that <Col N="1802" /> the development will cause as little harm as possible to the environment.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1994, SI No. 86, stipulate that the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications must receive a copy of the environmental impact statement, prepared by the developer of any mine project, at the time the developer submits an application for planning permission to the relevant planning authority. Staff of the Department's exploration and mining division and of the Geological Survey of Ireland, which operates under the aegis of the Department, are directly involved in examining all proposals for mine projects.</P>
    <P>In the case of small mine projects, involving minerals such as coal or industrial minerals generally, the engagement of external consultants would not usually be necessary.  In the case of larger mine projects, however, the Minister needs the best possible independent external advice so as to address properly all the key issues arising.  This is particularly so in cases involving base metals, such as the major proposed zinc lead mines at Galmoy, County Kilkenny, and at Lisheen, County Tipperary, which would have major infrastructural and financial considerations as well as possible implications for the environment.</P>
    <P>The Minister requires the best mining practices and also minimising, if not avoiding, all possible long term negative effects of the mines if they were to proceed. This means that the Minister has to call for advice upon suitably qualified and experienced external consultants from relevant disciplines, notably mine and mine plant engineering, hydrogeology, chemistry and geostatistics, which have the required international standing.</P>
    <P>Due to the small number of mines in the State, independent expert advice of the required level would not ordinarily be available within the State, except perhaps in relation to some limited aspects of mine projects.  Where applications for a State mining lease or licence are successful, the practice has <Col N="1803" /> been to recoup handling costs as part of the fees for the State mining facility for the project.  There is no mechanism in place to recoup handling costs necessarily incurred by the Minister in considering applications which turned out to be unsuccessful or are later withdrawn for any reason.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill is designed to fill the gap in the Minerals Development Acts, 1940 to 1979, by specifically requiring all applicants for State mining leases or licences to pay an appropriate application fee.  As heretofore, that fee will be kept as low as possible, consistent with a thorough independent assessment of each individual application.  No two mineral deposits are the same and hence neither could two mining projects be the same.  As amended by Dáil Éireann, section 5 requires the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to make regulations in order to specify such fees from the date on which the Bill becomes law.  Thus, for the future there will be a transparent and flexible mechanism for specifying such fees and for quickly revising those fees if required.  Such regulations will be subject to standard review by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>These new arrangements represent a very considerable improvement on the <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements which applied heretofore.  The Minister proposes to specify the following application fees in regulations to be made under section 5 of the Bill: metalliferous minerals, such as zinc, lead, etc, £15,000 plus 10p per annual tonne of the design capacity of the mine.  The greater of £15,000 or 50 per cent of the total fee will be payable on application and the balance within six months of application.  For other minerals, such as gypsum, calcite, dolomite or dolomitic limestone, etc, the application fee will be payable on application: (i) £5,000 if the design capacity is less than 100,000 tonnes per annum; (ii) £10,000 in other cases.</P>
    <P>The need to legislate for renewal of mineral prospecting licences and for application fees to be charged for State <Col N="1804" /> mining facilities provides the opportunity to legislate also for updating the original penalties in the 1940 Act for a variety of offences.  The penalties have become derisory through the fall in the value of money.  The offences relate to illegal working of minerals, obstruction of authorised persons and failure to provide required information to the Minister. Clearly, there is continuing need to deter would-be offenders by having updated penalties which can be applied specifically to offences committed by individuals, whether acting alone or behind a corporate veil.  Sections 6 and 7 of the Bill refer and will allow the courts to impose penalties fitting particular offences and circumstances if such arise in the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications is determined to ensure that, with the proper application of modern technology and mining techniques, the mineral resources of the nation will be developed with proper safeguards for the environment.  These are national assets which must be developed responsibly so as to achieve the maximum benefit in terms of job creation, increasing national wealth and underpinning industrial growth.  It is vital that every effort be made to locate all commercially viable mineral reserves and, having done so, to bring them into production as efficiently as possible. The aim is to support as strongly as possible the principle of sustainable development for the benefit of the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>The recent report with recommendations of the national minerals policy review group will provide an important input into the development of a sound national minerals policy for the future. The report and recommendations are being examined by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications as a priority.  Each Member of the Seanad and Dáil received a copy of the report on publication, on 12 May 1995. The Minister and I look forward to receiving the considered views of Members and to a wide ranging and overdue public debate so as to help <Col N="1805" /> shape national minerals policy for the future.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House does not prejudice in any way the fundamental review of national minerals policy and the Minerals Development Acts, 1940 to 1979, which is underway following publication of the review group's report. On the contrary, the Bill is required to fill as quickly as possible important gaps in the Minerals Developments Acts which the Minister's advisers and those of his predecessor have identified.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, which will have a relatively quick passage through the House.  This area has been extremely important to the economy in recent years.  I am sure people, particularly those in the midlands, recall the magnificent contribution of mining in terms of the creation of jobs and the wealth of Counties Meath, Westmeath, Louth and Kildare&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Mining has created an enormous number of jobs in the midland counties of Meath, Westmeath, Louth and Kildare.  When the discovery was made at Tara Mines in 1970, it brought welcome employment to the area.  Young Irish men started the mining industry in Ireland in the late 1950s and the early 1960s before they emigrated from the midlands to Toronto, Vancouver, Winnipeg and other parts of Canada.  They all returned and used their expertise in the development at Tara Mines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report to which the Minister referred mentions the new minerals policy and some eminent names, such as Mr. Michael McCarthy from Loughrea, <Col N="1806" /> County Galway, who is a legend in the mining business.  He and others, including Mr. Pat Hughes, went to Canada, worked in the mining business and created their own exploration companies. As a nation, we owe a great deal of gratitude to these pioneers who went to Canada in the 1950s in search of employment, came back with their wealth and helped to build a sound mining business, which we now know as Tara Mines, in County Meath.  While the various sections of the Bill and the points made by the Minister are relevant, they would not be so without the personnel behind them.  I know these people at first hand and I admire the way in which they have worked so hard to get themselves off the bottom.</P>
    <P>It is only fair that I should point out I hold 71 Arcon shares.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>That is hardly a declaration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>That should be put on the record, as there is another Member of this House present who also has an interest in this matter.  It is only fair that I should declare this interest, although only a small number of shares are involved.</P>
      <P>There were 700 exploration licences available in Ireland about five years ago.  Why has this number now been reduced to 400?  Is it because there is not that much interest in it, or is it that all of the country has been researched to such an extent that only the high possibility areas are left to be explored? I know that there was a high expectation of finding minerals in my own areas of Moate and Knocknavalley in the 1970s.  We also thought that there would be a big mineral find in Barrymine and Ballinalack, but we were told that there was too much hard stone between the product and the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The poet Boone said that &ldquo;There is a goldmine in the sky&rdquo;.  It is a goldmine that many people seek.  This is an exciting adventure, to say the least.  There are enormous risks involved in this area and I know of many friends who did not <Col N="1807" /> have pleasant experiences in this regard. The report of the National Minerals Policy Review Group recommends that 100 per cent capital investment could be written off in this venture.  I can well imagine the intention behind that.</P>
    <P>The report stated:</P>
    <P>It is strongly recommended that the State adopt a positive pro-active National Minerals policy so as to maximise the contribution that the Minerals Industry can make to the national economy and employment, while ensuring that the highest standards of environmental protection, health and safety are maintained.</P>
    <P>Those of us who are members of local authorities will know that environmental impact studies have to be taken even for the smallest project if there is a chance that it could be a hazard or cause any sort of environmental problem, and that is only right.  This would be certainly the case for those of us who have witnessed the long and tedious application in regard to Galmoy over the last number of years.  It is good and healthy that these matters are teased out and there should be no bad repercussions. When those who invest heavily come into an area, take the minerals from the earth and then leave it in an unsatisfactory state, that is not in the best interests of the environment.</P>
    <P>I commend the Department, who have built up a bank of expertise in this regard over the years.  I know that it got considerable help from these eminent gentlemen, especially during the Hughes era, and it was able to bring in the top geologists from around the world and the expertise to help them with the various projects that came on stream.</P>
    <P>The greatest mineral success of all was the Kinsale gas find, which has meant a lot to our economy.  It has helped us to make great savings on our fuel imports over the years and has made Ireland that much more self-sufficient as far as our energy costs are concerned. This country was practically <Col N="1808" /> brought to a standstill by a petrol strike a few years ago, which had nothing to do with the Government or the Department at the time but was due to forces outside our control.  The more exploration licences that can be granted and the greater the encouragement that can be given to people to invest some of their funds in these explorations, the better.</P>
    <P>When it comes to a challenge, the Irish can face up to it and take their chances.  One only has to look at the great successes that we have had in various fields over the last number of years, particularly in those of business, politics and sport, to see that.  When it comes to exploration, we are as good a race, if not better than most, in taking a long shot with the high risks involved.  The penalties the Minister is proposing definitely needed to be updated.  The main reason Parliament exists is to update and create new legislation when it is badly needed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and look forward to its speedy passage here today.</P>

      <P>It has an inverse proportion to the wealth of Senator Cassidy and myself.</P>
      <P>It has been an extremely uncomfortable experience to hold so many shares in Arcon.  Although I have not changed them very much for a while, it is a reflection of the status of our mining industry that a share of that sort, which has proven assets under the ground, has been consistently declining.  It is not, as the Minister might say, necessarily a reflection of the price of zinc or lead worldwide but of the atmosphere in which these mining companies have to operate within this country that the share price of a solid company of that sort is continuing to deteriorate. Senator Cassidy's shares are worth about £14 at this stage, mine are about £14,000.  It is important that the Minister, while addressing this Bill, which he says is a technical one, should also give us some indication of the Government's view of the Irish mining industry.</P>
      <P>I remember a time when the Minster and his colleagues in the Labour Party would have said that these assets belong to the Irish people and that was that.</P>

      <P>The language and rhetoric have changed and so have the policies. While I gather that everybody approves of this Bill for reasons which are probably political rather than matters of conviction, it would be appropriate to ask why the Minister is always the licensing authority.  The Bill assumes the approval of everybody in this House that the Minister will give renewals as well as imposing the level of fines and the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to go over old ground but, as everybody in this House knows, there was a difficult controversy recently on the Arcon issue which involved a Minister.  It would have been easier for everybody concerned if the Minister had not been involved.  There are so many authorities in this area that it seems wrong, or certainly questionable, <Col N="1811" /> that a political figure should be the final arbiter of a mining licence or of its renewal.  That creates difficulties for those involved in the mining industry and for the political figure himself or herself.  It would be better and more appropriate if this final decision was taken out of the political arena and given to those who are qualified experts in this area.</P>

      <P>I have had time to read it in the last hour and I would have thought that somebody in the Department would have been able to give an indication of the response of the Government to the document, which is, after all, in mild language a fair old <Col N="1812" /> indictment of Government policy on national minerals over the last 20 years.</P>
      <P>The document's message about a new policy is that the minerals industry does not live in a sympathetic environment here.  That is not just the result of socialist rule over a period in the 1970s and the 1980s, it is the result of consensus politics about minerals which is now outdated.</P>
      <P>It is worth looking at some of the recommendations and hoping that the Minister takes them into account when he is considering the problems of this industry and future mining policy.  While he is hampered by past ideologies, I know that he is maturing and is leaving those behind him in the new coalition which is working so well.</P>

      <P>You would have approved, Senator Cassidy.  Let me look at one or two of the measures which have happened in the last few years.  The 20-year tax holiday was withdrawn in 1974 and was a clear message to some of the multinationals that Ireland was not quite such a welcoming environment as it had been in the past.  After that we had what this document calls a series of minor successes, but there were no real commercial successes in the exploration industry here.</P>
      <P>There was a great deal of hype in the offshore industry in the 1980s, which to some extent created and developed the notion that exploration amounted to gambling by people who were in it purely for speculative purposes.  While that is understandable, it is not necessarily the truth.  A great deal of speculation is involved, but at the end of the day if there is solid lead, zinc or base metals of any sort under the ground they should be brought up and the people who are prepared to take those risks should be encouraged to do so by the Government.</P>

      <P>As a result of this, from 1981 to 1986 the loss of the multinationals meant that exploration declined and there was very little expenditure in this area.  Some capital was put in, but base metal prices fell in that period thus creating an atmosphere which was unhelpful to exploration.  Then what this document calls junior exploration companies entered the Irish market because the multinationals had retreated.  We had companies which I remember so well in the Stock Exchange, companies like Burmin, Emex and Arcon itself, which was Conroy in those days.  Like many others they scored minor successes but did not achieve any commercial success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was great excitement when gold was found in the Sperrins, but none has been commercially developed. Unfortunately, when other discoveries were made by small companies they either did not have the capital or the <Col N="1814" /> incentive to develop them and so they were abandoned.  It is a fair indication of the difficulties facing the mining industry here that Arcon, which made its discovery in 1986, is still not producing lead from the ground.  That is a tragedy for many people involved, not only the owners but also for the potential employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>It sends out the wrong signals to anybody else thinking of coming into the mining industry in this country. Senator Maloney will deal with this far more eloquently than I can, but the reasons for the delays in granting mining licences are, supposedly, all environmental. The environment must be protected from cowboys who come in and destroy it, and I commend all Governments for what they have done in this area.  However, there are so many people who have their finger in this mining pie &mdash; so many authorities, groups, boards, county councils and others who can stop mining at one stage or another &mdash; that it is difficult for those who are taking these risks to justify them to their shareholders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In terms of the Arcon development there was Kilkenny County Council, the Department, the Mining Board, An Bord Pleanála, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Minister.  Off the top of my head I can think of those six hurdles which have to be gone through, not just for environmental qualifications but for planning qualifications as well.  Whereas the criteria which are being used are certainly laudable and commendable and no one would have any quarrel with them, there must be a quicker way of getting through this process than a nine or ten year procedure.  Everybody has a great deal of sympathy for the residents and farmers of Galmoy and other places who felt, and still feel, threatened by what is happening on their doorstep.  If a decision has to be made &mdash; and there are other interests involved as well &mdash; all I ask the Minister for is a more <Col N="1815" /> speedy procedure; not to change the standards in any way but to develop a procedure which would mean that a planning application and an environmental impact study of this sort do not have to go through quite such stringent&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and long-winded procedures as they have done in the past. The Bill is a highly technical one, which still seems to be, in large part, unnecessary. Will the Minister tell the House whether this Bill will give retrospective approval to grants of licences which were renewed illegally?  This is my understanding of some of the Bill &mdash; that, in effect, renewal was being given without a legal basis, so that it has to be put on a statutory basis now.</P>
      <P>Finally, on a general point, indigenous mining companies have tended to stop exploring in Ireland.  That is a tragedy for this country.  Companies such as Kenmare Resources pie, Glencar Explorations plc&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and many others have tended to go overseas to other countries like Ghana, Pakistan, Mozambique, Russia and other such places.  Bula Resources plc has gone to Russia.  That is a direct result of the fact that we are not giving enough encouragement to our mining companies to develop the resources here.  They are finding a more sympathetic atmosphere in other undeveloped countries elsewhere.  I ask the Minister to take this into account when he is considering future mining policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  I had a tradition of trying to drop words of Latin into speeches.  I have run short of them in later times but there is a lovely one <Col N="1816" /> that applies to this issue and it is: <i>obesa non cantava.</i>  In case our Latin has slipped a little, that means &ldquo;The fat lady has not sung yet&rdquo;.  It is appropriate to this debate because, having listened to Senator Ross, this is not the end of the road.  I support this Bill, though I cannot in all honesty say that I welcome it.  The fact that a patching-up Bill like this is found to be necessary is symptomatic of the unsatisfactory way that the minerals development issue has been handled down through the years.  We have a national block in our minds about developing our natural resources and particularly about developing mineral resources.  I am sure we have that national block from our school days.  I can remember &mdash; by the looks of things I am older than everybody else in this Chamber &mdash; Eleanor Butler's geography, which stated, if I remember correctly: &ldquo;Ireland has little or no mineral resources of its own&rdquo;.  We all believed that back in the 1940s.  We have been proved not to be correct&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a great old time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but we grew up with this national block that we did not have resources and we therefore developed a mentality that was not to be encouraged. That attitude and misconception has dogged our approach to minerals development all these years in the existence of the State.  The result is that we have a much smaller minerals industry than we could have had if we had taken a more aggressive entrepreneurial approach.  We did take that entrepreneurial approach back in the 1960s when those who came back from Canada &mdash; I am thinking of people such as Mr. Pat Hughes and Mr. Matt Gilroy &mdash; said that they wanted to settle in Ireland. They had this belief that there might be mineral wealth in Ireland and wondered if they could be encouraged to look for it.  They got encouragement, the entrepreneurial discoveries occurred and we ended up with some successful enterprises in that area.  No industry worth £100 million a year and <Col N="1817" /> employing thousands of people is insignificant in our economy; but the tragedy is that it could have been much bigger and better.</P>
      <P>It was that thinking that led to the setting up of the review group on national minerals policy and I welcome, as Senator Ross does, its recent report.  We had that mental block, but it was the belief that it could be a bigger mineral industry that got the review group to examine the possibility.  I hope that this report will be the first step towards a new way forward, a way by which we could properly exploit our mineral resources for the first time.  However, I am not convinced that the review group's report adequately recognises the need for a strong entrepreneurial role in the State's involvement in this sector.  Let me make clear that I am not suggesting the State should itself get involved directly in mineral development, even as the holder of an equity stake in mines.  The State's role, as I see it, is to encourage and to stimulate mineral development by others.  Even though its role should be one of stimulation and encouragement, that role needs the entrepreneurial streak.  It needs the spark of entrepreneurship that is required.  I am not sure that we will ever provide that spark with the kind of administrative framework we have at the moment and that is being proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review group suggested that we should transfer the responsibility for minerals development to the Department of Enterprise and Employment, but I question whether any Government Department can be the right place for that.  Perhaps what we need is a more independent autonomous body than a Government Department.  I had the pleasure in the late 1970s and early 1980s of being involved, when a similar sort of suggestion was made about the Department of Post and Telegraphs, in the setting up of An Post.  The establishment of Telecom Éireann took place at the same time.  It was exciting to see what happened when the fetters of a Government Department were <Col N="1818" /> removed from those organisations.  Perhaps there is a case for a minerals development agency, staffed not only by technical experts but also by entrepreneurs. The remit of such an agency could range beyond that of pure regulation and the handing out of licences. It could also be given an overtly entrepreneurial brief and be charged with the task of maximising the potential of our mineral resources by whatever means were most appropriate to the occasion, but not extending as far as entering the business itself.</P>
    <P>I am not one in favour of expanding and proliferating State bodies, but in this case we have a task that is not being done adequately within existing structures and it is questionable whether it ever could be.  Back in the 1970s, when the Dargan report suggested something similar for Post and Telegraphs and proposed that the existing structures were not suitable for development &mdash; they were mainly talking about telecommunications &mdash; the Government of the day grabbed hold of it and within months set up interim bodies to face up to that challenge.  Perhaps we should look at something along that line now. It is also a task, as the money provisions of the Bill show, that can be self-supporting. There is no reason why a minerals development agency should cost the State a single penny.  I hope the Minister will take this into account, give it some attention and will, perhaps, be able to take the first steps in that direction on Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>

      <P>My understanding is that, under Standing Orders, reference should never be made as to whether a Member is present.  Senator Ross made a schizophrenic contribution, as if in reality there was a group of entrepreneurs out there who were willing and able to exploit the mineral resources of Ireland when, of course, historically the opposite has always been true.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn may be incorrect in relation to Members' ages, because I remember Seán Lemass in the 1960s and the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement. If the trade union movement was reluctant to move with the times, they got lessons from the employers.  They were terrified to come out from behind the tariff wall put up by the Government, so they could not market anything but just sell and collect.  They did not develop any markets because they had a captive market.  The biggest obstacle to free trade at that stage was the so-called Irish entrepreneurial class.  When we then entered the Common Market we encountered much the same situation. Senator Ross is quite incorrect in saying that if only the Government would get out of the way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was going to say that Labour is the Government but that is for the future.  Yesterday in this House we discussed the importance of trade and tourism to this country with the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg.  People visit this country because of its environment, its rivers and hills &mdash; the whole ambience of Ireland is about the environment, which is why people come here. When Senator Ross talks about removing the fetters of Government from the mining industry, he is asking for a recipe for total disaster in respect of the environment. <Col N="1820" /> Giving people an unfettered right to seek minerals at any cost to the rest of the community or the State is a recipe for madness and would be rejected by any sensible Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that entrepreneurs should be encouraged to develop the mining industry and whatever minerals we have in a sensible and structured way which constitutes the least damage to the environment.  However, I have no doubt that that requires not just Government regulation but also constant appraisal by the Government of the macro value to the country of allowing mining to take place wherever minerals are discovered.</P>
      <P>The image conjured up of mining is probably of Klondyke or the Australian gold rush and massive wealth, which sometimes happens.  However, the dry hole is more often the case and people lose substantial amounts of money.  In that context I never had a problem, and neither did the Labour Party, in relation to the exploitation of not just minerals in the ground but also of oil under the seas around our coasts.  We never had a problem with encouraging companies or individuals to exploit the resources or whatever could be found around the coast.</P>

However, we took the view that Irish oil should be essentially owned by Irish people and that while its development should reward the risk taker, the main beneficiaries should be the people of Ireland.  I had huge reservations about the Irish becoming the Arabs of the early part of the century&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>One more point which I would like to make in the light of the Irish entrepreneurial spirit is that when the mine in Tara was being developed, Bula then came on stream.  There was then a massive legal battle &mdash; ongoing, as far as I know &mdash; about the ownership of the lode under the earth.  That had enormous consequences for the development of mining and the creation of employment, and it is nothing short of a disgrace that it was allowed to drag on for many years without resolution.  If that joint body had been developed we would be talking about smelters and very substantial downstream industry, but it never came about because greed became the predominant emotion as far as the so-called entrepreneurs were concerned. They were more concerned with grabbing the lot than developing it on behalf of themselves and the Irish people.</P>
      <P>As has been said, the Bill is essentially a technical one, but it gives us the pleasure or the pain of roaming over the whole mining industry.  As Senator Quinn said, it is a substantial employer, which employs a couple of thousand people in mining itself and there are also many ancillary jobs.  I do not wish to comment too much on the Bill as it is technical legislation and none of us is that competent to judge whether it is necessary, but one presumes that it is. Unlike Senator Ross, I have faith in the good will of the Government to only bring forward legislation when it is necessary and desirable to so do.  Perhaps, we will part company on that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I hope that we meet in heaven as we seem to be meeting so often in this environment.  I am sorry that Senator Magner is on his way out of the Chamber because I was going to make some brief comment on his robust defence of the Labour Party and the interests of mining in this country.</P>
      <P>I come from a unique area, the Arigna valley.  My late father had a letter from the present Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, who was Minister for Energy in the short lived 1982 Government.  Perhaps I am getting my Tánaistes mixed up, in that I know that Mr. O'Leary was also Minister for Energy during the three Governments of the 1981-82 period.</P>
      <P>The correspondence centred around the establishment of a second coal mining power station on the shores of Lough Allen to complement the existing station which was burning crow coal from the Arigna mines and providing over 300 jobs.  Following successive geological surveys, it had been established that on the other mountain overlooking Lough Alien, Sliabh an Iarainn, there were, and still are, millions of tons of a form of crow coal with a high ash content. At that time it would have required quite complicated technology to extract the quality coal from the ash. The ash content comprised 60 per cent, which is very high, and would require a form of open cast mining.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a great deal of agitation right through the 1970s and early 1980s. When Labour came into Government during that period, it was in the forefront &mdash; Senator Magner has, once again, robustly defended its policy &mdash; of defending and nurturing our natural resources.  The initiative by Mr. O'Leary, and, subsequently, by Deputy Spring, was welcomed by the people in my part of the country.  The letters are still there to show that there was a commitment given that there would be a second power station built which would secure the employment of that area for considerable decades to come.  The <Col N="1824" /> Leas-Chathaoirleach will know about this better than most because he, like myself and many of our colleagues, was involved in a political context in the eventual decline and fall of the Arigna mining industry.  That is no longer the case and mining is no longer a major industrial employer in that part of the world.</P>
    <P>This Bill and the report on a new minerals policy have probably come a little too late for the people of Roscommon, Leitrim and parts of Sligo.  The die is cast.  The power station is closed and the mining industry and its expertise, such as it was, have been scattered to the four winds although there are still millions of tons of crow coal lying unexcavated in the Sliabh an larainn mountains.  The Labour Party has always offered the robust defence to the public that it, like Sinn Féin and Fianna Fáil &mdash; I am not sure of Fine Gael's position on this but it probably is the same &mdash; has a policy of developing our natural resources.  That commitment from the national parties rings rather hollow for the families in the Arigna valley.</P>
    <P>The Minerals Development Bill, 1995, is a technical measure whose main purpose is to give specific statutory cover for certain long-standing practices, for renewal of minerals prospecting licences and for charging fees for certain State mining facilities.  It is an upgrading of the first mining legislation enacted in 1940.  Since this Bill was initiated and debated in the other House, the Minister has published the report of the National Minerals Policy Review Group, which was set up by my colleague.  Deputy Noel Treacy, when he was Minister of State with responsibility for Energy in the last Government. The Minister of State referred to this towards the end of his contribution. Like Senator Ross, I am somewhat disappointed that only one paragraph of the Minister's speech is devoted to the National Minerals Policy Review Group's report.  I appreciate that his focus was on the specifics of the Bill but I would have expected a little more than <Col N="1825" /> the platitudes he expressed in his comments in this regard.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to my friend and colleague, Deputy Treacy, for his foresight in acknowledging that there was a major need for streamlining and establishing a clearly defined public minerals policy. The recommendations of the review group make interesting reading.  I am sure this debate will provide the Minister with an opportunity to explore &mdash; if he will excuse the pun &mdash; the salient points of this important document.  I am particularly impressed with one of the major recommendations of the report &mdash; that minerals development should be actively promoted in Ireland and that all county councils should be made aware of the mineral resources in their area and the role that they can play in the overall development of their areas.  The report also points out that minerals do not feature as part of industrial development at local or national level.  It states that the recent national development plan does not mention minerals.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the report's reference to the county councils.  I am sure my colleagues who are members of county councils will enthusiastically endorse this recommendation, particularly at a time and in an environment in which local councils are under severe threat from what is not so much a democratic deficit as a power and financing deficit.  It is initiatives such as this which should be encouraged by Government. A greater amount of this developmental role should be devolved to local authorities.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that mining requires a specific expertise that might not always be available to local authorities. However, the report makes a number of suggestions in this area.  I was surprised to learn from the report that there is no mention of minerals in the national development plan, although the Minister will no doubt correct that situation in his new office.  This is not necessarily an implied criticism of the present or previous Governments &mdash; many county development plans also do not consider <Col N="1826" /> the role that minerals can play in the development of local industry.  As Senator Quinn said, there appears to be a considerable absence of urgency or awareness at national and local level of the importance of mineral development in this country.</P>
    <P>I am impressed with the review group's suggestion that the Geological Survey of Ireland should provide information packages for use within central and local government, combined with briefings and seminars on relevant topics. It is a focused and specific area of expertise which is not always available to local authorities, so the role of the Geological Survey of Ireland in this regard should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>Surveys and excavations have been carried out on the Cavan-Leitrim border, particularly around Blacklion, which traditionally has produced high levels of gypsum.  As a youngster I was enthralled by the massive transports of the Canadian mining firm which has worked these deposits on and off over the last 40 years.  Massive trucks and lorries with huge tyres came trundling through the small town of Drumshanbo at all hours of the day and night and they were quite intimidating.  They were also impressive and gave the appearance of activity in an area that had suffered great economic decline following partition.  However, these activities ran independently of any input from the local councils.  In that regard I hope the Minister will act speedily on the second recommendation of the National Minerals Policy Review Group and create an environment in which county councils can play a leading role in mineral development.</P>
    <P>The Minerals Development Bill, 1995, comes into law at a time when mining exploration, both onshore and offshore, is at an all-time high.  There are currently almost 500 mineral prospecting licences in force, of which about 300 fall due for renewal this year. This clearly indicates that there was a need for a statutory measure to protect the State and the applicants in the unlikely event of any of the parties <Col N="1827" /> seeking legal redress, although the Minister has pointed out that all licences from 1940 to date were renewed by successive Ministers in good faith, including hundreds of licences currently in force.  It is a matter of public record that this long-standing practice of renewals and successive renewals has not given rise to any difficulty or challenge. Clearly, however, this state of affairs could not be allowed to continue in a modern environment, where litigation now seems to be the first option rather than an instrument of last resort.  The experience of other countries, where there is, perhaps, a more developed mining structure, is that litigation between companies and governments is the order of the day.</P>
    <P>I wish to echo the views of my colleague, Deputy Treacy, who said that he cannot understand why this Bill is being introduced so quickly as the mandate of the National Minerals Policy Review Group was for such a short period and its report has been with the Minister since the end of last year.  I realise that the publication date was May and I am not suggesting that it was available at the end of last year.  However, the mandate of the policy review group was to report by the end of the year.  From the time that the report would have reached the Minister's desk to its publication date to now is more than just one month.  I appreciate that the Bill was initiated in the other House in March, but I have not been able to ascertain whether the report was with the Minister at that time.  I am anxious to learn why it was felt necessary to introduce this Bill at this time.  Even if the Minister clarifies the time space between the drafting and initiation of this Bill and the review group's report, I still fail to understand, as a number of colleagues in both Houses have mentioned, why it was believed necessary to introduce this legislation at this time in the context of the request for an overall review of our national minerals policy.  This is not by way of opposition to this legislation; it is purely an inquiry.  I suggest it might <Col N="1828" /> have been a better use of the legislative process if the Minister had stayed his hand and introduced this purely technical measure as part of a wider minerals Bill incorporating the recommendations of his own policy review group.</P>
    <P>During the tenure of the last Government, the Arcon controversy emerged, the fallout from which reflected little credit on some politicians in Leinster House.  Deputy Treacy states that the application of Arcon Mines Limited was the last mining licence granted by the former Minister and his Department and that both he and the then Minister, Deputy Cowen, were deeply involved in this application and left no stone unturned to ensure that every detail pertaining to it was fully considered.</P>
    <P>Deputy Treacy feels rightly aggrieved, and I echo that view, that no one on the Government side has to date acknowledged publicly that both he and Deputy Cowen were always motivated by hard work and dedicated effort to ensure that the resources in the southeast of this country would make a major contribution to local, regional and national economic development.  I have no wish to go down the well-trodden road of the Arcon controversy. However, there is a long-standing practice in this House when one Administration takes over from another.  Yesterday the Minister of State publicly acknowledged the work of his predecessor on the Tourism Bill.  This might be a timely opportunity to acknowledge the work of those two public servants during that controversy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Treacy also raised the question of consultants in the application process and this has been dealt with in the Bill.  I would like to be assured by the Minister that his Department will not be obliged to employ unnecessary outside consultants.  I ask him to acknowledge that there is sufficient expertise within the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications to process in a professional manner any mining application or renewal.  The Minister touched on this in his speech and is obviously somewhat sensitive to <Col N="1829" /> suggestions that there may be an unnecessary waste of public money.</P>
    <P>The Minister went to some lengths to explain why he believes it may be necessary from time to time, depending on the complexities of the application, to bring in outside consultants.  It is a valid request that there would not be any unnecessary employment of outside consultants.  We are plagued in this country with consultants, consultancies, the theory of consultancies and the concept of consultancies.  We have more consultants than we have lawyers, doctors or even politicians.  Of course, they have a role, but sometimes consultants take on a much more enhanced role than that which was originally envisaged for them.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to clarify the position relating to section 5 of the Bill which deals with application fees.  My understanding is that there is currently a long-standing practice, which is not enshrined in law, to charge a nonreturnable handling fee.  This fee can sometimes be as high as £200,000 where the application is for a mining lease or licence.  I am grateful for clarification on this point.  The Minister outlined the regulations under which he intends to introduce the fees following an amendment in the other House.  However, I share the concerns expressed elsewhere that a handling fee of this proportion might be a disincentive to mining companies. I appreciate that the figure I mentioned probably only applies to large mining companies dealing with zinc or lead.</P>
    <P>I would be grateful if the Minister outlined whether there is any hope of mineral discovery offshore under the current round of licences.  I note that Aran Energy is active on the western seaboard off County Galway, where the use of modern technology has enabled that company to probe deeper into our waters in a cost effective manner.  They are hopeful, according to press reports, that they can produce oil in sufficient quantities to make it commercially viable.  Can the Minister assure the House that he is satisfied that of the <Col N="1830" /> almost 500 mineral prospecting licences currently in force in this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was not given an indication at the outset.  I am almost finished, if the Chair will indulge me.  I ask the Minister to assure the House that he is satisfied that, of the almost 500 mineral prospecting licences currently in force, the applicants are active in exploring their franchise areas and not retaining these licences to prevent other companies from coming into Ireland.</P>
      <P>I reiterate the call for more comprehensive legislation in the area of mineral development.  There have been some notable onshore successes, but despite the odd offshore success &mdash; Senator Ross also referred to this &mdash; the last 30 years have been spectacularly uneventful. Ireland has had a disappointing record in mining exploration.  Senator Ross referred to the euphoria &mdash; he may not have used that word but I will &mdash; which greeted the Kinsale Head discovery in the mid-1980s.  There were several false starts in the mid-1980s which set off a boom in mining shares, but this has considerably dissipated in recent years.  Many people were badly burnt after buying shares in a hole in the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has not been any significant development of oil off our shores; yet there was a great mood of euphoria in the early 1980s when many licences were handed out in the early rounds.  I am not suggesting that the Minister tell us that oil will be discovered off the south-east or south-west coast or in Kildare.  However, is there any information available to his Department that would give us some cause for optimism in that regard?  I accept this type of <Col N="1831" /> exploration is not an exact science, but can I be assured by the Government that it will treat mineral exploration more seriously than previous Governments did in the past?</P>
    <P>A start was made by my colleagues, Deputies Cowen and Treacy, in setting up the National Minerals Policy Review Group.  The Minister has the group's report now and he has acknowledged that.  I hope the high standards set by Deputies Cowen and Treacy will be continued by this Government.  I commend the Bill and agree with the sentiments expressed about the objectives to be attained by this Bill.  I wish it well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister back to the House and the opportunity to address this important Bill and discuss the implications of mining.  The Bill will provide a solid legislative basis for our mining industry.  Exploration requires considerable investment by corporate bodies, who may never receive any dividend from it.  For that reason, it must be encouraged.</P>
      <P>The Bill deals with areas which are not included in the Minerals Development Acts, 1940 and 1979, such as the renewal and successive renewal of mineral prospecting licences, application fees for State mining leases and licences and offences by corporate bodies such as companies and other organisations.  It is important that we address this issue so that the bodies that may be affected by such developments know their exact position if they offend.  The Bill also increases the penalties for a variety of offences &mdash; for example, obstruction of authorised officers and unlawful mining provided for in the 1940 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has not been a great deal of mining in recent years, hence the lack of pressure to introduce changes.  In my own county no mining has been done since the 19th century and at that time it was for iron ore.  A number of years ago there was some discussion about uranium in the Fintown area, but that was quickly stopped.  Many mining licences were granted by Ministers since <Col N="1832" /> 1940 and it necessary to safeguard the renewal and successive renewal of these licences.</P>
    <P>This Bill gives statutory effect to the long-standing practice of requiring applicants for State mining licences to pay an appropriate fee to cover the Minister's cost in considering applications. Most Members will agree that considerable expenditure is necessary for the professional expertise required to examine mining industry proposals. In the case of a major complex mine project, external consultancy services could cost up to £200,000 and it is important that the State is protected from having to cover such costs.  The Bill also provides an opportunity to strengthen the law to protect both State-owned and privately owned minerals by increasing the original penalties for offences provided for in the 1940 Act and applying them to offences by corporate bodies.  Under existing law only individuals are covered.</P>
    <P>We have an obligation to protect our environment while making full use of our natural assets.  Mineral ores should be fully developed to create jobs, to contribute to gross domestic product and to take on a pivotal role in industrial growth.  The Bill obliges the Minister to protect the environment and he must be satisfied that any proposed development would cause as little harm as possible to the environment.  A full environmental impact statement will have to be prepared and submitted to the Department in this regard.</P>
    <P>The safeguards already in place for mining licences include penalties if the site is not explored after a licence is granted.  Since November 1994 the terms applicable to prospecting licences include an obligation on licensees to undertake an approved programme of work for each of the three two year periods and to submit a work report for each period.  This will ensure that licences are not used to freeze prospective sites.  If developers are granted licences to explore hundreds or perhaps thousands of acres but fail to do so others who may wish to explore such <Col N="1833" /> lands are prevented from doing so.  This legislation will at least ensure that developers are obliged to carry out the works within a specific period.</P>
    <P>Our mineral sector has suffered because of Europe's recession but recent recovery provides an opportunity to increase employment.  I welcome the Minerals Policy Review Group report. This report has identified the contribution of the mineral industry, both directly and indirectly through job creation, to the national economy. People will be surprised at the extent of this contribution.  We must evaluate the potential for downstream industrial development using Irish mine production and review the international competitiveness of Irish mining.  Developments to date will prove that we are one of the most advanced countries in this regard, particularly in the context of Tara mines.</P>
    <P>Investment that involves the creation of additional jobs should be considered with an open mind.  We have not always reaped the benefits which the investment of large amounts of funding would bring to this labour intensive area.  We must also examine the potential and associated costs of a more aggressive approach to the promotion of Ireland as a favourable location for mineral exploration and the energy or energies best suited to undertaking such promotions. For that reason it is important that the Minister strikes a fair balance between protecting the environment and encouraging people to explore while being conscious of environmental legislation which would make such exploration almost impossible.  We must also review the provisions of the Mineral Development Acts, 1940 to 1979, with particular reference to the extent to which the financial terms of State mining facilities should be standardised and published and the State's role under the 1979 Act.</P>
    <P>Protection of the environment must be top of the agenda in all of this. Because of the difficulties which have arisen in recent years local authorities have had to employ experts in environmental <Col N="1834" /> protection.  Ground water in particular must be protected because that is the only source of drinking water available in rural Ireland.  In many places it has been proved that ground water sources can easily be polluted, for example, by sumps and septic tanks. When the rock is cracked and a substance seeps into the ground water source, it is practically impossible to stop it.  For that reason the local authority must be the monitoring body with total responsibility for exploration.  It is not right that the company doing the exploration should be the watchdog.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recommendations in the report to delegate certain powers to local authorities.  The local authority must be informed in advance about what a company intends to do and when.  That can be done by notifying the planning officer and arranging meetings on site to ensure that what is being done is in the interests of everybody and also in the interests of protecting the environment; nor can the fisheries board be ignored, because of its interest in the tourism industry because if we allow our lakes and rivers to be affected it would do great damage to the industry.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works has a major role to play because it identifies the archaeological sites throughout the country.  In most areas where mining has taken place this can be clearly seen.  For that reason the Office of Public Works must be informed in advance because there would not be much point in a company identifying a mine and then being prevented from mining at a later stage for archaeological or other reasons.  There must be a co-ordinated approach to the exploration.  Somebody must do the co-ordinating and the local authority, which has the knowledge of the area, the expertise and the staff, should play a central role in protecting the environment in the context of mining and exploration.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It will go some way towards dispelling the fears that exist.  It will also encourage people to invest and explore.  We have a long way to go to overcome our long term unemployment <Col N="1835" /> problems and there is no greater way than by encouraging highly labour intensive industries such as mining. This industry employs many people directly and the benefits of such employment to the local economy are immeasurable.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is not particularly important in the overall context of the importance of the mining industry in Ireland and its future developments.  It deals with the validation of licences and technical matters but it affords an opportunity to discuss in broad terms the whole development of the Irish minerals industry and future policy in that regard.  I wish to put on record our appreciation of the very valuable document which was published in April of this year, <i>A New Minerals Policy</i>, which is the report of a committee set up by the Minister's predecessor.  Deputy Treacy.</P>
      <P>We have not exploited our natural minerals or our other natural resources to the greatest extent possible.  Many people question the wisdom of exploiting our mineral resources, mainly because of a lack of knowledge of the industry and of the contribution it can make, both in terms of employment and the revenue which can accrue to the national economy.  This Bill affords us an opportunity to draw the attention of the public to the importance of the Irish mining industry for the economy and to the necessity of revitalising our national minerals industry, thereby creating further employment opportunities and revenue for the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity for discussion presented by this Bill.  Like Senator Mooney, I wish to see far more comprehensive legislation before the House soon which would enable us to create the kind of climate favourable to the development of one of our natural resources.  The Minister has the very onerous task of bringing forward, as soon as possible, legislation along the lines suggested in the report.  The report <Col N="1836" /> highlights the need for a new national minerals policy with clear objectives, clearly setting out lines of responsibility.</P>
    <P>Some developments which have already occurred are favourable to the development of an Irish minerals policy. In the forties and the seventies we enacted progressive mining legislation; for example, we established the Environment Protection Agency.  Because of legislation passed within the last few years this agency can carefully monitor and assess the industry and ensure that the proper safeguards are put in place to protect the environment.</P>
    <P>I fully endorse the view expressed here that the environment is very important and must be protected.  To a large extent the mining industry has been seen in the same light as interpretative centres in relation to heritage matters. Mining has been seen as a danger to the environment and a problem area that people should keep away from. This is not the real situation.  With specific environmental safeguards in place it will be possible to have a viable development of the mining industry, which would enhance its contribution to employment and to the economy.</P>
    <P>I agree with the view expressed in the National Minerals Policy Review Group's report that it is necessary that county councils are made aware of the mineral potential in their jurisdiction. Mineral development in my constituency, County Clare, has largely been confined to a few initial tests, which were done in the late 1950s and early 1960 in relation to oil exploration.  A well was bored in Doonbeg a few miles from where I live.  At the time there were great expectations, but they did not fully materialise.  Nevertheless, there is still a view that there are sufficient resources there to look again at that site.  The Minister might direct the attention of his officials to the exploration area near Doonbeg, which was abandoned 20 years ago.  Because of the change in circumstances since then it might now be a valuable resource.</P>
    <P>There were also some indications of a gas find at that time.  A few years ago <Col N="1837" /> Gerry O'Neill, a businessman from Ennis, was involved in an attempt to carry out further explorations in near Mullagh in west Clare.  Apart from those two instances most of the interest has centred around east Clare, near O'Callaghan's Mills, Killaloe and Scariff. A few licences have been issued, mainly to individuals and small companies interested in calcium, calcite and other minerals.</P>
    <P>There has never been a great awareness in County Clare &mdash; in the local authority, in business circles or in the Shannon development company &mdash; in relation to what may be valuable mineral resources, especially in east Clare. For that reason I endorse the view of the review group which suggests that local authorities should be made aware of this.  I suggest that the Minister avail of the opportunity to draw the attention of local authorities to the reports, which are produced every six months.  I was not aware of that until I made inquiries at the Department recently.  These six monthly reports give some detail, although not as much as we would wish. We would like to see some results from the exploration which has taken place in east Clare in the past 20 years.</P>
    <P>The IDA, in particular, should pay attention to the opportunities and the prospects for creating enterprise and developing employment, which could be achieved from some of this work.  I am not sure if the IDA has a mandate in relation to mining and exploration but if it has, it is sparingly used.  The failure to attract foreign investment seems to be a handicap to the development of the mining industry.  The IDA and the Shannon Free Airport Development Company might direct their attention in that regard to see if it could be integrated into their overall industrial promotion and activity drive.</P>
    <P>We must understand that failure to exploit our mineral resources is a failure to exploit our natural resources.  We have failed to fully exploit and develop not only our mineral resources but also some of our marine, agricultural and other natural resources.  The Minister <Col N="1838" /> should avail of this opportunity to outline EU policy in relation to mining.  I am not sure of anything is being done in this regard.  As we approach our Presidency of the European Union, we might take the initiative and ensure that in any efforts to revitalise our small mining industry, we avail of EU funding to enable work to be done in that regard.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty with this technical legislation.  From my inquiries, I am certain that issues about which I was concerned are already covered.  I was worried about safety on sites.  Like the environmental protection legislation, we have enlightened safety in industry legislation and a safety authority has been established.  Safety issues are fully catered for, although not perhaps in this legislation.  A fine of £5 for failure to comply with the regulations should be increased because even fines for parking offences are higher.</P>
    <P>The Minister should push ahead with the significant work done by his predecessor. If he can make a dynamic impact in this dormant industry, it would be widely welcomed because it would create more revenue for the State and more employment opportunities.  As regards my county, will the Minister indicate whether the exploration licences which have been in operation there for the past 20 years are yielding any results and if we might strike gold?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill, while of a technical nature, is nonetheless an important and urgent measure aimed at filling gaps in the statutory framework for mineral prospecting and development. The three purposes of the Bill are to make express statutory provision for a renewal of minerals prospecting licences and validate licences renewed to date since enactment of the Minerals Development Act, 1940, in effect, to give statutory cover for the <i>status quo</i>; to secure procurement of costs of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications in considering applications for State mining leases or <Col N="1839" /> licences under the Minerals Development Acts 1940 to 1979, whether the applications are successful; and to update the original penalties for offences under the Minerals Development Act, 1940, to the new maximum set out in section 6 and apply the increased penalties to offences by bodies corporate so as to deter would be offenders and to protect minerals, State owned and others, from illegal workings.</P>
      <P>A number of Senators made points with which I will deal.  Senator Cassidy asked why there was a drop-off in the number of licences held between 1980 and 1990.  That is explained by the mad gold rush which occurred and the holding of 300 gold prospecting licences, which came to an abrupt end when the former Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy, revoked the gold mining licences for my native county of Mayo and Croagh Patrick and approximately 300 licences were handed in shortly after that; I do not have the exact figure.</P>

      <P>That is why a high level of goldmining licences were issued at that stage.  There has been steady progress in the number of applications and in the roll-over and turnover of licences since that time.  The introduction of the special licence for unexplored ground &mdash; with a fee of £1,000 compared to the normal £2,500 &mdash; is also having the desired effect.  There are 400 licences available under that scheme.  Another Senator suggested that the reduction in the number of licences was the fault of socialists but I do not think Deputy Molloy would fit into that category by any stretch of the imagination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ross asked why the Minister is the final arbiter.  He complained about the number of possible bodies that an applicant had to go through to get a final decision.  It is not much different to the normal planning procedure. There is a very good reason for the required, detailed planning procedure <Col N="1840" /> for mining.  This arises from a situation where it is known that mining, if not properly handled, can be very detrimental to the environment on a permanent and lasting basis.  It is highly desirable that the Minister, who is democratically responsible to the people and the Houses of the Oireachtas, should be the final arbiter.  It would be a major democratic deficit if some quango or other body, not democratically responsible, were to have that power.  I will not be seeking a move away from the situation where the Minister has authority to issue licences.  Deputy Ross also inquired about&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Senator Ross also inquired about the position of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, on the report. This has been referred to repeatedly.  I will quote from the Minister's press release from 12 May:</P>
      <P>The Minister is committed to giving urgent and careful attention to the 52 Recommendations in the Report and would, therefore, welcome comments as quickly as possible.  The Minister's intention is to seek Government decisions on those Recommendations as soon as that consultative process has been completed.  Those Recommendations have not been considered in detail by the Government and, therefore, publication of the Report is not an endorsement of those Recommendations or acceptance of the costs of their implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the Government's position.  This new report was put before Government in April and published in May.  There should now be a reasonable period of consultation before it goes any further. A number of speakers asked why this Bill is being introduced now and why the Government did not wait for the report, the consultation and a full policy review in that period.  The report was submitted to the Minister in April 1995 <Col N="1841" /> and was published on 12 May 1995.  The Bill now being dealt with was initiated by Deputy Cowen prior to those dates. This is simply an urgent response to legal advice received at that time.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn asked why the State was involved and what was its exact role.  The State's role is that of a facilitator, encouraging development and enabling people to exploit their licences and mineral rights.  At the same time the State ensures that there is a balance between that exploitation of minerals and the needs and interests of others, including the environment.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney suggested that I should publicly acknowledge the role of my predecessors in this area.  I did that in the Dáil during the debate on this Bill.  Deputy Cowen and Deputy Treacy, as Ministers in the Department, were directly involved in initiating the Bill and setting up the review group which has now presented its report.</P>
    <P>A question was also asked about the hiring of unnecessary consultants.  I want to assure the House that no unnecessary consultants will be hired. With regard to fees, these are pitched in proportion to the size and complexity of the mines involved.  If, for example, the output of a mine is 1 million tonnes per annum, the fee for that scale of mine would be £100,000 plus the £15,000 fixed fee.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney also inquired how activity by licence holders was ensured. I dealt with that in some detail in my opening remarks.  I do not think it is necessary to report that.  Senator Mooney also downgraded, somewhat, our activity and success in discovering offshore oil and gas.</P>

      <P>I would like to inform that House that in a recent round of licensing all the major players have been attracted back and awarded licence blocks in the Porcupine Bank.  I do not wish to push up the price of shares by saying this but there are very real expectations <Col N="1842" /> that oil will now be found there in exploitable quantities and will be brought ashore in the relatively near future.</P>

      <P>Senator Daly raised a number of questions concerning the situation in County Clare.  Clare Calcite has recently applied for planning permission for a calcite mine.  Clare County Council has made its decision on the application but the Environmental Protection Agency has yet to consider it. However, that application is progressing. I will bring the Senator's points concerning Doonbeg to the attention of my officials to see if that matter can be further activated.  I agree that local authorities should be informed about the six-monthly report and any other information they might require.  For some reason, the remit of the IDA does not extend to mining and mineral processing.  Senator Daly recommended that the IDA'S remit should be extended and that will be considered in the examination of the review.  EU mining policy is only involved in gathering information but, arising from recent developments in Austria, Sweden and Finland, there is a possibility that a new policy will be developed in that regard.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, there is no opposition to the Bill or amendments coming forward in the House.  It is a technical Bill to meet the urgent requirements of legal advice given to my predecessors which is now being acted upon.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
