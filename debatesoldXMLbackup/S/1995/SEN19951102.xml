      <P>I have notice from Senator Fahey that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Justice if she is aware that Garda strength in Galway city is down by 22 since January 1994 with at least a further five retirements by January next; and if she will outline the number of Garda appointments she now proposes for Galway city and the timescale for those appointments.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Cosgrave of the following matter:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Justice if she is aware of the delay in her Department in granting a visa to a person (details supplied) who has been granted a work permit and is expected to commence employment shortly.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator McGennis of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to make a statement regarding the delay in the transfer of <Col N="98" /> the corporation housing stock and landbank to the three new Dublin local authorities.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator R. Kiely of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Social Welfare to establish the number of people claiming social welfare benefits fraudulently.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Mulcahy of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health to make a statement on the proposal by the Eastern Health Board to locate a drug rehabilitation unit in Weir Home, Cork Street, Dublin 8, and the anxiety that this proposal is causing residents of the home and local residents in the area and on the location of drug rehabilitation units generally.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Fahey's and Senator Cosgrave's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is items 6, 1 and 2.  Item 6 is merely procedural in that the Progressive Democrats wish to withdraw a Bill from the Order Paper.  The proposal in relation to item 1 &mdash; Statements on Education &mdash; is that the Minister will speak for not more than 15 minutes and the first speaker from each group for not more than ten minutes with five minutes for each speaker thereafter.  At 12.10 p.m. the Minister will take questions in accordance with the procedure which operated on previous occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Item 2 will commence at the conclusion of item 1 and there will be no sos.  There is wide interest in the Statements on Education.  Although Members have the right to use the <Col N="99" /> Order of Business as laid down, I appeal to them, unless they have something of great consequence to say, to curb their enthusiasm to ensure there is as much time as possible available to those who wish to participate.</P>
    <P>Item 17, motion 23, in the names of the Progressive Democrats Senators deals with the governance of the universities. I would like to be clear on where we stand on that.  I was approached to have a debate on this motion rather than on what was ordered today.  I did not agree to that because it was not what the House had indicated to me previously.  I have no difficulty in having a debate on that motion or on the amendment I have put down.</P>
    <P>I gave an undertaking last evening to the leader of the Progressive Democrat group that I would amend the motion so that it became a substantive motion.  I have done that.  I also undertook to make time available not later than the end of the next three weeks.  It will not be taken next week but it may be the week after and will not be later than the end of the next three weeks.  That is a very reasonable proposal.  I will also circulate copies of the briefing notes given to all Government Senators yesterday as a basis for that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to record the Fianna Fáil party's appreciation and gratitude of the way in which the business of the House was ordered yesterday by the Leader.  We on this side of the House appreciate that party politics are set aside from time to time.  You displayed leadership qualities and I thank you for the way in which the business was handled yesterday on the sudden death of Deputy Brian Lenihan</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened carefully to what the Leader said to me today and yesterday.  Yesterday, he said to me that as soon as proposals were published there would be time for a full debate on the matter of the governance of Trinity College, Dublin, and the autonomy of the colleges of the National University <Col N="100" /> of Ireland.  I did not regard that as a firm enough commitment and I still regard what he said this morning as not being specific enough in terms of the timing. Accordingly, I wish to move an amendment to the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>That a minimum of two hours be given to statements on education; that item 17, motion 23, be taken at the conclusion of item 1; with each speaker to have ten minutes and the Minister to take a question and answer session before the motion is put.</P>
      <P>This morning, there is another spin in the national newspapers on this matter. We have been given a succession of information &mdash; if that word could be used in the context &mdash; through the columns of the national newspapers.  This is the forum in which these matters should be debated and not the columns of the national newspapers.  It should be particularly debated here because the founders of the State thought third level education was so important that members of that sector should be directly represented in this House.  We now have the complete reversal of that situation where the State wants to be represented in the universities and to virtually control them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I am putting the point to the Leader.  We meet on Wednesday afternoons and on Thursdays &mdash; there are others days in the week when we could quite easily meet.  I do not see the difficulty about dealing with this matter and this is the forum where it should be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difference of opinion between the Leader and Senator Dardis on what was agreed informally on how we would approach this.  In the interests of peace and avoiding an unnecessary vote this morning we should have a comprehensive discussion on education this morning and not focus on one individual point.  The points made by Senator Dardis are crucially important in terms of third level education and all the independent Members feel they should be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Leader has given me an absolute commitment that this issue will be dealt with separately.  I would prefer to have two bites of the cherry &mdash; one today on the general issue of education and another one later.  In the interests of peace, I also recognise that there are particular political reasons for a demand <Col N="102" /> to have that debate at an earlier date. While I understand that a specific date cannot be indicated at this time, I appeal to the Leader to give a commitment to the House that it will be dealt with within the next fortnight.  That is enough time for everybody to examine what is still a live issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave an undertaking to some people last night to raise the concern of a number of people in Cork about the incident involving a doctor there.  In relation to the self regulatory position of the Medical Council and other professions, I ask the Leader to initiate a debate in this House on the principle of self regulatory bodies and how they serve the public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise on foot of an undertaking from the Leader yesterday on an issue I raised on the Order of Business in the context of the peace process and in reference to the media reports, which I hope are untrue, of the imminent breakdown of the peace talks between Sinn Féin and the British Government.  The specific issue is the signing by the Irish Government yesterday of the convention on the transfer of prisoners and the indications that the British Government is not prepared to accept the jurisdiction of this State which is prepared to accept 30 republican prisoners into our prisons.  There seems to be a logjam which is obviously critical to the ongoing peace talks.  In that context, I once again ask the Leader if he could give the House any information on what is going on and if the media reports are accurate.  Would it be possible for the view of the Minister for Justice to be accommodated whenever Northern Ireland is debated in the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader find out the current status of the equal status Bill, which is a very important item in the legislative programme and which we have been promised?  I know there have been difficulties but I would like a very firm commitment that we will have an <Col N="103" /> equal status Bill before the end of this Government's term.</P>
      <P>I am particularly interested in the matter referred to by Senator Dardis. However, as I said yesterday, given that six Members represent university constituencies, it would be good politics to discuss this matter with those whose constituencies are directly affected by that.  I am also concerned that I did not receive the briefing document on this subject as of yet, although my colleague, Senator Henry, did.  Perhaps she has some political influence which is beyond my scope.</P>

      <P>A question for the Leader.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to ensure that all of us are kept as informed as possible.  While it would be a pity to limit the discussions with the Minister this morning, there is a tradition on this side of the House that, whatever about the substance of the issue, we, as a matter of respect for parliamentary democracy, stand for a vote if one is called.  I shall certainly act on that principle if the Progressive Democrats call for a vote, despite the fact that it rankles somewhat that this matter was raised and pushed so vigorously without consultation with the university Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>While I agree with the spirit of the Progressive Democrats' motion on the universities, the Leader has stated that we will have this debate. The whole House, and not just the six Independents, should be consulted. Position papers have been forwarded to the heads of the universities.  If we got those papers immediately, we could have an informed debate.  The Leader and Senator Fitzgerald, as members of a governing body, would have an input to this discussion.  As a graduate, I am very concerned and would welcome a debate on this matter but we need only wait two weeks.  It would be pointless to have the debate today because we do not even have the relevant papers.  We <Col N="104" /> should get the position paper immediately and then proceed with the discussion.</P>

      <P>I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his comments.  Yesterday was a special day and the House reflected the enormous sense of loss and great depth of feeling for our late colleague. The House did so with dignity and in a fitting manner.</P>
      <P>I undertook to convey Senator Mooney's views to the Government and I will do so.  As the Senator knows, other things happened yesterday.  I will ascertain for Senator Norris the current state of the equal status legislation.</P>

      <P>Both I and my predecessor in this position have always been reasonable in dealing with requests from the House.  We always kept our word.  I said this morning that this motion will be debated within three weeks and earlier if I can arrange it.  I will not be forced to give a date which I might not be able to keep for a variety of reasons when I have given a reasonable timeframe within which this motion can be taken.  If it can be done within two weeks, it will be done within two weeks.  I have never broken any word I have given to the House, no more than any Leader of this House has done.  If I say the debate will be held within three weeks, it will be held within three weeks.  If it is possible within two weeks, it will take place within two weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question raised by Senator <Col N="105" /> Magner is worthy of discussion and I will see if it can be arranged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the House for the honour and opportunity to discuss an issue that we all recognise as central to the economic, social and cultural wellbeing of our children, our fellow citizens and our country as a whole &mdash; the subject of education.  During my time as Minister for Education, I have come to appreciate at first hand the sheer scale and complexity of our education system, and the complex ways in which the system is geared towards meeting the needs of our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, of course, a heavy responsibility on the Government to ensure that available resources within the educational system are properly aligned towards meeting the needs of students and society.  Change, renewal and <Col N="106" /> reform must be ongoing.  There must be a continual input of energy on the part of all of the education partners if the system is to retain its relevance and if young people are to be properly equipped with the capabilities and skills they need to enhance their own personal development and to meet the needs of society in all its rich dimensions.</P>
    <P>By mobilising all the talents and energies within our education system, I am confident that we can bring about meaningful changes for the betterment of all our people and students of all ages in a lifetime of learning.  At this time of unprecedented change in our education system, it is worthwhile to take stock of the positive achievements to date.  This year saw the publication of <i>Charting our Education Future,</i> the Government's White Paper on Education, in which principles and priorities are clearly identified and in which the agenda for further progress in reforming our education system is laid out.  Our priority &mdash; increasing the standards of education available to all sections of the community &mdash; underlies all the programmes now under way in my Department.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate to begin our discussion with the primary education sector which is the bedrock upon which the education system is built.  The primary sector plays a major role in determining children's life chances and the benefits derived at this level are key determinants of the extent to which the individual citizen participates in society throughout her or his lifetime.</P>
    <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have made significant improvements in the primary school sector, giving it a new focus in line with the principles set out in the White Paper.  Among the most important achievements are improved pupil-teacher ratios, significant reductions in maximum class size guidelines, increased capitation grants, increased grants for school books to assist needy pupils and a massive investment in capital for the improvement of school buildings. However, there can never be complacency <Col N="107" /> about the current state of our education system.  Change and renewal must be ongoing and the White Paper lists several priorities for further progress in the primary sector.</P>
    <P>There is the new expanded role for parents which incorporates in a real way the constitutional position of parents as the first educators of their children.  A renewed emphasis will be placed on literacy and numeracy in primary schools to help tackle all serious numeracy and literacy problems in early primary education. The revised primary school curriculum being prepared by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, building on the significant strengths of the existing curriculum, will put in place a rich and diversified programme to provide children with the widest possible range of educational experiences.</P>
    <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education I have attached a particular priority to addressing the needs of children with disabilities and children from disadvantaged backgrounds.  The report of the special education review committee in 1993 represented the most comprehensive examination of the special needs area ever undertaken in this State.  The findings of that committee provide a comprehensive agenda for the future.  While the measures set out in the While Paper in relation to special educational needs provide the framework for the future, significant progress has already been made on many fronts. This includes significant increases in the number of special resource teachers and the rates of special capitation funding to special schools and schools with special classes.</P>
    <P>We all know that the earlier the intervention to address the educational effects of disadvantage the better.  I have initiated the Early Start pre-school project as a pilot project in selected areas of disadvantage to introduce young children to an educational programme which will enhance their overall development, prevent school failure and <Col N="108" /> offset the effects of social disadvantage. The Early Start service is now available in 40 locations.  The project is a well researched and high quality intervention which will help the Government in its drive to combat educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>Arrangements are in place for the introduction of a programme of relationships and sexuality education in all our schools.  A number of groups, representative of the partners in education, are currently working on the details of the implementation of this programme.</P>
    <P>The education system is currently undergoing major reform, involving extensive curriculum development and restructuring.  Bringing these initiatives to fruition depends on supporting teachers in managing change and facilitating their professional and personal development.  The White Paper lays significant emphasis upon providing appropriate in-career training and development. The Government is committed to an expenditure of almost £40 million on in-career training over the period 1994-99 for first and second level teachers, and special training programmes will also be developed for parents and boards of management.</P>
    <P>Education objectives at second level seek to promote the right of each student to full and equal access, participation and benefit from educational provision, in accordance with each student's ability.  The junior cycle programme seeks to extend and deepen the quality of students' educational experience. The availability of the option of a three year senior cycle for all students entering second level education from 1994 onwards and the restructuring of the senior cycle to cater more effectively for the needs and aptitudes of all students provide the framework for achieving this objective.</P>
    <P>Among the achievements made in providing for high quality second level education over the past few years are increased <i>per capita</i> school grants; special grants for pupils in special classes; increased provision for the free <Col N="109" /> book scheme for needy pupils; major improvements in pupil teacher ratios and equipment grants for disabled pupils.  Major reforms are underway in the second level curriculum, including the restructuring of the senior cycle.</P>
    <P>In keeping with the other developments taking place, such as the greater devolution of authority to boards of management and education boards and the increased professionalism of school staff, a new system of inspection is being developed by my Department's inspectorate.  Inspection in the future will focus on the work and management of the school in its totality. The underlying purpose will be to improve the quality of education in schools and, in addition, to provide appropriate information to the community served by the school, to school management and to the regional and central authorities.</P>
    <P>As promised in the White Paper, I propose to bring forward legislation dealing with education boards as a matter of priority.  This will put administration of the education system at primary and second levels on a modern footing.</P>
    <P>The present system for central administration of schools originates from a time when national schools were first established in the last century.  Given the scale, complexity and maturity of our education system in the 1990s, there is now the opportunity of looking afresh at the administrative arrangements with a view to optimising the flexibility, quality, relevance and accountability of the educational system.  The demands for increased accountability from the system, deriving from the foregoing considerations, and the commensurate increase in resources devoted to education, are placing severe strains on an administrative model designed for another time, when education was but a modest undertaking for the State.</P>
    <P>The potential benefits of the regionalised approach to education provision have come to be recognised by many of the major partners in education. A round table discussion among <Col N="110" /> all the partners in education advanced the process of ensuring that education boards will contribute to better educational provision across the following broad areas: enhancing quality of education; facilitating an effective partnership among all those with an interest in education at national, regional and community level; realising national objectives in education, such as equality of access and relevance to the needs of the community in an effective way; eliciting a broad level of acceptance from those within the regional remit of the board and reflecting the diversity of the school system; promoting transparency in education, particularly in regard to resource allocation; and enhancing public accountability.</P>
    <P>In addition, education boards will contribute in a crucial way to the development of the further and adult education sectors.  These sectors are now recognised, nationally and internationally, as key contributors to social and economic well being.</P>
    <P>I am now developing the education board proposals as a matter of priority, in accordance with the policy direction set out in the White Paper, so that the benefits of the reformed arrangements can be felt at the earliest possible date. I look forward to the continued co-operation of all the partners in education in progressing this important initiative.</P>
    <P>The establishment of Teastas, the Irish National Certification Authority, represents a major commitment by the Government in its efforts to ensure a coherent framework which will facilitate access and progression by individuals through a structured system of graded educational and training qualifications. It will allow progression from basic attainments and qualifications, right up to advanced degree level.</P>
    <P>The establishment of Teastas is evidence of the Government's commitment to the facilitation of life long learning. Life long learning should focus on the learning opportunities and processes of the individual.  The European year for life long learning to which Ireland, during its Presidency in particular, will <Col N="111" /> make a significant contribution, will aim to mobilise all the forces which will contribute to providing our citizens with the education and training to help them find their place in the new world that is evolving and to forge their individual destinies during the course of their lives.</P>
    <P>The past 30 years has seen an extraordinary growth in higher education in Ireland.  Thirty years ago only one student in ten proceeded to higher education, then provided solely by the university sector.  Now, by contrast, approximately two thirds of leaving certificate students proceed to further or higher education.  Of these, one third enter the universities, one third enter the regional technical colleges and one third enter further education, mainly post leaving certificate courses.</P>
    <P>I have taken a number of steps since coming into office to provide more places, more buildings and more facilities in all third level institutions.  Thus, funding of the universities since I became Minister for Education has increased from £137 million to £179 million, an increase of more than one third in three years.  Even more dramatic has been the increase in grants for the running of the regional technical colleges, up from £86 to £132 million since I came into office, an increase of more than one half.</P>
    <P>This increased funding has facilitated a major expansion in the number of third level places.  In the universities, since I came into office, the numbers have risen from 48,000 to some 56,4000, an increase of more than one sixth.  In the regional technical colleges, the numbers have increased from 32,000 to some 37,800, again an increase of more than one sixth.  In the last three years alone, some 14,200 additional third level places have become available to our young people.</P>
    <P>In addition to these places, I announced in mid-September the provision of a further 6,200 places in the university sector over the next five years.  These places will be allocated among the seven universities and will be <Col N="112" /> funded by a combination of public and private funding.  This is the first time that public and private funding has been used in this way and it marks a new departure for third level capital development.</P>
    <P>Increases in recurrent grants have been matched by increases in capital funding.  Under the 1994-99 national plan, more than £120 million, at 1994 prices, will be spent on improved facilities and buildings in third level institutions. The programme is targeted at 23 separate third level institutions and I am pleased to say that a number of the new projects, involving an expenditure of approximately £36 million in 1995, have already been commenced and others are at an advanced stage of planning.</P>
    <P>The year 1995 marks a watershed in the development of higher education. For the first time, we join the mainstream of European education in having higher education available to full-time undergraduates without payment of tuition fees.  This is an achievement of extraordinary significance and brings higher education centre stage.  It demonstrates in the clearest way possible that higher education is for all, without barriers of income, social status or family background.</P>
    <P>The abolition of full-time undergraduate tuition fees has been achieved at minimal cost to the State by linking it with abolition of covenant tax relief. The highly regressive covenant tax relief which meant that high earners gained more has been replaced by the abolition of tuition fees.</P>
    <P>In addressing the issue of legislation for universities the White Paper notes the conclusion of the report on the National Education Convention that &ldquo;third level institutions are difficult to manage and require constant reappraisal of management structures and functions&rdquo;.  It also refers to the commitment to a broadening of the composition of the governing bodies of universities which arises from the Government's decisions on the implementation of the Culliton and Moriarty reports. <Col N="113" /> The aim of this broadening of representation is to provide wider representation from society and the economy and for staff and students.</P>
    <P>There is also a commitment to gender balance in the composition of the governing bodies.  The White Paper makes a commitment to bring forward legislation concerning the composition of governing bodies, the restructuring of the National University of Ireland and more comprehensive provisions relating to autonomy and accountability, diversity and enhancement of developmental roles.</P>
    <P>There are no proposals to interfere with the academic freedom of the universities. On the contrary, the legislation as proposed would strengthen academic freedom by giving specific statutory expression to it in the principles underlying the legislation.  The principle of proper institutional autonomy is also given expression in the principles. The universities would be free to run their affairs as they see fit, within broad budgetary and staffing constraints.</P>
    <P>The Department has engaged in extensive consultation with the university heads, in their personal capacities, in preparing the draft Universities Bill. Several potential areas of disagreement have been resolved and this aspect of the consultative process is not yet complete. This will be followed by the publication of a position paper.</P>
    <P>I also established the steering committee on the future development of higher education to advise me in relation to the development of the sector well into the next century.  I have secured Government approval for a joint public and private sector funded capital programme to provide an additional 6,200 places over the next five years.</P>
    <P>Ireland's development is now linked in an integral way with the development of Europe.  This poses no threat to our national identity.  Rather, it offers significant opportunities for growth and development in the broader European context.  In the education sector, <Col N="114" /> Ireland's commitment to the European ideal is manifested in its active participation in a wide range of European education programmes and its development partnership with the European Union, through the Structural Funds, designed to promote economic and social development.  The Community Support Framework, through the operational programmes for human resources development, tourism, industrial development and local, urban and rural development, provides for the highest ever commitment to multi-annual funding in the education sector &mdash; over £1,500 million between 1995 and 1999.</P>
    <P>I have touched on a number of important areas but time does not allow the in-depth treatment which each topic requires.  Indeed, each topic could be the subject of a full debate in itself, as indeed could other topics which I have only referred to briefly.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Education, my record demonstrates a commitment to partnership and consensus-seeking in the formulation and implementation of education policy.  The White Paper sets out key principles which should underpin policy.  I am happy to submit my policy to the test of these principles &mdash; equality, quality, pluralism, partnership and accountability.  I thank Members for their attention and look forward to the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to see the Minister as I have been campaigning for the past couple of months to have her back in the Chamber.</P>
      <P>I have had many discussions about the White Paper in staff rooms throughout the country and with many of my teacher friends.  The White Paper is a great document for discussion. However, when we got down to the practicalities of the many policies the Minister proposes to implement in the future, I had great difficulty in seeing how they would work.  I wish to focus on one area because I have only ten minutes in which to say all that must be said.  I will ask hard, factual questions that will require hard answers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="115" /> The Minister proposes to disband the vocational education committee system and introduce a new structure.  In the White Paper she talked about devolution and decentralisation.  When I read the document further I found it very vague.  The Minister proposes to introduce regional education boards.  When I examined that proposal I looked at the south-east region which comprises five counties: Carlow, Kilkenny, Waterford, Wexford and south Tipperary.  The Minister says that regional education boards will be accountable and accessible. They will cover over 300 schools and, in some cases, 600 schools.</P>
    <P>I do not understand how the Minister could call that structure accountable.  It is a Civil Service model; it has nothing to do with teachers and buildings.  The Minister is throwing out a structure &mdash; the vocational education committee system &mdash; that has existed since 1932 and served this country well.  The Dublin Institute of Technology and the regional technical colleges sprang from that system and are modelled on the vocational education committee structure.  The Minister is now saying that they do not work, that we should throw them out and bring in a new system.  I ask the Minister not to fix it if it is not broken. It is a cliché but appropriate.  The vocational education committee structure works.  I know that because I work within the system.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that she wishes to change the model and introduce a large structure which I do not think will be accessible or accountable.  Let us take the two examples of a regional education board in Dublin with 300 schools and a similar board in the west with 613 schools.  Is it the plan to close the schools in the west?  Is the plan to cut down on our rural life another example of &ldquo;the last person out can put out the light&rdquo;?  That appears to be the way forward in rural development.</P>
    <P>I have grave reservations about the regional education boards.  I cannot understand why the Minister does not take soundings again and realise that <Col N="116" /> perhaps local education authorities are the way forward.  People identify with local concepts.  They understand how the composition of local education authorities work.  I welcome the enhanced role of parents in education.  How will the composition of parents be represented on these boards?  Surely the way forward is to have a local education authority.  Our culture is to deal with things locally.  We reflect the needs of the people on a local basis.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to reconsider her views on the regional education boards. They will not work.  The people do not understand them; they are too daunting. Where will each headquarters be located?  Will Waterford be the location for the south-east?  Will Galway be the headquarters for Mayo?  The regional education boards will not work in practical terms.  I ask the Minister to answer the points I have raised on that issue.</P>
    <P>The Minister is introducing many changes to the second level education system.  Is it any wonder that the teachers' morale is at an all time low? The Minister sent out a circular in September about time spent in the school. Part-time teachers' hours are to be cut according to a new circular from 800 down to 735 hours.  I do not know if the Minister understands what that means to the management of the school.  In smaller schools it will mean larger classes.  The remedial teacher will have to be pulled out and brought into a class which will necessitate a tighter management structure.  If teachers are ill, who will take over if there is no part-time teacher available?  I am not so sure the Minister got that one right either, judging by the unrest it created in staff rooms at the beginning of September.</P>
    <P>I wish to give an example of the volume of change the Minister has introduced to the second level system.  In the leaving certificate programme she has brought in three new courses.  A new curriculum is being devised for the traditional leaving certificate.  The Minister has introduced the leaving certificate applied programme and the leaving certificate vocational programme.  She has <Col N="117" /> introduced more changes in relation to transition years.  The leaving certificate applied programme was a pilot scheme and yet in-service training was necessary in order to become familiar with the course.  The course started in September and teachers are still only familiarising themselves with some aspects of it.  I am not knocking the concept; the course is ideally suited for students who were not served well by the traditional leaving certificate.  I do not want anybody to think that I do not think it is a good concept.</P>
    <P>I am a guidance councillor.  Last week a parent asked me whether their child would have access to third level education having done the leaving certificate applied programme.  I did some research and discovered that the child will not.  The parent asked me what kind of a certificate that child would get at the end of the year, whether it would be a traditional leaving certificate or whether it would have a different tag on it so that when two people are going for interview the one who has the LCAP will have a different status from the one who has the ordinary leaving certificate. We did not market the new leaving certificate applied programme very well. Parents do not understand it, I do not understand it, the pupils are uneasy with it.  Teachers want to teach it because there are lots of very good things about that course for students who cannot go through the normal channels in education. The Minister has not got that right and it is time she did.</P>
    <P>Such is the volume of change that other concepts are being introduced. We have the NCEA, the NCBA, the NCCA and TEASTAS, another umbrella organisation dealing with the overall certification &mdash; of what, I do not know.  Another body has been constituted which is to organise and develop the VTOS, the PLCs, Youthreach &mdash; the mind boggles.</P>
    <P>Morale is low among teachers.  The Civil Service and the Department of Education are throwing out forms to them.  So much change is taking place that they cannot teach and the Minister <Col N="118" /> is saying they must have more accountability. Hard answers are needed in relation to the volume of change.  We welcome change.  Teachers want to do their work and nurture the interaction that exists between the teacher and the student.  They want the resources to be able to do so but they are educators, not form fillers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  It is nice to see her here.  She is showing full and proper respect for the House in the course of her very busy schedule.  We will have further discussions over the next couple of weeks about education and in particular on the furore that has developed regarding the Minister's proposals for the management of the university sector.  It is surprising and somewhat illogical that a furore has developed because this whole process was flagged long ago when we discussed the White Paper.  The procedures the Minister is following were clearly indicated on page 104 of the White Paper.</P>
      <P>The Leader of the House has promised a discussion within three weeks.  If the consultative process is not finished in three weeks it is a waste of time having a discussion on it, but the Minister is doing all the right things in that regard.  She has sent out a consultative document which is being examined.  She is hearing the views of the people involved and until such time as those views have been formulated and communicated to the Minister, she will not proceed to phase two, which is finalising the legislation.</P>
      <P>It is generally agreed that the university sector has to be linked more closely with the various elements of society and interact more with the economy.  It must offer a leadership role, which it is doing, but to make that leadership role more effective the governing body should be changed.  What the Minister is proposing is more or less what was agreed in discussions she had with various people before the White Paper was produced and in my view that linking is essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="119" /> We started a huge investment in education in the mid-1960s and we can be proud of the achievements, particularly the economic achievements, which followed from that.  We cannot ever stand still; this process of evolution which the Minister is undertaking is essential.  We must have one eye on how our competing economies are getting on as well. Unless we continue to evolve our education system and our economy and add value to it in every possible way we will be losers in the long term.  Any discussion on education these days should also focus on the progress the economy is making.  Research and development was slow to take off, possibly because until about 1970 the universities here did not pay much attention to research. That was probably because we inherited a British system which was basically a teaching system.  The universities have adapted well and are now working very hard at research but there is still room for improvement.</P>
    <P>There is a great need for further investment in research and development by both the State and private companies right across the economy. According to figures for research in the developed world we are well down the scale and we are probably still investing under 1 per cent of GNP where other countries are investing three times that. That, of course, puts a drag on our economy because many of our workers tend to be working in low added value areas and this is reflected in relatively low productivity levels <i>vis-à-vis</i> other economies. This is why it is important for the education process to continually reexamine itself and its relevance to what we are seeking to achieve as a nation and, in the light of this evaluation, we should make whatever changes we can. This is an important year in Irish education.</P>
    <P>The decision of the Minister and the Government to introduce free third level education results in greater equity. The old system was very inequitable. Many families on relatively low incomes did not qualify for grants.  They found it <Col N="120" /> impossible to make a continuing commitment to the education of their children because they simply did not have the money.  The covenant system did not help them much.  These families are now in the position where their children will have a much better chance of attending third level than they had previously and it is likely that their children will be able to remain in third level longer.  This initiative has made third level much more attractive for the full body of Irish students.  This is important for students and it will pay rich dividends to the economy in future years.  When the decision is fully implemented next year it will ease the burden on many parents and it has met with general acceptance throughout the community.</P>
    <P>At primary and post-primary levels the previous Government started the ball rolling and this work has been continued. There has been increased investment in primary and secondary education. We could spend a long time pointing out areas in primary and post-primary levels which need large injections of personnel and funding.  One such area is the psychological service. Although the Minister did not have time to refer to it, she has plans for the development of this service.</P>
    <P>We should consider the complexity of what happens in the classroom and the difficulties teachers have to contend with on a daily basis at a time when parents have put enormous store on education for their children.  Many of us do not appreciate and understand the complexity of teaching a group of 25 to 30 pupils in national schools.  Difficulties arise for teachers when they teach classes with dyslexic students, slow learners, pupils with hearing and sight problems and emotionally disturbed pupils.  When we consider the difficulties teachers have in trying to deal with such an incredible mix of problems in the same classroom, we should come to the conclusion that teachers need the maximum level of service we can give them.</P>
    <P>They need the assistance of remedial teachers and psychological support, which we all agree are inadequate at <Col N="121" /> this stage.  We hope the Minister has proposals to improve these service over the coming years.  There are many problems which need to be considered.  The pupil-teacher ratio has been reduced but it must be further reduced.  The remedial and psychological services must be developed.  The conditions of some schools leave much to be desired. The school where I taught was built for 150 students but now caters for almost 500.  I ask the Minister to look at the file on this school and see what she can do for it.</P>
    <P>I am happy that the education system is examining itself with a view to improving itself and delivering a much better service.  I look forward to further discussions on education in future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Senator Cotter on the broad general principle of how things might affect his own constituency. I welcome the outlining by the Minister of her views.  The White Paper must be seen as a positive statement indicating the way forward for Irish education.  It is a comprehensive document which could and should influence education for many years to come but the level of that influence will be determined by the level of resources which Governments are prepared to invest in the implementation of the recommendations.  The White Paper combines vision, change and courage.  It also contains many things which are incorrect and it will take courage to change them.  However, vision without provision will prohibit development. Provision for vision will be a necessary part of the Minister's job and that of her successors.  Some 95 per cent of what is contained in the White Paper is progressive, is the result of years of consultation and is welcome.  Any differences we have can be sorted out through negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to make a substantial point on the question of school ethos.  The Minister mentioned the need for and importance of diversity and we all support this. I ask her to give a clear commitment, in addition to her commitment to diversity <Col N="122" /> and multi-denominational schools, that there will also be a place in primary education for non-denominational schools.  It is extraordinary that, in a pluralist society, it is impossible to get recognition for a primary school which is not denominational.  Multi-denominational schools exist because people have been unable to establish non-denominational schools.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to give a commitment to make it clear that it is in order for school patrons or authorities to lease school buildings.  I am not talking about the situation in years to come when the State, as is proposed in the White Paper, will buy all school buildings and lease them to the people operating them.  As and from now it should be possible for people with the numbers of pupils required to establish schools to lease buildings.  Leasing is common in the private sector, industry and commercial life.  It is a peculiarly Irish notion that people have to own the buildings in which they operate.  This should not be necessary; the leasing of appropriate buildings should also be acceptable.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal about the curriculum in the White Paper.  The Minister has mentioned time and again things which need to be added to the curriculum.  There are proposals for the inclusion of new programmes on arts, science, European awareness, health and well being as well as a revised Irish language curriculum.  I agree with all these proposals but I cannot see how they can be implemented without overloading the curriculum.  This mistake was made in England, Wales and, to a lesser extent, in Northern Ireland.  We have closely examined the curriculum in Northern Ireland.  I appeal to the Minister to be wary of overloading the curriculum. So many subjects could be added with the result that we would become jacks of all trades without achieving anything.</P>
    <P>There is a way by which this problem can be approached and I ask the Minister to consider it.  We need a research and development team working on the curriculum to ensure that the areas I <Col N="123" /> have mentioned can be introduced through a cross curricular approach, which would mean a merging or integration of various subject areas.  This is complicated, complex and difficult.  It could be done by having a permanent research and development team in the curricular area which would ensure the curriculum is constantly monitored and modified as appropriate.  The problem of overcrowding and overloading the curriculum needs to be dealt with by means of a professional approach involving a permanent research and development team which would work to introduce cross curricular themes and the integration of subjects.  This would be different from the work now being done by the curricular unit; it would be particular and specialist.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have to obtain money from the Government for the implementation of the long list of recommendations of the committee on special education.  On behalf of children who are the focus of special education, teachers say that there should be available to every parent of a child with special needs a clear statement outlining that child's educational needs.  That statement should identify the nature of the special education required and an appropriate placement.  That is the only way to move forward when dealing with integration and handicapped or disabled children.  This will require grasping the nettle and obtaining finance, but it is the only way it can be done.</P>
    <P>I have given a lot of consideration to assessment, which is probably the most difficult issue for a teacher.  I hope the Minister agrees that this issue has not yet been concluded.  It must be clearly understood that assessment is part of a teacher's work.  The requirement that assessments should be carried out at the end of first and fifth years at primary level is almost a <i>non sequitur</i> in the context of professional thinking on the subject. Teachers must continue to assess their pupils on a regular and structured basis.  Problems arise, however, when the results of assessment become the <Col N="124" /> basis on which judgments are made on pupils.  Assessment is important to the teacher as a diagnostic tool to identify learning and teaching problems.  Assessment, however, can only be formative; it should be part of what helps the teacher to form an opinion on the child. It can only be one aspect of the professional judgment and the teacher will then arrive, through a formative process, at a broader judgment.</P>
    <P>The successful teacher &mdash; I am on shaky ground here as regards convincing many of my colleagues about this &mdash; must build a profile of the child by making judicious use of standardised tests and by combining informal assessment and professional judgment and knowledge of the child's background.  This must be done without making disproportionate claims on class time and activities.  I appeal to the Minister not to allow that to happen.  I visited schools in England and in Wales where there are more books of test results than on the implementation of the curriculum.  More time is spent testing than teaching in some of those schools.  We do not want that to happen in Ireland.</P>
    <P>It would be unacceptable &mdash; I must fight the rearguard action with people who oppose a more open approach to education &mdash; to use aggregated test results to compare school with school or county with county.  For example, a highly successful teaching team in a disadvantaged area might be happy to measure success by bringing the majority of their pupils to an acceptable professional level of development. Another school might consider that a starting point while colleagues in other areas would demand more of themselves in terms of those outcomes.  A comparison between one set of pupils and another is unfair to the pupils, the school authorities and the teachers and fails to give any indication of the problems or the progress.</P>
    <P>I accept that in these days of political accountability the Minister needs to be able to tell people why we are spending £2 billion on education.  For that reason, the teaching profession must move <Col N="125" /> towards the Minister in the area of assessment.  I am prepared to look at this difficult issue.  I am opposed to aggregation and constant testing, but it must be approved and I hope we can reach an agreement.</P>
    <P>The debate on school time has been disastrous over the past two or three months.  Some 15 years ago the Department of Education asked management and teachers in the primary sector to increase the length of the school day by a certain period to reduce the school year from 190 days to 184 days in order to save the costs of heating, transport, administration, etc.  This proposal was agreed and teaching time was not lost. It puts people like me in a difficult position if people are now shouting to add those six days back when the basis of the previous agreement was to lengthen the school day to make up this time.</P>
    <P>As regards the initial training of teachers, education must reflect diversity. It would be an error to accept the current model as the only way to train teachers.  Different, imaginative approaches must be adopted in this area, such as the consecutive and postgraduate models.</P>
    <P>We must find a way to appraise teachers and to identify those experiencing problems.  We must introduce welfare payments, etc.  However, we do not need to appraise every teacher in the system all the time to weed out a number of problems.  We should find a way to deal with the problems and allow other teachers to do their work.  I know of the Minister's commitment to a teaching council.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made major progress in the area of early childhood education. It makes economic and educational sense to respect the right and the need of young children to education and care, particularly in disadvantaged areas.  The INTO will publish a major report on this area at its education conference later this month.  We welcome what the Minister has done and the method of guided discovery through structured activities which are aimed at the harmonious development of children. <Col N="126" /> We welcome the Minister's insistence on professional qualifications and classroom assistance for those working in child care areas.  We need to develop that and to ensure the content of those courses.</P>
    <P>The inspectorate is crucially important to the whole system.  It is being diluted, but it needs to be part of the teaching team.  A strong inspectorate is a guarantee of quality, although this may be against the interests of the INTO members.</P>

      <P>If one was an alien one would be excused for thinking that the Minister's plan to abolish third level fees was a highly improper and unpopular decision because newspaper reports castigated her for it.  However, parents, including myself, appreciate what she has done.  Many of us would not have gone to second or third level education if it had not been for the introduction of free education in the 1960s.  I pay tribute to a former Minister for Education, the late Brian Lenihan, who was one of the early pioneers of free education and without whom we would not be in the positions we are in today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those of us who attended third level education became teachers, workers in local government, etc.  However, we were faced with the problem of not being able to send our children to third level education because they were close in age, the cost was high and we were outside the income limits.  We will benefit most from this proposal.  People criticised the fact that those on high incomes would also benefit, but they always got <Col N="127" /> more from the system through covenants. By abolishing covenants, the Minister will be able to finance third level education for many people in the middle income group.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for the attention she gave to the disadvantaged in primary education.  I refute Senator Ormonde's claim that morale is low among the teaching profession.  Many teachers, especially in the primary sector, do not share that view.  They feel the Minister understands their grievances and knows what it is like to work in disadvantaged areas and with disadvantaged children.  The Minister has taken their concerns on board by introducing a range of measures to ensure that these levels of disadvantage are examined and funded.</P>
    <P>I especially thank the Minister for introducing 33 early start pre-schools for children from socially disadvantaged areas.  The article written by Vincent Browne in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday gives a clear idea of all the difficulties faced by somebody growing up in a socially disadvantaged area and early start pre-schools are one way to combat this problem.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for raising the number of home school links from 45 to 105, for raising capitation grants from £45 to £65 and increasing the number of remedial teachers from around 900 to nearly 1,200.  The fund for disadvantaged areas has risen to £3.3 million. Another provision for which primary school teachers are particularly grateful is the decrease in maximum class sizes from 39 pupils to 29 pupils and that figure is projected to fall further.  The number of second level remedial teachers has also increased.  I thank the Minister for raising the number of guidance teachers from 350 to 568.  Guidance teachers are essential when discussing third level options.</P>
    <P>There may be a misguided view among some parents and pupils that the regional technical colleges are not an avenue to a good job; the reverse is often the case.  The best, most lucrative <Col N="128" /> and worthwhile jobs can be obtained through regional technical colleges. Many university graduates living in my area are qualified for jobs that are not available.  If they had been guided into the areas in the regional technical colleges where there is a lack of suitably qualified people, they would have been trained in the way industry demands.</P>
    <P>There should be ongoing links between our third level institutions and industry.  There is no point having a large supply of graduates for certain areas if there are no jobs available while other areas do not have enough suitably qualified people.  It is an enormous economic, social and educational drain that some of our brightest and best graduates are forced to emigrate while we are crying out for people to take up positions in other industries.  People often have to be brought in from abroad to fill these gaps that could, with a little guidance and direction, be filled by our own people.</P>
    <P>The Minister must be congratulated for increasing the annual education budget by £350 million, which is an indication of the commitment of this Government and the Labour Party to education.  It is high on our list of priorities and the Minister has shown this by her commitment to all levels of education. However, I would like an improvement in the level of maintenance grant for children from disadvantaged homes.  Grant aid should be increased to a more realistic figure and a system should be put in place where students going to third level could have access to these grants a little earlier. Some undergraduates have to survive for months with little money and this puts a huge drain on many low income families.  I ask the Minister to take this into consideration over the coming years.</P>
    <P>I again thank the Minister for the attention she has given to the people who need it most.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it difficult to be as enthusiastic a supporter of the Minister as her colleagues.  If she continues <Col N="129" /> to be Minister for Education, small primary schools in rural Ireland will disappear completely.  I have a lot of evidence to support this theory.  Senator Cotter is correct in saying that we are in a consultative period at the moment. However, the White Paper on education may as well be white smoke because it means nothing to those involved.</P>
      <P>I will start my contribution by reading a letter from an elected representative of the County Donegal Protestant community which states:</P>
      <P>It has been brought to my attention the serious situation at Monreagh Protestant School.  This is a two teacher school with 30 children. About two years ago, transport was withdrawn due to insufficient numbers. That was the reason given at the time but now a more serious situation has emerged.  The building has been deemed unsafe and the Office of Public Works has ordered the children out with no replacement of the premises. Considerable efforts have been made to have necessary repairs carried out but to no avail.</P>
      <P>I am speaking on behalf of a section of the community that are not here to talk for themselves, the Protestant community. Many of these small Protestant schools in County Donegal may have to close.  That does not reflect an open approach to the two traditions on this island.  The Minister seems to be out of step with her colleagues on this matter. It will not be good for this country if this Protestant public representative discusses this lack of educational facilities with his colleagues across the Border.  I have a litany of similar cases and it would take me an hour to go through all of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Royal and Prior Comprehensive School in Raphoe is valuable to the Protestant tradition of County Donegal. The children attending that school have to get up at 6.30 a.m. to get a bus at 7.10 a.m.  Many children are collected up to a mile and a half from their homes.  One does not have to use much imagination <Col N="130" /> to fully understand the effort those people have to make to get a secondary education for their children.  They are entitled to regard themselves as being part of a community that is getting little attention.</P>
    <P>I hope all the nice things said by the Minister's colleagues are true and I hope the Minister proves me wrong but her development plans do not take into account areas outside Dublin.  Rural Ireland has suffered under her administration to the extent that her rationalisation programme excludes small two-teacher schools.  No effort whatsoever is made to protect these small units of education.  Small Protestant schools in Counties Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan and in the west will be the first to pay the price under the Minister's administration.  They will be eliminated. They already have to make great sacrifices to partake of secondary education.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister receive a deputation from the parents of the Protestant children in Donegal?  The Minister has refused to meet them to date.  I have a copy of a letter from her Department to Deputy McGinley and Deputy Coughlan, but the Minister and her officials have refused a meeting.  I ask her openly and sincerely to prove me wrong and to prove wrong those who have already formed the impression that she could not care less about Protestant children and their future.  The Minister should meet the parents of the Protestant children in County Donegal.</P>

      <P>Recent education debates have tended to focus on the needs of people attending third level education, yet many young people leave school without an adequate foundation at primary or secondary level.  Around 6 per cent of all pupils leave school without any qualification and in many parts of the country the figure is closer to 50 or 60 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For many students primary school is the only university, the one universal level of education.  In this regard I implore the Minister to develop the <Col N="131" /> Youthreach programme which is working so well for those who have opted out of second level education.  I have seen the value of Youthreach to young people.  Our primary class sizes continue to be the highest in the EU and in our infant classes our ratio is worse than in many countries.  At primary level we spend <i>per capita</i> less than half than that spent in many other countries.</P>
    <P>For decades our primary students have been expected to learn in a physical environment which is sometimes dangerous and we often hear of parents protesting and taking children out of school.  Under Fianna Fáil Governments the word &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; acquired a disturbing permanence.  It is unacceptable that as we approach the millennium we should still have primary schools without adequate indoor sanitation.  It is unacceptable that in 1995 nearly a quarter of primary schools should lack a supply of drinking water or that 64 per cent should lack access to a typewriter, let alone a computer.</P>
    <P>Democratic Left believes in a bottom-up rather than a top-down approach. Access to third level education will remain fundamentally inequitable until all children have equal access to a solid foundation at primary level.  Traveller children are being provided for in the special education review but it still needs to be fully implemented.  The provision of remedial teachers continues to be grossly inadequate.  In some sparsely populated areas there may be one remedial teacher serving perhaps four or six schools.  Remedial teachers may spend more time travelling from school to school than teaching.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Minister has established a task force to implement the findings of the special education review committee and that each school will be responsible for drawing up a policy on student assessment.  The promised expansion of the school psychological service will provide teachers with a valuable back-up in this task.  One of the problems that has bedevilled children with special needs in the past has been <Col N="132" /> the absence of co-ordination between the relevant Departments and agencies. The White Paper recently published by the Minister suggests that each child with a special disability be entered on a national database.</P>
    <P>The Minister is focusing on the good of the pupils.  Last year she made a worthwhile decision to upgrade St. Gobnait's national school in Mallow.  As a result many pupils are being accommodated in the recreational hall.  The Minister said she made the decision for the good of the pupils and that shows. However, the Minister must keep in mind the provision of adequate accommodation for schools.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse what Senator O'Toole said about assessment and curriculum.  With regard to curriculum, media studies should be a central element to equip our citizens with the capacity to evaluate the barrage of information to which they are subjected and from which they draw the bulk of their opinions and views nowadays. However worthwhile our current education system may be it does not thus equip juveniles or adults.</P>
      <P>Adult education is an idea whose time has come or ought to have come.  The Minister says the establishment of Teastas is evidence of the &ldquo;Government's commitment to the facilitation of life long learning&rdquo;.  With respect, it is no such thing.  It is the resources the Minister may get for it which would be evidence of the commitment.  In that respect, it was a retrograde step to introduce the distinction between day and evening fees for university students last year.  I ask the Minister as one of her highest priorities to restore parity between them as a matter of urgency.  It has damaged the morale of adult education by appearing to relegate it to a second status level and introducing an invidious distinction in terms of status. Far more important than the Minister's eloquent paragraph of commitment to lifelong learning would be concrete evidence of her commitment to the values behind the admirable rhetoric.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="133" /> I was disappointed to see the reference to the Culliton report in the Minister's speech.  I hope the Department of Education has sufficient intellectual independence not to succumb to such an approach.  The Culliton report was extremely good on those areas in which the members of that group knew what they were about.  They did not know what they were talking about in education but seemed to draw on their recollections of their experience of 20 or 30 years ago.  The chapter on education is by far the weakest in that report.  I am sorry to see the Department cite it as if taking it on board when it should challenge it.</P>
    <P>Some of the same recollections which are now out of date in large measure may be influencing the Minister's attitude towards what I understand is proposed university legislation.  I will not comment on that as I have not been favoured with the details but I hope legislation is not based on an out of date image of what is happening in universities. I regard myself as a radical educational reformer and I welcome the Minister's reforms in many areas.  Some of what I understand the Minister wishes to do with regard to universities is well worth doing but I will strongly resist some other of her objectives &mdash; if my understanding of what she has in mind is correct.</P>
    <P>The area of research students and research at third level generally is still grossly neglected in terms of policy.  It is the most unsatisfactory section of the report of the steering committee of the Higher Education Authority.  It is an area with major policy and financial implications and I urge the Minister to address it in a systematic way as soon as her harassed officials have time to think about it.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed because I wished to make a contribution and am afraid this will be another whitewash, as we are not getting time to debate the effect on rural areas.  We had a good education system when there were two school streams, vocational schools and colleges.  The Culliton report supported that system but it was thrown aside.  Is there any relationship between industry and education?  The aim and net result of education is to create jobs so that people can make a living and rear a family.  It is not a trophy to be put on the sideboard and admired, one should make use of it all through one's life.  There will be a grave shortage of sheet-metal workers, welders, block builders and many other trades in the near future.  Have any surveys been done about this?  It is fine to send people for further education or the new scheme whereby people are in college until they are pensioners&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Apprenticeships involve co-ordination between the Department of Enterprise and Employment and the Department of Education. The schemes are good but people cannot get sponsorship.  Education has a role to play as to how best we can help. Does the Minister have views on the matter?</P>

      <P>I thank Senators for a lively debate and for stating the challenges <Col N="135" /> to which I was invited to respond. As Minister for Education, although I am proud of my position, I do not have answers for all the questions at this time.  In response to Senator Lee, I do not find my officials to be harassed at any time; probably they find the Minister harassed.</P>

      <P>I thought I was winding up the comments and that was the end of the questions.  In response to the questions from Senator Farrell and Senator Ormonde, the apprenticeship system is undergoing change at present. Senator Lee mentioned the Culliton and Moriarty reports and the Departments are looking at them again in developing these links.  Whether one sees education as full training for a job or as having other purposes, I think Senator Ormonde will agree that we know from all the research that those who stay at school longest and acquire qualifications respond much better to the requirements the community makes of them.  We are looking at retaining people in the education system, the apprenticeship scheme and the links between industry and education.  The further education authority has a role in that regard.  When we consider the massive investment by the EU, particularly in vocational training, we see the system Senator Farrell described has not gone forever.  It is changing and the investment and management of that change is being facilitated with generous EU funding.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed that because of the way the business was ordered, the tradition that each shade of opinion is heard has not been honoured <Col N="136" /> on this occasion but I understand how it happened.  The Minister said that each topic could be the subject of a debate in itself, which is true and I hope we will return within the next few weeks to the topic which concerns other Senators and myself.</P>
      <P>The briefing document on third level education seems to be available to the press and some Members but others have not received it.  Is it the Minister's intention to circulate it and if so when can we expect to receive it?  My other questions relate to the proposals for the governance of third level education.  In what way does the Minister think Trinity College, Dublin, as currently constituted is not accountable?  Will Trinity have to accept outside representatives on its board, although its system has stood satisfactorily for over 400 years through war and, I suspect, significant political interference?  In what way is it not representative as it stands?  Will the Minister require universities to prepare and submit a charter to her and could or would she impose a charter on them? Would private funding of buildings or to endow chairs in universities be subject to State approval?</P>
      <P>Finally, could the Minister reconcile two apparently contradictory statements in her script?  When referring to proposed university legislation, it reads that respect for the autonomy of the institutions is also part of the context for development and the approach to policy is stated as a search for balance between institutional autonomy and the needs of public policy and accountability; that the proposed legislation acknowledges and gives expression to autonomy of universities which is consistent with the demands of accountability and transparency. I am interested how she reconciles that with her other statement:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper makes a commitment to bring forward legislation concerning the composition of governing bodies, the restructuring of the National University of Ireland and more comprehensive provisions relating to autonomy and accountability, <Col N="137" /> diversity and enhancement of developmental roles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the other question on university fees is a separate issue.  I have two specific questions and I will be brief as others wish to contribute. Regarding university governance, what compelling reasons and arguments can be put forward by the Minister against the existing structures?  In common <Col N="138" /> with Senator Dardis and others, I believe the existing structures have served education well.  I cannot understand how meddlesome interference by the Department of Education could improve matters in any way.  If governing bodies are to be restructured, I hope we do better than we did with regard to the regional technical colleges.  That is not a model which commends itself to anybody.</P>
      <P>If there is to be some restructuring of governing bodies, I hope it is not in the Minister's mind that political or elected representatives will be treated further as some form of pariah.  This occurred with regard to the regional technical colleges when a previous Minister &mdash; a Minister of my own persuasion &mdash; removed Oireachtas Members from the regional technical colleges.  There was no good or compelling reason for doing so and there is no good or compelling reason for doing it now with regard to third level institutions.  I have a further question regarding fees but as this issue relates to governance I will return to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the strong resistance which is building up in Trinity College, Dublin, to her proposals for the board?  These have not been publicly stated but they are known throughout the university.  Does she realise that many graduates in Trinity College will not tolerate Labour Party nominees, political appointments, to the board of a great university which has had autonomy for many centuries?  If these proposals are in her mind, she should realise that a Bill proposing such nominees will not be passed by the House.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that people in Northern Ireland are watching her treatment of Trinity College, Dublin, very closely on this issue?  They take her threat to its autonomy very seriously.  I ask her to explain her philosophy and whether she believes a university should fulfil the needs of public policy.  If so, what does that mean?</P>

Will the Minister confirm that discussions are ongoing at present with the heads of the universities and, in light of that, a further position paper will be made available to the public for detailed discussion and analysis in the House?  I will echo the points of my colleague, Senator Ross, who cogently put the case which is strongly felt within the university. Is the Minister aware of the degree of resentment, anger and frustration which is building up in the university?

      <P>I wish to respond to the contributions which preceded the questions before I deal with the questions. Senator Ormonde touched on a topic at the start of the debate which Senator Mooney mentioned at the conclusion. Many national and international studies of the Irish education system have been carried out over many years.  The critical analyses always conclude that the system is too centralised.  Following many discussions across the partners in education, including parents, managers and teachers, we are aiming towards real regional planning and devolution.  All schools will be involved.</P>
      <P>Senator Ormonde stressed the vocational education committee system, but as Minister for Education I must remind those in that dedicated section that we are talking about 250 vocational education committee schools.  However, over 4,000 schools come within my remit.  For example, in the primary sector, practically the colour of the paint on the front door is decided in Marlborough Street.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;between east, west, north and south but the plan reflects a sense of community, rather than division parish by parish or county by county.</P>
      <P>Regarding Senator McGowan's comments, the regional difference is recognised by the communities which reflect greater participation by Protestants, Catholics and Gael Scoileanna in the west.  In planning this move, we consulted widely and we have taken on board critical analyses of the system. Because we are planning for the future of the next generation it would be easy to sit back and concentrate on one particular issue, but this is a time of momentous change and every Minister for Education must be prepared to manage change and must not react to it as some have reacted outside this House.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole welcomed 95 per cent of the White Paper.  The challenge faced by the Department of Education is to retain people within the system. There has been a concentration on third level education within this debate, but many students never complete second level.  There has been a measured success rate since I became Minister for Education.  There has been an increase of seven per cent in the numbers of students retained within the system during the past three years.  They must be dealt with in a way which allows us to target their needs and harness our resources.  That is best done in partnership and can only be achieved as part of the job of teachers in the classroom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Toole also referred to the implementation of the curriculum and a system of assessment.  During my time in the Department of Education a pattern has been established to consult with the partners involved on how it will be implemented.  If these measures are to be introduced for the betterment of students this can be best achieved by continuing that model of consultation. <Col N="143" /> In excess of £2 billion has been invested in the education system.  The White Paper sets out the framework or philosophy on which decisions are taken on how that money is best spent.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Kelly for recognising my initiative in relation to the abolition of third level fees, as this affects parents. The cost was minimal.  The Government abolished a very regressive covenant tax concession and recycled the proceeds to abolish undergraduate tuition fees.</P>
    <P>Senator Lee mentioned night students.  The priorities are hemmed in or controlled by the amount of funding available to a Minister.  Criticisms of the Department of Education do not amount to much and arise because we do not have sufficient funding to make the Department's excellent services more widely and freely available.  I passionately believe access to education is a right for everybody.</P>
    <P>I was slightly taken aback with Senator McGowan's comments.  The White Paper introduced during Deputy Séamus Brennan's term as Minister for Education discussed the idea of the four teacher school.  There was a recommendation at the National Education Convention for representation from the Protestant community at management and all other levels.  The idea of the four teacher school was then removed from the agenda.  I am particularly sensitive to accusations that I am Dublin-centred or Catholic-centred.  As Minister for Education I am responsible for an education system with which the word pluralism is associated.  I take the Senator's comments on board but I challenge him to refer to the facts.  The suggestion that I might turn my back on any sector of the community is one which I find quite hurtful.</P>
    <P>Senator Sherlock was correct to inquire with regard to the Youthreach programme.  Early school leavers have few qualifications and that guarantees them a place among the long-term unemployed.  We have abolished third level fees, however, and we must concentrate more on work and resources at <Col N="144" /> primary level and secondary level to retain more people within the system.  I set myself a target to ensure that 90 per cent of students will avail of the leaving certificate by the turn of the century. We expect 89 per cent to do so in the very near future.</P>
    <P>Further challenges must be faced on the relevance of the school curriculum and changes to it.  It might be easier to change at a slower pace while many people are leaving the system and not availing of the State's massive investment in education.  However, one has to rise to this challenge and identify where the curriculum needs to be changed. The teaching profession required in-career training, and some parts of the traditional honours leaving certificate were not suitable to all children's needs. I am sure Senator Ormonde will agree, from her experience as a guidance counsellor, that the extra 7 per cent of students remaining in school require more attention and greater challenges. Investment in education should be seen as relevant since education is the key to our life chances.  The interest shown by Members of this House in debates on education is always startling.  Those who leave education too early lose out on their life chances and have not made wise decisions.  There is an obligation across the political spectrum to ensure that the options we now offer to these people are relevant.</P>
    <P>I have already commented on Senator Farrell's point with regard to apprenticeships and the links between jobs and qualifications.  Senators Dardis, O'Toole, Ross, Roche, Henry, Norris and Kelly raised the issue of the university legislation.  I have indicated that discussions with the universities are ongoing.  One often faces difficulty if one is prepared to consult since one begins with a stated position.  That position was spelt out in the White Paper. There is no shock or surprise about this. As Minister, I have proceeded with my work and not waited to come to this House or the Lower House to deal with commitments given in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>Papers can circulate outside a wider <Col N="145" /> area of circulation than was originally intended but a consultative process, however, means that one also listens. Considering the tenure of the recent debate I had to circulate a certain amount of information in the interests of those participating in this process, senior civil servants in the Department of Education, the heads of the universities and the chancellor of the NUI.  This debate would otherwise have reached its conclusion based upon spurious articles featured on the second last page of a recent Sunday newspaper.  To enter a public debate &mdash; I say this for the benefit of Senator Dardis, the Progressive Democrats and other Senators in this House, particularly those elected by the National University of Ireland and the University of Dublin &mdash; based upon spurious accusations in certain sections of some city centre universities would be unfair.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that today's debate concentrated on the White Paper on which discussions are ongoing.  If I am to consult the Provost and the Presidents, I owe it to them to complete the consultation. I have undertaken to return to this House to specifically address those concerns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course.  I am not implying anything.  There was no suggestion that there was any ulterior motive.</P>
      <P>There is a growing concern about the further establishment of what might loosely be termed Government quangos.  The most recent count to my knowledge revealed 108 such bodies and we are now being asked to establish two more or to make provisions for the establishment and functions of various bodies.</P>
      <P>This gives me the opportunity to ask whether the Minister has any philosophical view about this growing trend in a small country.  There are 37 county enterprise boards, 36 Leader programmes and 35 area partnership boards which, together, number 108. This does not take account, for example, of the six county enterprise boards in my part of the country which were set up in the Border counties under the International Fund for Ireland and the Arigna taskforce, which was set up in the Roscommon-Leitrim area following the collapse of the Arigna coal-mining industry, which is still in existence and still helping local industry.</P>
      <P>When will this end?  Already, in counties such as my own and in the western counties generally where there is depopulation, it is becoming increasingly difficult to find personnel who are both capable and have the time to devote in a voluntary capacity to the increasingly onerous activities of these boards.  Substantial sums of money are now passing through various evaluation committees and boards which hopefully will filter through to the local communities for which they were set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to give the impression that I am against the concept.  Far be it <Col N="147" /> from me to suggest that because all of us are enthusiastic about more money and power being devolved to local level, particularly to community based organisations. However, does the Minister agree that this will reach a logjam eventually?  For example, representatives of IBEC have pointed out that a number of their members are withdrawing from these boards because they do not have time for them.  If business people with the expertise, which was to be put at the disposal of these boards and bodies, are withdrawing from them and being replaced by people who, with the greatest respect, may not be up to the mark, surely the long-term effects will be a diminution in the quality of the decisions taken and, perhaps, in a return of a more centralised form of government, which none of us wants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a huge growth in the use of devolved groups in the approach to enterprise, local development and unemployment action. It is not fair to lump them together and say that it is terrible we have 108 bodies. The partnership programme is obviously designed to try to bring about a community response to unemployment. Most people who have looked at long-term unemployment see it needs community based responses at local level.  There is a need for local groups who would try to solve the problem of long-term unemployment.  That cannot be done from Merrion Street or Kildare Street.  There is an acknowledged belief, which has surfaced through the National Economic and Social Forum, that one must have a community based bottom up response to that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="148" /> Equally, the county enterprise boards grew out of the belief that micro-business was bypassed by the large agencies, that there was not sufficient focus on the potential of local business, that there was a need for a local agency which could take a view of that area and see how to address its enterprise requirements and that there was merit in bringing employers, unions and the community together to do that.  Indeed, the Senator's party first put that in train and I have, to a large extent, inherited the 35 boards.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I recognise there is potential for confusion, particularly for people looking to these agencies, trying to set one off against the other, with all the potential for frustration which that could bring.  The Taoiseach's Department, as the Senator probably knows, recently established the county strategy teams which are designed to draw together the executives in these different bodies to ensure there is coherence in what they are doing, that their plans gel and that they will not waste their time processing the same application twice.</P>
    <P>I see this need at local level.  If there is a genuine belief in a county that these agencies are putting an excessive burden on the membership and are doing things which could be consolidated, there is every opportunity for them to consolidate at county level.  Some county enterprise boards and Leader groups have successfully dovetailed their evaluation committees, for example, so that they have a single evaluation team working on projects coming from different areas.</P>
    <P>We would be keen to see that evolve and to see first stop shops created.  The county enterprise boards is where the resources are.  If you walk in off the street to a county enterprise board, it has all the answers as to where you should properly go with a project.  There should not be waste.</P>
    <P>We are determined to ensure State money in this area is well spent.  We will take a rigid view on this.  We want to see value for money from the agencies.  We <Col N="149" /> will review their progress and if they are not succeeding, we will look at that issue.  As of now, and with considerable political momentum from the Senator's party as much as any other, we have wanted to see a bottom up approach with local people taking this into their own hands.  Clearly, the onus is on the local areas to make it work.  Ultimately, if it is seen to fail because of the reasons about which the Senator is worried, the Government will have to respond.</P>
    <P>The Senator will have seen that in the case of Leader there was considerable criticism from the Comptroller and Auditor General of the review of the first programme but there has been a lot of tightening up in the second programme to make sure those errors are not repeated.</P>
    <P>We must act similarly.  We must have critical reviews, put better reforms in place and ensure there is no wasteful duplication.  That is the best way forward. It is not fair to tot up everything and say this is unacceptable when, at the same time, people have grabbed the opportunity to have a group in the local county town.  These groups look to the future of the county, try to devise enterprise strategies, give soft supports to small businesses which are trying to get on their feet and run grant and mutual training schemes.  Those are valuable contributions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of quangos is important and I take the point which Senator Mooney made.  Newspapers love the short headline &ldquo;More quangos&rdquo;.  In some cases, as we move further down the road of decentralisation and devolution, this will rear its head.  People will ask why there are so many intermediate bodies between the dispenser and the recipient.  The Taoiseach's intiative may go some way towards resolving that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some questions must be asked about IBEC and ICTU because on almost every occasion they seem to adopt the old maxim &ldquo;round up the usual suspects&rdquo;. Hence you see the same faces on five different and unrelated layers of <Col N="150" /> endeavour.  It is almost like a cocktail circuit because the same people are involved.  It is time that ICTU and IBEC provided a talent bank of some description. Very good people on both the union and business sides do not get a look in because both organisations are clubs where the best people do not always come through.</P>
    <P>Just because somebody does not want to get involved in a town or village's local chamber of commerce, it does not mean they do not have a lot to contribute. Many people are excluded because they cannot waste time at meaningless meetings, and if they did attend such meetings they would be appointed to all sorts of things.</P>
    <P>As we move into the decentralisation and devolution process a potentially serious problem arises.  IBEC, ICTU and other organisations are almost always asked to produce an &ldquo;expert&rdquo;, but the trouble is that such people are either very thin on the ground or the pool of experts is confined to a few friends.  That has to be examined in the interests of making it work at local level with real community involvement &mdash; not tyranny by the few as we have in some communities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I was anxious to hear the Minister's views on the one stop shop, but has he checked out the county enterprise boards, Leader and tourism groups the Senator did not mention? They comprise another layer of people who have been put in place over the last three years &mdash; none of this happened in the last 12 months &mdash; and we have watched them all grow.</P>
      <P>I would like to see a direction given to such groups when they are setting up offices that all the agencies should be in one building.  This would save an enormous amount of expense because one secretariat could do the work for the county enterprise boards, Leader groups and tourism companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the strategy groups proposed by the Taoiseach, it is important to bring their leadership together to avoid widespread duplication.  It would <Col N="151" /> be crazy to do otherwise.  I suggested this a long time ago so that each group would know about the other's applications. This would avoid a situation where projects receive grant approval from two different groups because information about applications is not shared.</P>
    <P>In County Meath there is an opportunity to put all these organisations into one headquarters, yet some people are resisting the idea because they want to run their own little enterprise.  That is totally wrong.  Next week we will bring together all these bodies to see if funds for tourism development can be pooled to maximise their use in promoting the county as a tourism base.  Such funds will not be available after the turn of the century so the best possible use should be made of them.  Every county will have an opportunity to make use of this once off contribution over the next few years by selling their individual areas on a national and international basis.</P>
    <P>The Minister should not allow two or three offices to be set up in the same town, thus forcing individuals to drive from one office to another and find parking along the way, spending half the day trying to get information that could be provided by a one stop shop.  The funds should be maximised to avoid their abuse for the benefit of individuals who say, &ldquo;This is my little enterprise and I am going to run it as I see fit&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Earlier the Minister recognised the potential for confusion. Since this Bill is merely a housekeeping one, why can it not sort out some of the confusion which has been worse for the last year or so than previously?  The Minister mentioned the one stop shop idea which has been in vogue for quite some time.  The real problem now, however, is that three agencies &mdash;<Col N="152" /> Leader, the county enterprise boards and the small industry section of the IDA &mdash; are dealing with one group of small business people.</P>
      <P>Even at this late stage, could the Minister consider including some provision for a more synchronised approach by those three agencies?  The Senator is correct in saying that three agencies are dealing with one group of small businesses in different offices in the same towns, which is a bit ridiculous. I am disappointed that the Minister has not included in the Bill a strategy to synchronise the work of those agencies.</P>
      <P>Since the debate on Second Stage I have checked the position with a number of county enterprise boards and Leader groups.  I found that several thousand applications for aid were approved in principle but have been held up because no money has come either from the Department of Enterprise and Employment or the Department of Finance to fund those programmes.</P>
      <P>For instance, in Galway where we have a new Leader programme, a number of good projects capable of creating jobs immediately have been approved in principle but have not yet received any money from central funds.  There is a continuing delay.  We are told from week to week that the money is coming. The same applies to Galway County Enterprise Board where there is a major shortage of funds.  Even though the funds have been approved and committed we cannot get the money.  The Minister should address this problem facing many small businesses that have been told their projects cannot be approved because the money is not there.</P>

      <P>The Minister has attracted a small amount of criticism because he has not done certain things in relation to this Bill.  However, I congratulate him on the delivery of 1,000 jobs, 300 in my county.  They are scattered around four areas and I am sure my Limerick colleagues will support me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That does not mean I do not share <Col N="153" /> some of the concerns expressed in relation to this multiplicity of promotion bodies and I said so when this matter was debated in the House a number of years ago.  As far as I recall, Senator Mooney did not support me at the time. When I argued against a multiplicity of bodies I was persuaded that this was the way forward.  This system has been in place for a year or two and we should measure its effectiveness.  I call on the Minister to see if it requires change and I am satisfied that any objective examination will mean that it does.</P>
    <P>I say this in the context of another issue which I would like to raise.  There is a train of thought coming from Europe which I support. There is an urgent need to deal with legislative and administrative simplicity as far as industrial development is concerned.  A monitoring committee has reported and said that over-regulation stifles growth, reduces competition and costs Europe jobs, that the impact of regulations frustrates a culture of enterprise, hampers innovation and deters domestic and inward commitment.  The committee came up with 121 proposals which will be considered at the Madrid summit but, before then, they will be put in order of priority.  I would like the Minister, perhaps not today, to outline the Government's response to the proposals.</P>
    <P>Europe has belatedly come to the conclusion that we are stifling everything by over-regulation.  Perhaps we are stifling things by having too large a conglomeration of promotion agencies. The movement is towards simplicity. Will the Minister outline the work being done in relation to that report, the response of the Government and how many of the 121 proposals it has identified should receive priority?  I compliment the Minister on this morning's announcement which will be welcome in my area.</P>

      <P>I join Senator Howard in welcoming the 300 jobs for Gilloge in east Clare which is two miles from where I live and straddles the east Clare and Limerick constituencies.  As regards Senator Mooney's point, I agree with the Minister that each of these organisations was set up in response to needs at various levels, including the county enterprise partnership boards, the Leader programme and Forfás.  It is ineffective to talk about them as quangos.  They have arisen in response to the principle of subsidiarity and there is no need to defend them.  They do a good job and the fact that those on the county enterprise partnership boards said they have already spent their money is an indication of the need for this type of assistance.</P>
      <P>A system of co-ordination is needed and I support what has been said in that regard.  I also support the suggestion that a one stop shop should be available to the public because there is confusion in that people do not know the relevant body which will provide them with information and assistance.  Where it should be provided is a matter which could be decided on.</P>
      <P>I would not like the role of local public representatives to be swept aside. One of the terms of reference of the devolution commission set up by the Taoiseach is to identify where local and regional authorities can play a role in co-ordinating the various developments, in making information available and ensuring that there is no waste and duplication.  I would have thought that local and regional authorities would have had an important role in this area. The terms of reference of regional authorities indicate that they have a role in monitoring how EU money is spent. These bodies are necessary but they should be co-ordinated and provide clear information to the public in one place so that they know exactly where to go.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Sullivan mentioned the need for local representatives to be involved in these organisations, <Col N="155" /> particularly the ADM which specifically requires that public representatives are not represented.  There is a ludicrous situation in my constituency where an individual who twice stood for election and was unsuccessful is now successfully running west Limerick resources.  Those of us who defeated him in the local elections found that we were not even considered. If we believe we will remove politics from all levels of society, we must think again.  We may remove elected representatives but we will still find politics at local level.  I ask the Minister to remember local representatives.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for outlining his views in this area and to my colleagues for a worthwhile debate on the increasing number of institutions.  I am sorry Senator O'Sullivan took umbrage at my reference to quangos.  It was not pejorative; I was attempting to find a word to explain or define these bodies and institutions because they are not elected bodies but a mixture of appointed members and representatives of local authorities.  I would be grateful if somebody could come up with a definitive word.</P>
      <P>In my constituency Sligo County Council has initiated a one stop shop.  It is trying to pull the various bodies together in one building.  Senator Farrelly referred to this.  I am concerned that in areas where there is not a wider availability of talent, as Senator Magner lucidly put it, there could be a danger that we would find a diminution in the quality of the service provided by these bodies, which would be unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards Senator Howard's comment, I fought hard in my party against the concept of the county enterprise partnership boards taking it from the local authority.  The county development teams were working well and they should have been strengthened.  We should never have set up county enterprise partnership boards.  Being a member of a party the Senator will <Col N="156" /> know that when I lost the battle in my party I had to defend the indefensible.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the initiative by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, who has increased the number of elected representatives on county enterprise partnership boards from that set out by my party which was not in favour of widening the franchise for elected representatives. The issue is not relevant to this debate but, as Senator O'Sullivan said, we are concerned about the diminution of the role of elected local representatives which is a challenge to the Government.</P>

      <P>(3)  That no disposals be undertaken without prior consultations with Local Development organisations and bodies.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment is self explanatory.  All I am asking for is a continuation of the philosophy expressed in the debate so far on all sides of the House and by the Minister.  There should be local consultation about the disposal of property. The 1993 Bill was initiated to split the IDA into three bodies, which I am not so sure was a very good idea.  My party's deputy leader is on record as saying that when Fianna Fáil comes back into Government it may re-examine the splitting up of the IDA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The county enterprise boards have been in place since the 1993 legislation. This legislation does not acknowledge <Col N="157" /> the role and status of the county enterprise boards specifically and that of the wider local authority in the areas where there is now an input into industrial policy.  It seems unfair and goes against the spirit of this legislation if the Minister retains the right to dispose of property and the various bodies &mdash; Forfás, Forbairt and IDA Ireland &mdash; retain exclusively the right to dispose of the existing land banks and advance factories which were traditionally in the ownership of the old Industrial Development Authority.</P>
    <P>I am sure all Members will agree that for decades the IDA, in furthering the industrial policy outlined by the Government of the day, always took into account local needs, interests and concerns and also ensured that the land bank or advance factory was in keeping and sympathy with the environment in which it was located, whether it was a tourist environment or an industrial zone.  It seems this power is now being absorbed and concentrated in the personage of the chief executive of Forfás.</P>
    <P>I am asking that, in having the power to &ldquo;acquire, hold and dispose of land and other property or any interest therein&rdquo;, no disposals would be undertaken without prior consultation with local development organisations and bodies such as the county enterprise boards, local authorities, local development agencies, area partnership boards and Leader groups.  These are the people who, as the Minister said, are most aware of their area's needs.</P>

      <P>If property to be disposed of was put up for public tender or auction, all of these organisations would know about it.  I do not believe any organisation should have the right to have first or second look at a proposed development with an opportunity to purchase it.  If a body has property to sell it should always be put on the open market.</P>

      <P>I understood from Senator Mooney's contribution that he is concerned that the county enterprise boards should be consulted before a disposal. The amendment is not specific and states &ldquo;local development organisations and bodies&rdquo;.  How wide would that circle be?  I have that reservation about the terminology used in the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I deliberately made it wide ranging in order not to tie the hands of the Minister or the chief executive. I have very specific experience of property vested in the ownership of the Industrial Development Authority which was not sold by public auction and did not even come into the public domain, where an individual approached Forfás which, in turn, was prepared to sell without any consultation. This is a flaw in the legislation.</P>
      <P>We have been talking up to now about local involvement and empowerment.  Surely, the argument cannot now be turned on its head to say that we will now vest this power exclusively in the chief executive of Forfás? All I am asking for is local consultation and I have left it deliberately wide ranging to allow the Minister to define what he or she believes to be local development organisations and bodies and how they go about that consultation process.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have real problems with this amendment.  The Senator may misunderstand what is happening.  We are proposing that Forfás, which has since the 1993 Act held responsibility for the land and property portfolios, hand that responsibility back to the IDA.  These decisions will not be in the hands of the chief executive of Forfás but in the hands of the IDA with its regional offices and its access to the regional directors to consult on any disposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="159" /> What the Senator is putting forward has potentially very serious and damaging implications.  It would mean that on every occasion the IDA consulted on an incoming project &mdash; confidential consultations on the development of the project and access to land and factory space &mdash; there would have to be additional circuitous consultation.  I do not see how that would be helpful and it would be very cumbersome.  For example, if a company renting factory space from the IDA decided to purchase that space &mdash; which we are very keen to see happen as we want to use that money for industrial development purposes &mdash; that would have to go through a process of consultation which I cannot see having any beneficial effect.</P>
    <P>If the Senator is concerned that there might be a planning issue if the IDA proposed to bring in a project with environmentally damaging implications, such a case would have to go through the planning process.  If it wanted to change the use of an existing factory it would also have to go through the planning process.  The proposer would consult locally as part of that planning process. That is adequately covered by the normal planning process and the IDA cannot sidetrack local concerns.  What the Senator is putting forward is not the correct way to deal with what is adequately dealt with in our planning laws.  Environmental and other concerns about a project can be hammered out with An Bord Pleanála and the IDA has no exemptions.</P>
    <P>If the Senator is concerned that the IDA might decide that it no longer wanted to hold its land bank in a certain area for industrial purposes, he will see that I have dealt with that under subsection (4).  The IDA should take a commercial approach to its land bank but it cannot get into the property development business.  We do not want to see the IDA buying and selling land for commercial purposes which is nothing to do with its mandate.  If it decided to dispose of land which it acquired under its industrial mandate for non industrial <Col N="160" /> purposes, that would come back to me as Minister before it would be approved because, essentially, they are moving from their industrial mandate and disposing of property.  In general that is a good thing but not in every case.  I do not want the IDA to become mini-property developers and that is why I require ministerial involvement.  If the Senator has concerns we could require local consultation before ministerial approval is sought for the disposal of land for nonindustrial purposes.  However, I see no merit in it from an industrial development perspective.  We do not want the IDA bound up in cumbersome procedures which could only damage its capacity to be flexible and deal with issues and companies in a confidential way.</P>
    <P>Local concerns will be properly dealt with in the planning process, as we have seen in many instances.  I appreciate the Senator's point but the amendment does not achieve his objective.  He is right to be concerned that industrial development would take account of environmental matters and that decisions about the property portfolio would be related to the regional director of Forbairt or the IDA.  I am happy that regional directors would be intimately involved in decisions about disposals as a matter of course but a wider round of consultations would limit the flexibility of the IDA and damage its greatest selling point.</P>
    <P>It has been a non-bureaucratic organisation with the capacity to deal with people in a confidential way.  It has short communication lines and can get things done through good links with local authorities and Government.  Prior consultation could damage the flexibility and be counterproductive.  Other procedures could ensure consultation with IDA or Forbairt regional directors when they are disposing of property for purposes which are unrelated to their mandate but I could not allow a situation where every disposal of property, even to an existing tenant, would involve some form of consultation.  That would be neither helpful nor fruitful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I wanted to clarify.  I have no monopoly on wisdom but my reading of section 3 did not indicate that this was a reversal.  I understood that land and advance factories in the ownership of the Industrial Development Authority up to 1993 were now being transferred to Forfás.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>When Forfás was established it retained the property portfolio pending a decision as to how to deal with the operations of Forbairt and the IDA, as both had an interest in the land banks and the advance factories. A consultancy examined how best to handle this issue.  As a result of that consultancy and a review by the EU operational programme personnel, it was decided that the best way to handle it was to transfer the land back to the IDA as is now provided for in subsection (2).</P>
      <P>In future, the IDA will hold the land bank and the estates but this has been done in full consultation with Forbairt to ensure its interests will not be damaged. The most important role of advance factories or land banks is in the context of incoming investment.  The most important consideration was that the IDA would have that facility and, for that reason, it is best that it manages the land bank.  It would be senseless if the IDA had an industrial estate in which three blocks were owned and managed by Forbairt and four owned and managed by the IDA.  There should be uniform management and that was the background to the decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regional structure of the IDA will deal with these issues.  Forfás will have <Col N="162" /> a role only in relation to its own buildings. We are reverting to the previous situation while taking account of the existence of Forbairt and the IDA.  We wanted to be sure that the arrangements relating to land and advance factories protected both their interests satisfactorily. The powers are not being sucked out of the regions and into a central body.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment seemed to make a lot of sense.  I congratulate Senator Mooney on his motivation. However, having heard the Minister explain the problems it would create, I understand why it would be an impossible task.</P>
      <P>I was in America last year where I met an American who thinks the world of Ireland but swears he will never open a factory here.  He is on a number of boards and says he will work hard against ever employing people here again.  I was jolted by this.  He said it was because we do not understand business in Ireland.  He had a bad experience here some years ago.  I am determined to make sure that never happens again and I examine Bills to see if they contain anything likely to discourage people from opening factories here.</P>
      <P>In spite of the fact that I came in here determined to support the amendment, the Minister has convinced me that we must simplify the process of encouraging people to select Ireland against fierce competition from other European countries in Europe rather than make it more bureaucratic.  When selling a factory to a potential investor, prior consultation with local development organisations or bodies could delay the crucial moment of decision making and on that basis I support the Minister.  If there is a problem we should find some other way around it rather than accepting an amendment which, despite the best motivation, would hinder the process. The amendment is not in our best interests.</P>

      <P>I want further clarification. I am grateful to Senator Quinn for <Col N="163" /> his tacit support of the thrust of the amendment.  The purpose of an amendment is to get clarification and, as has happened in this instance, reassurance. Since 1993, Forfás has had responsibility for the land bank and advance factories. They could have disposed of them without any of the consultative procedures which had been in place within the IDA structure at regional and national level.</P>
      <P>My concern was that in this interregnum power appeared to be vested in the chief executive of Forfás and its board, because of this legislative vacuum.  Taking on board the Minister's point regarding planning and obligations, I was concerned about the one to one relationship between an entrepreneur or a potential purchaser approaching Forfás and an arrangement being arrived at.</P>
      <P>It appears that the policy of the IDA &mdash; perhaps the Minister will clarify this &mdash; has been to dispose of the land banks and the advance factories where they have not been either filled or built on.</P>

      <P>There has been a consultative process, even if it has been informal.  I appreciate the Minister's remarks.  Like Senator Quinn, I detest red tape and abhor bureaucracy.

It had it because under the structure of the legislation it had everything and delegated things one by one to the agencies as it saw fit.  The land was held back until it found a satisfactory way of dealing with it.  I assure the Senator that it will revert to the original position and that his concerns will be met.  The purpose of the legislation is to press it back down to the rightful level, having worked out a <i>modus operandi</i> that defends the interest of both Forbairt, which deals with indigenous companies, and IDA Ireland.</P>

      <P>I welcome the increase in the sum in respect of SFADCo from £150 million to £200 million.  I am sure that the increase is well beyond the level of inflation.  SFADCo is doing a very necessary job in promoting industry in the mid west region and will put its additional resources to good value.</P>
      <P>When considering section 1, I suggested that the Minister might at an appropriate time examine the performance of the different promotional agencies in the industrial area.  Any such examination should include the performance of SFADCo.  This is not meant entirely as a criticism, but its performance should be subject to the same examination as all other development agencies.  A failure to do so could have the effect of allowing an element of smugness to develop within these institutions, which would not be a good thing.</P>
      <P>SFADCo will continue its good work for many years to come.  Its head office is located in County Clare and it has had a long association with the county.  Your predecessor in the Chair, a Chathaoirligh, reminded me that my constituency is a national one, and he was right. However, there is a tendency to look to one's county also.  For the first time there is no Clare person on the board of SFADCo, which many in my county find hard to accept.  I can assure Senator Magner we have many talented people suitable for board membership.  Perhaps this is another aspect the Minister will bear in mind when a suitable opportunity arises.</P>

      <P>The increase provided is considerably ahead of inflation.  The Industrial Development Acts provide, with regard to all these bodies, an upper limit on their total grant provision and, essentially, this is something that moves every few years.  However, it allows the legislative scrutiny to revert to the House.  Before they are granted further latitude with regard to their grant they must account for their stewardship every so often to the Oireachtas.  It is correct that we have this opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="166" /> The performance of SFADCo is kept under close scrutiny.  Even its larger projects must come to Government for assessment.  We are happy with the progress it is making.  The Senator is probably aware that there was a total revamp of its senior management in the last three years and that it has restructured its organisation.  We believe it is working well on foot of that.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister continue to monitor the development of the county enterprise partnership boards once they have been established on a statutory basis?  Like many of my colleagues, I speak with a vested interest, being an elected member of a local authority.  Senator Howard earlier referred to the origins of this concept.  I was totally opposed to what I saw as a diminution of the role of locally elected representatives when it was first initiated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could not believe that a Government would give legislative effect to such a concept which would be in control of industrial development in an administrative area where elected public representatives were already operating and in which the local authority had a great deal of expertise in business, the social area, economics, etc. I was delighted that there was, at least, an increase from two to four in the number of elected councillors to be included on the boards.  My understanding is &mdash; and I stand to be corrected because my experience is limited to my own region &mdash; that the elected representatives are the most active members of the county <Col N="167" /> enterprise boards.  They regularly attend meetings and are totally committed to the brief they have been given.  That is not to suggest that the other members are not.  However, the councillors on county enterprise boards are from all parties and are doing valuable work.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Howard's request for a review of the working of these bodies.  There might be a case for an increase in the representation of elected representatives in light of experience to date.  Why should we be seen as pariahs?  Why should we be excluded from boards operating in areas where we have gone before the public and are putting ourselves on the line? An increasing number of bodies are operating in the counties concerned and there is no obligation on their members to stand for election and there is no public accountability in the widest possible sense.  There is an obligation on the county enterprise boards to be transparent in their operations and about the moneys they grant.</P>
    <P>There is a need to look at the role of elected representatives <i>vis-á-vis</i> the developing bodies.  I welcome enthusiastically the initiative of the Minister's brother, the Taoiseach, and I have written to him on the subject.  At a recent meeting of the National Economic and Social Forum he threw away the script and spoke to the plenary session in Dublin Castle on the question of devolution and the relationship between bodies such as Leader, county enterprise boards, ADMs and so forth.  I hope that the devolution committee will report soon and that it will not be one of these commissions that go on forever and a day and are then quietly shelved.  I hope the recommendations in its report will be acted on as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I believe there is an inherent threat to democracy in all that is happening in this type of legislation.  If we arrive at a point &mdash; and it can happen within a few years &mdash; where it is no longer attractive or there is no longer an incentive for people to put themselves forward for locally elected bodies and where it is <Col N="168" /> more attractive to be on non-elected bodies, this House, and ultimately democracy, will suffer.  There will not be the continuum of talent the country needs in order to address issues and problems.  That is my real concern.  I do not have a monopoly on that concern &mdash; all of us share it, irrespective of political or party affiliation.</P>
    <P>If the issue cannot be addressed within the devolution committee, it should certainly be taken on board by this Government even if it means that the Government must break the trend which appears to have developed about 25 years ago where locally elected representatives were somehow deemed not capable or responsible enough to be included on regional and local bodies.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider directing that these organisations come together within one office premises in towns throughout the country?  I presume most of them are located in the main towns.  We can reduce the substantial administrative costs by bringing these bodies together and employing one receptionist, one telephonist and so forth.  There is a need for such a system. We are not providing that and we now have little Hitlers in every part of town running their own ship at the expense of the taxpayer.  More money would be available for investment and to help provide badly needed jobs.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>My question relates to how the county enterprise boards will monitor progress with regard to jobs or companies they have grant aided.  There is a history of problems with indigenous industry that has been grant aided.  Of the indigenous industries that were grant aided in 1983 half of them had gone out of business ten years later.  It is essential that money given out by county enterprise boards is to companies that will last so that jobs will continue.  It is <Col N="169" /> impossible to predict that when money is being given out; all the board can do is assess the business plan and whether the company is likely to succeed. However, it is important that there is continuous monitoring so that judgments can be made as to whether mistakes might have been made, how to learn from them and to ensure that money is given in such a way as to yield maximum benefit for the local area.  Is there a provision for such monitoring?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I warmly welcome the Senators' comments.  There will be a proper review of the success of this programme. However, as Senator Howard said, they have only been established and one cannot start reviewing and restructuring before they even get their remit.  This Bill gives them the remit we wish to see them fulfil.</P>
      <P>I agree that the county enterprise boards would add nothing if they just became a local bureaucracy doling out grants.  That would reinforce concerns about grant dependency and would not add value.  The added value is their capacity to ensure that the small businesses they assist do not fail.  There is greater emphasis on this occasion on issues, such as mentoring and hands-on support to small emerging businesses, to ensure that we do not have the 56 per cent failure rate &mdash; not necessarily grant aided &mdash; for small businesses.  That requires a degree of hand-holding with emerging enterprises at local level and the ability of a mentor to open doors for them to, perhaps, banks and customers and to be there to guide them on what can go wrong.  They might be under-capitalised at first and make all sorts of errors that should be foreseeable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much of the success of county enterprise boards will not be judged by the number of grant approvals they push through but by their capacity to enable the businesses to be sustained. That would be absolutely critical to an evaluation of their success.  They have evaluation committees that are quite rigorous in looking at the extent to which the ground has been prepared by <Col N="170" /> a small business when they put a project forward.</P>
    <P>With regard to the role of local authority members, anybody in elected office feels the same about a Bill that contains a standard section in which Oireachtas Members are taboo.  It is understandable at one level.  However, in an issue such as this I am pleased that there is a role for the local authority member on the county enterprise board. Much of what must be decided by the devolution commission is to carve out exactly what is the role of the local authority member.  They clearly do not have a role in deciding between specific projects. However, they have a critical role in defining the planned structure, the quality of the plans and the policies that will be pursued.  That is the purpose for which people are elected to office and that should be done at the lowest effective level.  The principle of subsidiarity underlies the devolution issue.  We are the most centralised State in Europe and we need to address that issue.  The proper role of the local authority member will be an important one.  They have been downgraded over the years and that must be addressed.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrelly made the interesting suggestion that there should be a single office and first stop shop.  I do not have the power to direct these matters. Leader and the partnership companies have their own remit, but I hope the county strategy team will realise the clear obvious local benefits to be had from integrating services.  It is not in my power to direct it but we are anxious that it occurs.  We have directed our own county enterprise boards that one of their key roles should be to develop a first stop shop where people can get access to information on the first call.</P>
    <P>In the evaluation of the role of county enterprise boards, the quality of the plans they put forward is crucial and that has been one important element of the county enterprise board.  They have had to put forward plans and their future access to development will be conditional on the quality of their plans. We are directing their development by <Col N="171" /> forcing them to plan and take a strategic view of their county and add value in that way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>One final question on the Minister's comments and what Senator Farrelly and my colleague Senator Fahey have been pushing over a long time, that is, this one stop shop notion.  Would the Minister and his Department be prepared to consider funding initiatives in this regard?  I mentioned earlier that an initiative in Sligo was initiated by Sligo County Council. As I understand it &mdash; I am not in that jurisdiction so I have based my comments on the information given to me &mdash; they are currently in the process of acquiring property which will house the various local bodies.</P>
      <P>Not every county will be in a position to do this; presumably they are receiving grant aid.  It may be that they are planning to locate this new office under the urban renewal scheme so they will get tax relief.  Would the Department, through the county enterprise board with, for example, European funding &mdash; many of these are European funded organisations anyway &mdash; be prepared to push the matter by suggesting some form of finance or support?  This is vital. The point has been made here repeatedly and it needs to be said again that it is not feasible to expect business people to travel all over their county.  People complain about the time wasted and the bureaucracy and red tape involved.  A one stop shop would go a long way towards minimising that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My final question is about the operation of the county enterprise boards. Coming from a tourism orientated county, my understanding is that the county enterprise boards do not fund or grant aid projects unless there is a specific job creation element to them. Where does tourism come into that? Why do the county enterprise boards not fund tourist projects that would promote and enhance the county and which would ultimately bring people into it?  I am thinking about the arts and culture, <Col N="172" /> music and the visual amenities.  If a company wishes to travel that road, the county enterprise boards will not fund it.  That needs to be looked at.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difficulty in deciding at my level that there will be a single office because essentially the county enterprise boards and the Leaders have different administrative budgets.  It is a local issue and they have to work out the most cost effective way of handling that.  We cannot grant aid the purchase of a building for them. They have a budget within which they have to arrange for the rental of suitable space and the recruitment of their staff. There are clear benefits to be had from doing that in a way that gives the best local service by having an integrated service.</P>
      <P>Through our soft supports we support the idea of a first stop shop advice content and they have access to funds from my Department to fund the advisory element of that.  If they establish a first stop shop location they have soft support funds to make that an effective service so that when people walk in they have access to suitable information.  In that sense we are developing that idea as best we can.</P>
      <P>The other issue the Senator raised is that of specific job content, particularly in relation to tourism.  The county enterprise boards follow a national tourism policy by which they must abide but a significant number of tourism projects come forward within the county enterprise board.  There have been tourism projects and Leader would be more involved in the tourism related area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My understanding is that they can only grant aid in relation to specific projects but they have plans to develop other concepts that would help develop the tourism strategy of the county.  The Senator is correct that, where someone comes with a project there must be a job content, they will not give out money unrelated to an employment content but through their other mechanisms of activity they can support, for example, a specific training initiative related to <Col N="173" /> tourism where an infrastructural weakness in the training area had been identified with a number of local tourism businesses.  They could support the development of a response to that but there is a difference between doing that and giving out grant aid so they would have to have identified a specific service as an area where there is a gap with an opportunity for them to fill it through soft support.  There is some flexibility there.  The position is not quite as black as the Senator might feel, that is, that they cannot support anything that does not have a broad infrastructural lift for the county.  They can do that but not through project grant aid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to respond to the matter I am raising. However, I must express my disappointment that the Minister for Justice did not feel it worth her while to come here for this most important Adjournment debate.</P>
      <P>My purpose in raising this matter is to ask the Minister for Justice if she is aware that Garda strength in Galway city is down by 22 since January 1994 with at least a further five retirements by January next and if she will outline the number of Garda appointments she now proposes for Galway city and the timescale for those appointments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="175" /> The original matter I submitted was to ask the Minister if she is aware that only five gardaí manned the operational unit in Galway city on the nights of Friday, 21 October, and Saturday, 22 October last.  Those inadequate manning levels are now the norm in the city. On the weekend in question the reported crime spree included six stolen cars, eight cars had been broken into, numerous house break-ins and two armed robberies.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister accept that her statement to the Dáil in April that the Garda authorities were satisfied that the strength at Mill Street Garda station was adequate to meet the policing needs of Galway city is inaccurate?  I am particularly concerned about answers given by the Minister to me and the Dáil which indicate that Garda strengths in Galway are adequate and that the level of crime and vandalism is acceptable.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to confirm that there are now 22 fewer gardaí at Mill Street Garda station compared to the number stationed there in January 1994. This reduction is due to retirements, promotions and transfers.  During this period there were only four appointments to the station.  I want the Minister to confirm that there are 100 more gardaí in Limerick than in Galway, despite the fact that the Galway borough has the same population as Limerick. Does the Minister accept there is an immediate need for an extra 20 gardaí to be appointed to Galway and that 50 gardaí are needed to combat the increasing levels of crime in the city and surrounding areas?</P>
    <P>Because of the low manning levels at Mill Street I want the Minister to confirm that operating units now have only a skeleton staff.  As I stated earlier, there were only five gardaí on duty in the whole city on Friday, 20 October, and Saturday, 21 October.  The incidence of crime in the city that weekend involved cars being stolen and broken into and houses being ransacked.  The house of a couple from the Newcastle area of the city, who were on their <Col N="176" /> honeymoon, was ransacked that weekend. A number of joy riders operated in the city on the night of Friday, 20 October.  On Galway's main street, which is one way, a stolen car was driven at high speed against the traffic.</P>
    <P>This situation is intolerable for the people of Galway and, particularly, for the gardaí in the city who are now totally frustrated by the lack of manpower and resources to provide an effective deterrent to such crimes.  The Garda is now saying publicly that morale is at an all time low in Galway.  I ask the Minister to give me an undertaking with regard to the appointment of gardaí to Galway, to indicate the numbers he feels are required there and when it is intended to make those appointments.</P>
    <P>I also wish to raise the issue of the Garda complaints procedures.  In some cases a great deal of time is taken up by senior members of the force investigating individual gardaí following complaints by people, many of whom have significant criminal records.  The vast majority of complaints are spurious and are designed to delay the investigation of crime and to frustrate Garda procedures in dealing with the criminals concerned.  There is now a need to examine the whole complaints procedure to ensure that the abuse&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of this mechanism by people with criminal records is put to an end.  This is relevant because some weeks ago in Galway city there was a major battle on the streets involving a number of well-known criminals.  They were arrested and have since been convicted but they made a series of complaints against gardaí in Galway which is frustrating the Garda in its efforts to deal effectively with these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this era of openness and accountability I want accurate and specific answers to the questions I raised.  I hope the Minister of State's reply will not be the usual Civil Service speak in an <Col N="177" /> attempt to gloss over the major problems which are now widespread for people living in Galway due to the levels of crime and vandalism.  I do not want a rerun of the information we have been fed in the past from Garda headquarters and the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the facts issued by the Department and Garda headquarters do not accord with the situation on the ground.  The crime figures are watered down and they do not reflect the unacceptable levels of crime on the ground.  It seems to be the case that when the Department hops a ball to Garda headquarters the response of the latter is &ldquo;how high?&rdquo; in an effort to portray a satisfactory response to crime.  It is time for the Department and Garda headquarters to come clean and admit that there is a totally inadequate response to criminals.  There is an urgent need for a series of initiatives to ensure that the considerable advantages enjoyed by criminals over the rest of society are addressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Justice is engaged in other serious and important matters this afternoon and this is why she is not in the House, although she would like to be here.  I am sorry that the presence of the Minister of State at the Department is not good enough but the Senator will have to put up with me.  I am amused to hear some of the comments made by him.  One could be excused for thinking that deficiencies in the criminal justice system and increases in crime have occurred since his party went out of Government ten months ago.  This situation has not developed overnight and we are doing our best to grapple with these problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to clarify the position regarding Garda strength in Mill Street in Galway and to speak about the policing arrangements for Salthill and the Galway west division.  I want to explain that the deployment of Garda manpower and resources to individual areas is a matter for the Garda <Col N="178" /> authorities.  I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the present strength of Mill Street divisional headquarters is 127.  While this represents a reduction of 27 compared to 1 January 1994, it is partly due to the fact that a district headquarters was established in Salthill on 16 May 1994 and 12 members were transferred there from Mill Street. Prior to that, Salthill was policed from Mill Street.  The present combined strength of Mill Street and Salthill district headquarters is 175 compared to 183 on 1 January 1994.</P>
    <P>I also understand that the projected retirements between now and the end of January 1996 at Mill Street Garda station is four.  The manpower needs of both Mill Street and Salthill stations will be kept under continuous review, as well as those of other stations in the Galway west division.</P>
    <P>I refute the allegation made by Senator Fahey about the numbers of gardaí operating in Galway city on the nights in question.  While I am unable to provide this House with the precise numbers on duty at that time on the grounds of security and in the interests of crime prevention generally, I have been assured by the Garda Commissioner that the number of gardaí on duty was considerably higher than that mentioned by the Senator.</P>
    <P>As regards crime in Galway city, I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the provisional crime figures for 1994 for the Mill Street area show a decrease of over 12 per cent compared to the previous year.  I am further informed that this downward trend appears to be holding this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the reply but it does not answer the question and that is partly the reason there is so much crime in Galway.  I hope the Minister does not believe what he has read out because it is not correct.  I know there were no more than five people involved because the Garda Síochána told me.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Justice is more than adequate to take this matter and I am sure he will be able to respond positively to my request.</P>
      <P>I have had difficulties getting a response to this issue so, perhaps, the Minister might take it up with the appropriate authorities.  I understand that Departments are busy but they are well staffed.  Senator Manning and I share a secretary who helps us with our political business and also helps to keep this House running, which is done efficiently and effectively.  This proves that quality is better than quantity.</P>
      <P>This visa, which has been delayed, is urgently required for the development of a restaurant enterprise in the Dún Laoghaire area.  The Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Bruton, issued a work permit some time ago and he was satisfied with the applicant's credentials.  I hope this enterprise will develop and will create additional local employment which is in everyone's interest.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to ensure that a positive decision is made as soon as possible.  We must ensure that this enterprise helps local development and creates employment.  I ask the Minister to respond positively; perhaps, he could pass on my earlier comments to the appropriate authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will ensure that the Senator's comments are passed on to the relevant authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned has been issued with a work permit for the period 1 August 1995 to 31 July 1996 and has applied for a work entry visa.  Certain nationals, including Chinese, are required to possess a valid Irish entry <Col N="180" /> visa prior to their entry to the State. Visa applications may be made to any Irish embassy or consular post.  The person concerned, a Chinese national, requires a valid visa each time he enters the State.  Failure to possess a valid visa is a reason for refusing a person entry to the State.</P>
    <P>An applicant for a work visa should, as a minimum, provide the following information: proof that the relevant work permit has been approved or issued by the Department of Enterprise and Employment to the person's employer; details of period of employment; details of a reference in the State and any other relevant information deemed necessary with regard to the application.  The issue of a work permit to a prospective employer does not automatically grant permission to enter or reside in the State.  The alien must obtain the correct entry visa to be allowed to travel to Ireland and, if allowed to enter, must register with the Garda Síochána within three months of arrival.</P>
    <P>In this case a standard check of the person's visa application showed that he declared his profession as farmer.  Given that his intention was to come here to work as a chef, it was decided that his chef's certificate should be verified with the Chinese Ministry of Labour.  We have been made aware of a problem of forged cook's certificates being presented by visa applicants.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Senator will appreciate the importance of carrying out appropriate checks to ensure that visas are issued to bona fide applicants only and that non-Irish or non-EEA nationals securing jobs here do so on the basis of legitimate qualifications.  I understand that confirmation was received today that the certificate has been verified so a visa will issue in this case.  I am sure that is the positive response the Senator requested when introducing this matter.</P>
