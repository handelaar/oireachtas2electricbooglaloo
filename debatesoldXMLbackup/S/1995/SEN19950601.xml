      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is items 1 and 2.  Item 1 will be taken until 1 p.m. with a sos from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. and item 2 will be taken at 2 p.m.  I think the House would like me to compliment the Information Officer of both Houses on the fine programme which went out on &ldquo;Cursaí&rdquo; during the week giving details of the operation of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It was a fine piece of work which should be complimented.</P>

      <P>There was a very good debate on tourism in the other House over the last two days and I listened to the Minister speak on a motion put down by the Fianna Fáil Party.  There is much expertise in this House about tourist boards and investment in various areas.  It could be dealt with by a Private Members Motion, but I would prefer if the Leader would agree to set aside a Thursday afternoon in the near future <Col N="1562" /> as the high season approaches.  We would all have an opportunity to give our views on the only sector of the economy where there is major growth.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Leader's point about the &ldquo;Cursaí&rdquo; programme. The Information Officer, Verona Ní Bhroinn, is to be congratulated. The programme could be useful at school level.  We have discussed on many occasions the need to bring an understanding of the Oireachtas and Leinster House to a wider audience. Making the programme more accessible to schools should be considered.</P>
      <P>The Ethics in Public Office Bill will be before the House shortly.  However, I am of the view that perhaps we should have a discussion before that Bill.  Political correctness, attitudes towards politics and attracting people into political life is increasingly becoming a matter of concern to everybody, regardless of the side of the House on which they sit.  Do we need a broader debate before we look at the Bill, or is the Leader happy to simply leave the Bill take its place? The debate in the other House has been pointed and difficult.  We could simply tie ourselves up in knots and create a situation where people will not be attracted into politics, which would be the worst of all options, while trying to strike a balance between transparency and other concerns.  Is this best done through the discussion of the Bill, or could it be done in another way?</P>
      <P>Item 3 on the Order Paper is Report Stage of the Civil Legal Aid Bill.  Do we have a date on which that will be taken?</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader of the House if in future, when streets adjacent to the Houses of the Oireachtas are blocked, Members might be alerted in advance.  I believe that this morning Members are late for the sitting of this House because streets are blocked.  This is the second time in the last two months that Dawson Street has <Col N="1563" /> been blocked.  While I welcome both events &mdash; the celebration for Steve Collins and the visit of Prince Charles &mdash; they coincide with the start of business in the House.  On both occasions I have had difficulty in arriving in the House on time.  I barely made it this morning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I endeavoured earlier to ascertain from the Leader the position in relation to county roads.  We got an undertaking from the Minister for the Environment that he would make some announcements about additional funding for the upkeep of county roads. Council management are making people redundant because they do not have sufficient money.  Can we get a clearer answer from the Leader?</P>
      <P>May I also ask the Leader to draw the Minister for the Environment's attention to a serious fish kill in Cork in the last few days?  Miles and miles of one of the most outstanding fisheries in the southwest was wiped out.  There is a threat to fisheries as the start of the summer season approaches and the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for the Marine should do something about it.</P>

    <P>Having read the statement issued by the Government in relation to the Attorney General's Office and the enormous amount of technology that is being installed in that office in terms of PCs, information retrieval systems and <Col N="1564" /> so on, it is still an outstanding disgrace in the House that despite what we have tried to do, and the Leader has tried to do in his capacity as Vice-Chairman of the Joint Services Committee, nothing has been done in the Library to enable Members to participate in the way we govern this country.  There is no information available except through the efforts of Ms Maura Corcoran and her small staff.  Frankly, it is disgraceful that immediate action cannot be taken, with all the information technology now available, linking into databases throughout the world, but here in the House, where Members are expected to compete with all sorts of vested interests and powerful lobbies, all of whom are equipped with the latest information techniques, we are still living back in the '40s and '50s.  It might be timely that the House would consider a debate on the issue of services in the House, particularly with regard to technology.</P>

      <P>The Leader of the House will be aware that the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, received a 40 page memorandum from the Garda Representative Association two days ago which put forward their proposals for ending the damaging divisions within the Garda Síochána.  The Minister said she would consider these proposals. Will the Leader ask the Minister to come into the House when she has considered the report to inform us of the proposals she intends to bring in to end this damaging split which has had the effect of undermining public confidence in the Garda while it continues?</P>

      <P>I add my voice to the sense of indignation expressed by Senator Magner and others about the neglect of the Library.  I recall an excellent debate here to which Senators Manning and Magner contributed.  I remember Senator Magner holding up some of the neglected volumes in the House.  It is an absolute disgrace.  Why <Col N="1565" /> can we not do something about it?  All the sentiments have been expressed and are agreed.  When can something be done about it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Wright raised the question of tourism and I think he said it was one of the many booming aspects of the economy at present.  He raised an interesting point, as did Senator O'Toole, on the question of ethics.  Day in, day out I am asked, quite legitimately, to make time available for issues which are of concern to Members and I very much want to do that.  One of the proposals I will put before the small committee which is meeting to review our procedures during the recess is that we might have what is called a topical hour like the German Parliament has. Each week, perhaps on Thursday afternoons, issues could be nominated by Members in advance and discussed. That might take up some of the burden of issues which the House would legitimately like to discuss and which I certainly would like to provide time for.</P>
      <P>On the question of tourism, Senator Wright, I will try to make time available within the next two weeks.  It is topical and timely for that.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole's question about a discussion of ethics in politics is timely. I am a little concerned as to the structure it might take and I will discuss with the Senator afterwards how it might be done.  I am certainly not opposed to it.</P>
      <P>Senator Fitzgerald raised the legitimate issue of streets being blocked off. Under the Constitution, we have a right to go unimpeded to meetings of either House of the Oireachtas.  Obviously, if there are major events, we like everybody else must be inconvenienced.  Nonetheless, prior notice should be given of what streets are being blocked off so that Members can make other arrangements. I will convey that concern to the relevant authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Daly asked me once more about county roads.  I conveyed to the <Col N="1566" /> Minister the urgency &mdash; and there is urgency &mdash; and as soon as I have information I will come back to him on that. I was not aware of the fish kill, but obviously that is disturbing.  Perhaps we can discuss it later.</P>
    <P>Senators Magner and Lee rightly raised the question of the Library.  I have been thinking about it and I intend, in the first place, to write to the Taoiseach on behalf of Seanad Éireann to ask that the matter be treated with urgency.  If need be, it is a matter on which this House could put legitimate pressure on the Government.  The Taoiseach is supportive and I think it is a question of jogging his memory to see if we can get action there.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy raised the question of the Garda representative body.  I am not sure a debate in the House would necessarily help to resolve the dispute, which has been a scandal to the entire country for a long period of time.  If a debate would be helpful, I would support one.  It is a dispute which has defied the last Minister for Justice and it does not appear to be any nearer a solution at the present time, but I will convey the sentiments of the Senator to the Minister.</P>

    <Title>Occupiers' Liability Bill, 1994: Committee and Final Stages.</Title>
    <P>Government amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>In page 3, subsection (1), to delete lines 10 to 17, and substitute: &ldquo;not including an entrant who is so present and is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a member of the occupier's family who is ordinarily resident on the premises,</P>
    <P>(b)  an entrant who is present at the express invitation of the occupier of such a member, or</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1567" /> (c)  an entrant who is present with the permission of the occupier or such a member for social reasons connected with the occupier or such a member;&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of amendment No. 1 is to correct an anomaly which arises out of the way the definitions of recreational user and visitor are expressed.  These definitions are interlocking so that entrants engaged in recreational activity, who are excluded from the definition of recreational user, are given the higher duty of care owed to visitors.  These entrants are specified in paragraphs (a) to (c) of that definition and cover, for example, entrants who are expressly invited to engage in such activity.</P>
      <P>However, the result is that two categories of entrant are excluded from the definition of visitor without adequate justification.  These are entrants who are expressly invited by members of the occupier's family for non-recreational activities and entrants who are permitted by them to enter for social but not recreational purposes.  This anomaly is being corrected in the amendment by the redrafting of the exclusionary words in the definition of recreational user so that paragraphs (b) and (c) of the definition no longer refer to entrants present for recreational purposes only but extend to those invited or permitted to be present for any purpose whatever.</P>
      <P>The definition of visitor, which specifically includes entrants mentioned in those paragraphs, is thereby enlarged to include all such entrants.  This is really a very technical amendment but I believe Senators will agree that the anomaly I referred to should be eliminated as proposed in the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that there has been quite an amount of concern expressed by farming organisation leaders in particular about what <Col N="1568" /> they fear is an absence of cover especially for visiting children, whether invited or permitted.  Quite an amount of lobbying has taken place and has been constant for a number of years.  Is the amendment designed to cover the fears expressed by the leaders of the farming organisations, or is it a further amendment to strengthen the existing cover?  The leading farming organisations have been critical of the fact that the Bill as originally published did not go far enough to offer protection to farmers, especially those with heritage areas on their land.  The Poulnamrone dolmen is a famous site in the Burren in north Clare, but the owner of the land has fenced it off for a number of years because of the fear of liability arising from accidents happening to people going to see the dolmen.  It was anticipated that the Bill would totally safeguard such farmers, but there is still anxiety that it does not cover the situation. Will this amendment go further towards achieving that or does something more need to be done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the farming organisations are now reasonably happy with the amendments made to the Bill in the Dáil and with those proposed here.  Following extensive consultation with the farming organisations, we made a number of critical amendments to the Bill in the Dáil.  I believe Members commented favourably on the alterations we made on Second Stage.  The position now provided for is that to qualify as a visitor a person requires the express invitation of the occupier.  In other words, even an implied invitation would leave the person in the lesser recreational user category as opposed to being in the visitor category.  It would require an actual express invitation before the entrant would qualify to be a visitor.  I believe the organisations are happy with it.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1569" /> Government amendment No. 2:</P>
    <P>In page 3, subsection (1), line 25, to delete &ldquo;such an entrant &ldquo;and substitute &ldquo;an entrant, other than a recreational user,&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Section 2 agreed to.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister elaborate on the section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>This section states in straightforward terms the duty which an occupier of premises owes to visitors under the Bill.  The section defines the common duty of care basically as a duty to take such care as is reasonable in all the circumstances having regard to the care which a visitor may reasonably be expected to take for his or her own safety.  It equates approximately to the old negligence provisions and provides for contributory negligence by the entrant.  It takes all circumstances into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This common duty of care is the higher standard of care owed by an occupier to a visitor, that is, a person who comes at the express invitation of the occupier or a person who comes as of right &mdash; a person who comes on the premise by virtue of an express or an implied term in a contract.  This is the higher standard of care to be contrasted with the much lower standard provided for in the next section, which is the lesser duty owed to recreational users <Col N="1570" /> and trespassers.  They both fall into the same category of liability.  The common duty of care approximates to the normal negligence standards, to what is reasonable having regard to the circumstance in each particular case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) No person entering on premises, or being thereon or leaving thereof with any criminal intent or whilst entering on, or being there or leaving the premises commits or attempts to commit any criminal offence will have any cause of action against an occupier of the same premises arising from his entry thereon, his being there or leaving the same premises.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to insert a new subsection to give protection to the occupier.  The Minister will see that it is in line with the thrust of the Bill, that is, to give the occupier better protection, especially against anyone trying to commit an offence or a crime while on the premises.  I look for a positive reply from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I inserted a provision in the Bill on Report Stage in the other House to meet the case made that persons <Col N="1571" /> who enter premises for criminal purposes or to commit offences while there should not be entitled to any compensation for injury sustained on the premises whether or not the occupier had acted with reckless disregard towards them.  That provision is now contained in section 4(3).</P>
      <P>It exempts an occupier from liability to any person who enters for the purpose of committing an offence against the person or property of the occupier or a family member or who commits such an offence while on the premises. It has an important qualification; it gives a court discretion to make an award if that would be required in the interests of justice.</P>
      <P>That qualification was made because there could be cases where, if there was no such discretion, justice would not be done.  For example, some offences can be quite trivial and predictable, such as raids by juveniles on apples trees each autumn.  It would be wrong for the law to allow an occupier who behaves with reckless disregard in that context a complete exemption from liability. However, it was represented in the debate on that provision that the definition of &ldquo;offence&rdquo; did not cover cases where the offence was directed not against the occupier or the occupier's family, but against a neighbour or the neighbour's property.</P>
      <P>My amendment is designed to meet that point and it amends the definition of &ldquo;offence&rdquo; by extending it to any offence whether or not it is committed against the occupier or a member of the occupier's family.  Because the Senator's amendment could result in injustice in relation to the trivial kind of conduct I mentioned, I regret I cannot accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>In our view the Minister is still not covering a situation where people who enter with criminal intent can still sue the occupier for liability.  Is that not still the case, although there is <Col N="1572" /> an improvement from the original situation? The fact is that those who break into premises for the purpose of committing a criminal act can, after suffering injury or whatever, sue the occupier for liability.  Is that situation covered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>On reading this section, I believe the Minister is taking a reasonable approach.  I understand and appreciate Senator Kiely's concerns, but we must accept that there could be situations like that which the Minister outlined where it would be wrong to give blanket coverage to somebody to take any type of action against somebody committing a slight misdemeanour like those entering orchards and premises.  I do not believe a person should be covered to take any action against people in such circumstances.  At the same time, we have seen cases in the US where people committing larceny, entering premises with intent to steal, sued the owner and received considerable damages.  That could never be tolerated. Such situations are covered by the amendment the Minister introduced in the Dáil, having respect for a situation where a blanket coverage might be unjust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's reply that reckless action cannot be taken by occupiers against trivial trespassers and so on.  However, is the Minister satisfied that the occupier is protected sufficiently against any criminal act by any trespasser on their lands or premises?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not talking about the trespasser situation here but about where a person comes onto land to commit an offence or commits an offence. Such a person will have no claim unless the interests of justice require it.  My point is that that proviso has to be there to cover certain types of situations.  For example, a 12 year old girl going into a garden to pick a flower is committing <Col N="1573" /> larceny, which is a criminal offence. However, I do not think that we would want to say in such a case the occupier would be at liberty to act with reckless disregard towards that child with impunity.  That is why we have to put in the proviso.  I submit that there is a bar on a claim by a person who comes to commit an offence and a court will be debarred from awarding damages in such a case unless the interests of justice require it.  That is intended to cover that exceptional kind of situation.</P>
      <P>The point was made by Deputy Woods in the other House that the way it was framed after Committee Stage there meant that the exemption would apply where a person came to commit an offence against the occupier of this particular land or against a member of the family of the person residing there. However, excluded from it would be the case where a person came through that land to commit an offence, not against that particular land but against a neighbour's land.  I have taken that point on board so that, even in a case where the offence would be intended to be committed against an adjoining land, there would also be a bar against a claim in the event of injury to such a person unless they would come within the proviso that the court would hold that the interests of justice required it.</P>
      <P>We have gone a long way on that and we are also including the category of an attempted offence as well as the committing of an actual offence.  If a person comes on land in an attempt to commit an offence, even if they did not succeed in committing the offence, they likewise would be debarred from bringing a claim under my amendment No. 6.</P>

      <P>I am sure that the Minister will agree that an occupier will have to take some action to protect their property if they see somebody entering their property.  What is the definition of &ldquo;reckless disregard&rdquo;?  How far can an occupier go to protect his property?</P>

      <P>The Minister gave a very innocent example of a child breaking into an orchard.  However, people are worried that if a criminal goes through a man's fields and breaks into his house to steal his property, wrecks the house, escapes and falls into the septic tank on his way out, he can then sue the owner. Can that happen under this legislation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>My question is to the proposers of the amendment.  What do they mean by &ldquo;attempts to commit any criminal offence&rdquo;?  How does one prove that somebody is attempting to commit a criminal offence?  It is open to a great deal of interpretation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Many things are open to interpretation and it is the job of the courts to interpret them, which they do. The point made by Senators Daly and Kiely is covered by section 8, which provides that:</P>
      <P>Nothing in this Act shall be construed as affecting any enactment or any rule of law relating to&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) self-defence, the defence of others or the defence of property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Kiely raised the question of what lengths a person could go to defend their person or family or property if somebody breaks in.  The answer is that they can take any step which is reasonably necessary.  However, a measure of proportionality is required by the law in that regard.  For example, if a person broke in armed with a stick, it would probably be regarded as excessive if the occupier came with a gun and deliberately shot them dead.  Whatever response was reasonably necessary is <Col N="1575" /> covered by those self defence provisions.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise that this is a different category from the reckless disregard position.  We are talking here about excluding a claim from a person who comes on land to commit an offence. While that person is a trespasser, they are doing more than that in that they are coming to commit an offence beyond simple trespass, which technically is not an offence.  Coming on land to trespass without doing damage is not an offence, although many people think that it is.</P>
    <P>When a person comes on land and commits an offence or attempts to commit an offence, they will have no claim unless the interests of justice require it. It is quite a major step forward to actually say that in that format.  It is a blanket exclusion, and because it is so broad ranging it was necessary to put in the proviso for exceptional cases where the interests of justice would require it.  For example, if an occupier acted with reckless disregard towards a child coming to pick a flower, they would not be allowed avail of the blanket exclusion which is provided for in other cases of commission of an offence on the person's land.</P>

      <P>This is the first of two amendments to subsection (2) of section 4 which contains various criteria to guide in determining whether an occupier has acted with reckless disregard towards a recreational user or trespasser.  The particular criterion with which the amendment is concerned is that specified in paragraph (e) of the subsection:</P>
      <P>the burden on the occupier of eliminating the danger or of protecting the person and property of the person from the danger, taking into account the difficulty, expense or impracticality of so doing, having regard to the degree of the danger;</P>
      <P>It was represented to me that a further relevant consideration which should be taken into account in assessing the burden on an occupier of eliminating a danger or protecting a person or a person's property from it should be the character of the premises, whether they be farmland, factories, shops or private houses.  The amendment is reasonable and makes the necessary addition to paragraph (e).</P>

Paragraph (g) is another of the criteria for determining whether there was reckless disregard on the part of an occupier towards recreational users or trespassers.  It requires account to be taken of their conduct and of the care they may reasonably be expected to take for their own safety.  The amendment requires regard to be had also when taking account of these matters to the extent of the entrant's knowledge of the premises.  Such knowledge or the absence of it could be very relevant in farmland situations.  I trust the House will agree that this is a useful requirement.</P>

      <P>In page 5, between lines 35 and 36, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(5) An occupier shall not be liable to a recreational user or trespasser in respect of any injury to the person or damage to the property of such person sustained or <Col N="1578" /> contributed to by reason of the ordinary use or storage of agricultural machinery for farming purposes.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage I mentioned the concern of this side of the House about this matter.  The purpose of the amendment is to ensure the occupier will not be liable for any damage caused to any person using machinery for agricultural purposes.  The occupier should be protected against such cases.  I am sure the amendment is reasonable and that the Minister will see it as such.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment proposes to exempt occupiers from liability for injury or damage caused by the ordinary use or storage of agricultural machinery for farming purposes.  The Bill does not deal with injuries caused by the use of machinery.  It is confined to those caused by dangers due to the state of the premises.  Dangers arising from the storage of machinery are provided for in the Bill.  I see serious objection to exempting any occupiers from liability if such dangers happen to arise in particular circumstances and they show reckless disregard towards the safety of anyone who may be injured by it.</P>
      <P>In this Bill we are striking a fair and reasonable balance between the rights and obligations of occupiers and those of the various categories of entrants.  So far as recreational users or trespassers are concerned, the occupier's duty is pitched at a lower level and simply requires the occupier not to injure them intentionally or to behave with reckless disregard towards them.  Before an occupier can be held in breach of that duty, all of the various criteria mentioned in section 4 must be given full consideration, including the fact that entrants are expected to exercise reasonable care for their own safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If farm machinery is stored in such a way that it constitutes a danger to persons who are or are likely to be in its vicinity and if the occupier in doing so has clearly acted with reckless disregard <Col N="1579" /> for those persons and injuries result, I cannot see why the occupier should not be liable.  The safety of those persons must be given due priority.  It would be wrong, in my view, to have the law as such that a person who behaved with reckless disregard for the safety of another should be exempted from liability for injuries sustained as a consequence. I think the principle enshrined in the Bill is right and should apply to all occupiers in all circumstances where dangers exist, whether on the land or in stationary equipment on it.  For these reasons I regret I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think any occupier would deal with machinery with reckless disregard.  If an agricultural contractor brings machinery which might have some fault on to a farm, I cannot see why the occupier should be liable for any injury which may be caused to any person using that machinery. The occupier should have better protection than that provided in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The only circumstances in which the occupier could be liable would be if the court was satisfied that the occupier, whatever he did or did not do, had acted with reckless disregard towards the person.  If the occupier has not done so, taking into account all the guidelines set out in section 4, the occupier is not liable.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister on his expeditious dealing with this complex legislation.  This issue has been the subject of controversy and has been serious in some tourist areas, especially in my own county, where many farms were locked up and important sites were fenced off.  Lemanea is one of the most famous heritage buildings in Ireland.  Its owner wired off the castle from visitors because of the fear of compensation claims arising from injuries people might sustain on their way in and out of the castle.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a balanced effort, but the message must go out that people will have to exercise care and caution because the Bill cannot cater for every situation.  Otherwise we may find there may be demands for further amendments to the legislation.  Everybody, whether they are owner occupiers or visitors, have a responsibility to take care.</P>
      <P>Everyone, whether the owner occupier or the visitor, has a responsibility to take care.  Even on minor fishing expeditions, anglers have been damaged by wire fences but it is beyond the capacity of anyone to remedy that because cattle must be prevented from wandering.  People visiting significant sites or angling in important fisheries will always have responsibility to the landowners as well as to themselves.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for acting speedily with this legislation and I hope it is successful.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on being open to improve the original Bill.  He listened to the farming and sporting organisations and politicians from all sides of the House who were concerned about the provision concerning minors and the mentally handicapped.  We <Col N="1581" /> should thank the field sports groups who lobbied strongly to bring this issue to the fore, the farming organisations and the Law Reform Commission, which did excellent work in its two reports to develop the legislation.

As an owner of land near a city, I had to discourage people from coming onto our land some years ago; that was the only step we could take within the remit of the law.  No occupier wants to stop people having the pleasure of walking through lands and enjoying the freedom of the countryside. I hope this Bill allows that to happen and that occupiers will no longer be forced to discourage people from entering their property.</P>
      <P>Much depends on how the Judiciary interprets the phrases &ldquo;wanton disregard&rdquo; and &ldquo;reckless disregard&rdquo; in the Bill.  I hope they are read in the manner intended by the drafters.  I wish the legislation well and, like the last speaker, I hope the insurance companies realise the onus is no longer on the occupier, it is shared by the visitor.</P>

The organisations were pleased with the amendments in the other House to the provisions on minors and entering land.  I also compliment Senator Neville because he introduced a Private Members' Bill to highlight the concern, which was also expressed by the Progressive Democrats. Overall I am happy and the people who were worried think this is good legislation.  As Senator Kelleher said, people can now visit land without occupiers being fearful of anything happening.</P>

      <P>I thank all Senators for their contributions and kind comments which I much appreciate. I am pleased the Bill has now been passed.  It represents a fundamental and radical change in the law as it has existed for hundreds of years.  As a student solicitor some 40 years ago I remember learning this branch of the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill brings about a fundamental change in the basis of liability for entry onto land.  This is a major change, not a trimming operation because we have repealed the old common law rules dealing with liability for occupation <Col N="1583" /> which have existed for centuries and which have been evolved by the courts.</P>
    <P>This change had to be made and one of the main objectives &mdash; although not the sole one &mdash; was to encourage tourism on lands.  Previously many landowners feared actions; the fear may not have been well based but it did exist. They therefore closed off their lands and blocked access to public and heritage sites.  That had potentially serious adverse affects for our crucial tourism industry.</P>
    <P>With the passing of the Bill, I hope all occupiers of land, particularly land containing heritage sites, realise the law has changed.  That will occur when the amendments made today are dealt with by the Dáil, which I hope will be soon. The regimen of legal liability will be different.</P>
    <P>I hope those who have closed off their land, as mentioned by Senator Kiely and others, will reopen it so that tourists from home and abroad will have free and open access to these heritage sites, which we are fortunate to have, which are important to preserve and are a significant part of our culture.  We want people to see them because they are of the greatest interest to so many of us. One of my greatest thrills is to travel around Ireland visiting these sites.  It is a wonderful right and everyone should have it.  We have made a contribution towards that and I thank Senators for their help in achieving it.</P>
    <P>I thank the officials in my Department who have worked so hard on this particularly complex legislation.  It may be a short Bill but it is an extremely complex area of law.  We have improved it considerably since it was originally introduced.  We have good, fair legislation now.  The matter will now be in the hands of the insurance companies and the courts.  It will take some time for it to settle down but we have done a good day's work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 13, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) The trading activities of an approved Stock Exchange shall not take place otherwise than in public.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, for coming to the House for this debate.  He was also here last week for the Second Stage debate when we recalled that the central function of this Bill is to bring the operation of the Irish Stock Exchange to Ireland.  The Irish Stock Exchange looks to London more than to Dublin, although some regulations are now being made here. However, reform must come ex-London. I welcome this Bill because it makes the Central Bank the regulatory authority of the Stock Exchange.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the trading activities on the floor of the Stock Exchange take place in public.  I do not know if this rule applies now, but I remember going to the Stock Exchange on one occasion and being told that I had to be accompanied by a person from one of its member firms.  I did not feel welcomed and it was not indicated to me that public facilities were available to view its important economic function. There is a precedent for this because the old coin exchange on Dame Street was open to the public as is the New York Stock Exchange.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There should be no mystery or surprise about raising capital or trading <Col N="1585" /> shares on an open market.  Many of these companies are public and have thousands or millions of shareholders. The public own the companies on the Stock Exchange, whether by direct share investment or through pension or mutual funds.  There is no reason the public should not be able to view the activities of the Stock Exchange as part of a healthy free enterprise economy. People may not avail of such an opportunity, but there is an onus on members of the Stock Exchange, if they are of the view that it would be dangerous or detrimental to trivialise the activities of the Stock Exchange, to advance that argument and to say why the public should not be allowed to attend.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say this is not necessary, but I ask him to consider an amendment to this section if he does not accept the one I have tabled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Mulcahy. If the Stock Exchange is to command the respect and support of the nation, it must operate in an open and transparent way.  We must move away from the old idea that the Stock Exchange is an insider's club, as it used to be, because it is there for the benefit of the many and not a few.  There was a time when the Stock Exchange was believed to exist for a small number of people.  Every pensioner and contributor to a pension fund is involved, although not directly, in the results of the Stock Exchange.</P>
      <P>I accept what Senator Mulcahy said &mdash; that the Minister may be able to explain why there is no need for this amendment.  I visited the Stock Exchange on a few occasions and I was surprised when I was told I had to be accompanied by a person from one of its member firms.  I am not sure if that is accurate.  Perhaps the Minister could put our minds at rest on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past we relied on our connection with the London Stock Exchange to build a reputation for the Irish Stock Exchange.  This Bill was introduced as a result of an EU Directive which states that every member state must have its <Col N="1586" /> own independent regulatory system.  It is ironic that Europe seems to be forcing us away from the integrated system we had with Great Britain.  This contrasts with what is happening elsewhere.  I hope the separation between the London and Irish Stock Exchanges will be seen as a first step towards a different type of integration, where each stock exchange will operate in a different member state.  This must happen in an open, clear and transparent way.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  We must ensure that the Stock Exchange does not operate behind closed doors and that we can visit it.  I hope the Minister will accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney) Avril Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Mulcahy for tabling this amendment. Although I do not agree with it, that does not mean I do not appreciate the reasons behind it.  Senator Quinn mentioned integration.  Although it starts with separation from the London Stock Exchange, it brings us into the mainstream of a European network where exchanges and people can operate in different countries.  It starts with separation, but it brings it into a European context.</P>
      <P>The amendment proposed by Senator Muclahy to section 9 would appear to require all the trading activities of an approved stock exchange to take place in public.  It is fair to say that when most people think of an exchange they still think of a trading floor with brokers shouting orders to each other.  This is an image from the past.  It does not match the reality of trading on modern stock exchanges.  On the Irish Stock Exchange, as in modem exchanges generally, most trading is done off the floor of the exchange, usually by telephone between brokers working from their offices on the basis of the most recent prices quoted on the exchange which will be available to the brokers and to any subscribers to the service on the screen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a simple reason for screen based trading; it is cheap, efficient and <Col N="1587" /> quick, for both stockbrokers and clients. It is the way business is done on modern exchanges and to require the Irish Stock Exchange to operate otherwise would be a step backwards.  I am not clear that this is what the Senator proposes.  I am taking his words rather literally.</P>
    <P>The role of the stock exchange in this trading environment is to ensure that the market operates efficiently and that all clients are treated fairly.  To this end member firms are required to inform the stock exchange of all deals done off the floor of the exchange within five minutes of the transaction taking place, and the exchange has indicated that in practice the exchange will be informed within one minute.  Prices are then posted on the screen by the exchange and are available to all other member firms.  If a transaction takes place after hours it must be communicated to the exchange before the following morning's opening and is posted on screen before the opening.</P>
    <P>The Irish Stock Exchange has detailed conduct of business rules which govern how the member firms of the exchange do business with their clients. They specifically require the member firms to deal to the best advantage of their clients in all circumstances.  As part of the enforcement process for these rules, the exchange monitors all trading on the exchange and keeps records which enable it to reconstruct all the details of a specific day's trading and of a specific transaction.</P>
    <P>The Irish Stock Exchange rules, including conduct of business rules for member firms, will, under the Bill, be subject to approval of the Central Bank and the bank will be able to require those rules to be amended where it considers this to be necessary.  In this context, because I assume Senator Mulcahy's amendment arises from a desire to ensure that investors are treated fairly, it is important to note that the Central Bank will be required, as regulator under the Bill, to act in such a way as to promote the proper and orderly regulation and supervision of stock <Col N="1588" /> exchanges and their member firms, the proper and orderly regulation of financial markets and &mdash; I stress this point &mdash; the protection of investors.</P>
    <P>The EU Investment Services Directive imposes detailed reporting requirements for transactions on stock exchanges which will apply to all European exchanges and which will he enforced in this country by the Central Bank as competent authority under the directive.  While I understand the motivation behind Senator Mulcahy's proposed amendment, I trust that I have explained why modern commercial realities dictate that much business here, as elsewhere, is done by brokers sitting in their offices rather than on the floor of the exchange.  We cannot put the clock back, but we can do our utmost to ensure that trading is conducted fairly, and Stock Exchange rules in addition to the Central Bank's regulation should ensure this.</P>

      <P>I accept the Minister's remarks.  The activities he mentions cannot be undertaken in public.  Perhaps my amendment is not worded accurately enough, but the Minister could have been more helpful if he proposed an amendment to the Bill which would incorporate what I wrongly assumed he might have known I was thinking.  I am referring to the trading floor.  The Minister will be aware that in other stock exchanges &mdash; for example, the New York Stock Exchange &mdash; there is a large trading area.  The trading floor in Anglesea Street is an open area where people can come and go.  The rationale behind my amendment was to cover the type of situation referred to by Senator Quinn, where somebody wanted to go down to the floor of the central exchange and see what was going on.</P>

Although <Col N="1589" /> unlike the Senator, I have not visited the exchange, I understand that there is a certain amount of public access to the exchange.  There must be security measures because one cannot have crowds charging in and out.  I was concerned to explain and emphasise the protection available to investors.

      <P>May I suggest a compromise, because I understand the viewpoint of both the Minister and the Senator.  Will the Senator consider the idea of an approved area for information for the public?  The vast majority of people in Dublin will not go Anglesea Street to see stocks and shares being transferred.  However, those who have an interest, such as pensioners, should be able to go to an area of the exchange where information is available to them. While those engaged on the Stock Exchange may not be on the floor of the exchange, given the modem transaction methods described by the Minister, is it possible to provide a screen and information area where an update could be provided to interested parties and would the Senator agree to this proposal?</P>

      <P>My understanding is that there is public access.  The point raised by Senator Mulcahy is that such access is unnecessarily difficult as a result of people having to have people with them and so on.  This is a detail and it does not require an amendment to the Bill.  I am, therefore, not prepared to accept the amendment.  I understand what the Senator is saying and I will make inquiries.  I am not fully aware of the degree of public access at the moment.  Senator Quinn mentioned the need to be in the company of a member and so on.  We will take the point, but it does not require an amendment.  I accept the spirit of the Senator's point that it should be as open as possible, consistent with proper security and the running of the business.</P>

      <P>I believe that Senator Mulcahy will probably not press the amendment.  The objective here is to win the respect and support of likely customers who are going to be investors, either directly or through other shareholders.  The Stock Exchange will meet this challenge.  I accept what the Minister has said.  The Stock Exchange will become, and is already, market driven.  Facilities are available and it is possible to visit.  On the two or three occasions I have visited the exchange I have never seen it packed.  There is probably no need to do any more other than have the Central Bank remind the Stock Exchange &mdash; it does not even have to be reminded &mdash; that it is a market driven force.  All the facilities are in place and it will thrive.</P>
      <P>It will be a challenge for the country to realise that it is not linked to Britain and that we do not have the controls that were there.  We must do a good job in this if we are going to earn the respect of the financial institutions around the world.  We are capable of doing so, as is the Irish Stock Exchange.  I am sure that Senator Mulcahy will not press his amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 18, subsection (1), between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following new subparagraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(i) has failed to comply with a direction of the Bank,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The objective of this simple amendment is to give a wide ranging and discretionary power to the Central Bank, as the regulatory body, to revoke the approval and licence of a stock exchange where that exchange has failed to comply with a direction of the bank.</P>
      <P>A general discretionary power should be vested in the Central Bank.  This would not be unusual because several discretionary powers are already vested in the board of the Central Bank.  The Minister is responsible for the bank, while both he and the Government are ultimately answerable to Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>It is possible that situations could arise which are not covered by any of the phrases or formulae in the Bill and for which the bank might wish to have a general discretionary power.  It may issue a direction to an approved stock exchange, with which it does not comply. In itself, that should be a sufficient ground on which to revoke the licence of an approved stock exchange.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Mulcahy for putting down the amendment. Section 14(1) sets out the circumstances where the Central Bank itself can revoke an approval and refers to the limited situations in which it can do so. Subsection (2) sets out the circumstances where the bank must go to the High Court to get an order to revoke such an approval.  The case mentioned by the Senator comes under that heading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be noted that subsection (1) deals with straightforward cases &mdash; for example, where an exchange asks for its approval to be revoked, or where it is being wound up or where it is not <Col N="1593" /> operating as an exchange.  The Central Bank can clearly revoke an approval in those cases.  However, subsection (2) deals with cases where matters of judgment arise and it is appropriate to go to the court for an order revoking the approval.  The revocation of an exchange's approval is a very important power since it involves not only the exchange itself, but also its member firms and their clients.  Issues of natural justice also arise.</P>
    <P>Clearly, in such an issue involving contentious circumstances the bank must get the sanction of the court. Senator Mulcahy's amendment proposes that subsection (1) be amended so as to give the bank itself, without reference to the court, the power to revoke an approval where the exchange has failed to comply with a direction of the bank.  Directions under the Act refer essentially to section 29, which empowers the bank to issue directions in the following circumstances: the exchange is unable to meet its obligations; or is not maintaining adequate capital; or has failed to comply with any condition or requirement and the soundness of the exchange is affected by this failure; or where the safety of client money is jeopardised.  These are all very serious matters.</P>
    <P>However, I cannot accept the amendment because to do so would be to enable the Central Bank to revoke an exchange's approval where a direction was not being complied with, without reference to the court.  This would be going too far since the bank has power under section 29 to go to the High Court to ensure that a direction is being met. Furthermore, the issues about which the Central Bank can issue directions under the Act are covered in section 14(2) as grounds on which the bank can go to the High Court for an order to revoke an exchange's approval.</P>
    <P>The bank's power in relation to matters on which it may issue a direction, which is to go to the High Court to seek a revocation, is quite adequate.  I doubt if giving the bank the power proposed by the Senator would make much difference <Col N="1594" /> because the exchange in question would be virtually certain to appeal the bank's decision to the High Court in a case of that type.  For these reasons, it is more appropriate to leave the Bill as drafted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the Minister's final point, I think he supports the logic of my amendment.  In effect, he said that if the bank acted unreasonably, arbitrarily or incorrectly, the decision would be subject to review by the courts.  This is the position.  Every decision of a public body, by way of judicial review or otherwise, is subject to the laws of natural justice and fair procedure.  However, it is highly unlikely that the bank would act in an arbitrary, capricious or superfluous manner.</P>
      <P>Since every decision of the bank in this regard would be subject to judicial review, it would be quite proper and appropriate to give a wide ranging power to the Central Bank to enable it to revoke a licence where the approved stock exchange has failed to comply with a direction of the bank.  The Minister did not say that he can foresee every circumstance where the bank might want to give such a direction.  The bank should have a catch all ability to revoke a licence where a direction is given but not met.  I intend to press the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment would provide the power to revoke the entire exchange.  In itself, that would have the effect of revoking all the companies within the exchange.  This is a wide and all embracing power.  As it would be made on foot of a judgment &mdash; I am not suggesting that the bank would make an illjudged decision, but it could &mdash; and would have such serious consequences for people other than the exchange itself, it is more properly dealt with by the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any event, it is almost certain in such circumstances that the exchange would appeal to the High Court.  There is provision in the Bill whereby the Central Bank can move quickly on foot of <Col N="1595" /> issuing an instruction.  If the instruction is not accepted, the bank can go straight to the High Court, which can act quickly in emergencies, as the Senator is aware. The powers are balanced and adequate and I do not intend to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 21, subsection 1(a), line 29, after &ldquo;kept&rdquo; to add &ldquo;and such books or records are to be available for inspection by members of the general public at normal office hours&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to provide as much information as possible to the public.  Section 15 concerns the maintenance of books and records by approved stock exchanges.  It reads:</P>
      <P>(1)(a) An approved stock exchange shall keep at an office or offices within the State such books and records...as may be specified, from time to time, by the Bank and shall notify the Bank of the address of every office at which any such books or records are kept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sick to the teeth of the words &ldquo;transparency, accountability and openness&rdquo; but the public has a right to information &mdash; the old fashioned Bill of &ldquo;information&rdquo; or a citizen's right to know.  There is no reason a public body which receives a licence from the Central Bank of Ireland should not be prepared to keep its books and records in a place where a person, during reasonable office hours, can ask to see them.  The argument must be seen from the other perspective.  If one wishes to keep something from the public or to keep it confidential, <Col N="1596" /> surely the public can argue about why that should be so.  The Minister said, when speaking on amendment No. 1, that all these deals and information are available on screens and so forth.  Why should they not be available to somebody who visits the offices of the Stock Exchange to see its books and records?</P>
    <P>The Minister might ask what possible interest Joe Citizen could have in the books and records of a stock exchange. The Stock Exchange is the body that will regulate the operation of its member firms.  Its members firms will have a huge influence on the companies which sell shares on the open market.  I ask the Minister to accept this amendment unless he has a compelling reason for not doing so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>We are discussing the books and records of the business of the Stock Exchange.  The Senator's amendment would oblige the Stock Exchange to make all its books and records available for inspection by the public during normal office hours.  The amendment appears to go too far and there are a number of reasons I cannot accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Stock Exchange will be required by this Bill to incorporate, that is, to become a company.  It will accordingly be subject to the usual obligations under the Companies Acts, including the obligation to file audited accounts annually with the Companies' Office where they will, of course, be available for inspection by the public in the usual way. Section 15 of the Stock Exchange Bill provides that the Central Bank can specify books and records, including books of accounts, which must be held by a stock exchange.  These books and records will be available to the auditor of the Stock Exchange and the auditor will be obliged under section 34 of the Bill to report to the bank if he has reason to believe that the exchange is not complying with the provisions of the Act.  The Central Bank will be entitled <Col N="1597" /> to send a second auditor into a stock exchange where the bank has a real and substantial concern about its audited accounts.</P>
    <P>The bank itself will also monitor the exchange's operations and the authorised officers of the bank will be entitled to see the books and records specified by the bank under section 15.  In addition, the bank will, if necessary, be able to appoint an inspector into the affairs of the Stock Exchange or to ask the High Court to appoint one.  The operations of the Stock Exchange will be subject to very close scrutiny on behalf of the public.  The Senator will recall that section 9 of the Bill requires that the board of the Stock Exchange must be broadly based and include a number of independent directors so as to promote the maintenance of proper standards.  The chairperson, of course, will also be independent.</P>
    <P>However, the most telling point is that the Stock Exchange is a commercial operation.  It is not appropriate that it should be required to make available all its books and records to the general public, including its potential commercial rivals.  To do so would be to put it at a complete disadvantage commercially. I am sure the Senator would not wish that.  In these circumstances I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">

      <P>Section 15 does not specify all books and records &mdash; it refers to &ldquo;such books and records...as may be specified, from time to time, by the Bank&rdquo;.  If the bank is entitled to see them, why not the public?  Again, I publicly chastise the Minister for keeping the lid on another aspect of Irish society that does not require it.  If the public can see these books and records at reasonable office hours with reasonable notice &mdash; whatever wording is used &mdash; there is no reason this great shroud of secrecy over the Stock Exchange should continue. I do not believe the Minister is doing a good day's work for democracy <Col N="1598" /> or for the economy when he is keeping the dealings of an approved stock exchange a secret and a mystery when the public has a right to know.  He is going down the wrong road in this regard.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel confident that the Minister will agree to this amendment because his opposition to it would, in effect, mean that the Central Bank, in the exercise of its duties and functions under the Bill, would be able to act negligently and not be liable, but if it acted in bad faith, it <Col N="1600" /> would be liable.  The concept of negligence is a concept of a duty of care &mdash; this is important.  When dealing with a stock exchange and with a public company, one is dealing with people's money and life savings.  In the recent past people have lost their life savings on shares which turned out to be grossly over-valued.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have seen situations, such as the County Glen case, where irregular activities occurred resulting in a situation where the shares of that company became virtually worthless and could not be traded on the Stock Exchange.  We have seen situations where there is growing and serious public disquiet about the level of pay that the directors of public companies are giving themselves.  There is a huge onus on public companies to run their affairs properly and to comply with the rules of the Stock Exchange and there is a huge onus on the Stock Exchange to police those companies so that people who invest in them are not ripped off, do not lose their investment and, accordingly, that the Stock Exchange and the working of a free market economy continues unhindered.</P>
      <P>Just as there is an absolute need for a stock exchange to police its members, there is also <i>ipso facto</i>&mdash; logically &mdash; a vital need for the Central Bank, as envisaged in this Bill, to be meticulous, rigid, comprehensive and professional in its policing of the Stock Exchange.  It is a chain reaction.  If that does not happen, it follows on down the line.  If the policing of the Stock Exchange does not work, then the policing by the Stock Exchange of the member firms may not work, the policing by the member firms of public companies may not work and people may lose their money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why should the Central Bank be able, under this Bill, to act negligently and get away with it?  Why should it not <Col N="1601" /> have a duty of care to the public to ensure that its policing of the Stock Exchange is up to standard?  The Central Bank and its officers, servants and agents should be liable in damages for negligence &mdash; as we all are if we are negligent. If I drive negligently, I am liable in damages for negligence.  Why should the Central Bank not be liable in damages to the people who lose because of their negligence?  The Minister has assured us of the high degree of competence of the bank in this role.  I am sure he will assure us that all the people who will be in that role will be highly committed, highly trained, highly professional and highly competent.  If that is the case, they are not going to be negligent: they will never be negligent.  Will the Minister accept that on some occasions they may be negligent; they may not pay enough attention to the affairs of the bank?  There might be a bad employee among the servants or agents who, through a mishap, a slip up or a lack of effort or diligence, does not do something, the result of which is loss. It is covered by bad faith.  I am also suggesting that it should be covered by the concept of negligence or, to use the common phrase, by carelessness.  If the bank is careless and somebody suffers, why should it not pay in the same way as servants or agents have to pay if they act in bad faith?</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has made an impassioned plea but the implications for the taxpayer are serious. Section 53 (1) provides that the Central Bank and its officers and employees</P>
      <P>.... shall not be liable in damages for anything done or omitted in the discharge or purported discharge of any functions carried out under this Act unless it is shown that the act or omission was in bad faith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this provision is to ensure that making the Central Bank <Col N="1602" /> the regulator of stock exchanges and member firms does not expose it to claims for damages.  The bank would be particularly susceptible to such claims because of the intrinsic nature of the supervisory task and also the widespread perception that it is a deep pocketed institution.  Such claims could obviously be large, given the nature of stock exchange business, the fact that such business is often done with international clients and financial institutions and the large sums of money potentially involved.  It is essential to protect the Central Bank &mdash; and ultimately the Irish taxpayer &mdash; from an exposure of this magnitude.  The exemption from liability does not apply where the Central Bank is shown to have acted in bad faith, that is, maliciously or with intent to deceive.</P>
    <P>It will be clear why I cannot accept the Senator's amendment.  It would expose the Central Bank and &mdash; as I have said &mdash; ultimately the Irish taxpayer to potential substantial claims over matters which would be matters of opinion because negligence is very much a disputed issue: it is not a matter of fact.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>Ultimately.  If a person loses their money and the Stock Exchange cannot pay up or the company collapses and they see the Central Bank &mdash; in other words, the Irish taxpayer &mdash; as a good mark, they will go for a claim for negligence.  These claims could include claims from overseas institutions and clients dealing with Irish Stock Exchange member firms.  They could also come from stock exchange member firms in other EU member states which are doing business here on foot of authorisation from their home member state.  In such a complex arena, it may not be too difficult to claim, in hindsight, that an action had been negligent. The result could be the making of <Col N="1603" /> large awards against the Central Bank and, thus, the Irish taxpayer.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the result of the Senator's proposed change would potentially be to transfer to the Central Bank the day to day responsibility for making certain that stock exchanges and member firms act properly and prudently in the conduct of their business. That responsibility rests, and must be seen to rest, with the directors and management of exchanges and member firms and not with the Central Bank.</P>
      <P>The final point is that the Senator's amendment could undermine the system of regulation being introduced by this Bill as it would necessarily make the Central Bank cautious about all its actions in case they were accused of negligence afterwards.  This is obviously not in the interest of either effective regulation or investors and it could also lead to claims of negligence.  The bank could be accused of failing to act in situations where it was in fact trying to protect itself against charges of acting negligently.</P>
      <P>I share, as we all must, the concern of people who may lose their money, particularly small investors.  In that context I would refer to the existence of the compensation fund in the Irish Stock Exchange which facilitates the repayment of moneys to people who lose money in circumstances which are wrong.  For all of those reasons, I cannot accept the amendment.  I am sorry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>In effect he is.  He is accepting that the servants or agents of the Central Bank may act negligently and nobody can be compensated.  The Minister will accept, as I think his speech accepted, that this is the actual result.  A servant or agent of the Central Bank can act negligently in the discharge of their statutory duty and a third party will have no redress.  That is a staggering proposal, because to my knowledge it is one of the few exceptions in Irish statutory law to the general negligence principle.</P>
      <P>One interpretation of the Minister's position is that he showing a lack of confidence in one of two sets of people.  He is either afraid that somebody in the Central Bank will act negligently in the discharge of their statutory duty, or he is afraid that some judge or some part of the administration of Irish justice will not reach a high enough standard in determining a claim.  If the Minister has proper confidence in the Irish judicial system and in the servants or agents of the Central Bank, there is no logical reason why he should not make the latter accountable for their own carelessness or negligence.  Letting the servants or agents of the board of the Central Bank off the hook is a considerable disservice to a person who may suffer loss as a result of negligence, which the Minister will ultimately accept may happen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make just two points, because I am listening to matters which are inclined to be above me and I am afraid I might be getting a little confused.  The point of the Senator's amendment is that if the Central Bank, as the watchdog of the Stock Exchange, was negligent, a company could do something wrong which would cost us <Col N="1605" /> and the shareholders of that company money.  That has often happened before.</P>
      <P>The Senator is also saying that the Minister is not taking responsibility.  I ask the Senator to look at recent events where a sum in the region of £45 million was spent and nobody was blamed or charged.  That did not happen under this Minister.  An inquiry was held which cost £45 million and nobody was blamed or charged.  If we really want to talk about negligence, we can talk about that.  There have been companies who have done their shareholders enormous wrong and yet nobody was blamed.  We had inquiries and High Court judges making decisions but nobody was charged.  I want to remind the Senator of that.</P>
      <P>Is there a danger that international people involved in Irish companies or who have shares in the Irish Stock Exchange could see an opportunity? The fact that the Irish taxpayer was prepared to pay could lead them to use their own resources and ability to undermine a company or the Stock Exchange itself and make money both ways.  Did the Senator think of that at all?  There are people who are prepared to do that.  One has only to look at what happened during the devaluation in 1993 and what those with outside resources did to us while making millions of pounds out of it.  I do not want a situation where people can undermine us on one side and can gain from us on the other and I would not agree to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not carrying a flag for the Central Bank and I do not know any of these people.  I might have a few stocks and shares but I did not make money out of them.  At the same time I am conscious that it is not just the people of Ireland who are putting money into stocks and shares.  There are also outside investors who might see an opportunity. They saw it before and cost the Irish taxpayer up to £800 million over a very short period when our interest <Col N="1606" /> rates went up to 40 per cent.  We should not create opportunities for international people to undermine Irish society again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a brief comment in view of the remarks made by Senator Mulcahy.  He is a little unfair to the Central Bank and to its staff and its agents who have served it well.  It has a regulatory function in many financial institutions, including building societies and so on, and has performed well. There will always be people who will invest in the Stock Exchange, and there is always the possibility of a dishonest stockbroker.  The Central Bank cannot be responsible for everything that goes wrong in the Stock Exchange, but it will act as a regulator.  Up until now the Stock Exchange regulated itself and it is only right that we should now have an independent regulator in the Central Bank.  As the Minister said, it is only when the Central Bank acts in bad faith that people can claim against it and that is important.  I have no record of the Central Bank ever acting in bad faith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCalnan" hpid="Mr. Calnan Mr. Calnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the amendment was necessary and I ask the Minister to reply to this.  Is it not strong enough to say at the end of subsection (1) that it must be shown that &ldquo;the act or omission was in bad faith.&rdquo;?  Does that not cover the situation?  This Bill provides for the regulation of the Stock Exchange and much work has gone into the drafting of the Bill.  We do not want any section of it to be open to abuse, particularly in this compensation culture. I can see the Minister's point.  The fact that the act or omission must be shown to have been in bad faith should cover Senator Mulcahy's point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have much more to add except to thank the Senators for their support.  I do not want to put the regulator, the taxpayers of Ireland, in the position of being sued for <Col N="1607" /> the acts of the culprits.  A company could act in an illegal way or the stock market itself could do something illegal. The bank's regulatory role cannot possibly operate on a day to day basis and therefore it could in theory miss something. I do not want the Irish taxpayer to be subject to a claim for negligence from people who see it as the best mark&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their contributions to the Bill on both Second and Committee Stages.  I thank Senator Mulcahy in particularly, despite what he might think of my responses, who obviously put a lot of time and effort into this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The enactment of the Bill will mark a further stage in the regulation of the financial sector in this country following on the various Acts affecting that sector in recent years.  The Irish Stock Exchange will separate from the London <Col N="1608" /> Stock Exchange once the Bill comes into effect.  The Bill will allow the exchange and its member firms to operate under a modem system of regulation more suited to the needs of our time and in line with modern international practice and the requirements of European law.</P>
    <P>The Stock Exchange Bill, 1994, is part of a wider process under which firms providing financial services will be allowed to trade freely throughout the European Union.  This will obviously bring challenges as well as opportunities and I wish the Irish Stock Exchange and its member firms well as they meet these challenges.  I also take this opportunity to thank the exchange and its member firms for their help in advising us in the preparation of some aspects of the Bill.  I also thank the Central Bank for its contribution to the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as I mentioned on Second Stage, is one part of the legislation which is required to transpose the EU Investment Services Directive.  I expect to be back here shortly with the other part, the recently published, Investment Intermediaries Bill, 1995.  This will implement the directive in respect of investment intermediaries which are not member firms of a stock exchange and will regulate the investment activities of investment intermediaries generally in this country.  I look forward to the cooperation of the House in dealing with it.</P>
    <P>The Stock Exchange Bill, 1994, has been a long time in preparation and in its passage through the Oireachtas.  I commend the Bill to the House and trust the Irish Stock Exchange will add a long and proud future to its 196 year history.</P>
    <P>Finally, I thank the officials and staff in my Department who took on a greenhorn Minister last week and managed to get me through Second and Committee Stages of a Bill I had never seen prior to that.  I am grateful to them and the country is lucky to have people who can guide us in that way.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, I thank the Minister and his officials for their time today and in the preparation of the Bill.  It is pleasantly ironic that the Bill should pass today. Yesterday, and this morning, we have a symbol of England visiting Ireland from the UK in the form of His Royal Highness, Prince Charles.  We have in the passing of the Bill a symbol of taking a little part of England back to Ireland. There is great symbolism in this.  By the way, this is the hand that shook the hand&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;if anybody wants to shake it.  It is always great when we can fully develop our institutions in line with our own particular traditions and genius, no less so than when we are involved in the commercial aspects of our life.  The Bill has been a long time in coming.  The end of rule by the London Stock Exchange comes with no bitterness. I am sure they are probably glad to be rid of us to a certain extent, although one would not know.  I encourage people who want to organise another stock exchange to do so.  The Bill specifically provides for that.  The Minister gave me an assurance, which I am now happy to read into record, that any application for a second or even a third stock exchange would not meet a wall of resistance or bureaucratic intransigence if it fulfilled the correct criteria. I wish the Dublin Stock Exchange well and any other stock exchange that may be approved in Ireland.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister. The debate was good and amendments were accepted in the process.  I congratulate the Minister for his graciousness <Col N="1610" /> in recognising that the work was done by a greenhorn Minister, as he says himself, with the support of his officials.  It is an important Bill.  Everybody nowadays has some sort of involvement, although maybe not directly, in the success of an active, thriving stock exchange.  It is important to regulate them and, having now been given the first chance to regulate it ourselves, that we do a good job.  I congratulate the Minister and, particularly, those behind him who put the work together and have succeeded in getting the Bill through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I can assure him and the House that he is no greenhorn.  I wish him well in his new position.  I think his officials will find him to be fair and hardworking.</P>
      <P>We are looking at a Stock Exchange restructured first in 1799, then in 1918 and now today.  It is historic.  Although some people might have shook the hands of royalty, I am the same everyday. I would like to think we are now the people of Europe.  It is important to make the point that it was not only Anglesea Street that had a stock exchange. Cork had its own stock exchange until a few years ago.  Some people always say that the border was in the wrong place. We should have been cut off.  We could have been much better off, but we have to make sure we are up here to run the country because you would make a bad hand of it.</P>
      <P>We are looking to the future.  The Bill is broadminded.  We should not be afraid to inform the public, particularly from an educational point of view.  Our young people should be informed of how our Stock Exchange works and of the regulations regarding stocks.  They should know about the Central Bank and we should make no apologies for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to be associated with what was said about the Minister and everybody in the Department of Finance on the way they have compiled this Bill.  We are talking about <Col N="1611" /> something which dates back to 1799; the next date mentioned was 1918.  When dealing with finance and stock exchanges and so on in a democracy, we must be extremely careful.  An unusual degree of accuracy and care was required in the compilation of this Bill so that it would be right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking about a sensitive issue &mdash; people's savings, investments, lifeblood and money, which deserve great care.  The Central Bank has been given a front seat in the running of the affairs of the Stock Exchange.  For the first time the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment will have a large part to play because appeals can be made to them.  I <Col N="1612" /> do not believe those provisions were there before.</P>
    <P>The separation between London and Dublin is timely.  While it gives us independence, it prepares us for Europe because the situation must be right where foreign exchanges and so on are concerned.  I compliment the Minister and his staff for coming up with a comprehensive and excellent Bill which will be good for the Stock Exchange, the Central Bank, the Government and for democracy.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
