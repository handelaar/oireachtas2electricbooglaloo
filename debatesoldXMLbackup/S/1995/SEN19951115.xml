      <P>I have notice from Senator Burke that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to provide funding to upgrade the existing swimming pool and facilities at Castlebar, County Mayo.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Neville on the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine to establish a centre for international maritime business.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Fahey on the following matter:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications the Government policy on the growing trends where satellite television channels demand exclusive rights for sporting events, some of which are staged in Ireland, and if he is in agreement with the development of paid TV which could lead to individual payment being demanded for events such as the All Ireland finals or soccer internationals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="382" /> I have also received notice from Senator Mooney on the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to indicate whether the Irish Government was consulted by the European Commission on the establishment of the Eurathlon Programme and if she agrees that the requirements of at least three member states participating should be reduced to two in order to permit the development of Irish sport, especially our national games.</P>
    <P>I have selected Senators Burke's and Neville's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  I regret I had to rule the matter raised by Senator Fahey out of order on the grounds of lack of ministerial responsibility. Senator Mooney may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take items 1 and 14, motion 25, today; item 1 to conclude at 6 p.m. and item 14, motion 25 to be taken between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree with the proposed Order of Business.  The Leader has given a commitment that between now and the end of this session we will be given an opportunity to make statements on Northern Ireland.  I suggest that, after a weekend of major speeches by the Taoiseach and my party leader, now would be a good time for us to be afforded a chance to make such statements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the proposed Order of Business.  It is in everybody's interest to have a nonjudgmental type debate on the operation of semi-State companies.  I am concerned &mdash; this is not a political comment &mdash; about the quality of people who will participate in public representation at this level in future and about the morale <Col N="383" /> of workers and management in these companies.  Many of the good aspects of these companies also need to be mentioned. I am not taking sides and I am not saying that the Minister or Fianna Fáil is right or wrong.  The situation is a total mess at this stage and the whole series of events reflects badly on all of us in public life.  All aspects of semi-State companies and not just the corner of a plot in Cork should be discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to item 1, the Leader did not indicate if there would be time limits on speeches.  If there are limits, will time sharing be permitted?</P>
      <P>We should condemn the execution in Nigeria of Ken Sara-Wiwa and others and say we do not condone that type of activity.  Consistent with the concerns we expressed last week about human rights in East Timor, the same concerns should be expressed in this case.  I am glad to see Senator Norris has returned safely from Indonesia; we were worried about him last week.</P>
      <P>I support what Senator O'Toole said about semi-State companies.  I do not wish to open a political debate on this matter but we should reflect on it and the House could make a valuable contribution. There must be concern at this stage that people who have the ability and qualities required to serve on the boards of semi-State companies may not be attracted to do so.  This would be regrettable.</P>
      <P>When will the White Paper on foreign affairs be published?  It has been expected for some time.  When it is published time should be made available to debate it here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator Dardis in his condemnation of the execution of Ken Sara-Wiwa and his colleagues.  The world seems to be ineffective in preventing such atrocities. These executions were signalled in advance and protests were made but the executions were carried out.  It would be helpful if we could debate the kind of sanctions which could be availed when <Col N="384" /> there are international incidents such as this.  There should be a powerful and effective world body in this area.  As a neutral country Ireland could make a valuable contribution to what can be done at world level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I reiterate my question to the Leader about the criminal justice drug trafficking Bill.  He will recall that I asked him if the Minister for Justice could introduce the Bill, perhaps in this House, as a matter of urgency.  Everybody agrees this Bill is vitally important. When will it be before this or the other House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House, in view of the great urgency attached to Irish Steel, that he immediately contact the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Bruton, and ask him to intensify his efforts to resolve this matter with Mr. Eggar, his British counterpart.  There is currently a stalemate on the matter.  I also support Senator Dardis' condemnations of the Nigerian Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Dardis for welcoming me back and I also wish to place on record my appreciation for the kind words from the Leader of the House and others which were transmitted to us in Indonesia.  The international delegation of which I was a part was impressed with the recorded stance of Ireland on East Timor.  It is on that matter that I speak.  There is a motion about East Timor, No. 18 in the name of myself, Senator Henry and Senator O'Toole, on the Order Paper. Can the Leader indicate whether it will be possible to take this motion or one similar to it provided by the Government at the beginning of December because 7 December will be the 20th anniversary of the invasion and illegal annexation of East Timor.  It is a particularly important anniversary and will be acknowledged throughout the world.  I would like to think this House could have the opportunity to have this sort of debate.  This will also provide me with <Col N="385" /> an opportunity to update the House on developments there, as I was made aware of them.</P>
      <P>I also support what other Members said about the situation in Nigeria.  The way to apply pressure is through the oil companies like Shell and Chevron; that is the key.  It was made clear to me, both in Indonesia and Singapore, that economic pressure at the time of the invasion of East Timor would have stopped the Indonesians dead in their tracks; but they were given the signal by the West that it would look the other way.  Perhaps a debate on international human rights, about which Senator O'Sullivan expressed some concern, would be in order.</P>
      <P>We had, on the day of Brian Lenihan's lamented death, a high powered delegation from Iran.  Some serious matters about the barbarous torture and execution of gay people in Iran were raised.  That delegation confirmed this was what they wished to do, but it was not recorded because the committee went into private session.  I greatly regret the Irish people did not have the opportunity to see the savagery of the Iranian Government greatly revealed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate our public relations officer for a series of information leaflets which have recently been published.  I draw the Leader's attention to the fact that an information session for provincial journalists from Munster took place on 7 November to enable them to see the Houses and the committees of the Oireachtas at work. However, the Seanad was not sitting that day.  I am concerned the public relations officer would arrange such a session on a Seanad non-sitting day and herald it as giving information on how the Houses worked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>In light of the image of honesty, accountability, openness and transparency this Government is trying to project, would it not be right and fitting for it to provide some time to discuss the continuing problem in the <Col N="386" /> Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry regarding the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, and his Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, in connection with the employment of the Minister of State's private secretary?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a motion on this matter on the Order Paper.  The Minister stated in the Dáil last week that under no circumstances did any civil servant ever indicate to Michael Kelly that he would be allowed to continue drawing invalidity payments.  Yet, the Minister of State, who is continually supporting Mr. Kelly&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>A question for the Leader, please.  We cannot debate the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not debating the issue.  I am trying to put the question. The Minister of State has supported his private secretary, which is completely in conflict with what the Minister, Deputy Yates, stated in the Dáil last Tuesday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot discuss the matter on the Order of Business.  A question for the Leader.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to ask the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, to come to the House to explain what is happening in connection with the employment of Mr. Kelly and why the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, said that no civil servant gave him that indication.  Someone is being economical with the truth on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I also call for a debate on Northern Ireland.  It is now almost five months since the death of Senator Wilson and the matter has not been discussed in the Seanad in that time.  There <Col N="387" /> have been a number of serious exchanges concerning the peace process and it is important we move as soon as possible.  Could the Leader also indicate when the Seanad seat of Senator Wilson will be filled?  It is important that someone of that calibre, living and working in Northern Ireland and from a Unionist viewpoint, should be here to keep us informed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support my colleagues' condemnation of the executions in Nigeria. I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Justice if she intends introducing amending legislation on the reporting of family law cases.  It is essential that the identity of participants would remain private; but it would do much to inform the public, and in particular legislators, about family law cases.  Many lawyers specialising in this area have called for reform and I support that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to convey to the Minister for Foreign Affairs this House's appreciation of Ireland's recent decision to vote with Cuba in the UN. For years we abstained on this matter but we now have voted in favour of lifting the USA's unjust blockade of Cuba.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>Cubans are back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader may not be aware of the growing concern in the midwest about Government plans for the future of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  SFADCo is the agency which promotes and undertakes to develop tourism in the midwest region, which includes north Kerry.  It has recently been suggested that this responsibility may be given to Bord Fáilte.  The concern is felt both in the region and the company, especially in view of the recent announcement by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications that responsibility for the promotion of Shannon would be given to Aer Rianta.  We need some clarification from the Minister as to future plans for SFADCo.  Is it intended <Col N="388" /> that it will retain responsibility for the development and promotion of tourism within the region or are there plans to transfer that responsibility to Bord Fáilte?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCalnan" hpid="Mr. Calnan Mr. Calnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader for a debate on tourism.  We had a good summer this year and tourism is important for employment in rural areas, even if such employment is part-time.  I ask that such a debate occur in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of issues were raised.  All of us agree with Senator Dardis and others about the executions in Nigeria.  This was a brutal act carried out in defiance of world opinion.  As Senator O'Sullivan said, it also indicated the powerlessness of the world to influence the Nigerian dictators who persisted with such an act. The disgust and condemnation of the House will be conveyed to the Nigerian Embassy in Dublin, but it may be appropriate to have a short debate on the matter later.  If Senators are interested we may set aside half an hour for short statements.</P>
      <P>Senator Wright mentioned Northern Ireland.  I have spoken to the Tánaiste; he is anxious to come to the House and as soon as an appropriate date in the near future can be found we will have such a debate.  Senator O'Toole and others raised the future of the semi-State bodies.  This is a serious subject for which I would be happy to make time available and to invite the Minister to the House.  Perhaps we can arrange that in the next few weeks.  Senator Dardis asked about time limits on item 1.  I suggest 20 minutes per speaker, if that is agreeable, and Members may share time if they wish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not aware of the date of publication of the White Paper on foreign affairs but I will seek information on that.  Senator O'Sullivan raised the question of sanctions; it might be appropriate to have a short debate on the future of the UN between now and the end of the session.  We live in a crucial time in the life of the UN which is being <Col N="389" /> reshaped for the next century.  The issue which she and other Senators raised would be appropriate to that debate.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of progress on the criminal justice drugs trafficking Bill but I will attempt to find out about it.  I assure Senator Sherlock that the Minister is working very intensively to ensure the proper result in the case of Irish Steel and there is good reason for hope at this stage.</P>
    <P>I welcome back Senator Norris.  The wishes of the House last week were sincerely meant.  It would be appropriate, if we could do it, to have a short series of statements on 6 or 7 December.  It is the view of the House that we should have that debate and we will see if we can arrange it around those two dates. Perhaps an hour would be sufficient.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be perfect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Senator Neville, I am puzzled that an information day was held when this House was not sitting and I will pursue the matter.  Senator Kelleher's party has Private Members' time next week and a motion on the Order Paper so it is open to them to spend their two hours next week pursuing the matter.  He will have a device open to him.</P>
      <P>In reply to Senator Maloney, I believe the seat will be filled in the very near future.  In reply to Senator Honan, I will take advice on the reporting of family law cases and I will try to come back to her.  I will convey Senator Kelly's good wishes to the Tánaiste &mdash; I think it was a good day's work &mdash; although she may see him before I do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already done so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Daly raised the issue of the Shannon Development Company.  I am not aware of the disquiet being caused but obviously it is there.  That motion might be appropriate for the Adjournment.  Perhaps the Senator might raise it tomorrow in order to get a speedy response.  In reply to Senator Calnan, I do not have any <Col N="390" /> plans at the moment for a debate on tourism but we will try to work it in later.</P>
      <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is much cynicism about people in public life.  There is a belief that we are only out for what we can get from politics.  People in politics, despite the long hours we work, our strong commitment to the people we represent and the strong sense of public service which is always demonstrated in this House, are all tarred with the same brush &mdash; that we belong to a discredited profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="391" /> That is why the Ethics in Public Office Act is important for us as elected representatives and why it is important in strengthening trust in our democracy. It is important for confidence in our public service and in the wider public sector.  It sets out to put the facts and not the myths on the record.  It establishes the principle of openness in addressing any potential conflicts of interest.  It sets out a framework where the conduct of public business and the private interests of people in public positions are seen to be kept separate.</P>
    <P>Ministers and TDs, civil servants and people running State companies are in positions of public trust.  The Act provides a framework for identifying and dealing with potential conflicts of interest in those roles.  It enables people in public life to demonstrate that the values of public service prevail.  It enables people in positions of public influence to show that they keep their public duties and private interests separate. Its mechanisms are a safeguard to show that those who work in the public's name are working on behalf of the public interest.</P>
    <P>The rules of disclosure contained in the Act echo those in other Parliaments among our European neighbours, and in the European Parliament itself.  They are a basic feature of democracies in the modern world.</P>
    <P>The Act provides for the annual registration of interests by people in key public positions &mdash; Members of the Oireachtas and Ministers, the Attorney General, senior civil and public servants, board members and senior executives of State companies and Ministers' special advisers.  It sets out procedures for handling conflicts of interest which arise on the job.  It sets out new rules in relation to acceptance of gifts by office holders.  It introduces greater openness and accountability into personal appointments by office holders.  It provides for an independent commission to oversee key provisions of the Act and investigate complaints.</P>
    <P>The Act has been debated at length, <Col N="392" /> in the House and in Committee, with spirited contributions from all sides.  A very constructive debate on the Act took place in this House.  Our purpose today is not to revisit those debates.  The Act is now law.  Today we are making arrangements to commence those sections of the Act which apply to Members of this House.  This is in line with the constitutional principle &mdash; in Article 15.10 of the Constitution &mdash; that each House regulates its own affairs.</P>
    <P>The Government has already made the Commencement Order to bring the other sections of the Act, other than the provisions for Deputies and Senators, into operation from 1 November.  The Dáil has already passed its Commencement Order for the Act.  The Minister for Finance &mdash; the designated Minister under the Act &mdash; is proceeding with the necessary orders to apply the Act in respect of the public service.  The Act is somewhat technical.  Therefore I will set out, in simple terms, the provisions of the Act in respect of which we are making the Commencement Order today.</P>
    <P>A Select Committee of this House, chaired by the Cathaoirleach, must be set up under the Act with the statutory task to prepare guidelines, on compliance with the Act, for Senators and offer advice on individual queries from Members.  A similar Select Committee of the Dáil will have the same functions for that House.  This follows the constitutional provision that each House regulates its own affairs.  Those guidelines will be drawn up following consultation with the independent commission, which oversees the Act for Ministers and senior public servants, and with the Dáil Select Committee, to ensure maximum consistency.  To help with that consistency, the commission will include the Clerk of the Seanad as a member.  It will be an important protection under the Act for Senators to show that they were acting on the advice of, or following the guidelines laid down by, the committee in the event of a complaint being made.  A further role for the committee is to investigate complaints and report to the House.  The committee will <Col N="393" /> have comprehensive powers to summon witnesses.</P>
    <P>Preparatory work on setting up the committee and preparing the guidelines can begin when today's order has been made, to ensure that all the necessary elements are in place for the commencement of these sections of the Act on 1 January.  The House may also consider any amendments now required to the Standing Orders of this House.</P>
    <P>The Act requires two types of disclosure of Senators, as it does for all groups which come within its remit, an annual statement of interests and <i>ad hoc</i> declarations of interests where a conflict of interest may directly arise, which may occur if a Senator is speaking or voting on a particular issue.  Oireachtas Members, including Ministers, must set out annual statements of their interests in a public register.  The first register covers interests arising from the time the Act was passed to the first registration date, the period from 22 July to the end of January next.  The interests to be declared in the register are outside income, shares and directorships, land, but not the family home, gifts other than personal gifts, public contracts and work as a paid lobbyist.  These interests are similar to those listed in other Parliaments. Interests below a threshold value do not have to be disclosed.  Such interests include assets or shares worth less than £10,000, income of £2,000 or less or gifts worth £500 or less, in accordance with the <i>de minimis</i> principle. In no case is the disclosure of the amount of income or the value of the interest required.</P>
    <P>In addition, when speaking or voting in the Houses of the Oireachtas, Senators will be required to make a formal declaration if the issue involves a potential conflict of interest for either themselves or a connected person, such as a close relative or business partner. A simple statement that the Member has an interest will be sufficient.</P>
    <P>As people holding executive positions, Ministers and other office holders are required to make a more comprehensive declaration of interests than <Col N="394" /> Senators.  In addition to the annual declaration of their personal interests, which like other Members forms part of the public register, Ministers are required to make an additional private declaration of those interests of their spouses and children which are known to them and which could have a bearing on their public duties.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the independent commission must be informed where a Minister proposes to exercise a function of his or her office which could potentially benefit themselves, their immediate family or business associates or could benefit another Minister.</P>
    <P>The Cathaoirleach and Leas-Chathaoirleach are designated as office holders under the Act.  In line with the developing role of Oireachtas committees, it will be open to the House to designate the Chairs of particular committees as office holders under the Act.  An Attorney General who is a Member of this or the other House will also be defined as an office holder and will come under those provisions in the Act.</P>
    <P>The order before the House provides for a commencement day of 1 January next for the sections of the Act dealing with Senators.  The first registration date for registration of Members' interests is 31 January next.  Members have 30 days from the registration date in which to register their interests.  The register is laid before the Houses following a further 30 days.  In other words, Members will make their first declarations by the beginning of March and these will be published at the end of that month.</P>
    <P>This Act does not only deal with politicians, although that is the aspect which has had most publicity.  It sets out rules for the disclosure of potential conflicts of interest for senior civil servants and those running State bodies.  Senior public servants, senior executives and members of State bodies are required to make annual declarations, which are private, in respect of their own interests and of those interests known to them of their spouse and children, which could <Col N="395" /> have a bearing on their public duties. They are also required to make once-off declarations where a potential conflict of interest involving themselves or close connections could arise in the performance of official duties.  Furthermore, they are generally forbidden, as a term of their conditions of appointment, from performing a function where there is a conflict of interest unless there are compelling reasons for so doing.  In such cases these reasons must be given in writing to the relevant authority and made available to the independent commission. These rules are based on the existing guidelines which operate for senior executives and board members of State companies on a non-statutory basis.  They have been put on a statutory footing in the Act.</P>
    <P>The Act is careful to strike a balance between serving the public interest through disclosure and respecting the legitimate right to personal privacy. Those in public life declare their own interests on a public register.  Declarations by public servants and State board members will be confidential to the relevant authority.  Declarations in relation to family interests, which are only required from people in executive positions, from Ministers but not from TDs and Senators, will be likewise confidential to the commission.  Any unauthorised disclosure of such information will constitute a criminal offence.  The basic principle is that a public person will make a public declaration, while a private person will make a private one.</P>
    <P>Apart from addressing the separation of public and private interests, the Act also deals with gifts to office holders and with the appointment of personal advisers and assistants by Ministers.  The Act provides that any gift worth over £500 given to a Minister, their spouse or child by virtue of that ministerial office, becomes the property of the State.</P>
    <P>As regards personal appointments by office holders, for example, personal assistants and special advisers, the Act provides that these will be temporary <Col N="396" /> and will cease when the office holder leaves office.  This gives legal effect to something which has been practice for many years.  The Government will be precluded from appointing such persons to permanent positions in the Civil Service, again giving legal effect to what is already established practice.  The Act also provides for publication of details of all such personal appointments.</P>
    <P>An independent commission will oversee key provisions of the Act in respect of office holders, special advisers, public servants, including civil servants, and senior executives of State boards.  The commission will undertake the investigation of complaints of possible contraventions in respect of these groups.  The commission will comprise the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Ombudsman, the Ceann Comhairle and the Clerks of both the Dáil and the Seanad.  As I said, this House regulates its own affairs for constitutional reasons.  A similar role to that of the independent commission will be carried out by the Select Committee of this House while a Select Committee of the Dáil will carry out that function in relation to Dáil backbenchers.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the motion before us today is to bring these provisions of the Act as they apply to the Seanad into operation from 1 January next.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I compliment the Minister on this important legislation. We all accept you cannot legislate for ethical standards and we all accept there are occasional slips from ethical standards. I happen to believe, in spite of the extraordinary tides of cynicism which flow backwards and forwards from the pens of scribes who sometimes do not think beyond the end of their page or paragraph, that our commentators have done an extraordinary disservice in general to public life in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our public service is a good public service, which is motivated by the highest ideals.  Politics in this country is motivated, by and large, by the highest <Col N="397" /> ideals.  I would not for a moment claim that everybody in politics in this State is a saint, nor do I subscribe to the sometimes evident view that they are all sinners either.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Act because, as the Minister stated in her speech, compliance with the regulations provides us with at least some protection or shield against the cynicism which has corroded political life in this country and which has made political life almost worthless. I believe &mdash; and I have some experience in this matter &mdash; in relation to the contribution of Irish public representatives, that although there have on occasion been fairly serious departures from what any of us would accept as either normal or appropriate standards, by and large the standards have been very high indeed.</P>
    <P>People of all parties and none have sought to serve the people of this nation.  Occasionally, people in political life deserve a little better than they sometimes get.  Therefore, the regulations when they come into effect will be very important, not least because they will show that standards, which are objective and can now be verified, apply in this place, in the other House and in political life and public life in general.</P>
    <P>I hope when the regulations take effect, when the committee is in place and the system is operating, that people will not turn to the old Irish practice of whispering behind the hand and suggesting they know what it says on the surface but they know what goes on below the surface.  Innuendo is one of the most destructive features of the Irish way of conducting politics.  Innuendo destroys politics.  It destroys the enthusiasm and the energy which volunteers largely bring to politics.</P>
    <P>I believe the regulations are good but there are a couples of points which I would make.  I do not wish to politicise the debate because this is not about partisan politics.  It is about standards.  I cannot pass without commenting on the fact that we have lost a chief executive of a State enterprise today.  It will become increasingly difficult to persuade <Col N="398" /> men and women from the business world to lend themselves to support the boards of State bodies.  They are paid very little and are subject to the most extraordinary scrutiny.  Sometimes they are subject to extremely damaging innuendo and, as we have seen in recent times, can be embroiled in extraordinary political convolutions.  There is an important point to be made here.  Not only are we trying to deal with issues of a fiduciary nature, issues related to investments or interests in the normal sense, but we have to raise our eyes and begin to look at what is happening in our public service.  These regulations and the Act are a start and are not the conclusion.  I think the Minister would agree with that particular view.</P>
    <P>Turning to specifics, it is important we have a select committee but it is also important that the select committee will have teeth.  The Minister is fully aware, as is the Leader, that one of the major problems in parliamentary committees at the moment is they have no teeth. They have no capacity to investigate and this Act will begin to redress that particular problem.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding good efforts by different Governments of different hues in recent times to try to bolster the committees, improve their standing and capacity to do a job in an objective sense, my experience is that when it comes down to it, unfortunately partisan politics intrude in the matter.  Again, I do not wish to be controversial.</P>
    <P>I was chairman for a number of years of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies.  Throughout my chairmanship I tried to avoid as far as was humanly possible any attempt to utilise a parliamentary or political majority there.  While chairman of that committee I initiated investigations which were highly unpopular with the Government of the day, or at least with one senior member of that Government who from time to time reminded me, from his august chair in another part of these buildings, that he was not too happy with the direction in which I was taking the committee.  In recent times <Col N="399" /> there was an effort to stall this downward spiral, this so-called Lowry or Tuffy affair.  Unfortunately, partisan politics were used in the committee to prevent the committee carrying out an objective appraisal of what was happening. As a consequence, politics as a whole, the State sector in particular and the State boards involved have all suffered.</P>
    <P>The point I am making is as much an admonition to this side of the House as the other side.  When the select committee is in place it will be important that we put partisan politics outside the door, as has been the tradition in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges over the years.  That is helped by the fact that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges operate in privacy and this will also happen in initial investigations in this context.  There must be a balance between what will become public and what is done in private.  But if the committee is to have an impact it is important that, as far as is possible in the political milieu, it is above partisan politics.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to suggest that I object to the select committee being chaired by the Cathaoirleach.  I would have mentioned any such objection during the debate on the Bill.  The Cathaoirleach has my absolute respect &mdash; there is no gainsaying that &mdash; but I suggest we should examine this point.  The principle applied in the Committee on Public Accounts is that it is traditionally chaired by somebody from the Opposition. That is not to suggest that the Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach are not more than capable of chairing it.</P>
    <P>In the context of the annual statement of interest, I can only recall one occasion when a Member of either House went to the trouble of declaring an interest.  A couple of years ago my predecessor as chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies made a declaration of interest because of a connection a firm with which he was connected <Col N="400" /> may have had with the sugar company.  It became an issue of major political debate and a huge brouhaha was made about it even though he behaved properly.</P>
    <P>When we establish declarations of interest one hopes that people will understand that the declaration of an interest does not mean the person making it must isolate themselves from the real world, because that is neither practical nor possible.  On the occasion in question we investigated the charges made against a Member of the other House who happened to be chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies. He was found to have operated correctly but, unfortunately, the truth and his exoneration came on the eve of an election and were lost sight of.  One of the tragedies on that occasion was that a voluntarily made declaration of interest was used to take an Oireachtas committee away from an investigation of the affairs of the sugar company.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that interests below a threshold value do not have to be disclosed, meaning assets or shares worth less than £10,000.  I will probably be howled at from all sides, but I believe an even smaller shareholding could require a declaration of interest.  A shareholding might on its face value be worth less than £10,000 because of the current state of the market.  However, the temptation might still be there to do something that would be supportive of the company and ultimately boost the shareholding.  Share values go up and down and over time this could present a problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated correctly that this is not just an Act for politicians but an Act for the wider public service.  We are well served by the public service in this country.  Nonetheless, it is not all made up of saints.  The application of the wider portions of this Act to the public service is both good and beneficial.  The public view of both political and public life is not objectively tied to the performance of politicians or the public service. Unfortunately, the performance of <Col N="401" /> politicians and the public service is presented through the media to the people.</P>
    <P>There is a regrettable and downward spiral in the way the media treats politics and politicians of all parties and of none.  We have witnessed in recent times a reprehensible move away from the objective standards of good journalism and, rather than getting objective commentary, we are being given highly subjective and highly biased personal views.  We cannot complain, by and large, about the treatment of Oireachtas reports in the media.  However, we can complain about colour reports that are written from bizarre angles.  I do not know what they are intended to achieve but they are not news &mdash; they are views. Our newspapers are becoming views papers rather than newspapers.</P>
    <P>There is also a regrettable indication of connections in recent years which means that the objectivity of some commentators is highly suspect.  In the ongoing divorce referendum debate, for example, at least one newspaper tells us where it stands but others do not. However, that contentious issue is not touched on by this Bill.  I regret that in talking about ethics in politics and in the public service there is a steely silence from the Fourth Estate when it comes to talking about ethics in journalism. Perhaps when the Minister has completed this job the ladies and gentlemen of the Fourth Estate might turn their minds and talents to that issue.  There is a job to be done in that regard too.</P>
    <P>This is good legislation.  There will be problems in the years ahead; no legislation dealing with this thorny issue could but have problems.  There will be difficulties and we will have to return to the legislation and make adjustments from time to time.  The Minister has made it a criminal offence to abuse the privacy of private information which is provided under this Bill, particularly from the point of view of office holders and near relatives.  It will be particularly important to ensure that abuses are policed and punished.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="402" /> I am pleased that this regulation is being introduced.  I compliment the Minister on it.  I cross swords with her on other issues occasionally &mdash; we are still waiting for the Freedom of Information Bill but that will be another day's work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and compliment her on reaching the end of what has been a long odyssey for her and for Members of the Oireachtas.  A great deal of learning has been involved for all of us.  I also compliment her on her clear outline of how the regulations will work.</P>
      <P>Like all Members of the House, I welcome the regulations.  They will give us the protection we do not have at present.  Only yesterday I was reading the Official Dáil reports for 1953 and I came across a statement by Dr. Jim Ryan who was the Minister for Health at the time.  He said he did not know why people entered politics but it certainly was not for the money.  In his time in politics, which dated from the foundation of the State, he said almost nobody had left politics better off than when they entered.  We can go back further.  In 1932 when the founding fathers of the State left office most of them were beggared by the experience; most of them were barely able to make ends meet and pensions had to be introduced for ministerial service in the 1930s to redress this.</P>
      <P>All of us have seen Members of this House who were broken on leaving the House and who returned two or three years later looking healthier, fitter, younger and more prosperous.  They find it is easier to make money in the private sector than being a politician. We have been loth to speak out about this and to put the facts before the people.  These regulations will go a long way towards protecting politicians and ensuring that there is transparency and that we are seen as we are.  We have nothing to fear on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="403" /> I agree with much of what Senator Roche said, especially with his view that the operation of ethics does not take place a vacuum.  We have created a system of regulation and are serious about it.  I assure the Minister that she has the full support of the House on this, although it leaves the Minister's domain after it leaves the House today. However, it is our job, one which the House will take very seriously, to ensure that the regulations are properly implemented and adhered to.</P>
    <P>Much of the scrutiny of what takes place here and much of what the public knows about what we do is transmitted to it through the media.  In this respect, I am concerned about some recent developments in the Irish media.  Let me put this into context.  I am not indulging in media bashing as I do not wish to get into anything as simplistic, futile or pointless.  The media are very complex and diverse.  There are good and excellent aspects but there are also indifferent and bad aspects.  However, we all know that a healthy, free and vital media &mdash; the Fourth Estate as we call it &mdash; is one of the essential cornerstones of a democracy.</P>
    <P>In recent years all of us have seen huge advances in the development, growth and sophistication of the Irish media, including the growth in strength and the comprehensiveness with which it covers public issues.  As somebody who professionally spends much time reading through old documents and old newspapers, if I compare the level, depth and quality of coverage today with what existed 30 or 40 years ago, the situation, for the most part, is infinitely better.  We are a better informed community, there is a much greater level of information transmitted and there is often an attempt to understand the complexity and not to have a simplistic approach.</P>
    <P>However, I have seen some trends in the Irish media in recent times which I find deeply disturbing.  Let me give some examples as it is better to give examples than speak in generalities. <Col N="404" /> Earlier this year somebody put up a reward for information which would lead to the conviction of any politician involved in corruption to do with the planning process.  We were told this was a public spirited person.  He or she did not give their name.  We do not know why but those in the media who knew this person assured us that the person was honourable, so we had to take their word on this.</P>
    <P>A firm of Newry solicitors then placed advertisements in the newspapers seeking information.  That was all right.  However, let us look at what happened subsequently.  Over a period of weeks names, two in particular, were fed out from this firm.  Specific sums were given as having passed over as bribes and specific developments were named.  The name of one person was attached to a large sum of money and a specific development.  This person was, in effect, named by some of the newspapers. The party to which he belonged, the senior position he held, the area he represented, were all clearly identified. Not once, but over a series of weeks, information was drip fed from this legal firm in Newry whose ethics I would question very deeply.  No charges were made, no evidence of any kind was produced yet, by innuendo, this person was, in effect, guilty.  His name was bandied around these Houses, the city and the country on foot of innuendo in the newspapers, never mind that the charges were totally without foundation and that there was not a scintilla of truth in them.</P>
    <P>That person and his family lived through the summer under a cloud because, in effect, he had been convicted by the newspapers, especially by one of them.  It did not matter that there were no charges, no evidence and not a scintilla of truth in the allegations.  This man, one of the most honourable Members of the other House, a very decent and honourable man, and his family suffered horribly throughout the summer.  For all of us, our good name is the most important, cherished, valuable <Col N="405" /> thing.  Our reputation is the most valuable thing we have in politics.</P>
    <P>Eventually, when even that newspaper accepted that there was not and had never been any truth whatsoever in the accusations made, that newspaper did a brazen about-turn and asked why this poor man was subjected to all of these baseless charges.  Everyone knew, it reported, that they could not be true. It was a brazen about-turn.  I question the ethics of the solicitors involved.  I put a question mark over the so-called benefactor.  Why does he not say who he or she is and what his or her motives were?</P>
    <P>My real concern in this is the ethics of newspaper coverage, of the reporting of politics as it happened in this instance.  That was not the only incident this summer.  The person in question could not reply to the accusations.  No charges had been made, there was only innuendo, but the word was out.  He was not the only person; others were placed in a similar situation with no possibility of redress.  I wonder if the editors concerned ever asked themselves, as they were passing judgement on others, about the ethics of that piece of journalism over the course of the summer.</P>
    <P>More recently and dramatically, there is the treatment meted out to Mrs. Geraldine Mahon.  Mrs. Mahon is a friend of mine.  She is a very good and fine person. She is a private citizen; and yet on the word of a man who is in effect a convicted liar, she was harassed and hounded by the media.  She could not leave her house to go to the shops or bring her children to school.  Wherever she went she was harassed by the media. Her character was scrutinised and abused by some of the people who write on the back of our newspapers.  It was an appalling episode.  What public good or public interest justified that sort of behaviour by sections of the Irish media?  It was an outrageous intrusion on the private life of a private individual. That person had no right of redress. She eventually had to leave the country simply to escape the harassment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="406" /> Earlier this year, when we were talking about the Competition Authority and the Irish Press, we were told that Independent Newspapers had to be allowed get control of the Irish Press because if Independent Newspapers did not have this control, we would be open to an invasion from the worst of the British press, from Murdoch, Black, from Rothermere and Beaverbrook and Northcliff and the whole lot.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Their spirit lives on. We would be subject to all of this.  In the two instances I have mentioned &mdash; and there were more &mdash; it was not Murdoch or Black, it was Independent Newspapers who were leading the pack in each case.  Independent Newspapers have very little indeed to learn from Conrad Black or Rupert Murdoch when it comes to these tactics.  I will come back to this point in a moment, because there is a serious question &mdash; Senator Roche referred to it &mdash; which our newspapers and media have to address.</P>
      <P>I want to say a brief word about the famous edition of &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; which featured Mr. Tuffy.  In terms of competence and professionalism it was an abject performance, but my main concern about that programme was that there was so little concern on the part of RTE, especially the programme makers &mdash;&ldquo;Oh, we got half it right.  We did establish something&rdquo;.  Too bad if a Minister, a public person, had to have his name dragged through the mud in the half they got wrong.  There seems to be very little concern about that.  In other words, politicians, as far as some sections of the media are concerned, have no real rights.  We are all fair game. There is a huge absence of basic fair play when it comes to this type of activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anybody who criticises the media in specific terms in this country may themselves become a target.  If they do, so be it.  I hope not.  I do not think it would be particularly helpful, because I want to be helpful in what I am saying today <Col N="407" /> about ethics.  In regard to my background, many of my friends are media people.  My best man was a journalist, the godfather of my son is a journalist. I have written for all the papers, I have been on radio and television and I tend to keep low company &mdash; I mix with journalists much of the time.  They would say they keep low company by mixing with a politician.</P>
    <P>I have a strong belief in a strong media.  I am not speaking from a desire to make the headlines but because I am genuinely concerned about the behaviour of certain sections of the Irish media who regard themselves as guardians of ethics and the protectors of high standards in public life.  I know a great many journalists share my concerns.  It behoves those who control the media to address the issues of ethical and proper standards of behaviour in the media and a proper form of redress, not just small clarifications or corrections for those who have been wronged.  Innuendo can go on over a long period and a person may not have a chance to answer.  The media should address the sort of harassment which a decent private person had to suffer at the hands of the Irish media over the past few weeks.</P>
    <P>Ethics in public life extend beyond people in these Houses and the public service.  The media are very much part of the ethos of public service and they say so themselves.  They are part of a healthy democracy.  In the spirit in which I raise these questions, I ask the controlling voices in our media to look hard at some of the standards of journalism they have given us over the past few years, especially in recent times.  If they are serious about fulfilling their public functions and about being part of democracy, they have hard questions to ask themselves.  I would like to see these questions asked with a certain sense of humility on the part of the media and I would like to hear what they have to say about these issues.  With the Ethics in Public Office Act we have started our work of openness and I hope the media will do likewise.</P>

      <P>I support what Senator Manning said about the perception of politicians.  I am irritated by reporters in the print and broadcasting media who frequently draw attention to the fact that few people attend debates in the House.  The reason for this is that we may be attending meetings of committees or working in our offices.  This is an easy cheap shot and the people who make it know it is not valid or legitimate.</P>
      <P>I may have been ranging a little widely but I am following in the footsteps of the Leader.  What we are doing today is little other than a technical acknowledgement which allows the provisions of the Ethics in Public Office Act, which have already been fully debated, to come into force.  The Minister indicated in her opening remarks that she did not think it appropriate to visit the particular elements of the Bill in any great detail because this would be more relevant to Second Stage.</P>
      <P>There should be respect for political life and those engaged in it.  Since becoming a Member of this House I have gained an increased respect for those engaged in the profession of politics, which I regard as honourable.  I hope the Act will lead to an enhanced perception of those who practise this profession.  This may happen, but I am not sure it will.  It will be difficult to shake the belief of people who are convinced that politicians are corrupt and who wish to advance this view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be happy to comply with the requirements and put on public record that I am the director of several companies. I am managing director of two companies, one of which I am the majority shareholder and which has substantial property holdings.  I have never made a single penny from these companies. In fact, they have cost me money.  The purpose and intent of one <Col N="409" /> of these companies has been to enhance the cultural life of Dublin and the aim of the other has been to create a national community centre for gay people.</P>
    <P>In the firm of Hirschfeld Enterprises not only did none of us make any money but we were surcharged 20 per cent for non-distribution of profit. Because none of us took anything from the company we were penalised for working for nothing and generating money to do the work which in other countries governments accept as their responsibility.</P>
    <P>Despite this and the fact that audited accounts, as required by law, were published every year, people all over Dublin were convinced that I was personally raking in money and that this was how I managed to buy a magnificent mansion in North Great George's Street. They did not see this house when I purchased it but they subsequently saw it in newspapers.  It will be difficult to disabuse people, who are convinced that politicians are corrupt, of this cherished notion and I am not certain that this Bill will do so, nor am I certain that it is necessarily true to say that all angles are covered in this Act.</P>
    <P>I am putting hearsay evidence on the record but I was at a dinner party about two weeks ago which was attended by shrewd financial advisers and commentators. One of them in particular indicated that ways had already been discovered by accountants to get round the provisions of this Act.  The Minister is shaking her head.  I only regret that I was dislodged in another conversational area and I did not pursue the matter to find out exactly what these techniques and manoeuvres might be because I would have placed them on the record with considerable relish.  I am interpreting the Minister's body language. She is vigorously shaking her head to indicate that she does not believe this is possible but my informant indicated that it is a reality.</P>

      <P>There has been discussion on ethics in the media and I am entertained by the fact that this happened.  I used the fact that this Bill was on the Order Paper a few weeks ago to trawl widely into this area on the occasion when Bishop Comiskey was pursued to a clinic for substance abuse treatment in the United States.  I thought that doorstepping him in this way was a barbarous invasion of his right to privacy and, I imagine, something which would be completely contra-indicated by the terms of his treatment.  If somebody is suffering from alcoholism, partly as a result of stress, the last thing he needs is the pressure of the press sending notes through the door and leaving letters to be read and answered.  This seems to me to constitute a clear case of harassment.</P>

    <P>We are lucky that we have good media, particularly newspapers, in this country but I share Senator Manning's worry that there may be a growing &ldquo;tabloidisation&rdquo; of the Irish press.  I would hate to think that we would sink to the ethical level of Rupert Murdoch; this would be regrettable.  We have a tabloid <Col N="411" /> press which sometimes acts irresponsibly and deliberately paints a bad picture of politicians.</P>
    <P>I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs. Even some of my colleagues said that I joined this committee to go on trips.  I have been on the committee since its inception and I have not once been on a trip sponsored by it.  I have been abroad a good deal.  I have travelled with the IPU and have been on other missions.  I turned down several trips, one of which was to New York and another was to Israel &mdash; I declined that because I had just returned from there. I go there frequently and know the situation there and I thought it would be more valuable if another member who had never been there went.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the committee's recent trip to China.  I was there in April and it seemed to me to be idiotic to go to Beijing again to rehearse the same scenes and revisit the same places.  It would be much better to allow somebody else to go, so I withdrew from it. Nevertheless, people still have the idea that a person is only motivated to get involved in the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs because they may get a free holiday and the less responsible sections of the media have much to answer for in this area.</P>
    <P>I went on a trip to Australia on which Senator Henry had been invited. However, she could not go because of other commitments so I took her place. One of our tabloid papers got onto this and had a huge headline about politicians on junkets.  I spoke freely to them, told them I was glad to be going and I defended the idea of going.  As a nation, we needed to be represented at these international conferences if we were to be taken seriously.  When I was there I made a scathing attack on Australian foreign policy, as conducted by Gareth Evans, from inside its parliament building and it was taken up in newspapers not only in Australia but in New York, Hong Kong and other areas of the world.  However, it did not rate <Col N="412" /> one single mention in Irish newspapers, the same newspapers that put my photograph under the headline &ldquo;Politician off on a junket&rdquo; on their front pages.  I had my contribution faxed to their offices and my secretary telephoned them. However, she was told a politician on a junket was a headline and a story but a politician working was not.  That is a pity and it needs to be examined.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning referred to the recent extraordinary and bizarre happenings in what has now become known as the Lowry affair.  However, the lady to whom he referred was partly the author of her own misfortune.  She vehemently and passionately defended the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, but then found he was distancing himself from her by calling her a casual acquaintance so the way it appeared in the press was that it looked as if she had volunteered a passionate defence.  Perhaps through naiveté, she may have walked into that one herself.</P>
    <P>With regard to reporting in the newspapers, serious ethical considerations are sometimes brought up.  There was a piece in the <i>Irish Independent</i> a few weeks ago under the by-line of Sam Smyth where he made certain allegations about Minister Lowry's previous career in business which would be very worrying if substantiated.  I am not sure if they can be but if they cannot, the Minister would be well advised to have recourse to legal advice, or at least to put out a statement denying these allegations. It appeared he had been employed in an engineering firm called Butler Engineering and had walked away with 98 per cent of its contracts in an involvement with another firm subsequently, which had a serious impact on the trading position of Butler Engineering. I am not able to say if those statements are fact but if they are, they certainly do not allow Minister Lowry to be picky about the ethical considerations of others involved in business. That article raises the question of the perception of ethical standards in public life.  I am surprised more was not made of it, that its terms were not denied by <Col N="413" /> Minister Lowry, or that further action was not taken on that matter.  It would have been appropriate to have done so.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Norris for sharing his time with me.</P>
      <P>I have two reservations about the Act.  I cannot understand why there was such a delay in introducing the regulations for Deputies and Senators.  Do we all come under the regulations at the same time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that, otherwise people may be cynical and think it took a certain length of time for Deputies and Senators to get their affairs in order.</P>
      <P>My second reservation, about which I expressed great concern before, concerns medical services which may be given either free of charge or at a reduced rate.  Whatever about giving services for free, it is hard to know if they are being given at a reduced rate.  I am not as concerned with the individual getting services free of charge or at a reduced rate as I am with a member of their family.  Although that family member does not have to be named, they can often easily be identified.  I do not like that at all.</P>
      <P>Under section 34 of the Act, submissions made about medical services will be kept for 15 years.  I feel this is unnecessary.  People's private medical conditions and files are their own business and a commission of the Oireachtas investigating the ethics of Members should not even be keeping the names of those who gave treatment to this person because often that is far too specific. Psychiatric and psychological services are also included.  This is a grave intrusion on the privacy of people who do not come under these regulations but belong to the families of those who do. As a member of the medical profession, I very much resent this provision and it should not be there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The medical profession tries to be careful about keeping their patients' <Col N="414" /> records confidential.  While services rendered do not have to be put down it will be easy to identify who the person may be and the services given.  I objected strongly to this provision at the time and wished it could have been removed from the Bill but it was not. Therefore, I again record my strong objections to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are almost at the end of dealing with this issue and we hope the regulations will be in operation on 1 January.  I do not want to rehash the points made during the debates on the Bill; nevertheless, I take this opportunity to state the broad principle that the public has the right to know that its representatives are acting in the public and not their own interest.  This must be spelt out to the public so there is no shadow of doubt, and this legislation is there for that purpose.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, we must get the balance right between the public's right to know and every individual's right to privacy in personal matters and that balance is in this legislation.  It is up to this House to regulate its business under the Constitution and we must ensure the guidelines are operated in a way that carries out that specific need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact there has been such a willing acceptance of this legislation across the political spectrum in both Houses must reassure the general public that public representatives are willing to co-operate with this legislation, we want it, we see it as a protection for ourselves, the public knows where we stand, it knows about our interests and that decisions in this and the other House are taken in their interest.  I share the statements expressed by other Members.  This protects us from misunderstanding, from any kind of suspicion, and the sad perception that public representatives are in the business for personal gain.  From my experience as a public representative at local level for ten years and in this House for a shorter time, that is not the reality.  As other Senators said, public representatives work morning, noon and night for no personal gain and often <Col N="415" /> end up much poorer than they would have been had they stayed outside the political process.</P>
    <P>In saying this we are reiterating what has been said many times before. Nevertheless it must be said because, as Senator Norris stated, a headline stating a public representative is on a junket will take precedence over a report that he or she has spent an afternoon in this House working constructively on Committee Stage of a Bill which will have an important effect on people's lives.  Such political work, which requires much time and energy on the part of Members of both Houses and those on local authorities, gets little publicity.  We cannot entirely blame the media because the public wants to read juicy stories or a headline which feeds its misconceptions. There is no easy answer but the fact that we have debated the media as well as public representatives is almost inevitable because the message is passed to the public through the media.</P>
    <P>In introducing the guidelines and working with the commission we in this House need a clear understanding of what the legislation entails.  I understand from the Minister's contributions on Committee and Report Stages of the Act that such assistance will be available for individual Senators who may not be clear on what is required of them and who wish to comply with the legislation.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris raised the matter of directorships which have no remuneration. I am in that position also &mdash; I am a director of two non-profit making companies and I have no problem declaring them.  It is right that they should be declared in case legislation arrives which might affect these bodies &mdash; one is a theatre company and the other is involved in public health.  We all understand the reasons for including such matters although there may be no monetary gain.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, under Article 15.10 of the Constitution this House has the power to draw up rules for itself. The Clerk of the Seanad is on the commission so we are connected with it in <Col N="416" /> that way.  Senator Henry's point about medical assistance was debated at length on Committee and Report Stages of the Act, when concerns were expressed by Senator Mooney and herself. Last night I read that part of the Official Report; perhaps the Minister will elaborate but my understanding is that we have the power to draw up guidelines and indicate the detail required.  We can decide the level of disclosure and the amount of information made available in such sensitive personal areas.  It would be helpful if the Minister addressed this point.</P>
    <P>The two types of disclosure are annual statements of interests and <i>ad hoc</i> disclosures where there might be a conflict of interest in a specific situation. These are self-explanatory and understandable but perhaps the Minister would elaborate on <i>ad hoc</i> disclosures. The legislation provides that this will apply where a Member was voting or speaking on a matter in which he or she might be considered to have an interest. This presumably applies to anything which would be discussed in the House; even where the Member did not intend to make a contribution to the debate he or she might vote on it.</P>
    <P>As I said, inevitably the media is bound up in a debate on ethics in public office because the information is transmitted through it.  I concur with other Senators &mdash; many of whom referred to specific cases &mdash; in doubting whether the public interest was served when people's private affairs were dragged through the media, without evidence or proof that such persons were implicated in the innuendo.  I do not know if there can be collective guidelines in the media similar to the statutory regulations we are putting in place today.  If so, the media should implement guidelines for itself and for individual reporters so that they know the boundaries they should not cross.  Reporters are answerable to their editors and legal advisers within their newspapers or other media outlets but the time has come for the media voluntarily to undertake such guidelines.  I <Col N="417" /> would be interested to hear their response.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about ethics in public debate in general, not only ethics in public office.  In the last few weeks we have seen doubtful standards of public debate in the divorce referendum.  Many specific points of fact have been made, such as the total nonsense on billboards concerning increases in taxation as a direct result of divorce legislation, which has been answered by the Minister for Finance and others.  An even more damaging and unethical advertisement is the one reading: &ldquo;Hello divorce, Bye Bye Daddy&rdquo;.  That advertisement should be challenged, although I am not sure what powers the Advertising Standards Authority of Ireland has in this area.  It is appalling that this advertisement faces fathers driving to work in this city and elsewhere.  It frightens children and is hurtful and unfair to individual fathers who are concerned for their children.  There should be ethics in public debate in general, not just in public office.  It is appalling that people are subjected to such false, unfair and hurtful advertising connected to a public debate.  That point should be made in conjunction with this legislation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of these regulations from 1 January and look forward to the Minister's response to my queries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no problem with these regulations because, for 24 years in one case and 20 in another, I have been a member of a local authority and had to sign declarations of interest in respect of both.  However, the Act is an <Col N="418" /> intrusion into the lives of public representatives because we are being asked to list our interests outside our role as public representatives.  We are no longer allowed to divide ourselves into a public and a private person.  This will dictate against professional and business people entering public life; they will look at the register and will not wish to list all their interests for the public.</P>
      <P>By making this open to the public we are really opening it to the media.  Once the register is left in the Oireachtas Library, every newspaper commentator will check in what companies a Member has an interest and use that to attack that public representative.  That is not good.</P>
      <P>One of the problems opened up was the ethics of the media, which are self-regulatory. When news commentators are commentating on legal, business and public matters they do not state their directorships or their interest in what they are making into a public affair.  Some commentators have a definite interest in ensuring that certain companies receive good press because they are shareholders.  There should be a regulatory body for news commentators.</P>
      <P>It is not the ordinary news reporters but the commentators who create the problem.  While those who report on the proceedings of the Dáil and Seanad may not report enough of what I or other Members said, they give the kernel of what was said.  However, the commentators try to run down the people who work in the public arena of the Seanad and the Dáil and have created the problems and the so-called cynicism. However, the cynicism is mainly in the media itself.  Politicians would not be reelected to the Houses of the Oireachtas and local authorities if the public was that cynical about their openness and ethics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad we have had an opening of the declarations of interest.  Two Senators have stated that they are not making money out of the companies with which they are involved.  Where <Col N="419" /> will it finish?  Senator O'Sullivan will not have to declare her interest in a theatre company if the value is under £10,000.  I think many people around the country would like to know about it if she has a theatre company in which directors can have an interest of over £10,000. According to my reading, interests less than £10,000 do not have to be declared.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated in her speech that &ldquo;in no case is disclosure of the amount of income or the value of the interest required&rdquo;.  What does that mean?  It states that one has to declare an interest below a value of £10,000 but then it states that &ldquo;in no case is disclosure of the amount of income or the value of the interest required&rdquo;.  There seems to be a problem there although I may have difficulty in interpreting what the draftsman said.</P>
    <P>In regard to personal gifts, the Minister referred to Waterford Glass.  Does this mean we can get a personal gift which we can wear but not one which can be put on a mantelpiece?  There seems to be an anomaly there but I presume she will tell us about it.</P>
    <P>I am glad Senator Norris can go around the world without travelling through the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I have no problem going on trips and I will go on any I find of value. People can call it a junket or whatever they like but no voter of mine has ever said to me that they were not voting for me because I went on a trip.  Many people regard trips as a valuable learning process if they are dealt with properly. I do not think that anyone would give out about that.</P>
    <P>There is now a statutory regulatory body for public representatives.  It is time for statutory regulatory bodies to be set up for the legal, medical and insurance professions.  Why do public representatives have to be statutorily regulated when there are huge problems in other areas which would be better addressed if they were regulated by statute rather than by self-regulatory bodies? These are the areas where the major problems have arisen.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="420" /> I am worried about the question of an <i>ad hoc</i> declaration of interest if we are speaking or voting in the House.  That means that every farmer in the Oireachtas would have to declare that interest.  Perhaps I should have read the Bill more closely but it appears from the Minister's speech that those involved in the farming profession will have to declare that interest if they speak or vote on a farming issue.  Obviously, they and their wives, families, cousins and so on have an interest.  Where does the <i>ad hoc</i> declaration end?</P>
    <P>Ministers, office holders, Members of the Oireachtas and directors and chief executives of State companies are mentioned on a few occasions in the Minister's speech.  She states that whereas our declaration of interests will be an open declaration, the declarations of those who work for semi-State companies will be held in private.  Ministers' special advisers are also mentioned in the speech but the Minister does not say whether they have to declare their interests and, if they have, where they have to declare them.</P>
    <P>The Act will not create many problems. However, in the past number of years fewer and fewer businessmen have entered the Houses of the Oireachtas and I feel that this Act will mean even fewer people taking up directorships in public companies.  I presume certain Ministers would like that because it would mean they could fill the vacancies with civil servants and so on.  There is a danger that people of standing in the business community could be lost to those companies because they will not want to get involved, not just because of the openness required under this Act but because of what has happened to directors of public companies in the past six months.  Enough has been said about that.</P>
    <P>I regret that Senator Norris stated that the Minister, Deputy Lowry, might have been unethical in his dealings with a certain company.  I do not think the company would have wished to be named here by Senator Norris because <Col N="421" /> that matter has been finished for many years.  If there had been any problems they would have been well ironed out by now and it was not helpful to have that engineering company named here again this evening.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Act and thank the Minister for getting it passed.</P>

      <P>I understand the importance of the subject with which Senator Lanigan is dealing.  I thank the House for the very constructive and interesting contributions.  I always find it a pleasure to come to the Seanad as the quality of discussion is always very high. The tone and atmosphere in this House is a pleasure.</P>
      <P>Senator Lanigan asked if ministerial special advisers will have to make declarations of interest.  Senior special advisers, but not personal secretaries or drivers, will have to make declarations of interest in the same way as principal officer level civil servants.  However, ministerial special advisers, as distinct from civil servants, are political appointees and serve in quasi-public positions.  Declarations made by such advisers will be published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Lanigan raised the issue of <i>ad hoc</i> declarations by Members.  He inquired whether a Senator who is also a farmer would have to declare that they own a farm and make money from headage each time a debate took place on headage.  The Act specifically states that if the nature of one's interest is very general &mdash; such as being a farmer, in relation to a debate on agriculture, or a parent, in relation to a debate on education &mdash; that interest need not be declared.  In a case where, for example, a Member owned shares in a particular company, the fortunes of which were <Col N="422" /> the subject of a vote or debate in the Seanad, the Senator involved would have to declare that interest.  The House itself would clarify the level of detail required.  That is specified in the Act. This issue involves people who have a material interest in and stand to benefit from the matter under discussion rather than someone speaking or voting in a general capacity as a parent, taxpayer, mortgage holder or farmer.  Broad general interests are unimportant, but specific interests must be declared.</P>
    <P>Senators Lanigan and Norris raised the issue of personal gifts.  A present given to me by my husband on my birthday represents a personal gifts.  If that gift happened to be worth £700 I would not have to declare it because it is of a personal nature.  If I were presented with a gift at a function that was valued at over £500 &mdash; I usually receive a bunch of flowers, with which I am delighted &mdash; that gift would become the property of the State.  However, this would not be the case in respect of an election donation, which is declarable but not surrenderable.  This will put Ministers on the same footing as other people. That is the distinction between a personal gift, which is a gift presented to one by friends or family and is not declarable, and a gift given to a Member by virtue of the office they hold.  The gift of a piece of Waterford Glass worth £700 presented by to a Member in their capacity as president of the local golf club is not surrenderable because it is given by virtue of a different kind of office.  Under section 15, gifts are surrenderable if presented by virtue of ministerial office.</P>
    <P>Directorships are declarable under section 3 of the Second Schedule regardless of whether they yield money. Many Members are directors of charitable bodies.  I myself am a patron of a housing association for homeless women.  Such directorships are declarable despite the fact that they do not yield any financial gain.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan also inquired whether this legislation was intrusive and if it would drive business people out <Col N="423" /> of politics.  Senator Quinn, who is one of Ireland's leading business people and has entered politics, made a splendid speech during the Second Stage debate. He argued cogently that the kind of declaration involved in the Ethics in Public Office Act would not be a barrier to a business person such as himself becoming involved in public service also.  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, a well known business person, declared his interests on the day he was elected to that office.  It was no big deal.  There have been clear examples of people who place such interests on the record with no difficulty.  Personally, I do not believe this will prove to be a problem. It is important, however, to stop the kind of innuendo which can occur.</P>
    <P>The public must clearly see that someone engaged in public affairs must not be involved with their own private business.  That is a protection for business people who become involved in public life.  The public must be sure that a statutory framework of rules and regulations exists to ensure that the two remain separate.  This has been the standard to date for people involved in public life who have private business interests.  The State has been well served by such people.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Sullivan raised the question of detail with regard to <i>ad hoc</i> declarations when a Member is speaking or voting.  The person need only say &ldquo;I have an interest&rdquo;, nothing more.  Such declarations concern cases where a specific material interest, not shared by a broad generality of people, is involved.  Provision is made under section 30 of the Act for people to make voluntary statements.  I would advise Members that if they are in doubt about something, they should declare an interest.  The Act specifies statutory obligations and does not include a catchall clause.  We were advised that such a clause would be unconstitutional. If people are in doubt, provision is made under section 30 to deal with that eventuality.  Any voluntary declarations made under section 30 have the same <Col N="424" /> status as declarations made under the remainder of the Act.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry raised the issue of medical declarations.  Section 34 (2) deals with this question and is a modification of section 34 (1).  A huge amount of detail would be required in relation to medical or legal expenses if that exclusion were not present.  I must declare that at present Senator Henry is treating me for a problem with varicose veins.  She will be fully paid for this service by the VHI.  I respect the Senator's sincerity in making that point.  Section 34 (2) specifies in law how little detail is required.  The Select Committee of this House will provide further guidelines in that regard.  The names of relatives receiving treatment, the area of medicine or the specialist involved need not be provided.  All that need be declared is that medical treatment was received in respect of a connected person.  Only a very general declaration is required. No one will know whether my relations are suffering from mental illness and being treated free of charge by somebody else.  Reasonable safeguards are provided, but I understand the Senator's concerns.</P>
    <P>Senator Roche raised a number of specific points.  I can inform the Senator that the Select Committee will have teeth.  The Privilege and Compelability Bill was recently published and similar, in some cases slightly stronger, powers as those provided in legislation are included there.</P>
    <P>The Senator also raised the issue of the possibility of the Select Committee being partisan in nature.  He stated that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges had been very non-partisan and I acknowledge that fact.  Whatever the composition of the Select Committee on a party basis, it will be bound by the rules of natural justice.  It will have to act in a quasi-judicial manner.  This is all set out within the terms of the Act.  The overriding requirement of natural justice will be present.  Whatever people's political passions, on attending the committee they will be bound by the rules of natural justice in relation to assessing <Col N="425" /> or ruling on any particular complaint.  I feel confident that the Select Committees in both Houses will work along those lines.  In relation to annual statements, provision has been made for voluntary statements in that regard.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris raised the question of loopholes.  I have been approached by Members who stated that they have placed property in the names of their wives or partners.  Such eventualities are covered under the Act.  If a Member places property under another person's name without a consideration, that property is treated as theirs for the purposes of this Act in the same way as it would be treated under the Capital Acquisitions Act.  Therefore, they are trapped.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry expressed concern that the dates on the Orders would differ between the Houses.  The dates for both will be exactly the same.  We had hoped to place this motion before the House last week but the House was involved with other business.  A delay of 14 days has taken place in making the Orders but the dates are identical for both Houses.  The Senator was also concerned with regard to information being held for 15 years under section 34 (2). So little information will be available that holding it for 15 years will not cause a problem.  If problems emerge with any part of this legislation, it will be revisited.  The purpose of the legislation is to be helpful to the public service and the public process.  It is not designed to catch or trap people or deal with them in an unfair manner.  The legislation is concerned with promoting trust in public life and in the quality of public service.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning raised an important point on the conduct of the media, which perhaps does not relate directly to the Act or this motion.  I strongly agree with what he said.  When drawing up the legislation we were careful to strike a fair balance between the right of private citizens to privacy and public disclosure for public figures.  Although this legislation was complicated, we were scrupulous in keeping that private-public <Col N="426" /> focus.  That is why there are different rules and regulations for the different groups of people covered under the Act.  I feel sorry for private citizens who do not put their head above parapet for election.  The media have no business showing their photographs or dragging them through the mud by innuendo.  I support what Senator Manning said in that regard.</P>
    <P>A number of Members referred to the need for guidelines for the media.  A commission on the newspaper industry is sitting at present.  I propose to give it a copy of today's debate and will ask it to look at issues raised by Senators, which are important and should be taken on board by the commission.  The media, including the national newspapers, have looked for a revision of the libel laws which they believe gags investigative journalism.  Greater openness brings with it greater responsibility. I am preparing legislation on freedom of information which will open up a considerable amount of public information to journalists and which will offer new challenges.  There is that concomitant responsibility on people to exercise that freedom and openness responsibly.</P>
    <P>Any Government examining proposals to loosen the libel laws must take into account how responsibly or irresponsibly the media behave in relation to private citizens who do not deserve to have their photographs, homes or details of their personal lives sprawled across the newspapers with all sorts of innuendo.  While those of us in public life put our heads above the parapet and we take what we get, people in private life do not deserve to be dragged through the media.  I thank Senator Manning and other Senators for raising that important point.</P>
    <P>We have come to the end of an era. Now that the regulations will be brought in, I have finished one phase of my life, one in which I learned a lot about the legislative process.  At times I found it a tedious, frustrating and slow business, but I also found it a worth-while exercise and learning experience.  I was supported <Col N="427" /> by excellent officials in the Office of the Tánaiste.  The Act is now the property of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Although my office no longer has a statutory function, it will give any assistance or advice to the Select Committee or to the commission.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators who contributed to the debate on the Act and on this order. It was helpful and fruitful and done in an open spirit.  I thank the civil servants who prepared the Act and the draftsperson, whose Victorian English I might have railed against from time to time. However, Laney Bacon did a smashing job.  I hope that in practice the Act will do what we aimed for in theory, that it will promote respect for people in public life by separating the myth from the reality, which will be on record, and that the public will be able to trust those of us engaged in public business to keep our public duties and our private business interests separate.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann, concerned at the growing discrepancy between the results of the internationally approved and standardised Labour Force Survey and the figures for the live register of those signing on for unemployment benefit from the Department of Social Welfare, requests the Government to devise a new system of regular surveys of employment which will give an accurate basis for policy formation in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate is in the same context as previous debates on unemployment here, particularly in Private Members' time.  We had a debate only two weeks ago in the name of the Independent <Col N="428" /> Senators on jobs in the services sector. Seanad Éireann is contributing well to this general debate on unemployment, and long-term unemployment in particular, which is of primary interest and concern to all parties in these Houses.</P>
    <P>We were concerned that the figures indicated in the Labour Force Survey are significantly different from those indicated by the Department of Social Welfare's live register.  For example, the recent figures for the period up to April 1995 indicated there was an increase of 49,000 people at work in the year to April 1995.  That significant increase is obviously welcomed by all of us.  When that figure was calculated, it put unemployment at 192,000 while the live register figure for the same time stated a figure of 276,000.  That is quite a significant discrepancy.</P>
    <P>In any kind of Government planning we need to know the facts.  We need to have an accurate picture of the basis on which policy decisions are being made. With long-term unemployment in particular, we need to be able to put faces on the people about whom we are talking. We have in some ways tended to despair of the black hole of long-term unemployment because we have looked at a sizeable figure which seemed to be uncrackable for so long.  There seemed to be an indication that it was almost inevitable that we have a large number of long-term unemployed people in our society.  That is not the present Government's attitude or, indeed, the attitude of previous Governments.  It is much more difficult to make proper policy planning decisions when one does not have an accurate indication.</P>
    <P>These figures have been released at an appropriate time because several factors dovetail together on this issue which can help to give accurate statistics on which to base Government action. For example, the local employment service has been set up recently following on report No. 4 of the National Economic and Social Forum.  That is being put in place around the country as a result of a decision, which related to that report, around the time of the last <Col N="429" /> budget.  It will put mentors in place around the country whose job is to relate directly to a specific number of long-term unemployed in each area.  In other words, it will give someone the job of relating to all of the people around the country who are long-term unemployed. This humanises the problem of long-term unemployment.  There is much potential there for knowing exactly what action needs to be taken for each individual.  That is part of the brief of the people who will be working under the scheme.  They will have to find out whether a person needs more training or education, whether there is a specific job for which the person might apply and so on.  It challenges the services which are already there to respond to the genuine needs of the long-term unemployed.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other areas which are being worked on at present.  I understand, and the Minister may confirm, that the Government is to undertake some pilot studies in urban and rural areas on what jobs are being created and who is getting them, again, in order to get an accurate picture of what is going on.</P>
    <P>We are well aware that the Minister for Social Welfare is trying to identify the obstacles within the social welfare system which prevent people taking up employment.  I refer to what is commonly known as the poverty trap, where people would almost be better off if they remained unemployed than if they took up employment.</P>
    <P>There are also tax related areas, which are being dealt with by the Department of Finance.  Significant measures have been taken in the last budget, and also in the previous budget, to make it easier for employers to take on extra people.  The Cabinet recently spent time discussing the whole area of long-term unemployment.</P>
    <P>There are a number of initiatives which are being brought together to address the problem of long-term unemployment, but unless we have sound facts and figures on which to base them it will be very difficult to determine <Col N="430" /> what action needs to be taken.  No matter what the issue, you need an accurate picture of it before you can deal with it.</P>
    <P>We are all well aware, and it was again referred to in the debate on the services sector, that there is a large black economy.  We are not exactly sure what it is, where it is or the way in which it operates.  There is no doubt that it exists and it functions more strongly in certain sectors than in others.</P>
    <P>It is important that research is undertaken on what jobs are being created and who is in a position to take up those jobs.  I am a member of the midwest regional authority.  We are trying to find out what the cost per job is of job creation in different sectors.  In other words, is creating jobs in one sector as opposed to another useful, cost effective and a good way to spend public money? Is it very expensive to create one job in one area and a lot cheaper to give local authorities the power to employ people?  Many public representatives in local authorities will probably say it would be quite cost effective to empower local authorities to employ more people and that they would certainly have work for them to do.  The midwest regional authority is trying to create categories in order to have more accurate information as to how public money is being spent on job creation.</P>
    <P>The Labour Force Survey, to which we refer in our motion, indicates that quite a significant proportion of the extra jobs are being created by the private sector.  That is welcome. Creating jobs in the public sector obviously involves spending public money.  One is also spending public money to some extent in creating jobs in the private sector but we hope it would be to a lesser extent.  If you are to have any kind of a good active economy you need a good active private sector, which is not only creating wealth but also jobs.  The figures from the Labour Force Survey indicate that that is indeed the case and that the private sector is, in fact, improving in that area. This is welcome because for a long time indigenous Irish industries were not performing <Col N="431" /> particularly well in the area of job creation.  For a long time we were relying on multinationals and companies from abroad to create jobs.  We still need to rely on both, but it is encouraging that there is an indication that the Irish private sector is also relatively successful in creating jobs.</P>
    <P>There is also the community sector and the kind of energy that has been generated in response to significant levels of direct EU funding for partnerships, Leader groups and others.  It is important that this energy is channelled in a positive way towards job creation because the funds may not be as flúirseach after 1999 as they have been to date.</P>
    <P>There is also a need to inject momentum into the structure of local and national government to enable work to continue.  A significant number of jobs have been created at that level because of community determination.  People are loyal to their local community and set up tourism projects or small industries which are creating jobs.  The county enterprise boards also play an important role in that area.  Jobs are now being created in areas which were not significant in the past.  I single out the arts as an area which has provided a significant level of job creation.</P>
    <P>We proposed this motion this evening because we believe it is important that these threads are gathered together in a purposeful way and that there is a factual basis upon which we can deal with job creation, particularly for people who have been out of employment for a long period.  Until we have accurate statistics to which we can refer with certainty and structures which reach right down to the long-term unemployed we will not be able to build on the real picture.  Local employment service is a crucial factor. We hope this debate will elucidate some of the areas uncovered by this discrepancy and help ascertain what action is necessary to ensure an accurate picture of the problem.  We can then proceed to put policies and arrangements in place that will help to reduce this figure. <Col N="432" /> There is never an acceptable level of unemployment but we should at least reduce it so as to provide meaningful opportunities for the long-term unemployed.</P>
    <P>It is important to welcome the fact that overall EU employment fell over recent years while ours has been growing. We should not see doom and gloom in Irish unemployment trends.  There was an increase of 49,000 between April 1994 and April 1995 and this seems to be part of a welcome ongoing trend.  We need to deal with the problems thrown up by the discrepancies in these figures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  It is not a party political motion but an issue which is of concern to all political parties.  For the last number of years, unemployment has been the most serious problem affecting this country. In proposing the motion we thought it was important to point out that we should not address this problem in a willy-nilly or panicky fashion.  We should study it in a scientific manner that will allow us to tackle it properly.</P>
      <P>The Labour Force Survey figures when contrasted with those on the live register were a cause of alarm to many people because of the huge discrepancy.  The Labour Force Survey is a scientific survey which accurately reflects the number of people in employment while the live register simply reflects the number claiming social welfare payments.  Such a huge discrepancy means there is something radically wrong.  We can hazard a guess as to what that is and we can assume that much of it is caused by the black economy and other factors.  It is important that the Government takes this issue seriously and studies it with a view to ascertaining the exact nature of the discrepancy.  It is only when we know the reason that we can address the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our past reaction to unemployment means we have empty IDA factories which were built with a view to obtaining jobs for various regions.  We offered huge incentives in the form of grant aid to multinationals which at the time seemed a good idea and may have <Col N="433" /> worked in some areas.  Certain companies gave invaluable service in terms of job creation and job maintenance.  Sadly much of that effort disappeared and the profit from those businesses was invested elsewhere.  As soon as the grant aid ended the companies disappeared back to where they came from.  It was not the most successful way to tackle unemployment and warranted further study.  That is still the case because while one can build a factory anywhere and give various grants, the requirement to create employment is not there.</P>
    <P>Our policy does not adequately encourage people to employ others.  I wanted to take on a part-time secretary and I was amazed by the amount of work involved.  I had to contact the tax office which required forms to be filled out on a weekly and monthly basis, there was also the question of insurance, etc.  My requirement was simple but I pity an individual setting up a business who is suddenly inundated with forms and bureaucracy.  It is assumed that they will make a massive profit in their first year of trading and the tax man is on their doorstep in no time.  We cannot seriously give out taxpayers' money with one hand and push those people out of business with the other.  We must decide on a sensible way to address business because we are not doing it properly.</P>
    <P>As a member of a county enterprise board, I believe that grant aid should be linked directly to employment.  We still invest taxpayers' money in the purchase of plant and machinery where there is no guarantee of employment.  In many cases no employment is created, yet the money is handed out wholesale.  Several county enterprise boards are returning money because there are not enough ideas for new businesses.  There is no shortage of money for people setting up businesses but we are failing to produce jobs because we are not focused correctly. We are still too focused on capital, machinery and plant when we should be focused on employment.</P>
    <P>We must address the creation of one stop shops to assist people.  I am a <Col N="434" /> Senator and a solicitor but when I rang the tax office, I had to ask each individual question about VAT and income tax.  Why does one have to drag information out of them?  Why is there not somebody who will immediately give one a step by step guide to employing someone?  I do not know how Joe Soap manages because they are not the least bit helpful.  It has been said that we are creating customer friendly services in the tax offices but I have no experience of them.</P>
    <P>People are anxious to create employment but the risk, hassle and expense are serious disincentives.  We also have the other extreme where people are providing employment without proper contracts or on a part-time basis.  They are taking full advantage of the fact that women might only want to work part-time. In my county they are employing them as mushroom pickers and are not paying them adequately.  They are giving the women no protection under the law.  They are registering some as employees for tax purposes but most are not registered.  The women are not given a choice in the matter and there appears to be no investigation of this practice.  Nobody seems to care; a blind eye is turned in the name of employment. That is not proper employment.</P>
    <P>I have more to say on the issue than I originally anticipated.  There is a number of problems.  Senator O'Sullivan has already mentioned the black economy and we must address that.  We also must link the taxation and social welfare systems in a formal sense and we have the computers to do that.  We need to create a greater incentive to work and to have a greater differentiation between social welfare payments and low wages.  If we address the unemployment problem properly we will be able to afford to pay the genuinely unemployed the money they need to make ends meet.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion on the accuracy of statistics on unemployment. The last set of unemployment figures released by the Government show that the seasonally adjusted unemployment <Col N="435" /> total has risen by 4,000.  At the same time our economy is supposed to be doing well &mdash; a great economy but poor when it comes to unemployment figures and it does not appear to be getting any better.  The Central Bank has just increased its estimate of the jobless total for 1995 by 7,000.  Independent stockbrokers are claiming that the Government will fall substantially short of its modest targets this year.</P>
      <P>Something is fundamentally wrong; indeed, many things are wrong starting with the figures.  The totals from the live register do not tally with the Labour Force Survey figures and neither set of figures tells us what we need to know. They are not released often enough to be useful.  We need to know what types of jobs have been lost and how many in each sector.  That information is necessary to target the problem rather than prolong it.  The material being produced at present is too dated and sketchy to be of use.  The Labour Force Survey should be conducted quarterly rather than annually.  This would cost an additional £1.9 million per year but it would be money well spent.</P>
      <P>In addition to more regular figures, we need to know who is looking for jobs, where they are, what jobs they can seek and what jobs they can do.  We need to know what sectors are recruiting people or are shedding jobs. We need to know the employment trends here and abroad.  The Government has made great play of its recent Cabinet summit on long-term unemployment. It was as if the Government suddenly discovered the problem; it was as if it had not realised the significance of the problem until then.  However, nothing has emerged to tackle the crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told we will get White Papers on training and employment.  More than two years ago the Department of Enterprise and Employment told us that the White Papers would be available shortly.  Why is there a delay?  The White Papers while important and welcome will not produce immediate solutions. Discussion on them is likely to <Col N="436" /> take a year and only then will new legislation be introduced.</P>
    <P>Our party is proposing radical new measures, including special tax benefits for those creating jobs and training staff. We also want to enhance the competitiveness of the economy, address employers' PRSI, create enterprise zones and aid the services sector which has contributed so much to employment and is the major area of potential employment growth.  I call on the Government to rationalise the measures for dealing with unemployment.  At present, there are almost 80 different industrial development boards dealing with job creation.  There are also eight Ministers and Ministers of State with responsibility for different employment and enterprise measures.  If a proliferation of agencies and Ministers could solve the Irish unemployment and enterprise problems we have a solution already.  However, we do not.  There is excessive duplication and overlap and, as a consequence, money, opportunities and time are being wasted.  Only one Minister should have responsibility for the different measures to deal with unemployment.  Otherwise, there can be no overview of the situation.</P>
    <P>Our social welfare system does not work properly either.  That is not surprising as it is based on a system invented at the turn of the century, a system designed to compensate people who were without work for a few months at a time.  It was never envisaged that people would be without work for years on end or would never work at all. It is a passive system.  It was never envisaged that some areas would have unemployment rates of 90 per cent.  Armed with the information we should be getting we should train people for jobs that exist or might be created.  We can offer the long-term unemployed one-to-one assistance with the practicalities of getting jobs and help with CVs, job applications and interviews.  We can give them a chance to work in the voluntary and social sectors to supplement incomes.  We can get them out of the <Col N="437" /> cycle of unemployment and give them real work experience.</P>
    <P>Even with the measures I have outlined there are still major obstacles in the way of Irish entrepreneurs.  Telecommunications have been mentioned. The telecommunications industry is changing fast.  The services modern companies require are growing in complexity and are putting huge demands on the existing network.  The move to fibre optic systems is no longer something to be planned for &mdash; it must start happening across the country right now. It is unbelievable that we do not have a telecentre in Ireland despite the fact that the greatest job creation potential in the world today exists in telemarketing and the telephonic communications area.  If we can make these changes we can reverse our drop down the competitive table.  In the last three years we have plummeted from ninth to 92nd place in terms of our competitiveness with countries around the world.  When I talk to entrepreneurs about the problems they face, their recurring complaint is that they continuously run into EU directives.  There seems to be no warning and little logic about when those rules appear.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by offering two examples from my clinic in Galway of the lack of common sense that is applied to this issue.  In the first case, a young unemployed person did not want to draw unemployment assistance but gave in and started doing so last August.  He wanted to get onto a FÁS course on sound production and development for bands and so forth.  As he was not six months on the live register he could not be considered for the FÁS course.  In total frustration he took the boat to London last Friday and his mother rang me on Monday.</P>
    <P>He had informed the unemployment office that he would be back in a fortnight but then he announced to her that he would not come back until Christmas.  He wanted to know if there was any chance that somebody could sign on or get credits for him so that when he returned at Christmas he <Col N="438" /> would have been signing on for six months and be able to join the FÁS course.  As a matter of interest, he was receiving £20.40 per week so he was not signing on for the money; he was signing on simply to get on the course.  Of course, the bureaucracy says no.  Unless he returns from England and continues to sign on until Christmas he cannot join the course in the new year.</P>
    <P>That is utterly ridiculous.  This is a young man who wants to work and learn and who is going into an area of great potential.  He has natural ability in the music and sound area.  He has gone to England and the likelihood is that he will not come back.  Another person who came to my clinic yesterday has been out of work for several years.  His wife has a good steady job in Telecom Éireann.  Because of her job, he does not qualify for any unemployment assistance due to the fact that UA is means tested.  He does not have a problem with that, but again he has been all over the FÁS system to try to get into some form of training or social or community work to get him out of the house and into a job; but because his wife is employed and he does not qualify for unemployment assistance, he is not eligible to attend any of the FÁS schemes. There are two simple examples of common sense gone wrong.</P>
    <P>I had the good fortune to work with people from all parties on the unemployment committee for about 12 months before the last election.  We came up with many good, practical proposals. We came up with an all-party set of proposals to get people on the dole who want to work out to work.  We came up against every possible obstacle that the bureaucracy and the public service could throw at us.  We can talk all we like but until we start using a bit of common sense in regard to how we deal with unemployment in this country we will continue waffling as we are doing this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. J. Higgins) Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. J. Higgins)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. J. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Labour Party for bringing the <Col N="439" /> motion to the House.  I welcome once again the opportunity which this motion offers to outline the position as to the measurements of employment and unemployment, particularly in view of some of the confusing commentary which has been made in the media in recent times.</P>
      <P>At the outset I want to stress that the Labour Force Survey provides the only objective information on employment and unemployment.  The live register, on the other hand, relates to persons who fall within the scope of certain social welfare schemes.  Changes in the administrative rules and practices governing these welfare schemes have an impact on the live register and this highlights very well why the live register should not be regarded as an objective measurement of unemployment.  Nevertheless, I understand the concerns that have been expressed about the widening difference between the live register and the Labour Force Survey.  This has been the subject matter of successive parliamentary questions in the other House.</P>
      <P>Since the late 1970s the live register total has always exceeded the Labour Force Survey estimate of unemployment. The difference was relatively small until the mid 1980s but it has grown considerably since then, so clearly some new factors must have come into play during that time.  The latest figures for April 1995 show that the number on the live register exceeds the survey estimate of the number unemployed by some 84,000.  In a moment I will look at some of the factors that might account for this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lest anyone think that we are out of step with the rest of Europe, can I say &mdash; I brought this to the attention of the other House when parliamentary questions arose in relation to the discrepancy &mdash; that in relation to comparisons with other countries, there is a growing disparity between the two in virtually every other European country.  For example, in Belgium the gap is 163,000; in Denmark, 130,000: in Greece, 188,000; <Col N="440" /> in Italy the figure is huge, something over one million.</P>
    <P>Before trying to explain the differential, it is important to understand the precise nature of the survey and the register.  The Labour Force Survey was first conducted in Ireland in 1975 and has followed a consistent methodology since then.  The survey has been conducted on an annual basis since 1983.  It is the largest sample survey in the State and covers a sample of some 47,000 households, that is about one in 20 of all households.</P>
    <P>The survey provides classification of persons employed and unemployed which are in accordance with standard definitions recommended by the International Labour Office.  These classifications are used for international comparisons and also provide benchmark estimates of the standardised unemployment rate for April of each year.  The survey provides information on an annual basis only.  Preliminary summary results are published in October while more detailed reports are prepared later by the CSO.  The preliminary results for 1995 were published on 24 October 1995 and it is these that have sparked off the latest controversy.  The detailed report for 1994 is due for publication in the next two weeks.</P>
    <P>Everyone recognises that it is essential for the management of the economy that statistics in the labour market are compiled regularly and that the statistics can be understood and trusted by the public.  However, it has been customary for years now in the periods between the Labour Force Surveys to use the live register as a short term trend indicator for unemployment.  This is an important point; it can be used to indicate only the trend in unemployment, that is, whether it is rising or falling and just how fast, but not to estimate the absolute level of unemployment.  However, the widening gap between the register and the survey is obviously calling this limited usage into question.  Furthermore, just as for unemployment, there is no comprehensive and timely short term indicator of trends in employment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="441" /> Not unexpectedly, the demand for more frequent and timely information on both employment and unemployment has been growing in recent times and especially in view of the latest survey figures.  I recognise the legitimacy of these demands.  At EU level proposals for labour force surveys based on sub-annual employment and unemployment estimates are under discussion at working party level.</P>
    <P>The National Statistics Board has recommended in its <i>Strategy for Statistics 1993 &mdash; 1997,</i> that the CSO examine the feasibility of a sub-annual labour force survey.  The new board, appointed on a statutory basis in late 1994, reviewed this recommendation and consulted over 100 users of statistics on the desirability of a sub-annual multipurpose survey covering labour force, market and social statistics.  There has been widespread support both for sub-annual labour force statistics and for the development of a data base on a wide range of social statistics.</P>
    <P>Following the recommendations from the board, proposals in relation to a quarterly survey have been formulated by the CSO in consultation with the relevant Government Departments and agencies.  I intend to bring these proposals to Government in the coming weeks.  As has been mentioned by the sponsor of the motion, Senator O'Sullivan, and Senator Fahey, there is a considerable cost factor involved; but in the interest of accurate, up to date data, and in conformity with the best international norms and standards, it is in everybody's interest that we have the sub-annual surveys and, without wishing to be pre-emptive, the Government can generally be assumed to be moving in the direction of sub-annual surveys, irrespective of the cost factor.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Sullivan makes a valid point when she mentions the need to go behind the cold hard statistics, to humanise the figures.  We will be looking at that aspect as well.  If a survey is to be comprehensive, it should be as detailed, as multifaceted, as accurate and as penetrative as possible.  It should <Col N="442" /> be as comprehensive as possible in relation to the range of areas of activity, social and otherwise that should be investigated and we will be looking at that.</P>
    <P>Senator Gallagher's point went somewhat gone beyond the scope of the actual motion itself.  We are talking about the accuracy of the statistics as a barometer for unemployment and she strayed into the area of unemployment initiatives and unemployment performance and so on.  However, from the point of view of accuracy, we should try and determine precisely what the figures are and we will be looking at that in the context of the division that will take place.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Sullivan makes a valid point in relation to job creation initiatives and training programmes.  Whatever initiatives we introduce will be better focused as a result of a general acceptance of the Labour Force Survey as being the accurate barometer.</P>
    <P>I take the point made by Senator Fahey that we need radical new measures, and the Government is looking at that at present.  That was very much the subject matter of a long Cabinet meeting.  It will be the first in the series of radical new measures dealing with unemployment.  I agree there is an over-prevalence of bureaucracy.  Often many schemes are riddled with anomalies, distortions, red tape and inhibitions and we will have to remove many of these warts from the system.</P>
    <P>The sub-annual survey, if agreed by the Government, will provide quarterly information on employment and unemployment as well as information on selected social topics.  Data will be collected from householders using laptop computer technology and quarterly surveys and results will be available within about three months.  This will be a considerable improvement on the current frequency and timeliness of labour force statistics.  There will be a need for significant preparatory work in relation to sampling design, the selection of social topics, staff training and the use of new technology before the survey can begin.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="443" /> I mentioned earlier that I would return to the issue of the gap between the live register and the Labour Force Survey figures, which is the subject of this motion.  The CSO published an explanatory note with its most recent live register statement, which I have laid in the Oireachtas Library, indicating that the gap between the two sources is due to the essential differences in what they measure.</P>
    <P>The recent LFS results are based on a classification of persons according to their own description of their situation, that is, whether at work, unemployed, working in the home, retired, etc., while, as I indicated previously, the live register is a count of claimants falling within the scope of certain social welfare schemes.</P>
    <P>No single factor can explain all of the difference of 84,000.  I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate what I have stated publicly, namely, that I do not believe, as has been suggested by some commentators, that the increasing difference is due to any increase in the level of social welfare fraud.  While this is primarily a matter for the Minister for Social Welfare, I understand that wide ranging measures have been introduced to reduce the incidence of fraud and to ensure that the vast majority of people who sign on are simply exercising their full and proper entitlement to do so.</P>
    <P>The following factors, on the other hand, are likely to have had an upward influence on the live register and to have contributed to the divergence in recent years: equality in the mid-1980s which increased the number of women signing on without any changes in their labour force status; the introduction of signing on as an eligibility requirement for subsequent participation in employment or training schemes; the increasing number of part-time and occasional workers, other than those on systematic short time, who sign on in respect of days when they are not employed; changes in the rules and practices in relation to means testing; changes in the levels of UA and UB payments and <Col N="444" /> arrangements for the splitting of entitlements between spouses.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to quantify the exact impact of any one of these factors but clearly the numbers signing on simply to qualify for training schemes and the numbers in temporary part-time employment who are legitimately signing on would account for a substantial proportion of the difference.</P>
    <P>I am confident that arrangements will be agreed shortly to ensure that objective statistics on numbers employed and unemployed will be available on a quarterly basis.  Besides giving us a much better picture of the real situation as regards each, the quarterly survey will be expanded to include inquiries on a range of social topics, as suggested by Senator O'Sullivan, for which we have at present very little information.  The availability of the more frequent figures would lessen the reliance on the live register as an indicator.  This can only be good because it allows us to reduce our dependence on a measure whose usefulness as a short-term statistical indicator of the level of unemployment has diminished greatly over the years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the opportunity to speak and I welcome the Minister. I support the motion because I believe the present tools we have for measuring our success or otherwise in job creation are inadequate.  The Minister explained well what the two measurements are: one measures unemployment and the other measures employment and job creation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a serious danger that if we only publish unemployment figures which are not improving we will create an era of pessimism during which people will not be willing to invest.  On the other hand, if we are able to show that jobs are being created, we will create optimism, which is the seed ground in which people are willing to invest.  It is important that we measure both employment and unemployment. We know what the unemployment figure is but we should draw equal attention to the number of jobs being <Col N="445" /> created.  To do so, it may be necessary to carry out an unemployment survey more often than we do.</P>
    <P>The most recent survey was published a week or so ago in respect of the year to last April.  It provides interesting figures on which I will later concentrate for a few moments.  These surveys are published only once a year and are six months out of date.  On this basis they do not get anything like the attention paid to unemployment figures and the live register.  I urge that we find some way to draw both measures to the attention of the public and that they be published at the same time.</P>
    <P>Many Members have drawn attention to the critical importance of the service sector in creating jobs.  In the future jobs will be in services and not in manufacturing. It is vitally important that we base our policy on this fact rather than continuing the approach we have had for 40 years of favouring manufacturing at every turn while penalising services.</P>
    <P>The truth of this becomes blindingly obvious when we look at the latest employment survey.  Of the 49,000 additional jobs created, more than three quarters were in services.  The trend towards services is not something of the future and is not a speculative forecast that may or may not come to pass.  This trend is definite and is a living reality. Even more frightening, this trend has been established for a long time but we have not recognised this properly and have not acted to exploit it fully, largely because we have been focusing on the wrong figures.  We have focused on the measures of unemployment rather than on the measures of job creation.</P>
    <P>If we look back not just one year but a whole generation, employment surveys show that by comparison with 1971 there are now 176,000 more people at work.  Because employment in agriculture dropped in the period since 1971 by about 134,000, 311,000 extra jobs were created in the rest of the economy. Where did we create these jobs?  Some 41,000 were created by Government employment schemes of one kind or another, a further 15,000 were created <Col N="446" /> in industry and the remaining 255,000 were created in services.  Over the past 24 years industry created less than 5 per cent of new jobs and services created over 80 per cent.</P>
    <P>Services created more than four out of every five jobs created in this period, despite being discriminated against in taxation and job creation incentives. How many more jobs could we have created in services if the playing field had been level?  Even more to the point, how many more jobs could we create in future if we levelled that playing field now?  These are the kind of questions the employment survey encourages us to ask.  We need to have this survey more frequently and to base our policy decisions on the facts it reveals.</P>
    <P>I am an optimist.  I believe we have to work to make sure that young people see, feel and hear from us the optimism they need.  We in this House do not create jobs but the atmosphere in which others will do so.  We must look for the measures and ways which will create this optimism, confidence and ability for people to get up and do something about creating jobs.</P>
    <P>I was at a breakfast in Trinity College this morning.  It was a well organised function and it is held a few times a year by the Foresight group, which consists of business students in their final year or two.  They use the opportunity to encourage potential employers to join them for breakfast.  The seating arrangements are well thought out.  One employer would be surrounded by four students and the students pick the person they want to sit beside.  We talked about what we were planning to do.  The students I met were planning to look for jobs and they told me it was not easy to get the job they wanted.  I told them that if I asked 100 American students what they planned to do when they finished their studies next year, a high proportion of them might say they planned to go into business for themselves and start an enterprise.  A reasonably high proportion of them may already be dabbling in some sort of business or have already taken the first steps.  I sense we <Col N="447" /> have not managed to sell that concept to our young people.  A large number of them still expect somebody else to create their job.</P>
    <P>The reason this motion is important and why I am delighted to support it is because it draws attention to the fact that we have been concentrating on the wrong figures.  We should know the live register figures, but I was not aware that 255,000 new service jobs were created in the last 24 years.  We do not see those figures often enough or realise how many more jobs are being created.  A large number of people would be willing to invest if they had confidence that our economy was improving and that jobs were being created.  It is up to us to find ways of drawing attention to the good news, not just for the sake of it, so as to get people to invest.</P>
    <P>I was drawn to this topic by listening to Senator Gallagher, who spoke about the bureaucracies experienced by somebody going into business.  I was also impressed by Senator O'Sullivan when she talked about the black economy. We must concentrate on doing what we can.  In that way we can encourage more people to do something for themselves rather than rely on somebody else to do it for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>The question we should ask ourselves is how do we translate what we heard from Senator Quinn into practice.  That is the issue and the answer to many of our problems. Senator Quinn is talking from a practical experience of what is involved and required in the market.  We all accept and support what he said, but the challenge is how do we create the environment in which that understanding and capacity to deliver job opportunities can be created.  I support the motion and welcome the assurance from the Minister that he intends to have proposals before the Government on the creation of the sub-annual surveys and their availability in the coming weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not dispute the reasoning behind the Minister's arguments as regards the <Col N="448" /> discrepancy between the Labour Force Survey and the live register of 84,000 people but the gap is still a large one.  It was not expected, judging by the reaction from official quarters since the publication of those results.  The Minister said similar gaps emerge in other European countries.  For example, he said the difference in the survey in Greece was over 100,000 people, but that country has three times our population.  Our discrepancy is way out of line with anything that has emerged in any other country.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to understand the reasons being advanced as to why the live register is different.  We must have a method to establish whether a person is working or is unemployed, otherwise we are fooling ourselves.  Therefore, I hope that what the Minister is proposing will resolve this conflict.  This information is confusing.  People are either working or they are unemployed.  It is important we get an accurate figure and it is equally important that we have it to forecast future trends.</P>
    <P>I welcome the indication that there has been an increase in employment. The figures quoted by Senator Quinn are impressive.  He pointed out that a large proportion of the 255,000 jobs created over the last 24 years were in the service sector.  That came about in spite of an environment that was not as encouraging as it could have been as far as creating jobs was concerned.  We must face the question of creating incentives, especially where small and medium industries and enterprises are concerned, to encourage the creation of jobs and the taking on of people.  Retail distribution services etc. would also come under that area.</P>
    <P>Senator Gallagher gave an example of this.  She wanted to hire a secretary, either in a full or a part-time capacity, but immediately encountered bureaucratic hassle.  She is a professional person. If an ordinary small businessman had the opportunity to take on extra people and came up against that obstacle, they would not do it.  That would be true of many people involved <Col N="449" /> in the service sector.  Even if the right atmosphere is there to take on extra people, the hassle involved is too great.</P>
    <P>Five years ago a small builder told me he bought a patch of land and began building houses adjacent to a town.  By the time he built his first five houses, 22 officials of one kind or another had come to his site to ensure he was not defrauding the public, the State or somebody else.  He built another 15 houses and tore down his shop.  These officials, many from the same institution, were arriving day in and day out. Four of them came from the local county council while others came from the house building guarantee scheme and the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  This became a nightmare.</P>
    <P>We must remove these bureaucratic barriers.  The European Union is coming to the same conclusion.  A committee established by the EU satisfied itself and has almost satisfied the Commission that overregulation and legislative and administrative requirements where small and medium sized enterprises are concerned have emerged as a barrier to the creation of jobs.  Recommendations to indicate what improvements and changes can be made in bringing about an atmosphere of deregulation which can lead to job creation are likely to emerge in Madrid next month.</P>
    <P>We co-operated in creating this problem over the years.  We allowed a mentality and atmosphere to develop that favoured the replacement of the worker with machines.  We grant aided the machine but taxed the worker and the employer out of jobs.  The environment we created encouraged employers to replace workers with machines where possible, because they would be less trouble.  We are now reaping the whirlwind.</P>
    <P>Much can be done and I would speak for longer if I had time.  There is widespread agreement on the problems.  If we agreed how to implement the ideas put forward by Senator Quinn, we would achieve a great deal.  We should <Col N="450" /> recognise there is a bureaucratic barrier and a lack of understanding about bringing about the atmosphere in which jobs can be created and people can be encouraged to take on jobs.  Unfortunately, there are vested interests involved in preserving that situation.  I regret having to mention that, but it is an issue we must face.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate because I have called for a number of weeks for a debate on unemployment and the problems it is creating throughout our society.  We can deal with the figures and statistics for ever more, but I despair when I hear discussion in this House on unemployment and social problems because it is the people in these Houses who create the problems. We have built a bureaucratic system which does not help employment.  We have taxed our basic raw material, our labour force, and we are all to blame for this.  As my colleague on the other side pointed out, for many years we have given incentives to business to replace <Col N="451" /> workers with machinery and then we tax the workers.</P>
      <P>We are not competitive on the world market.  We are a small island nation at the edge of Europe, with a huge market potential available to us.  We are not uncompetitive because of distances but because of what we are doing at home &mdash; we have taxed work out of existence. Should nothing else comes from this debate, if we acknowledge our huge problems in taxation of employment, we will be doing well.  We can change the figures, adjust the surveys and do as we please, but hundreds of thousands of people are still looking for jobs and thousands of people would be willing to offer jobs if the system was conducive to doing so.</P>
      <P>The State has much to offer, but the only employment we have created is for new boards, Ministers, Ministers of State, advisers and task forces.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the only employment we have created.  Members may state otherwise, but the statistics are on the live register and in the Labour Force Survey &mdash; those are the facts. If we acknowledge that we have a severe problem we will have done a good day's work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have also persuaded people that if one goes to college and qualifies as an accountant, one must become an accountant, or if a person goes to an agricultural college he must become a farmer.  We have made people think that if a job is not available within the sphere in which they were trained, they must go on the live register.  This, along with the taxation and social welfare systems, has killed incentive.  We must shake up not only the bureaucracy in Government and State agencies but also the education system and second level schools so that people are educated for life and given the ability to survive, not merely to go to third level or social welfare. A person may find a job which <Col N="452" /> does not suit him but will do until he finds something else.  We have vast resources and a good educational system which enables people to get qualifications. But if a person cannot get a job in his or her specific professional area, surely that expertise can be used elsewhere. We have channelled people in a narrow way so that if they do not find a position, they find few opportunities available to them.</P>
    <P>As I said, we have Ministers, boards and task forces, all of which sends a poor signal.  We must realise that young people coming into the labour market expect so much because that is what they are promised.  We do not deliver, no matter who is in Government.  We promise young people that if they qualify we will provide jobs for them, but we fail to deliver.  I do not see light at the end of this tunnel.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Quinn that we harp on unemployment figures and run ourselves down.  At this time last year there was a by-election in Cork and I spoke at length on radio and in interviews about all the jobs we had created. Although we had provided thousands of jobs, there were still 285,000 people unemployed at that time.  Even if I had said we had created 100,000 jobs it would not have made any difference because of the numbers unemployed. That creates an air of pessimism and when a nation is pessimistic the economy becomes depressed, because people are afraid to spend.  This has nothing to do with Labour or Democratic Left being in Government &mdash; people are afraid to invest in a climate of high unemployment where pessimism emanates from the establishment, the State and the population at large.</P>
    <P>We can fiddle with Labour Force Surveys and unemployment statistics forever, but if we are to resolve any of these problems we must realise that tax on work is pushing us down the international competitiveness league.</P>

In view of the discrepancy between the live register and the Labour Force Survey this Labour motion is timely and I support it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that they will keep working for the positive aspects.  There is widespread confusion because of the discrepancy in the figures; but, whether they are right or wrong, a sizeable number of people are unemployed, seeking employment and unable to get it.  Many of them are long-term, chronic unemployed, many are young people and many are women.  I welcome any study the Minister of State will undertake and I know he and the Government are interested in finding a solution to the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 26 October the Government had a full session on how it might deal with the long-term unemployed.  The reality is that 45 or 50 per cent of the registered unemployed are long-term unemployed, many of whom are disadvantaged. About half of that figure have no formal education.  As has been said by other speakers, we have a chronic long-term <Col N="454" /> problem which requires a number of initiatives in order to find a solution.</P>
    <P>The first prerequisite is to identify the unemployed who are genuinely seeking employment and break them down into categories.  There used to be a system whereby the unemployment figures were broken down into categories and it was possible to tell how many plasterers, plumbers, welders, fitters and so on were unemployed.  For some inexplicable reason that system was abolished. In the short time that I was Minister for Social Welfare I endeavoured to reinstate it.  If the long-term unemployed especially could be categorised into plumbers, block layers, welders, teachers, professionals and so on it would be possible to, at least, identify a way forward and formulate policies to deal with the situation.  For example, if 50,000 block layers were unemployed, some fairly urgent construction projects could be undertaken.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand how it is possible to plan for the unemployed when there is no accurate assessment of the qualifications of the labour force.  I understood that the Department of Social Welfare and the Revenue Commissioners were trying to find that out but, to my knowledge, they have not done so yet.  If all the training and unemployment schemes are taken into account, there is still quite a sizeable problem.</P>
    <P>In relation to investment in the development agencies, I wish to refer in particular to the lack of capital investment which has been provided for Shannon Development to deal with some of the industrial sites in the mid-west region.  The industrial estate in Shannon, which was for many years a shining example of regional industrial development, is now in a shambles.  Senator Howard has been through the estate and knows about this.  The bigger industrial bases are derelict with windows broken and doors barred.  Lana'knit, which was probably one of the biggest bases in the industrial estate, and the old bus company, which was Bombardier and then a new company was established, <Col N="455" /> are locked up but, what is worse, they are run down and neglected.</P>
    <P>That is not the fault of Shannon Development but is due to the absence of Government finance to undertake the reconstruction and reorganisation of those very important industrial bases. They are a very bad example for industrialists who visit that estate.  I invite the Minister down any weekend to see the state of that industrial estate due to the shortage of capital investment to modernise it.  The only way to get industrialists in is with attractive locations for them to set up their businesses.  The Shannon industrial zone at present is not conducive to attracting any industrial project.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the debate and congratulate Senator O'Sullivan for giving us the opportunity to discuss this. The issue has been in the public domain for some weeks and is surrounded by a certain amount of confusion and debate. It is important that the Minister had the opportunity to give his view of the situation and I listened to him very carefully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that there is an 84,000 discrepancy between the Labour Force Survey and the live register figures requires analysis and explanation.  The Minister has gone some way towards doing this tonight but further examination should take place.  I have been surprised for some time that the strong growth in the economy and low inflation and interest rates have not been reflected in a drop in the unemployment levels, as all the necessary factors are there for economic development and employment creation.  I always felt that there would be a period where the economy would grow without substantially increasing employment, mainly because of higher returns to scale as the economy develops and output grows.  In times of depression in industry there is a slackness in efficiency followed by a period of growth in the economy and output which takes up that slack.  I felt that improvements in the economy would lead to inevitable improvements <Col N="456" /> in productivity.  I felt for all those reasons that, after a period, economic growth would be reflected in the level of employment creation.</P>
    <P>I note that employment in the year up to mid-April 1995 increased by 4 per cent, which was 49,000 jobs.  That is a very significant figure.  That is the largest annual increase in employment on record.  That performance follows on from an equally credible performance in the preceding year between April 1993 and April 1994 when employment grew by 7.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>It is important to acknowledge that the private sector is the main provider of new jobs.  Over the past two years, private sector employment increased by 60,000, or 8.6 per cent.  We do not always give due recognition to the private sector for the contribution which it is making to the growth in the economy. It is the Government's job to create the climate for growth but the growth itself must be created by the employers.  We should recognise that the private sector has contributed substantially to the improved situation.</P>
    <P>To any objective observer the performance is quite impressive, especially when compared to growth in some other EU economies.  Over the same period, employment in the EU as a whole actually fell.  In the long term our employment prospects look even better.  Since 1987 private sector employment has grown by a quarter, which is considerably better than any other EU country. We are great in this country at giving bad news and announcing bad statistics and increases in unemployment. However, we should also recognise the positive aspects of what successive Governments have done.</P>
    <P>The new Labour Force Survey figures have resulted in a revision of the rate of standard unemployment down to 12.8 per cent.  This represents a material improvement and an acceleration of the downward trend in recent years.  Perhaps more importantly, Ireland's unemployment rate is rapidly converging on the EU average, which stood around 11 per cent in July.  In 1993 the average rate <Col N="457" /> of unemployment in Ireland was almost 16 per cent whereas it was 11 per cent in the EU as a whole.  We should recognise that we are converging towards the general EU position.</P>
    <P>The revised employment figures from the recent survey provide internationally comparable figures and is a more objective and consistent indicator of unemployment than the live register. As the Minister stated, these are only produced annually.  I was interested to hear the Minister's contribution because I had some information on some of the suggested reasons for the increased divergence.  This is an important analysis which shows why this divergence is there and the real figures.</P>
    <P>We have come a long way from the days when former Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, stated that if the figure for unemployment numbered over 100,000, the Government of the day should resign.  Comparatively speaking, the figure for growth in unemployment is false.  It does not take account of factors the Minister outlined, such as equality legislation and its impact; the introduction of eligibility to sign on for people involved in community employment schemes and various training courses under the social employment scheme and the number of part-time and occasional workers in the economy.  The latter has been an area of major growth because employers require more flexibility among workers.  A downside to this exists in the area of labour and employment rights, but it is a fact of life that employers are looking towards part-time and occasional employees as a way to manage their labour costs.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the divergence was influenced by changes in the rules and practice in relation to means testing and payment of unemployment assistance and benefit with regard to the arrangement to split payments between spouses.  These factors go some way to explain what is happening but a more in-depth study is required to ensure that people fully understand the implications. A movement towards regular surveys to indicate the exact figure for <Col N="458" /> unemployment is also needed.  That figure has a national and international impact with regard to how the economy and the country perform.  It also has an impact on public morale.  People hear that employment is being created but the figure of 300,000 is regularly quoted as the number of those out of work.  The real figure is nearer 200,000.  It is important that we move toward the true figure because people will lose confidence in the figures provided by the live register.  These figures will be disputed because nobody knows what they represent. The sooner we move towards the true figure outlined in the live register survey, the better.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the rate of unemployment is clearly on a very welcome downward trend.  This situation should, and will, be maintained due to the nature of current economic expansion.  This is a vital development in Irish society because unemployment is seen as a key factor in institutionalising social inequity.  It will be seen by those who helped to establish and maintain a consensus approach to policy formulation as a validation of their stance.  It will strengthen the case to continue along those lines when the present arrangement expires in 1996-97.  The social partnership and the consensus approach to managing this situation have produced results.  This survey proves that point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion.  There are a number of statistics which are vital to any Government in the formulation of economic policy, and one of those is the number of people who are unemployed. The country seems to have been ensnared in a major bureaucratic tangle with regard to this issue.  This was recently illustrated by the publication of two different sets of unemployment statistics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A major discrepancy exists between the figure in the live register, which shows that 276,000 people are unemployed, and the annual Labour Force Survey, which shows that 192,000 people are out of work.  This represents <Col N="459" /> a discrepancy of 84,000.  If there were 276,000 unemployed people, we would be formulating an economic strategy to cater for a country where the overall rate of unemployment is 20 per cent; if the figure is only 192,000, the rate of unemployment is only 14 per cent of the total workforce.  Different economic policies are appropriate to each of these situations.  A more exact figure should be provided.  How can a coherent economic policy be formulated if we are unsure of the true level of unemployment? Serious doubts have already been expressed in relation to the reliability of the GDP figures as a measure of real economic activity.  This is another key figure for consideration by the Government. Further confusion should not be introduced by having a layer of uncertainty and inaccuracy regarding a key national statistic such as the level of unemployment.</P>
    <P>It was stated earlier that, either hundreds of millions of pounds are being paid out in unemployment compensation to people who are not really seeking work or the Labour Force Survey seriously underestimates the extent of the problem.  I believe that a substantial element of under-reporting exists in the Labour Force Survey.  Many people would be reluctant to tell a complete stranger, calling at their front door, that they, or another member of their family, are out of work.  There may be a case that people are unwilling to provide this information and that is why the discrepancy exists.  However, it is not known if that is the case.</P>
    <P>I agree with the thrust of the motion that a more regular system of conducting surveys be put in place.  Great care would have to be taken in designing the wording of such surveys.  If they do not provide correct information, what is the point of carrying them out? The answer provided by some people when asked if they are unemployed might be very different if they were asked whether they were available for work.  If the wide discrepancy between the numbers on the live register and <Col N="460" /> Labour Force Survey continues, what good will conducting more frequent surveys do?  We will not be any wiser than we are now.</P>
    <P>The composition of the live register must be more closely considered.  The Departments of Enterprise and Employment and Social Welfare should conduct an investigation into whether the live register overstates the figure for unemployment.  Given the amount of money expended on unemployment benefits each year, this should be a priority.</P>
    <P>Another problem is the fact that people sign on for unemployment benefit in employment exchanges.  The only thing exchanged in these places is money.  Another network of services is provided under the auspices of FÁS where those seeking work can be matched with suitable jobs.  I do not believe that two parallel systems should be in operation to cope with the unemployment problem, one which gives people money in the form of State benefit and the other which attempts to find them suitable employment.  Presumably everyone who signs on at an employment exchange is available for work or seeking employment.  If they are not, why is the State paying them?  A strong argument exists in favour of rationalising the entire system and integrating dole offices with the job-finding services of FÁS.</P>
    <P>I also believe that the integration of the Revenue and social welfare systems would help to clear up confusion.  I am aware that that is supposed to be happening. In the previous Government, the then Minister of State for Social Welfare, Deputy Bruton, had responsibility for this.  What is the current status of that process?  Poverty traps exist in our system and many Members are aware of people who consider that it is not worth their while to take up employment.  I am also concerned about young people who get into the habit of signing on at employment exchanges when they leave school.  These people become aware of the long-term unemployed who have been signing on for so <Col N="461" /> long that they are now almost unemployable. It is not appropriate for young school leavers to enter that culture.  If employment exchanges and FÁS offices were amalgamated, people would enter the offices with the intent of seeking a job while signing on for unemployment benefit.  This would be much more helpful in relation to young people coming on the live register.</P>
    <P>At present one State agency, the Department of Social Welfare, hands out money to citizens while another, the Department of Finance, takes money from them.  Successive Ministers for Finance have spoken about the need for change in this area but little has been achieved.  The gap between the Labour Force Survey and the live register appears to be widening.  The more it widens the further we drift from an accurate picture of the true state of our economic situation.  It is time this is dealt with.  However, if more frequent surveys do not produce more accurate information, they will be a waste of time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of a total review of the way we count the unemployed. As far as I am concerned, we need to know the number who are totally dependent on social welfare and the number who need it to supplement their income.  I do not believe present statistics give us the type of data the Government needs to plan ahead.  Over the past few years the economy has grown at a rate which is one of the fastest in Europe, although this has not helped the majority of those who are dependent on social welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister said, the live register incorporates such a wide body of people that it is difficult to ascertain the number who are totally dependent on social welfare.  It includes those who sign on for credits, the self-employed, those who sign on for a few days each week and seasonal workers working on the docks at Foynes Harbour or meat factories, for example.  We should also include those who receive disability benefit and other forms of social welfare. They are as important as the unemployed because they too are totally <Col N="462" /> dependent on social welfare.  We should also take into account the 11,000 who are on low incomes and who receive family income supplement. Without this supplement they would be more dependent on social welfare but at present they are willing to take up low paid employment.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the plight of the long-term unemployed, whom we need to identify.  A man over 45 years of age who has been out of work for more than three years and with few skills has a 90 per cent chance of not getting work again.  Looking around the House most Members here are 45 years or will be shortly and it is hard to think that we could be regarded as being on the scrap heap in a few years.  It is terrible indictment to say that people are of no use after they reach the age of 45.</P>
    <P>If the economy grows by 8 or 9 per cent, who will fill the new jobs?  It will not be the 45 year old man with few skills; instead young people will stay at home and will return from abroad and women will be attracted back into the workforce.  It is not only a question of reducing the overall number of unemployed but we must also reduce the number of long-term unemployed.  The 45 year old long-term unemployed man will usually be the head of a family and his disillusionment &mdash; I am not being sexist; this is predominantly a male problem &mdash; will be felt by it.  A community with large housing estates and a considerable proportion of long-term unemployed males who are practically unemployable is a major social problem. That is why I would like a total review of the way we count the unemployed. As Senator Neville said, if the figures are not more accurate, their validity will be questioned.  The Minister should try to give us a more accurate view of the situation as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate is very worth while.  Unemployment is the largest issue which this, the last and future Governments will face and it should be seriously looked at.  The discrepancy between the two surveys is amazing.  I am delighted the Minister said that he intends to do this on a quarterly basis. <Col N="463" /> Many people have spoken about how the unemployment situation could be tackled.  I was glad Senator Quinn mentioned the services sector, where there is an opening to create more jobs.</P>
      <P>Although much good has come from the White Paper on Education, we should look seriously at taking on more career guidance teachers to direct young people to university or to training courses and to encourage them at second level to work towards FÁS training schemes.  I agree with Senator Daly that surveys should be done to ascertain how many plasterers, carpenters and bricklayers we need, for example.</P>
      <P>As regards third level education, we are not providing the necessary jobs for our highly qualified young people in certain sectors.  My nephew spent seven years at third level and received a variety of higher degrees in chemistry.  Yet when he looks for a job the criteria laid down is that he must have two to three years' experience.  That is wrong and should be looked at.  Training programmes should be put in place for university graduates who cannot get jobs unless they have the necessary training. An increase in the number of career guidance teachers would be the answer to this long-term problem.</P>
      <P>We could look at the public service. Gardaí, teachers, soldiers and civil servants could retire after 25 years service in order to open up opportunities for young people.  I agree with a lot of what Senator Kelly said.  When these people would retire, aged 45, with a reasonable pension they would have enough experience, contacts and determination to set up their own small businesses.  At the same time this would open up the way for a new intake of people into the public service.  This system has worked quite well in the United States and in other countries and we will have to look at it in depth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the black market.  If there is a discrepancy of 84,000 people, the black market will have to be examined in depth.  Every Member of the Oireachtas knows the black market in this country is rampant and I am glad to <Col N="464" /> see some Departments tightening things up as a result.</P>

      <P>Black market economy or the black economy.  Analyse it any way you like, but it is a black market no matter what way you look at it.  Everybody knows there are people in large towns and cities claiming social welfare in the morning in their overalls and working as a bricklayer or whatever during the day.  It is good to see Departments such as the Department of the Environment and local authorities tightening up on that aspect of the problem. Other areas should be tightened up too.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned in his speech that no single factor can explain the difference of 84,000.  Some commentators have mentioned the increase in the levels of social welfare fraud.  I know of one case which involved the secretary of a Minister in the other House and it went on for a number of months.  It was extraordinary that it went on so long.  Anyway, it has been sorted out.</P>
      <P>A lot can be done to try to improve the unemployment situation in this country.  Employers' PRSI must be addressed forthwith.  Tax deductions will have to be considered for those creating jobs and training staff.  This is important.  Low tax enterprise zones will have to be established for areas of high unemployment and that must be examined in depth.</P>
      <P>Unemployment representatives should be present at negotiations for national agreements and there should be a complete overhaul of the social welfare system, as Senator Kelly said.  Radical reforms of industrial policies will have to be addressed.  Currently, there are in the region of 80 different industrial development boards and eight Ministers operate the different responsibilities within the State.  This needs to be examined. Perhaps many of the agencies in the system should be abolished and we should start out with a new system.  We could not go far wrong.</P>

If one Minister could be put in charge of industry and employment, all the bureaucracy would be cut out.  Setting up boards or starting up a task force if there is a problem or huge unemployment only creates another layer of bureaucracy and we end up with bureaucrats and no jobs.</P>

      <P>I thank all the Senators who contributed to the debate, which was worthwhile and constructive. I also thank the Minister for his contribution.</P>
      <P>When Senator Fahey suggested we should have quarterly Labour Force Surveys, the Minister indicated there is an intention to have sub-annual surveys. That is welcome and we are delighted to be told this in the course of this debate.</P>
      <P>At least four Senators &mdash; Senator Gallagher, Senator Fahey, Senator Howard and Senator Kelleher &mdash; if not more, referred to the various impediments which still exist in the system for people who want to create employment. In fairness, there has been a shift in this area and there have been improvements in simplifying the system.  Obviously, from the direct experience of Senators, there has not been enough improvement and more needs to be done.</P>
      <P>Senator Kelleher, Senator Honan, Senator Kiely, Senator Kelly and Senator Daly referred to changes in the education system and called for greater linking between education and the work place and I agree with them.  We need a more real link between school and work, particularly for those who leave school early because they tend to be the people who fall into long-term unemployment. I support the concept of giving those people some kind of structure straight after leaving school so they do not fall into the black hole of unemployment. The applied leaving certificate and the transition year are two areas within education which are addressing to some extent that issue.  They are making the world of work more real to students who may not go on to third level education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="467" /> Senators Daly, Kelly and Kiely referred to the need to categorise people more accurately and looked, as I did, at the skills individuals on the register may have or may need to develop in order be able to link into the workforce. Indeed, the Minister also gave us some hope in that area when he said there has been widespread support for the development of a database and a wide range of social statistics.  I assumed he was covering that area when he said there will be more accurate detail information on the specific categories of the long-term unemployed.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan seemed to imply, although she may not have intended to, we were indicating that all of the 84,000 people in this area of discrepancy between the live register figures and the Labour Force Survey might have been defrauding the system.  It is not our intention to indicate that and I do not think there is any evidence to suggest that is the case.  Nevertheless, there is an element of a black economy there which obviously must be tackled.  We are not suggesting all of those people are somehow defrauding the system.  Senator Kelly, in particular, along with the Minister and Senator Neville, indicated that there are a number of people included in the live register figures who would not really be considered to be totally dependent on unemployment benefit, such as part-time workers, seasonal workers and people waiting to go on various FÁS schemes.  For example, one must have evidence of being on the register for a certain amount of time before being eligible for a community employment scheme.</P>
    <P>I will finish by referring to what I thought were the two most positive speeches, those of Senator Quinn and Senator Neville.  Senator Quinn gave us great scope for a positive outlook, particularly in light of his own experience. He pointed out that the figures in the survey indicate that the services sector has been successful and shown great promise in the creation of employment. He said that by concentrating on that positive aspect of the survey we would give more hope and encouragement to <Col N="468" /> employers.  I hope we will concentrate on that positive area to mobilise employers to take on workers.  Senator Neville also referred to that area.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville mentioned that the figure of 49,000 was the largest increase on record.  Senator Kelleher's pessimism is misplaced and his suggestion that no jobs were being created was quite inaccurate because 49,000 jobs were created between April 1994 and April 1995. What he said during the by-election was more accurate than what he said tonight.  Senator Neville referred to the fact that our statistics are converging to the general European position.  That indicates great hope, but we must continue to address problem areas and the discrepancy in the figures.  I welcome the Minister's intention to take up that issue and publish more regular reports which will give us accurate figures on which we can work.  I thank everybody who contributed to the debate and I hope the statistics in Portugal tonight will also be positive.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Barrett, to the House.  I do not know whether it is a good omen that he is just stepping in for the Minister for the Environment.  I hoped that the Minister for the Environment would be here because he is travelling to Mayo tomorrow and I thought he might have some good news for me.  However, perhaps he is keeping the best wine until last and he may have some very good news for us tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion relates to the provision of funding for a swimming pool and upgrading of facilities in Castlebar. Castlebar is an expanding county town. The existing swimming pool is inadequate <Col N="469" /> to cater for the needs of the people of Castlebar and the surrounding hinterland.  As a county town, it embraces a large hinterland which depends greatly on Castlebar for leisure activities.  The swimming pool is in great use throughout the year by people from a vast area around the town.</P>
    <P>The facilities are in poor condition at the moment and substantial sums of money are needed to upgrade them.  I understand that Mayo County Council has submitted plans to the Department of the Environment which would cost in the region of £1.3 million.  I hope the Minister will be in a position to secure that funding for Castlebar in the 1996 Estimates or, if the total funding is not available for 1996, that some money could be allocated to upgrade the facilities. The county council are at a crossroads. They cannot upgrade the existing facilities because the machinery is outdated and there is no point in buying new machinery and putting it into an old facility.  On the other hand they are waiting for funding for a new facility.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to urge his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, to make the necessary funding available for this worthy project in Castlebar which would give the people of Castlebar and central Mayo a much needed facility and aid them in tourism and other activities.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank Senator Burke for the opportunity to set out the position in relation to the proposed upgrading of Castlebar swimming pool.  Mayo County Council submitted preliminary proposals to the Department of the Environment in November 1994 for major refurbishment works, estimated to cost £1.3 million, at the Castlebar pool.  The works involved included major repairs to the general fabric of the pool building, replacement of the mechanical, heating and electrical services and upgrading of the water filtration and <Col N="470" /> disinfection systems.  It was also proposed to provide a number of new facilities, including a learners' pool, sauna and multipurpose room.</P>
    <P>The Department wrote to Mayo County Council last April conveying approval of the council's preliminary proposals and advising them that they could proceed with the preparation of detailed drawings and specifications &mdash; in other words, the contract documents. The submission of these documents is awaited by the Department of the Environment.  When the documents are received and approved and tenders have been received, the financial issues can be considered.  Grants are not formally allocated to particular projects until that stage is reached.</P>
    <P>There is a provision of £2 million in the Department's Estimates for 1995 for the swimming pool programme.  The provision is fully earmarked for projects already under construction or fully approved and there are also heavy commitments building up for 1996.  In the circumstances it is not possible to say when a firm financial commitment can be given towards the funding of the proposed works at the Castlebar pool. However, as I have already explained, financial issues are not the critical ones just yet.</P>
    <P>Mayo County Council should now finalise the preparation of contract documents and submit them to the Department of the Environment for approval.  This would mean that the Castlebar pool project would be fully planned and ready to go to the tender stage when funding becomes available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for Defence and the Marine to the House and thank him for taking this matter.  Ireland is a suitable location for the establishment of a centre for international maritime business.  Advantage <Col N="471" /> should be taken of the opportunity that exists in the EU and world shipping to establish such a centre in Ireland.  A quality shipping and maritime sector would broaden the base of the economy as a whole, the existing professional skills base and benefit other related businesses.  Based on the experience of other countries which have less to offer than Ireland, it is possible to create 2,000 jobs within a decade.</P>
      <P>The objectives of the suggestion to establish the centre are to induce leading international ship owning and management companies to establish subsidiary companies in Ireland which will create and manage all or part of their international trading fleets; to encourage the growth of the international ship owning sector operating in the European markets and also the development of an Irish deep sea fleet; to facilitate the expansion of our shipping service sector, that is, the banking, financial services, legal, shipbroking, training, maritime consultancy and the provision of technical services and others; to increase employment opportunities of professional Irish mariners in an Irish deep sea fleet in the provision of expertise to the services sector, in management and administration in shipping companies, ports and the many other areas where this expertise is in increasingly short supply.  There would also be an increase in training opportunities for young people interested in a career in this vital industry.</P>
      <P>The development of this proposal would require the establishment of an Irish open register which will provide the means by which owners and managers can be induced to place ships under the Irish flag.  These shipping companies will be obliged to manage these ships from Ireland and to man them to the greatest possible extent with Irish personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inducements necessary to attract people to such a centre include: a quality register operating to the highest international standards; the provision of the appropriate tax and legal framework which would be similar to and as competitive <Col N="472" /> as those already being put in place in many EU countries; careful marketing of the considerable strategic advantage we already have in the area. The implementation of this proposal would in the next decade establish Ireland as a centre of competence in all aspects of maritime business, thereby fulfilling a niche which has arisen in a growing and changing industry.</P>
    <P>The marine services industry is an important part of the international services sector.  It includes all the services required by shipowners to operate their fleets.  Ship management is a service which has arisen from the growing trend among ship owners to employ professional managers to handle various aspects of their operations for them. Cyprus and the Isle of Man are centres which have taken advantage of the mobility of ship management companies. Cyprus has now over 4,000 employed in marine services, while in the Isle of Man this sector is a major employer described as the &ldquo;third leg&rdquo; of the island's economy.</P>
    <P>With regard to banking, a ten ship deep sea fleet will put between $20 million and $30 million through its account. The marine services sector includes the provision of funding, leasing, equity planning and corporate advice to shipping companies.  The majority of shipping related contracts are, like Irish law, based on UK law.  London is the world's leading centre for the settlement of maritime law disputes, with over 1,000 lawyers employed full time in this sector alone.  With its position being threatened by high costs and over elaboration, the possibility exists for Ireland to create a niche in this area.</P>
    <P>The sector also includes shipbroking, insurance and maritime consultancy. These are services in which London is pre-eminent and in which there is also ample expertise in this country.  With the development of an Irish shipping community these sectors will attract both local and international business. Other areas which derive downstream benefits from the sector include communications, air travel, travel agencies, hotel and conference facilities and training.  A quality shipping and maritime <Col N="473" /> sector will broaden the base of the economy as a whole, develop the existing professional skills base and benefit other related business.</P>
    <P>Ireland has advantages to offer to the shipping industry in that it has an established marine structure and an established financial services centre together with readily available expertise in other ancillary services.  Ireland is an English language EU member state in a favourable time zone.  It has excellent telecommunications and ease of access to London and international air connections.  It has an educated workforce with a reputation within the industry for producing officers of the highest standard.</P>
    <P>The basic requirements needed to initiate this development include an update of Irish shipping and other relevant legislation.  We require the establishment of an open register and a provision that registered ships be manned from here and manned to the greatest relative extent possible with Irish nationals.  The tax legislation should allow seafarers and owners to be left outside the PRSI and tax net and special provision should be provided for capital taxation and leasing arrangements on ships.  None of the allowances required would involve direct State aid and would be self-financing.</P>
    <P>An opportunity exists in the EU and world shipping of which Ireland is well placed to take advantage.  The Government and other parties involved in shipping in this country should take steps to maximise this opportunity which offers long-term, substantial and sustainable benefit.  This project has been well researched and it would be remiss of me not to pay tribute to Captain Kevin Cribben, a neighbour of mine, who has done much research in this area.  He is supported by his organisation, the Irish Institute of Master Mariners.  I look forward to the Minister's reply.</P>

      <P>The concept of developing Ireland as a centre of significant maritime business activity was first proposed in some detail by Captain Cribben and the Irish Institute of Master Mariners.  Captain Cribben's proposals have been the subject <Col N="474" /> of detailed discussion between the Department and the institute in the context of the current review of national shipping policy.  In the Department's view, which I share, the proposals are a welcome and challenging contribution to the debate which should necessarily precede the adoption of formal policy principles and prescriptions for the Irish marine transport sector.</P>
      <P>Any proposals, from whatever source, claiming to yield significant benefits for the national economy if implemented must be given every opportunity of withstanding searching appraisal.  I understand in this context that agreement was reached some time ago between the Department and the institute on how best the institute might take forward the task of developing, honing and justifying its arguments for applying the concept in all its complex ramifications to the Irish situation. Together with officials of the Department, I look forward to giving detailed consideration to the institute's definitive proposals when they emerge.  On the face of it, the prospect of increased national economic activity in terms of new investment and employment opportunities across a range of marine related areas has to be welcomed in principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, it is timely at this juncture to delineate some of the broad parameters within which the objective of enhancing national maritime activity must be played out.  A concomitant of the institute's proposals, as I understand it, could possibly although not necessarily involve establishment of a cocalled second or open register.  I want to make it quite clear that irrespective of whether the Government ever sees any justification for creating such a register, no national register in this country will ever be run with the exclusive aim of making a profit, a feature seemingly common to many flag of convenience registers around the world at present. The institute's proposals quite rightly identify the desirability of creating a quality register capable of attracting reputable operators in numbers to the Irish flag.  Enforcement of the most stringent and comprehensive safety standards will always be a <i>sine qua non</i><Col N="475" /> in the administration of any national register in the country.</P>
    <P>Second, the future operation of a national register must decisively examine the options available to maximise employment opportunities for national/EU seafarers.  With unemployment such a critical issue, the growth of an Irish flagged fleet should properly be reflected in a corresponding growth in the employment of national-EU seafarers. Within the EU as a whole the question is now being raised as to whether it is appropriate that vessels operating in the intra-European trades should have to compete with vessels employing expatriate third country seafarers at pay and working conditions considerably less favourable than those accepted as the norm for EU workers. In mentioning this, I acknowledge the intensely global nature of international shipping.</P>
    <P>Without doubt there are complex and substantive issues here which must be decisively addressed at EU Commission level.  While no one country can adequately address these issues singlehandedly, member states can initiate and assist the debate as it continues to develop.  Earlier this year Ireland supported proposals from the French Presidency aimed at maximising job opportunities for European seafarers and at developing a stronger European fleet.</P>
    <P>In the third instance, and following from the job situation which I have just outlined, a healthy Irish fleet must provide vital knock-on replenishment for the indigenous shore-based maritime skills pool in a variety of onshore jobs such as harbour masters, pilots, surveyors, shipbrokers and agents, maritime lawyers, oil terminal operatives and college lecturers.  Fourth, Ireland's <Col N="476" /> peripheral geographical location as an island nation within Europe, coupled with the international trading and tourism needs of our economy, requires that we have as far as possible a number of substantive, indigenous and financially viable shipping companies capable of competing and consolidating market share in the cut-throat international shipping markets.  A critical mass of sound domestic shipping activity will help diminish the likelihood of market failure as well as help secure national shipping services.</P>
    <P>More generally, the aim of national maritime policy will continue to be to promote and support sustainable development of the marine sector for jobs and growth.  The objective for maritime transport, which includes ports, harbours and shipping services, is to deliver the port capacity facilities and shipping services to support trade and tourism by ensuring the necessary investment, operating climate and organisational structures.  If the institute's proposals prove to offer substantive prospects in attaining and building further on these objectives, that will be all to the good.  In this regard, while I am aware that a number of organisations and bodies have indicated support for the institute's proposals, I am not aware that they have formally detailed their own thinking on the issue.  A contribution of such nature to the current debate will help establish the full range of current thinking on the future of Ireland's shipping sector.</P>
