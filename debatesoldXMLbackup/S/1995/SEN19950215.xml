      <P>I have notice from Senator Neville that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to introduce measures to assist in the prevention and reduction in the levels of suicide.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator McGennis of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht to make a statement on the Government's proposals for the public acquisition of 170 acres of land in the Liffey Valley, Lucan; if a price has been agreed with the owners and the likely time scale for the land to come into public ownership.</P>
      <P>I have received notice from Senator Maloney of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to request the North-Western Health Board to cease the transfer of patients from St. Conal's Hospital to community based nursing units which is against the wishes of the patients.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Cosgrave of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to examine the growing delays in cases coming to court, with the resultant hardship to those seeking legal redress.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine to outline the up to date position regarding the proposed marina for Greystones.  County Wicklow.</P>

      <Col N="1883" /> I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Neville and Senator McGennis's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>May I put the Leader on notice that tomorrow we will have up to ten speakers on the debate on flooding? I ask him to take note of that and to allocate the appropriate time.  I also ask the Leader, as he himself asked, for the publication of the Price Waterhouse report.  In view of the Minister's statements in the last couple of days we would be keen that this important report would be published and that we have an opportunity to debate it as it affects many areas in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the Leader for an early date for the agreed debate on the education system and service.  I wish to put another item on the record of the House today.  Last week we commemorated the liberation of Auschwitz and this week we should note that it is 50 years and a day since the razing to the ground of Dresden.  During the week we saw a good example of how communities can come together.  It is relevant to what we talked about in the North that the Mayor of Coventry and the Mayor of Dresden should preach tolerance and openness to each other.  It is a good example of what can happen on this island.</P>

      <P>In support of Senator Wright I ask that we debate the future of the Defence Forces.  A report is with the Taoiseach and I ask the Leader to ensure it is published as soon as possible. We seem to be having another example of selective leaks and that is not desirable.  We need to establish in this House the Government's commitment to and plans for the Defence Forces. May I ask him that at the earliest opportunity to bring the Minister for Defence to the House so that we can debate this important matter?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I draw the Leader's attention to the statements made last week in the House in relation to Auschwitz and the deplorable television coverage of these statements.  What RTE decided to show was the row that broke out on the Order of Business; they did not deal, except in a most fleeting manner, with the statements that were made by all parties.  It was a deplorable exercise.</P>

      <P>Have you a question for the Leader?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>My question is as follows: there is a broadcasting committee which was established to monitor the amount of coverage given to the Seanad.  It is not good enough that they would highlight a row which was quite unintentional.  There was no slur meant or given, I am sure, by the Senator who mentioned flooding and Auschwitz&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but they decided it was going to be the item for the day.  It was deplorable.  I ask the Leader to take this up with the relevant authorities and to make sure that whatever coverage <Col N="1885" /> the House gets it is at least fair and balanced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>We noted today that AIB profits were listed as enormous.  I ask the Leader for a debate on the operations of the banks particularly in terms of the enormous costs to small businesses. Bank charges contribute to the huge profits the banks are making. However, although they are making enormous profits they are making less provision for bad debts.  It is time to address that problem.</P>
      <P>On 1 July last a genuine welcome was given to President Benazir Bhutto at the meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  The Chairman of the committee said that the two countries were dedicated to the values of human rights and equality in a democratic system.  President Bhutto said that unfortunately, the blasphemy law was used by unscrupulous enemies to victimise minorities living in particular areas. I raise this issue because two people, one is aged 14 and the other 40, were sentenced to death in Pakistan during the past week for what was suggested as blasphemy under those laws.  Not only were these people sentenced to death&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>You are talking too long; perhaps you could put a question to the Leader.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but they were also sentenced to two years hard labour and were heavily fined.  The third person involved in the trial was beheaded.  I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Government to take up this matter with President Bhutto who was, as I said, welcomed to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  She said that when her country was founded in 1947 the founder said that everyone was free to worship at their place of worship.  She also said that the Koran states that Moslems and Christians must reconcile their problems and allow the Lord to resolve all arguments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Government to raise these matters because they highlight specific problems of human rights enforcement.  When the President came to these Houses she said she would solve all problems relating to human rights violations and reconciliation in the community.  I ask the Government to do something.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimTownsend" hpid="Mr. Townsend Mr. Townsend">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Townsend</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to make time available for a debate on the rural environment protection scheme, known as REPS.  Last year £10 million was made available for small farmers under this scheme but only £1.4 million was taken up.  There was a lot of discussion about whether we would get £6 billion or £8 billion from the EU.  It is a serious matter that only £1.4 million was taken up, particularly when 75 per cent of this scheme will be financed by the EU and 25 per cent by the Government. One reason this scheme has not been taken up is the adverse publicity from certain quarters.  The scheme is not based on income; one could have ten or 11 jobs.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimTownsend" hpid="Mr. Townsend Mr. Townsend">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Townsend</NameTxt>
      <P>One big problem is that small farmers could lose their social welfare payments if they join the scheme.  We should debate this important scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want a debate on funding in the Border areas, whether it is from INTERREG, the Leader programme, IFI or the county enterprise partnership boards.  I raised this matter on a number of occasions and the Leader of the House also raised it when he was in Opposition.  I am raising it today because I am alarmed at suggestions that only a small portion of the £200 million special EU funding may be given to the Border counties in the south.  I am alarmed about this.  I am not <Col N="1887" /> scoring political points but there is no Government Minister from any of the Border counties.  Is there a voice or an input from those areas?  Is the Government concerned?  This is of importance to a large section of the people.  Who is making a case so that we will receive a fair allocation?</P>

      <P>A question for the Leader, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if I am being long winded but my point is important, as the Leader understands. This House is entitled to debate this matter.  I have been asking for this debate for some time but it is now of crucial importance in view of this large amount of money.  All of Ireland, especially the Border counties, will be much less attractive to someone setting up a business if there is to be £200 million in EU funding in addition to the IFI funding.  This House should provide a voice since the Government will not provide one.  We should have a debate as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Health to come to the House for a debate on hospital waiting lists.  This week it was confirmed by Western Health Board officials that 2,000 operations had to be postponed in the last number of months and that up to 200 patients were kept on trolleys overnight.  This is a serious problem.</P>
      <P>While I appreciate there is no immediate answer to this problem other Senators may have suggestions.  The concentration of acute procedures in the Galway area is contributing to this problem. If we had a debate Members could make proposals which would be of benefit to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a short time since we debated Europe but events are moving quickly.  I ask the Leader to consider the movements which have occurred in Europe in this week alone which we have not debated here.</P>
      <P>One example is immigration policy, which has already caused the resignation of a Minister in Britain.  The removal of passports within the EU will be combined with a decision that we must all carry identification cards and this may happen shortly.  It will be our fault if we do not take the opportunity to debate longer term issues in the EU such as passports, immigration, the single currency, etc.</P>
      <P>These are not issues which will arise this week but I urge the Leader to find time to debate the long term implications of EU membership and how it is beginning to affect us.  It has been talked about in Britain and has caused crises but we seem to be ignoring it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse the call by Senator Lanigan for a debate on the banks.  The Seanad is an ideal Chamber in which to have a debate which affects every citizen whether he or she likes it. We have a role to play in examining how lending institutions are regulated and controlled and how they impinge on our lives.  It is ironic that the call has been taken up by Fianna Fáil in a belated adoption of a long held policy of the Labour Party.  It is never too late to learn.</P>

      <P>Yesterday, the Government Chief Whip indicated that in excess of 50 items of legislation are on the legislative programme.  More of that legislation should be initiated in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's call for a debate on education.  However, particular reference should be made to the problem of young people leaving national school and not attending secondary school.  There is nowhere for such young people to go.  They cannot take part in Youthreach programmes. They have opted out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GordonWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Magner's comments on the media.  He should, through whatever committee or other means are available to him, see what can be done about what happened last week.  During one of the most moving hours of my life &mdash; and I suspect this is true of every Member &mdash; we talked about the greatest atrocity committed in living memory.  While I respect the freedom of the press, that freedom carries responsibilities.  Surely editors must accept that responsibility and not report a dozen or so words by a Senator who was speaking on the Order of Business.</P>

      <P>I welcome Senator Wilson's comments.  Unfortunately, however, it frequently happens that some small degree of controversy overwhelms serious matters as far as the media are concerned.  It is regrettable but it has become part of life in the Seanad and I deplore it.</P>
      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's vigorous call for the nationalisation of the banks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad he did so. I support it because I have learned to my surprise &mdash; and I presume the information is accurate &mdash; that a considerable proportion of our national debt is held by our domestic banks.  Nationalising the banks seems to be one solution to part of our economic problems.</P>
      <P>Could the Leader of the House give us any information regarding the timetable under which the legislation regularising abortion information will be brought before the House?</P>

      <P>Last week I asked the Leader when we would hold a debate on IMRO but I received no reply.  When our party was in Government it was promised that a debate would be held on the issue.  Senator Howard was also interested in having a debate on Irish music copyright.  Perhaps the Leader could arrange for such a debate at the earliest convenient time.</P>
      <P>Now that we have a Minister of State with responsibility for the West, would it be possible to have a debate on the development of the Shannon Estuary which has been highlighted on numerous occasions?  Last year the Shannon Estuary handled more tonnage than any other port in Ireland.  Perhaps the Leader could arrange for the Minister to come to the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I can be parochial when the need arises.  Any developments made in this country will be on the Shannon Estuary, and these would have been highlighted by the last Government. In view of this I ask for a full debate on the estuary, with the Minister in attendance.</P>
      <P>It is high time for a debate in the House on early retirement for all people working in the social services to enable them create vacancies for our young people who are in need of employment. There is a scheme in operation in the USA where one can retire after 20 years in the police force, the Army, the electricity and phone services and so on. This is especially relevant at present given that these people work under such stress and strain.  When the country is crying out for jobs for young people it is high time for such a debate.</P>

I ask the Leader of the House to obtain the joint agreement in principle of both sides of the House to put down a motion in the name of all parties.

      <P>On the issues of the Price Waterhouse report and defence matters, I am meeting the Minister for Defence today.  I have already invited him to attend the House and I will extend the invitation further and provide whatever information is appropriate.</P>

      <P>I am sure that the Minister will be delighted to attend the House and listen to the Senator. Senator O'Toole also mentioned Dresden, one of the worst war crimes of the Second World War, and spoke about reconciliation, a point well worth noting.</P>
      <P>On the issue of Private Members' Business raised by Senator Dardis, the arrangements are as usual this evening. The Senator also spoke about the defence issue.</P>
      <P>Senator Magner made an important point about coverage by RTE, with which I agree.  What was a moving and important discussion in the House last week should not have been dismissed as it was by RTE as an addendum to a small spat on the Order of Business.  It was out of proportion; I will refer the matter to the Broadcasting Committee of the two Houses.</P>
      <P>Senator Lanigan has taken up the mantle of Deputy Batt O'Keeffe on the banks.  We had a long series of discussions on the banks in the last Seanad and certainly within the last couple of years.  The banks sent in people with notebooks to listen to what was being said, for all the difference it seems to have made.  A debate on this issue would be worthwhile, and perhaps we might discuss later how to structure such a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1893" /> On the question of Pakistan and blasphemy, I am not aware of the facts but they are very disturbing as Senator Lanigan has outlined them.  Perhaps I will find some way of communicating with the Department of Foreign Affairs after the Order of Business and ascertain our position on the matter.</P>
    <P>Regarding the issue raised by Senator Townsend, I will do everything I can to accommodate the Senator on having the rural environmental protection scheme debated; perhaps we can talk later to see how this can be done.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan raised the question of funding for Border areas, although he stressed on a number of occasions that he was not making a political point.  I said to him previously on this issue that he is grouping together six or seven different issues and I asked him to give me the wording for a motion.  If he does that perhaps we could find some way to fit it in.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran raised the question of hospital waiting lists.  I appreciate that there is a wide range of expertise in this House on the whole health area.  I will communicate with the Minister to see if we can make time available to discuss those issues.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn raised an issue which highlights one of the problems we have in the House, which is how to have ongoing debates on current issues.  The motion on developments in the European Communities is on the Order Paper and perhaps we will resume that discussion next week.  However, I take his point and when we start our debate shortly on reform of the Seanad, I would like all Members to look at how we could put in place a structure to allow for short debates on current matters which do not have to be too elaborate or heavy.  If there are ideas on that we could look at them.  However, I take his point that events often pass without this House having a chance to comment.</P>
    <P>Senator Gallagher raised the question of banking, on which there would be agreement on all sides.  Senator Sherlock mentioned the 50 pieces of legislation <Col N="1894" /> which I will arrange to have made available to Senator Fitzgerald and other Members.  I will also try very hard to get as many of these Bills as possible initiated in this House.</P>
    <P>Senator Wilson made a point about RTE.  Senator Norris raised the nationalisation of banks.  I am not quite sure if Senator Lanigan was calling for their nationalisation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In reply to Senator Kiely, there is already a motion on the Order Paper on IMRO which would be ideal for Fianna Fáil Private Members' time, which is coming up again shortly.  I will convey his request for a debate on the west to the Minister of State with responsibility for the west.</P>
      <P>Senator Kelly raised the issue of designated areas, which I would like to invite the Minister to the House to discuss. Senator Cregan also raised the issue of the banks.  I will take up his suggestion of an all party approach to this as it is a major national question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome the Minister to the House.  I am genuinely impressed by the quiet but steady flow of legislation in the area of family law which reflects the Minister's real interest in such matters.  He is to be congratulated on his work in this regard. Before I sat down to read the Bill, I reread the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women which <Col N="1895" /> was published in January 1993.  To emphasise my earlier point.  I was pleased to see that many areas of concern outlined in that report have already been tackled by the Minister and his Department &mdash; maintenance, court jurisdiction, legal aid, etc.</P>
      <P>With regret, however, I noticed the report's detailed arguments for joint property rights on marriage and recalled the Minister's efforts to bring about reforming legislation in the shape of the Matrimonial Home Bill which was subsequently ruled unconstitutional by our Supreme Court.  There is a nauseating irony that such a conclusion could be reached when the Constitution expresses in Article 41.2.1º:</P>
      <P>In particular, the State recognises that by her life within the home, woman gives to the State the support without which the common good cannot be achieved.</P>
      <P>It seems that such paternalistic statements do nothing more than insult women by displaying a &ldquo;pat on the head&rdquo; mentality to reward the good little women of Ireland.  To adopt an old phrase, live horse and you will get grass. It seems the Supreme Court judges were really saying: &ldquo;Keep going women and things will work out.&rdquo;  Perhaps this is so, after a few centuries at this rate.  When it came to the crunch, property, bricks and mortar, were placed on a higher pedestal than Mná na hÉireann.  There is much more I could say on this subject but I will refrain to some degree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a typical hypocrisy in this country which purports to value the state of marriage but continues to perpetuate inherent inequalities between a married couple, by saying that one spouse can own the property while the other is constitutionally expected to voluntarily tie herself to the kitchen sink, a sink which she does not even own.  This fact reserves to husbands, who are often the sole registered owners of property, a right and dominance in family life that causes many wives worry.  It places an uncertainty in their minds, of which <Col N="1896" /> advantage can so easily be taken.  When partners take their vows perhaps the man should say &ldquo;For better&rdquo; and the woman should say &ldquo;For worse&rdquo;, while the man then says &ldquo;For richer&rdquo; and the woman says &ldquo;For poorer&rdquo;.  Although I may over generalise, it should not take away from the fact that many married women have no entitlement or say in what happens the family property.  Such inequality does not lend itself to good marriages.</P>
    <P>However, there is a contradiction in the law in that the property owning spouse has a rather late repentance of sins forced upon him in the grave by the Succession Act.  This allows the surviving spouse rights to the estate of the deceased for the wilight years, something of which she is not deemed worthy while the &ldquo;Boss&rdquo; survives.  I know the Minister recognises that it is not just a matter of introducing legislation but of education and enlightenment which may eventually bring about real equality between spouses.  Meanwhile, the Minister's work continues in this Bill.</P>
    <P>As was stated in the debate last week, the Bill is wide ranging, although, I understand, not as much as originally anticipated.  The Department has obviously examined the flaws in the current system and taken into consideration various reports, including that of the Law Reform Commission, on the age of marriage, the report on the jactitation of marriage and declaration of status, the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marital Breakdown and many other studies.  This has resulted in a comprehensive overview of family law, which explains the many areas tackled in the Bill.  Chiefly, as was stated last week, it allows the courts to make financial, property and other ancillary orders following legal separations and foreign divorces.</P>
    <P>There is a most sensible provision for preliminary type orders which will allow the court to make barring, protection and custody orders, etc., to resolve a difficult family situation before going on to decide on separation or other proceedings. Likewise, the court can make <Col N="1897" /> interim orders on maintenance or lump sum payments pending the determination of an application for judicial separation. This is much needed, particularly the new provision for lump sum payments as often one spouse is left to pay college fees, electricity bills and mortgage payments while waiting on the court to determine the main case, the family situation.  This caused great fear and hardship in the past and I am pleased the problem is addressed in the Bill.  It avoids obvious loopholes by allowing these lump sums to be paid by instalments and to be secured.</P>
    <P>The Bill goes on to give important new powers to the courts to order attachment of earnings at the same time as maintenance is ordered to be paid. As a solicitor I know of many women who are crying out for such a provision. I would prefer to see a system such as exists in Manitoba in Canada &mdash; a computerised system about which some of us will have heard for monitoring maintenance payments.  The accounts are monitored so that in the event that payment of maintenance is not made enforcement proceedings are immediately commenced.  The debtor can be compelled to make a full financial statement and can be summonsed before the court to do so.</P>
    <P>From experience I know that the biggest problem for the spouse depending on maintenance is not getting the original order but ensuring payments are made thereafter.  It is difficult for women in such circumstances to go to court each time the husband neglects to pay.  Under the Canadian system 85 per cent of orders are paid; that indicates its effectiveness.  It makes sense in other ways also.  If a woman receives payment promptly it will reduce the cost to the state of providing social welfare. Furthermore, it ensures that parents' honour their parental responsibilities and that is most important.</P>
    <P>In that regard, I noticed when the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, announced the budget he removed the provision in relation to deserted wives. I gather from what the Minister said in <Col N="1898" /> this House last week the term was being taken out in order that there would be no discrimination between the various categories of people in situations of marital breakdown.  It is a most sensible provision.  The term &ldquo;desertion&rdquo; inferred that a dependent woman could be deserted by her husband leaving the way open for the State to support her instead.  It seemed to accept the notion that a spouse and parent could simply walk out and abandon their responsibilities. I am glad to see that term removed from our social welfare code.</P>
    <P>I also note that the Minister for Social Welfare is making the necessary provisions to ensure those affected by any changes in family law will not be discriminated against because of the category they fall into.  I always thought this was needed and I am happy to see it happening now.</P>
    <P>I would favour a more proactive system for maintenance collection. However, I recognise that the Minister has made several important improvements in this area in previous legislation and facilitates the dependent spouses in many ways.  The provisions in this Bill for attachment of earnings will greatly improve the situation of many women as has been shown by the study undertaken by the Combat Poverty Agency.</P>
    <P>However, I am still constantly amazed at the level and amount of awards being given for maintenance.  I had a lady in court recently who was awarded the sum of £10 a week based on the information which the judge received which would not, I believe, have been the true picture.  Sadly, the judges are often left without vital information on which to base awards.  An award of £10 per week is an insult to the woman if the system considers that she can bring up a child on £10 per week.  It highlights the problem that exists when a spouse is not a PAYE worker.</P>
    <P>The greater powers in this Bill to make attachment orders are very helpful but they do not apply to the self-employed and those working in the black economy.  In some cases it pays somebody to leave secure employment <Col N="1899" /> and operate in the black economy and avoid family responsibilities.  I ask the Minister to consider providing a legal right to information about income and assets so that a spouse can at least ascertain the real position from employers, financial institutions, etc.  This is badly needed to allow the dependent spouses to gain their entitlement and to provide for a fair division of income.  This was recommended by the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women and anything the Minister can do in this regard would be helpful.</P>
    <P>While I am pleased to see that the Bill addresses the issue of insurance policies and pensions, can the Minister clarify if judges can now make orders in relation to a spouse's investments?  There is some indirect reference to it but it is an area where the property, asset owning spouse may attempt to avoid maintenance orders by pleading poverty.  The court could not touch such investments. Perhaps the Minister might answer that query.</P>
    <P>Some practical provisions have been made in this Bill in relation to life assurance and pensions; it has been dealt with extremely well.  Obviously much work was put into this by the Minister and his Department talking to insurance companies and pension bodies to ascertain what exactly would be needed to deal with this matter effectively and efficiently, and the Bill certainly achieves that.  It allows for a variety of remedies where the benefit of a life policy may be assigned in whole or in part depending on the circumstances.  Pensions may be split; I notice a provision for earmarking pension rights where they are not split.  That has been comprehensively thought out and it is one of the better parts of the Bill and is welcome.</P>
    <P>As regards the age of marriage, the Bill repeals the 1972 Act and the minimum age of marriage has increased from 16 to 18 years of age.  That is an important provision which is already happening, not because of the way people view marriage but because the way <Col N="1900" /> number of people living together has increased dramatically over the past number of years.  Marriage is a decision which people take seriously and it should be seen to be so.  It is extremely young to marry at 16 years of age.  I have learned at lot since I was 16 years of age and I would not like to be in a situation now where I would see such a decision as wrong.  It is practical to ensure that the serious act of marriage is reflected in our law.  Even 18 years of age is young when one considers the responsibilities one is taking on.  It is, however, a sensible change in the law.</P>
    <P>The provision whereby three months' notice must be given is also important. Many of my friends are engaged to be married and they have told me about the pre-marriage courses they are attending.  I find that interesting.  I welcome the fact that people do not rush into marriage and that shotgun marriages are gone.  Many couples need the opportunity to sit down and consider what they are getting into.  It is not a bad thing for the three months period to be put on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>A matter which concerns me is referred to in the section relating to property adjustment orders.  I trust the documentation required by the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds will be clarified with them before the legislation comes into effect.  In the past these institutions have insisted on marriage declarations, signatures of spouses to deeds, etc., even in separation cases. This has proved difficult in the past where one spouse may not want to cooperate, which is often the case.  It is important to ensure the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds are given clear instructions as to what documentation they should seek where property ownership is being transferred pursuant to these new orders.  That is a practical suggestion on my part.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that more family law cases are now being heard in the Circuit Court thus saving expense.  That is a sensible provision.  I know the Minister's work on legal aid, which we will deal with in the House tomorrow, will <Col N="1901" /> make it possible for those in need to obtain their rights without incurring financial hardship.  That too is welcome. This Bill tidies up many loose areas in family law and fills many gaps.  It paves the way for a divorce referendum which will only have to deal with the right to remarry.  The Bill removes any remaining flaws which could be used to engender fear in a referendum debate.</P>
    <P>Will judges be retrained to deal with the enormous changes in family law? The example of awarding £10 per week for maintenance seems to indicate that many judges are out of touch with the real world and the practicalities of rearing children.  It may also be useful to consider how our family law cases are heard.  As matters stand, cases are heard <i>in camera</i>, either before or after hearings of criminal and civil cases.  Therefore, the married couple have the advantage of a less formal atmosphere in which to conduct their business. However, with that advantage comes the fact that the press are excluded from such cases.  While the confidentiality of the parties concerned must be protected &mdash; this is paramount &mdash; the <i>in camera</i> system means that there is no comprehensive reporting of family law cases in the local or national media.  This can result in the not seen, not heard syndrome where the public at large are not made aware of problems in their society in a way that they might seek to address them.  Furthermore, it means that judges, researchers, legislators and others lose vital information about what is happening at ground level.  It also has the effect that family law cases are not seen as important in the eyes of the public.</P>
    <P>I raise this issue because it is important to develop a coherent approach to the area it covers so that when the number of family law cases increase, judgments would not vary as much in cases of similar circumstances simply because one judge may be more sympathetic to various problems than others or <i>vice versa.</i>  There is, therefore, a need to examine the development of family law.  In this respect, it may again <Col N="1902" /> be necessary to look at the <i>in camera</i> rule.</P>
    <P>While I am aware that this would be a matter for the Minister for Justice, we will have to look at, and seek changes in, our court administration system to allow it to cope with the increase in family law cases; I know this was mentioned in the previous debate.  These cases are often treated as the leftovers, to be dealt with when the real criminal and civil cases have been done so that people including judges, are tired at that stage. Justice is not best served in those circumstances. We have to examine the way family law cases are treated.  Strictly speaking, I know it is a matter for the Minister for Justice, but I hope that the Minister for Equality and Law Reform Deputy Taylor, will work with the Minister on that issue.</P>
    <P>I again draw the House's attention to the greater need for mediation services. I know the Minister did provide much greater funding for them, but it is no only a question of money.  The legal profession have an important role to play here.  Under existing law, they are obliged to inform clients of the mediation services available, but I question how much emphasis is given to this area and the amount of information available on it.  It is not the fault of the legal profession, of which I am a member. The legal profession knows little about the role mediation plays in marital breakdown.  The general public are also unaware of the services available. Yet the approach taken through mediation does help a separating couple to come to terms with what is hap pening.  Instead of scoring points of each other, it helps them to seek the best resolution to their problems while considering the needs of their children. This area deserves greater recognition by the public and the profession involved.</P>
    <P>Is it possible to fund the setting up of an independent State mediation service? A comprehensive family law system should have a mediation component in it.  Perhaps the Minister has dea <Col N="1903" /> with that idea in another way and if so, I would like to hear about it.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  It fills many gaps in a practical way.  I have named some of them but did not go into any great detail.  The tax provisions are another example where any of the property orders are facilitated by virtue of the fact that tax exemptions exist to facilitate them.  The Bill will no doubt be of great assistance to those who find themselves in the unhappy situation of a marriage breakdown.  It is a practical measure in dealing with the realities of life and I very much welcome it.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire go dtí an Teach seo.</P>
      <P>The Minister is dealing with a very difficult problem, particularly after the Supreme Court decision on the old family law Bill.  The emphasis we place and the number of laws we pass on the break up of the family amazes me.  We do not devote the same amount of research and work into keeping the family together.  Only a small percentage of families break up, less than 10 per cent; some 85 to 90 per cent still retain good old moral values.  When I see genealogical societies in every county compiling records to help the many Americans looking for their roots, I sometimes wonder if society will continue as we intend and if people will be able to find their roots in another 100 years.  This is rather sad.  It is a pity we do not have a proper survey to see why marriages break down.  My opinion is they break down because of the pressure of the society in which we live.  We have become very selfish.  Everybody talks about &ldquo;my rights&rdquo; but in marriage we should talk about &ldquo;our rights&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Let us look back over the last 20 years.  In 1974 I could come to Dublin, park my car in O'Connell Street and go window shopping at night and nobody would have interfered with my car.  I could visit my friend in Ballymun, park my car at the high rise flats, go up the lift and stay there for a day or two and my car would have been perfectly safe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1904" /> From their balconies women watched their children play below.  In the last 20 years we have put more money into health, education and social welfare to improve the lives of our people.  What is the end result but more broken marriages and more crime.  Some 20 years ago old people were admired and helped on to buses.  Today they are mugged, beaten up and robbed for a few paltry pounds.  What has come over our society in these short 20 years?</P>
    <P>Since 1974 we have heard all about this liberalism and freedom but what has it brought us?  Today we do not have the freedom we had 20 years ago.  One cannot have a pint and drive home; one cannot park one's car where one likes; one cannot drive at any speed one likes. One cannot build a house where one likes.  A farmer cannot sell his cattle on his farm.  We are squeezed with one Act after another.  People have no freedom today.  I could go on about all the ways our freedom has been curtailed over the last 20 years.  It is time some Minister started looking back to see what in God's name went wrong.</P>
    <P>If we did a survey on the break down of marriages we would find that in some cases more money can be obtained if a person is a deserted wife and her husband is claiming social welfare for himself. By not having the balance in favour of marriage we are going against traditional values.  We talk so much about traditional values and community effort but the heart of the community is the family.  We should load the balance in favour of the family.  That is one of the causes of family breakdown.  The second thing that causes families to break up is financial pressure.  The expenses incurred when children start school should be exempt from tax because they are part of the household budget.  Children's allowances are negligible and now we are going to give parents tax exemptions for breaking up.  Why not give them tax exemptions to stay together?</P>
    <P>In 1974 many women did not have to work, but now women want to work and they are giving a great service to society. <Col N="1905" /> Some have highly qualified jobs as teachers, nurses and doctors and we need them, but many women who would dearly love to stay at home are working today because of necessity, to pay the mortgage.  We should give the woman in the home more recognition and a better deal, but in modern society we are trying to make it a great virtue to be out at work.  Staying at home to rear the family seems to be a menial task whereas it is the most rewarding task one could do.</P>
    <P>In 1960 I built a house when I was thinking about getting married.  I had 33 happy years of marriage until God decided otherwise and I have been happily remarried for a year and a half.  I can never understand why marriages break down, but they do.  In 1960, I got a grant of £570 to build my house which cost £1,000.  I got a contractor to do some of the work and I did some myself. I was a two-handed man then and well able to work.  Since a person could build a house for £1,500 in 1960, I got more than one-third of the price of the house in grants.  Today a house costs a minimum of £30,000 but the grant is only £2,000.  Surely that is not helping marriage. Why can we not provide higher grants to encourage people to build family homes?</P>
    <P>I see a danger with this type of Bill of which I am sure the Minister will take cognisance.  In our society we have many silver tongued ladies and gentlemen. At a certain age men and women who have worked hard and may have a good farm or business, get talked into getting married, and a year later&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember a very interesting case involving a woman in Sligo.  It did not go as far as marriage but it went very near it.  In the court she was asked if she had told this man that she loved him and that she would marry him.  She replied, &ldquo;I said I would marry him and I would learn to respect him but I never said I'd love him.&rdquo;  In this case, pressure was exerted but luckily it did not come off.  This is the type of danger you have to guard against in this type of law.</P>
      <P>To get back to the more serious parts of the Bill, we now know that maintenance is well nigh impossible to obtain. Maintenance is granted regularly in courts, generally against the man who is probably on social welfare and cannot pay it.  Alternatively he may go to England and leave this jurisdiction. What do we do in that case?  Is there a way of incorporating this into EU law so that, regardless of what country he is in, we can take the necessary steps because so far that is not happening?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>It will always be hard to get maintenance from someone who does not want to pay it.  If someone is on social welfare it should be deducted from his benefit.  The maintenance payment should be his first priority.  We must have a system where, if a woman is awarded maintenance, she gets it and it is not just a meaningless figure in a book.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1907" /> A recent survey showed that children in unhappy homes were much happier than those from broken marriages and divorce.  We must take special care of children.  We talk about selling the home and dividing the proceeds between the married couple, but that is not enough.  Who is going to take care of the children?  It is good for them to go with one parent for a while but what happens when that parent remarries and the other family has children?  Between the jigs and the reels, the two families may not agree and some of the children may not be wanted by one spouse. Those are the hard facts.  These things happen and I do not know how we propose to deal with them.  It is a fact that, unfortunately, divorce will come but we will not have the solid families we had in the past.  I really do not know how we are going to provide for those children and I do not see anything in the Bill that is cast iron and will ensure that they are catered for.</P>
    <P>Maybe it is time to consider that, when a couple get married and have a family if the woman would like to stay at home with her family she should be legally entitled to five years' leave of absence from work.  I believe many women would avail of that and socially it would be a good thing because we now have all the problems of dragging children out in the morning to crêches. At the end of five years women would have the right to get back their jobs.</P>
    <P>Many families need money most when their children go to secondary school or to third level education and that is the time women really need to be back at work.  There should be a system where those people could get back into the workforce, perhaps have a month's refresher course before they go back to work.  If something like this were done there would be far less need for the Family Law Bill we are discussing today.</P>
    <P>I cannot stress sufficiently the need to maintain marriage.  Most of us came from good, traditional family homes and we would like to see today's children <Col N="1908" /> benefiting in the same way.  I believe that more than 90 per cent of families are still in good, solid relationships and provide good stable homes.  I sometimes think we now have better houses than good homes while in the past we had bad houses but good homes.  Interests have changed to some degree however. In England, I believe the divorce or marriage break-up figure is nearly 50 per cent and in America the figure is 70 per cent.  It would be sad if Ireland went down the road and if, in 20 or 25 years time, the number of solid, traditional family homes was as low as 20 per cent or 25 per cent.  There is a greater need than ever before to put more resources into the family home, into keeping families together and carrying out research as to why families break up.  There must be a reason.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, when we began with education for all we were told that if everyone was better educated it would create enterprise and employment, we would have a better country, better health boards, better health services, better community care services, people would not be going to hospitals, they would not be sick, they would be cared for etc., but it has gone the other way.  We have bigger hospitals, longer waiting lists and more sick people.  Social welfare payments have been increased out of all proportion during that time.  The result is that we have bigger housing estates, better houses, bigger green spaces, bigger open spaces, out near Dublin Airport there are acres of playing fields but there are no children playing only a few horses grazing.  These things have been done to improve people's way of life but what has happened?  We have more drugs, more drink and all kinds of abuse, in other words, we have a very disruptive society.  Some Minister &mdash; no one would be better suited than the Minister here today &mdash; will have to research why our society is moving in this direction.  Why are we legislating to help those whose marriages break up rather than helping those who stay together? Why is there not more research into keeping families <Col N="1909" /> together?  Why can we not go back to what we had 20 years ago when a person could get a grant of one-third of the price of a house to build a family home? As I said today one can get only a £2,000 grant when the cheapest house costs £30,000, a very small percentage. We have gone money mad but we have gone wrong in other ways too.  We must help people whose marriages are breaking up.  I welcome the Minister's efforts to alleviate that problem.  It is not an easy problem.  I would like to see more work and effort put into trying to retain the traditional family.</P>

      <P>It is very difficult to follow Senator Farrell who is always entertaining.  I was amused by some of the things he had to say.  I am delighted Senator Farrell had such a successful marriage and has had a successful second marriage for the past year and a half.  If all the people of Ireland were as fortunate as Senator Farrell we would not need Minister Taylor here today with this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>He would be a happy, redundant gentleman and not Minister for Equality and Law Reform. Fortunately, the fact that he is here demonstrates that the ideal Ireland Senator Farrell has just portrayed is not reality.  The good old times when everything in the garden seemed to be rosy are no longer with us.  I would suggest that part of that great rosiness in the garden of long ago was due to the fact that the women of Ireland felt their role was very specific, namely, to remain in the home and care for their families. Thankfully the women of Ireland over the past 25 to 30 years have realised that they &mdash; as individuals &mdash; have other specific roles to contribute to Irish society.  That is very good for Irish society and it is good for the individual to reach her full potential.  Senator Farrell has outlined the great family tradition <Col N="1910" /> and the great traditions of providing care and support in the home.  That is all very true.  We still have many cases of this in Ireland where many fine women provide carers' attention without any recognition from the State or their families for the tremendous work they do.</P>
      <P>It is time there was more serious recognition of the major contribution these women are making and have made in the past.  The reality is that the men of Ireland &mdash; and I do not mean this in a disparaging way &mdash; never felt it was their responsibility to be part of the caring system or to provide the carer facility that the women provided.  It is something which was taken for granted. Many daughters, daughters-in-law and many female relatives find themselves looking after elderly relatives without any recognition, thanks or recompense. We should recognise that fact and not take it for granted as Senator Farrell may have been stating here today.  We are living in changing times.  We have a changing society and we have to adapt and the fact the Minister is here is evidence of that.</P>
      <P>In effect this Bill is trying to address some of the difficulties confronting our society and attempting, in a very caring and understanding way, to resolve these issues in a civilised way and make it possible to work out difficulties in a more manageable way than has been the case in the past.  This Bill is a very welcome Bill.  I am particularly pleased it is before the House because it addresses many issues which have arisen over the years.  Many recommendations made by the Oireachtas Committee on marriage breakdown and in various Law Commission reports are addressed in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted the Minister has come to this House with this Bill which addresses some issues in great detail.  I refer in particular to area of pensions. That has been a particularly difficult issue for the law and for the courts to address in separation cases in the past. Very specific difficulties have arisen in that area.  In this Bill the Minister is <Col N="1911" /> attempting to address that issue.  I recognise that it is not an easy issue to deal with and what the Minister is doing in the Bill is what the feels is best in the circumstances.  Nevertheless, this is, I hope, a precursor to a referendum on divorce.  With this legislation in place the people and the electorate of Ireland will realise that issues that were of concern in the previous referendum on divorce in the mid-1980s will have been addressed prior to the divorce referendum taking place.</P>
    <P>I sat on the marriage breakdown committee between 1983 and 1985 and we made a number of recommendations in our report.  One of the recommendations was the increase in the age for marriage from 16 to 18.  It was the very strong view of the committee at that time that the marriage age would be increased to 18 years of age.  It is appropriate and right that the Minister is introducing that section in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Equally, in that report we recommended that special consideration be given to the position of itinerants because they have a very different culture and tradition.  Their pattern of marriage is much younger than the settled community.  I hope that due cognisance will be taken of that issue.  I know that there is a specific provision in the Bill for application to marry at the age of 16. It might be helpful if the Minister was in a position to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage dealing with the itinerant element because there were specific recommendations in the marriage breakdown report on that issue.</P>
    <P>There is just one section that I find curious and rather interesting, that is, the section on the notification of the intention to marry.  I would like to know the reason behind that.  While people may know each other for a considerable length of time, they often, for a variety of reasons, may decide fairly quickly to get married.  The fact that they decide to actually go through a ceremony fairly quickly does not mean that the <i>mens rea</i> has not been geared towards marriage <Col N="1912" /> at some date in the future.  That issue should be looked at more closely.  I do not see any great need or reason for it.</P>
    <P>I come from County Clare where we have an international airport with Aeroflot flights to Florida.  It is becoming a feature of those flights that people board the plane, get married in Florida and in various states of the United States, have their honeymoon over there and come back.  They are just going to fly out of the country, get married and come back.  I am not sure this is a judicious approach to adopt in relation to notification of intention to marry.  I ask the Minister to elaborate further on the reason behind that section.</P>
    <P>The Minister being a warm, full-blooded man will understand how one could get taken over with a certain level of emotion at any given time and decide: &ldquo;Right, we are going to go off and get married.  We are going to head for Dublin and get a priest friend to marry us and that is going to be it.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is something on which he should reflect.  That is all I will say on that section.</P>
      <P>I would like to address the situation in relation to family courts and the judges who adjudicate in family matters. It must be put on record that a variety of judges adjudicate on family problems and a variety of attitudes and approaches are adopted by these judges. There is an urgent need to take the lot aside and give them a good orientation course, direction or some sort of training on how to deal with the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a number of friends in legal practice across the country.  Some of the stories I have been told about attitudes <Col N="1913" /> expounded by judges in courts <i>in camera</i> are absolutely confounding and, quite frankly, unacceptable.  I dread to think about the attitude adopted by some of the judges.  It is so traditional and conservative and, I will go so far as to say, in some instances so anti-woman that it deserves close examination.</P>
    <P>In appointing judges in the family law area in the future close scrutiny will have to be given to the various applicants before they are appointed.  Those who are currently sitting and adjudicating need to be retrained.  I believe that some of them are unsuited to adjudicate on family law matters.  I ask the Minister to take that up with his colleague, the Minister for Justice, because it is a serious issue.  We can legislate all we like here but when it comes into the courts for adjudication by a judge, we are into a very different ball game and the persons concerned are left totally to the whim of the judge on the day.  That is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into too much detail on nullity.  There is a ludicrous situation in this country where we have Church and State nullity.  The majority of the public are not aware of the two separate nullities until they are in the situation of trying to resolve their problems. It appears that it is now almost easier to secure a Roman Catholic Church decree of nullity than it is to secure a State nullity.  That is extremely unfortunate.  When one addresses the question of nullity and the yardsticks that decide nullity, there is another area to be examined.  One questions the fallout from all of that.  That is why it is so important that rather than going through a preamble on that issue, the sooner a divorce referendum is put and passed to resolve that difficulty the better.</P>
    <P>This is all I wish to say on the Bill at this stage.  It is a very good Bill.  It incorporates and includes many issues which have been outstanding in relation to family law for a considerable length of time.  I commend the Minister for the fine work he is doing in this area of family law reform.  I wish him every success <Col N="1914" /> and hope he will be before us again shortly with a Bill to introduce a constitutional referendum on the issue at some date in the future.  I hope this Bill gets clear passage through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome the Minister to the House and on behalf of the Progressive Democrats I welcome this Bill.  I congratulate the Minister for bringing it forward.  The Bill, as Senators have outlined, is extensive and stretches beyond the framework currently in place.  It involves model provisions for any future divorce legislation.</P>
      <P>The Bill deals with many difficulties that have arisen in relation to nullity, foreign divorces and legal separations that we already have in this country.  It gives new and extended powers to the courts for the support of dependent spouses and children.  It deals with the areas of barring, protection and custody orders, maintenance of spouses and children and the redistribution of property for the benefit of spouse and children. It also deals very comprehensively with pensions, life assurance policies and property and succession rights.  It is a very welcome and detailed Bill.</P>
      <P>We are discussing this Bill under the shadow of the Supreme Court challenge to the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, on which this Bill is largely based and also in the light of the declared unconstitutionality of the Matrimonial Home Bill.  I read last week &mdash; the Minister may be able to elaborate on this &mdash; that the Attorney General is in some way moving forward the Supreme Court hearing of the challenge to the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act.  I read something about that in the papers last week and was wondering if that would speed up the hearing so we will have a decision on this quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This issue is very important in light of the impending divorce referendum.  The Matrimonial Home Bill, dealing with joint ownership of the family home, had the support of all the parties in this <Col N="1915" /> House and the other House, and the Minister himself greatly supported the principle it tried to obtain.  I and many of my colleagues are disappointed that the Government is not pursuing alternative methods of trying to ensure that the principle we all supported in that Bill could be given legal status.</P>
    <P>Senator Gallagher spoke about the decision of the Supreme Court.  The courts have told us when dealing with problems in this area that social policy is a matter for the Oireachtas.  The Minister introduced legislation which was found to be unconstitutional on an issue which none of us anticipated.  The concern was that it would have been found to be unconstitutional on foot of property rights but the argument put forward and accepted by the Supreme Court was that it interfered too much in the family.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the Minister's own sentiments in relation to this and of the sincerity of his belief in the objectives of the Bill.  I wonder if the Minister is getting support in Cabinet for the introduction of alternative legislation to ensure that what we wanted in the Matrimonial Home Bill would eventually come to pass.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum to this Bill states, when dealing with the implications for women, that:</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill apply equally to men and women.  However, the extended power of the courts to deal with the financial consequences of marital breakdown are expected to be of particular benefit to women.</P>
    <P>When we discussed the Matrimonial Home Bill we also believed that it would be of particular benefit to women.  We were addressing in the main a category of women who did not work outside the home.  In previous cases before the courts, particularly <i>L.</i> v. <i>L.</i>, the court decided that because the woman did not contribute financially to the purchase of the home or the repayment of the mortgage she did not have a joint entitlement to the family home. We were specifically trying to address <Col N="1916" /> the position of women who decided to stay in the home.</P>
    <P>Our Constitution, on the one hand, talks about the benefits of women in the home and how they contribute to the common good, yet was found to be wanting in relation to these women.  The onus is on us to try to change that.  We seem to be saying to women that we did our bit and got so far but it did not work out.  We are saying that we are very sorry about that but they have to go to the end of the queue again.  I do not think this is acceptable.</P>
    <P>Women in the main are not very demanding for things for themselves. They have put family interests before their own interests down through the years.  That in a sense contributed to the society Senator Farrell talked about.  It was because women were prepared to sacrifice their own needs and their own position in society and decided to do what society demanded of them without objection that they were ignored for a long time.  Times have changed and I welcome the changes.  Society has to address these issues.  We have to look at a situation where women are prepared to stay in the home and we have to be seen, as a society, to support them.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell also said that we make a virtue of the fact that women go out to work.  I deny that.  All women should have a choice to do what they want and the choice they make is the important issue.  They should be free to make those choices.  If women believe that by making a choice to stay in the home they are jeopardising their own financial independence or will become dependent on a male, they will decide that they do not want to do so.  It is because of financial dependency that they decide not do that.</P>
    <P>If we decide as a society that they should have a choice then we should enable them to make that choice with the freedom to know they are not financially dependent.  The principle of joint ownership of the family home went a long way towards achieving that and it was a great disappointment to me that it was found to be unconstitutional and <Col N="1917" /> that this was readily accepted by the Government.  I am not saying that the Minister readily accepted it, but it is an important issue.</P>
    <P>We talked about equality in the programme for Government.  Women were led to believe that some concessions would be made in the budget this year in relation to child care and that there would be some tax relief in that area.  It was ignored again.  The brunt of child care and care of the elderly is borne by women.  Just because women have done it for so long without looking for anything in return, when they ask for something, they are almost ignored.  It is as if all of these issues are outside the hard economic areas of life in this country. Many of the men who control positions of power in this country view them in this way and therefore, they are not looked after.  That is very wrong.</P>
    <P>I believe it is my duty as a female Member of this House to raise these issues again and again and to let people in positions of power know that we are not going to be content to let it pass and that these issues are important to us. They are very important to society and should be recognised as such.  They are issues that are very pro-family, which all of us would like to be.</P>
    <P>I accept what the Minister is doing. He is dealing with reality in this country and I welcome what he is doing.  The reality makes necessary the introduction of measures such as those he is introducing here today.  We would all like it if we did not need to introduce these measures, but unfortunately marital breakdown exists.  There are considerations such as maintenance in all of this which have to be dealt with and I congratulate the Minister for the comprehensive way in which he is dealing with them here today.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister's heart is in the right place and he knows that he has the support of everybody here.  He has managed to bring forward much legislation while in office and I know he will continue to do that.  Tomorrow we will have further legislation from his area.  I would like to help the Minister and support <Col N="1918" /> what he wants to do within the Cabinet. I want him to know that he has our support and we will continue to raise these issues and keep them before the Government's mind.</P>
    <P>There may be a feeling abroad that we are only interested in marriage when it breaks down, but that is wrong.  Most people accept that a stable marriage is what should be aimed for, but unfortunately marriages break down and we have to deal with that.  We should offer support to stable marriages.  I welcome the extension of the mediation services, free legal aid and such other services as the Minister has introduced.  Much more funding is required in these areas.</P>
    <P>When separation cases get to court it is a very adversarial system and is almost like a battle between the two spouses.  We must be concerned because unfortunately children can be the innocent victims and are left out in the cold. The last divorce referendum failed because people did not believe it addressed the financial implications of divorce.</P>
    <P>At this stage we accept that by the time the referendum is held all of these matters will be dealt with and the only issue will be the right to remarry. However the psychological and mental effects on children of marital breakdown and all the legal arrangements need to be looked at and it is a most important area.</P>
    <P>How we support the family is affected by our attitude to women in society. Women have supported the family very well and they have been doing it on their own.  They have not received much support from the State.  Our attitude to women and how we look after them reflects on our attitude to the family within our society.  It is important to look at women's position in society and at what we are doing to maintain such positions and to help them to make the choices they want.</P>
    <P>I agree with what Senator Gallagher said about family law cases being held <i>in camera.</i>  I remember having discussions with a friend, who is a judge, about what took place in family courts.  Many of us <Col N="1919" /> would like to believe that we live in a world that is different to reality.  The names of people involved cannot be published, but it would be worthwhile if details of the cases were published because this would create a general awareness about what we should do to protect the family and to ensure that it stays together.  It would also expose us to the reasons families experience problems which cause marital breakdown and it would mean that we are not looking at something when it is too late to do anything about it and maybe we would change our attitudes to the funds allocated to the various services which support the family.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase in the age for marriage from 16 to 18 years of age.  I have a 17 year old son and it is astounding to think that legally he would be able to get married.  I am sure he does not consider himself a child, but I do.  It is difficult to make decisions at that age which are supposed to be for life.  I do not think anyone of 16 years of age is in a position to make such a life time commitment.</P>
    <P>I agree with the three months notice needed for marriage.  In the past there was a tendency to rush young pregnant girls into marriage.  The church and families thought this solved the problem when, in fact, it was the worst decision for the couple.  It is right, particularly for young people, to have a period to consider what they are doing.  In this country one needs a licence to drive a car and one must be 18 years of age to vote, but it is easy to make a commitment to marriage which is supposed to be for life.  I congratulate the Minister for introducing these provisions.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions which strengthen the law on maintenance. Since this Bill will probably affect women in particular, access to legal advice is important.  If a woman does not have money, she does not have equal access to the law and to the courts and without proper provisions, the earning spouse will have an advantage.  I welcome what the Minister has done in <Col N="1920" /> relation to legal aid and I welcome the Bill he will introduce tomorrow.  We must ensure that both people have equal access to legal advice otherwise, the provisions of the Bill will not be fair.</P>
    <P>I welcome the extension of powers to the Circuit and District Courts. However, are they properly equipped to deal with this extended jurisdiction? Many courts lack the proper facilities. In order for justice to operate effectively, we need more court staff and judges, especially women judges.  The Government appointed Ms Justice Catherine McGuiness to the Circuit Court and I welcomed that at the time. She was the first woman to be appointed.  This is an indication of the poor representation of women in important situations, as Senator Taylor-Quinn outlined.  We need to train judges to deal with such situations.  Many judges in this country are far removed from the reality of marital breakdown and from the lives of women and children in these situations.  They do not experience the difficulties of financial dependency which many women experience. It would help if more women judges were appointed and if present judges were retrained.  We require better facilities and a proper civil legal aid scheme.</P>
    <P>Despite these few shortcomings, this is a much needed Bill which I support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill enables us to look at the issues which the Minister wants to address in a coherent and honest manner and to see if the Bill is a comprehensive and effective way of achieving harmony, justice and good relations in family law.  It is self-evident that it is not a family law Bill but a family breakdown Bill.  I do not want to criticise it for that reason alone, but the Title having regard to all the main provisions in the Bill, is inappropriate.  As far as I can see, there are only two or three provisions in the Bill which support the family as distinct from provisions which should arise when the family breaks down.  When we address this issue, we should be clear in our <Col N="1921" /> minds as to whether this is a family law Bill or a family breakdown Bill.  I am not suggesting that the latter term implies that what the Minister is proposing encourages family breakdown, but almost every detail in this Bill is geared to coping with the consequences of family breakdown.  However, there are a few exceptions which I am glad to note.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's statement about the need to safeguard and to protect the institution of marriage because that has been part of our laws and our society for years, from the old Judaeo-Christian concept of the family.  It is the basis for stability in our society and it is in our Constitution.  It is one of the fundamental priorities of the Bill, but where is the provision to protect the family under law given that the focus these days is on problems, rights, breakdowns, the protection of rights and the consequences of breakdowns?  I will give one example where the Minister is doing something enlightened in the context of breakdown, but I must ask why we are not doing it in the context of the family?  The provision in relation to pensions, for example, is an enlightened one in the context of breakdown.  The dependent wife, which it is in most cases, must have the rights for which the Minister is legislating and I welcome that.  However, why not take the positive step of providing the same right for a family where the unit is not breaking down?  For example, why do we not, as legislators, make provision under our pension regulations, as an example to all other pension schemes, that both spouses have equal rights by definition as a family and under law to the pension rights earned by one or other?  Would it not be a positive step if the provision the Minister is introducing in the event of breakdown could be used where there is no immediate or real risk of breakdown?  This would ensure that degree of security &mdash; which women understandably feel they need &mdash; is there as a matter of right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could even make provision in pension schemes for women in existing <Col N="1922" /> marriages.  If it emerged that the pensioner &mdash; such as a Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas &mdash; who has earned the pension through his entitlements, offended the standards we would require in vindication of the fundamental rights of women, one could provide for forfeit of pension rights in respect of the wife or, if not for forfeiture, for reduction.  This would be seen as family protection.  It is time we in the Oireachtas, who are meant to give an example, wrote into our regulations that our pension schemes do not attach to persons who, by virtue of Membership in either House, has &ldquo;earned&rdquo; the rights so to speak.  As all of us, male and female, recognise that none of us could begin to serve the public need were it not for the support and constant stability provided, in this instance, by the wife in the home.</P>
    <P>Another example in the Bill is the housing area.  The rights of women must be vindicated in the event of marriage breakdown.  However the old concept of family was not just a man, a woman, their children and rights in the event of breakdown &mdash; it went far beyond that. Society did not start in 1990 or 1995, although it looks to be close to breaking down at this point.  What has maintained the stability of society until today is the extended family concept.  The family is not only the husband and wife, it is also the grandfather and grandmother.  I welcome the points made by Senator Henry in this regard.  The elderly, as we can see from our experience, give a great degree of stability to family, and a great deal of affection to children and grandchildren. They give stability of a kind for which we all long and yearn but in a sense it is being ignored.</P>
    <P>Perhaps our housing policy could be redirected positively towards supporting families.  Let us consider Ballyfermot today.  I knew that area 30 years ago; I visited from time to time; only the first generation had settled in Ballyfermot at that time.  Many of them were vulnerable and unemployed, some of them single parents although not to the same extent as today, and there were some <Col N="1923" /> alcoholic husbands.  The problems of Ballyfermot at that point were all too visible and some saw them as synonymous with the problems of Dublin.</P>
    <P>It is wonderful to think that, 30 years later, Ballyfermot can be held up as an example of a cohesive community. There are problems there as there are everywhere but now the second and third generations have grown up, as they did in the village communities of which we are so proud, in the neighbourhoods in which we were lucky to grow up, and they have become an essential part of the area.  The problem has now been transferred to other first generations areas, as we might call them, in Dublin.</P>
    <P>In terms of financial commitment, no country has consistently invested as much money in local authority housing stock relative to its total economic capacity as Ireland &mdash; and I have experience of this in countries throughout Europe.  Further, no city corporation has invested as much as Dublin Corporation in providing accommodation but has our social planning been enlightened? I have great respect for people involved in community work in Tallaght and for those who are vulnerable and have problems.  Given its location, size and contiguity to the mountains, in any other city in Europe it would be regarded as an elite development in terms of accommodation stock and positioning. By and large, that has not been so with us.</P>
    <P>As the generations change, the strength in that great community, the educational infrastructure, etc., will draw out what is in those people.  Nonetheless, what we are conscious of now are the symptoms of breakdown.  We are putting all those who are vulnerable &mdash; the single parents, the unemployed, etc. &mdash; in one area.  Where is the positive thinking in terms of families, whatever definition one uses &mdash; the extended family, the conventional family or the single parent family? Where is the positive approach?</P>
    <P>This is not a criticism of the current Government because this has been a <Col N="1924" /> pattern over the years.  In our decisions on housing allocation and expenditure we should ensure a degree of social integration in communities.  People cannot be uprooted from their heartland in the streets of this lovely historic city and sent to the perimeter to better housing accommodation but a less amenable social environment.  We cannot do this anymore although we have been doing it for a long time.</P>
    <P>We have all been privileged to see this wonderful community spirit in rural Ireland but it is a feature too of the village communities of Dublin.  I was privileged to know one great village community in Dublin when I was studying for the Bar; I spent some years teaching part-time in Ringsend, or as we knew it &ldquo;The Ringer&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Village&rdquo;.  If one wants to see community, one will see it there.  Everyone is related one to the other, and no age distinctions.  Pressures now apply there as well as everywhere else but the strength of that community is the same as in any village community &mdash; the intermingling of ages and the interdependency of family in its broadest sense.  Mrs. Nolan &mdash; I remember her as Old Grandma Nolan &mdash; had a shop and her family gave great distinction to Irish football &mdash; of course we are playing football today.  She was the core of Ringsend; she knew what was going on and she was looked up to and respected.</P>
    <P>When we talk about family law, is it not time to use some of the desirable provisions in the Bill, which are there in the event of breakdown while the family unit is still in existence?  The Minister has to cope with the consequences of the problems which are there.  These provisions should be available for stable families as well as for families in danger of breakdown.</P>
    <P>If I did nothing else during my period as Minister for Finance, I am happy about my decision &mdash; when the Murphy judgment was made by the Supreme Court &mdash; to have two separate tax allowances for a married couple when a wife works outside the home.  I immediately saw that if one did not extend that to the working wife at home there would <Col N="1925" /> be active discrimination against the very person who is designated in our Constitution as being the significant bedrock in the stability of our society.  I proposed to the Government that we act rather than wait for any action on the part of any group who might feel offended or any determination on the part of a court.  God knows, there were financial consequences in respect of the first decision which put our budget way off key although they were also, perhaps, a consequence of some of our misplaced actions subsequently when we did not confront things we should have confronted. However, that is another day's work.  We introduced the same right to a tax allowance for the working wife at home as for the working wife outside the home.  What else should we do?</P>
    <P>There is understandable pressure nowadays on all of us, and particularly on those in Government, to cope with immediate problems that arise where there are consequences of breakdown and where there is violence or wife battering. That is understandable.  Is it not absolutely essential that, in addition to doing that, we should take the positive view in supporting what is already stable and secure?  The Minister is responsible for law reform and I ask him to look at all the relevant areas &mdash; social welfare payments, education and the range of areas where the State is involved &mdash; in order to protect the existing family.  I agree with Senator Henry; I would have been happy if all possible allowances and welfare provisions in the budget were targeted more to support the family.</P>
    <P>I resumed practice at the Bar in the last two years.  I have heard comments today, from Senator Taylor-Quinn among others, which are well based and justifiable from any reasonable observation of courts at any level in any one day.  Judges by definition are not going to heal problems or, as somebody said, &ldquo;solve&rdquo; problems, although that depends on what we mean by &ldquo;solution&rdquo;. Lawyers by definition are not engaged in reconciliation.  Lawyers are there to represent the interests of their <Col N="1926" /> clients.  That is the reality and we should acknowledge it.  We are living under an illusion if we think a court system can bring about some degree of reconciliation, or are we saying that that is not its function anyway?  We call it &ldquo;family law&rdquo;.  Perhaps we should call this the family breakdown Bill because that is what it is.</P>
    <P>Since I left the Bar over five years ago, the growth area in law has been what we call family law.  It is a huge area.  There are many lawyers, at both levels of the profession, who are making considerable incomes &mdash; and I do not blame them for doing so &mdash; as a result of that growth.  There is one fact we can state: in terms of family law there is one group of beneficiaries, the lawyers.</P>

This legislation will open up new avenues where there will be another boost to the income of lawyers, be they solicitors or barristers.  Let us recognise this as the reality.  We are introducing a new range of provisions in the event of breakdown. We will ensure that certain things will be done and there will be lawyers available to vindicate and protect the rights of the warring factions or conflicting spouses.</P>
      <P>Are we looking at the inadequacy of that profession in terms of trying to make a contribution towards reconciliation? Is the legal profession really equipped to do the job at all?  Senator Taylor-Quinn may rightly comment about certain judges.

      <P>We are living under an illusion if we think lawyers will solve problems.  We talk about our system and <Col N="1927" /> our courts.  Should we introduce the system that operates in the United States? Is it not evident that the courts in the United States are scenes of battle, of assertion of rights?  As soon as the parties come to court, whatever the issue, it will be aggravated.  Have we not seen that?  Do we not know that?  Are we going to have the UK system where they may be more enlightened in terms of training their judges?  Are we going to say there is no confrontation there? We have confrontation: an assertion of the rights of one person against the other.  Lawyers are there to do that and to protect those rights.</P>
      <P>We always talk in terms of rights as distinct from promoting responsibility. We might as well recognise that.  We should not operate under an illusion. Five years after the passage of this legislation &mdash; and the Minister, as a practising lawyer, will know this &mdash; there will be a major increase in the activities and income of lawyers in these and other areas.  Perhaps that is not a bad thing. However, it is not what we, as Members of the Oireachtas who are interested in trying to provide for family law, wish to set about doing.  Where marriage breakdown occurs it is necessary to have the provisions being introduced by the Minister in this legislation.  I will not question them.  However, I would like to see the focus on another area.</P>
      <P>One of the purposes of this Bill is to give substantial power to the courts to deal with the financial consequences of marital breakdown in cases where a foreign decree of divorce is entitled to recognition in the State.  I do not have a great difficulty with our decisions under our laws.  However, what we are saying in a sense in this Bill is that in the case of a foreign decree of divorce &mdash; and there are different concepts in other countries &mdash; we will introduce the same provisions in this Bill as if the divorce were secured here.  It is time to pause and look at this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn mentioned that people are engaging in quick marriages in other jurisdictions.  I am not sure if <Col N="1928" /> that is what the Senator wished to underline, but, in addition, we all know that a number of them are going to those same jurisdictions where they obtained a marriage to achieve a divorce and we are going to underpin that practice without having any real influence ourselves on the courts and the jurisdictions where the foreign divorces are affected.</P>
    <P>We are the representatives of the people in this jurisdiction.  We are the ones who have the responsibility in terms of the norms and standards of our society.  Are we going to react to the norms and standards of other societies and say that if one gets a divorce according to the legislation pertaining in America, Reno or wherever &mdash; and, God knows, it is a big business &mdash; we will make provision for the consequences? I am aware that the intention is not to discriminate against people who have been disadvantaged by that, but much more thought needs to go into a provision as broad as this, where effectively we are providing for the consequences of decisions made elsewhere, in different jurisdictions and different courts which are not based on our inheritance.  Understandably, they have their laws based on their inheritance.</P>
    <P>I recall reading a series of articles by perhaps the most eminent jurist of recent time in the UK or Ireland, Lord Chief Justice Devlin, a self-confessed agnostic.  He wrote a series of treatises on the issue of the law and morality, which are in the Library.  He made the point that the law in any country derives from a complex of influences &mdash; its history, culture, economic conditions and the prevailing order in politics, be it totalitarian, democratic or whatever.  He then also mentions, and does so deliberately as an agnostic, the prevailing religious ethos.  To illustrate the point he wrote, for example, that for consistency and stability what could be good law in Islamic society, because of the tolerance, at least, of Islam towards polygamy, would give rise to chaos in a Christian society, where the norm is monogamy as distinct from polygamy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1929" /> If we want to exclude &mdash; and we can if we wish &mdash; the prevailing religious ethos in any society, call it sectarian or something of that kind and say that it is of no effect and is no business of ours, we ignore the reality that in all the civilisations throughout the world, be they some of the most sensitive pagan civilisations of Africa, China or wherever else, the prevailing religion in the sense of ethos has a major effect, and rightly so, on the law.  However, are we at the stage of enlightenment, as we think it is, in 1995 that we are going to start from today and sweep all that aside, our culture or whatever?  I am not referring to Ireland specifically, but to everywhere.</P>
    <P>On whom are we trying to catch up? If somebody shows me the society we are aspiring to emulate and say that those are the standards, there is the happiness and wellbeing, there is the justice, the court system and the family, then I would sit and listen.  However, I have not heard that, and I am not referring solely to the Minister.  I have not heard that from anybody.  Indeed, there is the view, which I have seen again over the weekend, which is based on the proviso that if people have courage they will tackle these problems and that those who do not have courage will do other things.  The implications of this &mdash; and I am thinking of a whole range of commentators in the media &mdash; is that if one is to be in any way courageous or enlightened, one must go along with what they say is the modern enlightened way.  On that basis I plead guilty to being a coward, if that is what they call cowardice.</P>
    <P>I believe the real cowardice arises when people go along with those preconceived notions, because that is what they say we should all be doing, without expressing in a reasoned and convincing way why we want to question things at this stage.  I do not feel a coward, but if they wish to regard us as being cowards, that is for them, and let it be.  In addition, I do not wish to proselytise, but if they wish to represent what I say as being totally and utterly unintelligent, let them be.  However, any immediate <Col N="1930" /> superficial comment should not be the norm for any one of us who have the obligation and privilege of laying down in legislation the standards we wish to see protected and upheld in our society. We may come to this issue in more detail in subsequent discussions on other stages of legislation and referenda.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in the Bill regarding the notice of marriage, but notice of itself is only the first step.  It should be bolstered by a lot more than that.  It is a significant step, and a breakthrough, as is the increase in the marriage age, which I acknowledge. However, if these matters are worth such a breakthrough, we must do more. I do not want to pick out any specific grouping, but the Catholic Marriage Advisory Council is known throughout the country as providing a great service. There are probably other marriage counselling organisations also, so I am not merely speaking of the Catholic Marriage Advisory Council, nor do I wish to set it apart from others. However, I wish to see their role introduced at every possible stage into provisions in respect of the family, because by definition they are much better equipped, more committed and devoted than our lawyers, of whom I am one.  I am on a pay roll; they are not.</P>
    <P>I am aware the Minister has introduced a good element &mdash; and I am not perhaps as familiar with it as I should be &mdash; in regard to provisions for counselling and reconciliation and I encourage him in this respect.  It should be seen as a focus.  It could really be a monument to the Minister, or any other Minister or Government which introduced, strengthened and supplemented it.  If I know a group of people in our society who are not only well intentioned and highly motivated, but who are stable, balanced and have a healthy contribution to make, it is those who are engaged in marriage counselling though all the various organisations and who give their time, concern and professionalism to it.  I wish to see much more entrusted to them and to see those <Col N="1931" /> organisations specifically targeted in legislation of this kind.</P>
    <P>In considering the whole area of family and family law in the broadest sense, the Minister might, if not in this Bill, look at those positive elements and begin with a definition of family.  There is no such definition in the Bill.  The family is addressed in the Constitution, but if we wish to be clearer in our minds, let us define it and ascertain the units we wish to help.  I am not excluding single parents in this.  Having done that, let us then decide what we will do as regards family law, priorities and the instruments we will use to achieve our aims.</P>
    <P>This should then inform all of our policy through every activity of Government. For example, are we going to give special support to education?  We should provide such support to the family dependency, where for one reason or another a wife either does not have work, is not able to work or chooses not to work because of what she would see as her prior responsibility to the family role at home.  I do not suggest that all see it this way.  We should recognise that and support and vindicate it.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan referred to the sacrifice of women.  How can anyone do other than acknowledge that?  It is a question of <i>res ipsa loquitur</i>&mdash; let the facts speak for themselves.  The self-sacrifice by women in the home has brought about the stability and happiness we have in society.  There is no question about that.  However, I would not see it as being a question of women as distinct from those other awful alternative creatures, the men who, by definition and disposition, are uncaring or selfish.  In my view, even the most enlightened, caring male will never make the contribution to stability in society which the women in the home will.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>They could try but by definition I do not think we can.  The <Col N="1932" /> child relates to the mother; there is a natural link between child and mother from the very beginning.  I do not want to get into a sociological analysis of this. Of course, the father must be caring, protective, present as much as possible, understanding, tolerant and sharing. However, despite all that I would make the empirical observation that the mother's role in the home will always be of much greater primary importance in the children's lives than the father's, although he has a very important role.</P>
      <P>That pre-eminent role which women not just in Ireland but elsewhere have is irreplaceable.  Why do we not recognise, assert, respect and voice it?  That is not to make a criticism of those who work outside the home.  However, let us recognise at the same time the fundamental, irreplaceable role of the woman at home.  I sometimes query to myself if those women who, understandably, wish to find expression in work outside the home feel that they have to somehow assert their right to such an extent as to, in a sense, question the right of anyone to recognise fully the irreplaceable role of the woman who decides to stay at home.  To recognise one is not to blame the other.  Anyone can be a breadwinner but no one can replace the role of a mother in a home.</P>

      <P>I know that in any of the family homes of which I am aware the role of the wife and mother in the home is pre-eminently more significant than that of the husband and father.  I just want to have that recognised as a fact, but that is not to criticise those women who want to work outside the home.  Those women who want to work outside the home should also insist and assert, as women, that the role of the woman in the home is very special.  We should be working to secure and support that role, wherever a woman chooses to exercise it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1933" /> I wish to make two or three points which are more related to legal elements than the social elements with which I have been dealing.  With regard to the provisions in relation to nullity, it may surprise Members that, as a lawyer, I was engaged in a court case which went to the Supreme Court in 1973 or 1974 and achieved the first nullity decree for years &mdash; Mr. Justice Seamus Egan was leading me in the case.  I think there was one precedent which we could quote to the court.  The basis of the case was that the marriage was not a marriage in any sense of a civil contract, which is how we looked at it.  There was such a misrepresentation on the part of the &ldquo;husband&rdquo; as to his &ldquo;intention&rdquo; for &ldquo;marriage&rdquo; that, in fact, there was never what is called in law a consensus <i>ad idem</i>, namely, the agreement of both parties to make a contract in respect of mutual recognition of what they are intending to contract on, mutual respect for what they are contracting on and total and utter disclosure of the elements of the contract.</P>
    <P>Where that is absent, where there is misrepresentation or fraud or no real intention to contract, that will nullify any contract &mdash; building contracts and so on &mdash; and has done so and looking at marriage purely as a contract, it will also nullify a marriage.  Since that case in 1974 or 1975, the law courts have been simply looking at the conduct of the parties at the time, or soon after, and finding that the conduct was such as to be inconsistent with the intention to enter into a binding civil contract, no more or less.</P>
    <P>The courts have since then introduced a whole series of guidelines in relation to the provisions for nullity; there have been many nullity decrees since the case mentioned in which I was involved.  The simple fact is that nullity as such is now known to our law in the judicial determination.</P>
    <P>I belonged to Governments which failed to do this, so I am not making any implied criticism.  The Minister is making provision here in respect of the consequences of nullity but, obviously, he <Col N="1934" /> cannot extend all of the provisions in this Bill to nullity.  Is it not time in terms of legal reform to incorporate into our Statute law the norms, conditions and provisions under which nullity can be decreed?  Is that not our role?  The courts should simply be interpreting the law we pass.</P>
    <P>It is evident that there are many so-called marriages which were never marriages. For example, one of the parties may have been married before and did not disclose that to the other party, in other words, there was cheating and falsehood, which there cannot be in any contract.  People must have an intention to contract about the same things with the same purpose and the same knowledge. If a person conceals or defrauds that will vitiate any contract.  It is worth looking at that as being one area where we can show that the Houses of the Oireachtas are capable of providing legislation.</P>
    <P>I wish to underline the point made by Senator Honan about child care and care of the elderly, which must be one of the most consistent elements in any family law provision.  It is not so long ago, before the Married Women Status Act, 1957, that in any separation the father's right was pre-eminent; after that time both had equal rights.  Later, fortunately, we recognised that there is another right, the right of the children; they were not consulted about the breakdown.  We have come on, at least, in that form of legislation.</P>
    <P>When we are talking about rights in terms of all such legislation, it is time that we also recognise responsibilities.  Who consults the children?  They come into being as a consequence of the exercise of the right to get married. They are not consulted, but it is a natural consequence of the exercise of that right.  Have they not an essential, fundamental and primary right in the event that two people who exercised the first right were to exercise other rights?  I share the view that our society is becoming far too focused on rights and not nearly enough on responsibilities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1935" /> When I hear the question of a solution canvassed I would like to know its precise parameters.  It will be a solution which will bring about the conditions that exist in societies in countries in which I have lived for six and 12 months, such as Belgium, Italy, America and Switzerland.  It will be that type of solution and it is time we paused and examined what it represents.  It may seem a solution to some problems we have at present, but will it be a solution which introduces the problems those societies are experiencing now?  We should pause and reflect.  We should look at the consequences in those societies of some of the solutions which have been discussed.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that I have not addressed the detail of the Bill or its precise provisions, which the Minister outlined.  I have dwelt on the point that I would like much of that enlightened detail introduced, where possible, to an existing family as distinct from a family breakdown situation.  I hope the Oireachtas will not at any time confine itself to legislating and providing solutions for breakdown in any order of society.  If the Oireachtas does this it will be ineffective and we will find many people having recourse to rights.  It is time we started to remind people of their responsibilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is clear that it is part of the process of preparation for a divorce referendum, which I very much welcome.  It is important in our enthusiasm for the institution of the family that we do not lose sight of the welfare of the individuals who compose it.  It has always appeared to me completely blasphemous to erect a shibboleth, entitle it marriage and bow down and worship at that shrine regardless of the fate, wellbeing and happiness of the individuals who compose that entity.  This is particularly true of family law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over many years I have witnessed a situation where, because we have this exaggerated, sentimentalised and <Col N="1936" /> unrealistic attitude towards this human institution called the family, it very often militates against the wellbeing of people.  One example is where a wife is being battered.  Traditionally, the Garda will be called, but they will go away again, saying that they cannot intervene because it is a family matter.  In such circumstances it seems perfectly clear that the institution of the family is actually inimical to human wellbeing.  It is time we faced the reality of these situations.</P>
    <P>It is also remarkable that some groups who project themselves as pro life &mdash; this assumes there is another body of people who are anti life or pro death, but I have not met them and they do not seem generally spread around the country &mdash; found themselves placed in a situation of bitter antagonism to the Stay Safe programme.  This was on the basis that they alleged it constituted a threat to the family because children might be incited to become a fifth column and report incidents of sexual abuse by their parents.  I found that logic quite extraordinary, the notion being that being a parent confers upon an adult the right to molest and interfere with his or, in some strange case, her offspring.  I cannot accept that and if this is what the family means, the sooner the family withers away the better as far as I am concerned.</P>
    <P>I am sorry one of my colleagues has left the House because I wanted to address one or two of his remarks.  I note that he paid some attention to the role of the spouse, that is, in this case as quoted, the wife in the home supporting her husband.  I do not think that should be the exclusive role of women.  I know it is in the Constitution, but it is a very bad thing and the sooner it is removed the better.  It was inserted without consultation with women, against the advice of women and neglecting even to entertain the views of those women, as I heard on the radio no later than this morning when somebody was talking about the 85th anniversary of the Irish Countrywomen's Association.  When Mr. de Valera was projecting his views about the family in Article 41, a delegation <Col N="1937" /> of 15 women representing 15 major women's organisations in this country attempted to gain an interview with President de Valera to inform him that they were not flattered by being imprisoned in the home under his 1937 Constitution.  Mr. de Valera refused to see them, apparently anticipating the passage of the Constitution which would confirm that the woman's position was in fact in the home.</P>
    <P>I do not take the same view as some of my colleagues with regard to the position of women or the family.  One of the reasons I wished to contribute, although I do not have a great deal to say about the technical aspects of the Bill, is that I want to sound a little warning.  I was at a conference in the humanist university in Utrecht last year and I met a distinguished Belgian woman who alerted me to the fact that at a number of these conferences, which were taking place before the Cairo population conference, the Vatican's representatives were attempting to side through a charter for the family.  The method being proposed was that at the end of the conference the Vatican representative would stand up and say &ldquo;The charter of the family has been presented to this meeting and I assume it will be passed unanimously&rdquo;. Luckily, my excellent friend was there and said &ldquo;No, it is not going to be passed unanimously&rdquo;.  I am very glad she did so because &mdash; and this is how it relates to the Bill &mdash; the definition of the family was extremely narrow and very worrying.  It was a relationship consecrated by religion between one man and one woman and entailed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very problematic. The reason I say one must look at the family is because the family in Ireland has traditionally been, as presented by some sources, and intensely selfish, acquisitive and exclusive unit.  This was used by particular political forces in order to engender these qualities of selfishness and people were excluded from the definition of the family.  It had much to do with the acquiring of power in our society.</P>
      <P>I heard one of my colleagues talking about the pension rights of spouses and I am absolutely in favour of that.  After all, why would I not be?  For the last 30 or 40 years I have been paying into these pension funds for the widows, orphans and widowers of my heterosexual friends.  I draw this to the Minister's attention because I am sure it will come up again.  I claim to be part of a family and I claim that my relationship constitutes a family for me.  I do not consider that an extravagant or absurd claim.</P>
      <P>I remember reading in <i>The Irish Press</i> a number of years ago an article by Tim Pat Coogan about the great socialist from Donegal, Peadar O'Donnell, saying what great wit he had, what a wonderful man he was, how amusing and politically shrewd.  He said that Peadar O'Donnell told a story about two homosexuals in Roscommon and how one of them died and Deputy Seán Doherty got the other one the widow's pension. That was regarded as a source of extreme amusement.  I did not laugh quite as heartily as my sexist female friends.  Oh, the monstrous and fickle regiment of women.  How could they?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I see; it was a low political blow against a decent former Member of this House.  It is interesting to examine that story.  The mechanism upon which that joke works is the assumption that gay people are so radically different in their human relationships that it <Col N="1939" /> would be absurd to support them in any manner when they are bereaved.  I do not believe that and I do not feel it.  I do not resent paying for the upkeep of other people's family institutions or organisations.  However, when we talk about allowing widows and widowers to participate equally in the pension schemes of their departed spouses, I do not see any reason why if I have a relationship for 20 years which has love, nurturing, devotion and faithfulness in it, my partner should be dumped on the side of the road and laughed at for expecting a little support.  I do not think it is that absurd.</P>
      <P>I wrote reproving Tim Pat Coogan and he wrote a piece in an article saying I had absolutely no sense of humour.  I have, but there are occasions when it is politic to try to conceal it, not to laugh and to look terribly offended.  I am afraid I did not quite succeed here. However, I hope I exhibited some of the problems underlying the mechanism of that joke.</P>
      <P>While I support the family and I am a member of a family &mdash; even a member of a conventional nuclear family, one generation back &mdash; I raise certain questions about our unquestioning devotion to this institution as above the welfare of the individuals who compose it.  We should start with the individual.  If, as was claimed monotonously this afternoon, the family is the natural unit of society, the inevitable social building block as we understand it and as the Roman Catholic Church narrowly defines it, then why cannot this wonderful natural efflorescence inevitably produced by social organisation stand on its own two feet?  Why does it need to be buttressed, supported, cosseted, counselled, advised, paid for and legal aided?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite happy that these supports, which are provided for in the Bill, should occur, but let nobody simultaneously tell me that the family as defined in this limited way is inevitable and natural.  It is a human construct which suited people for the last 300 or <Col N="1940" /> 400 years, which is about as long as the family as we really understand it now has existed.  It may well be in a process of change.  If we believe in the spirit of humanity we must welcome and adapt to that change and reflect the reality not just of a majority of people but of everybody in society.</P>
    <P>We should start with the individual and then look at the institutions; and if a conflict arises between the individuals who compose that institution and the institution itself, we should not regard the institution as being sacrosanct and immune to questioning.  I am not trying to make a plea for the abolition of the family &mdash; that would be absurd &mdash; but as a society we must be mature enough to look at the family and to see that there may be certain circumstances in which the individuals are damaged by being locked into the institution of the family.</P>
    <P>I hope that there will be all-party considered support for measures such as these.  Although Fianna Fáil is now joining us Independents in Opposition, I hope it will be constructive.  I remember the last divorce referendum&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and forward looking. A spectre raised the last time by Fianna Fáil was the notion of property &mdash; it had nothing to do with the family &mdash; and it was unscrupulously used by Fianna Fáil and certain Church interests.  I urge my friends and colleagues in Fianna Fáil not to follow that disreputable course of action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nullity seems a complete absurdity. How can somebody live with another person of the opposite sex, produce ten children and then suddenly wake up, say, on Thursday 11 June at 9.45 a.m. and discover they were never married at all, or persuade a court or a couple of <Col N="1941" /> bishops to proclaim that they were never married?  It seems a complete nonsense.  There was a marriage, it was a real marriage and people ought to face up honestly to that; otherwise it leads them into totally absurd positions.  The notion of nullity which was drawn into our civil law from ecclesiastical law is a total and absolute nonsense.  Such hypocrisy brings our law into disrepute.</P>
    <P>I recall a case some years ago in which a senior judge determined that a marriage was null and void or he found in favour of an application for nullity&mdash; I am not sure of the legal phraseology. He found that the marriage was null and void because one of the partners gave evidence that he was, had been and continued to practise as a homosexual.  It struck me as curious that the same judge had held in a case which I took that the then existence of the criminal law against homosexual behaviour among consenting male adults in private was absolutely necessary to sustain the moral fibre of the State and to sustain the family against attack by driving people who would otherwise be reluctant into the institution of marriage.</P>
    <P>That seemed to show a low view of marriage, an animal husbandry attitude towards it, as if one was driving these people in as if into a sheep dip. Although they deeply disliked the experience and would not naturally select it for themselves, they had to be coerced by the threat of the big stick of the criminal law into this institution. Yet, 18 months later the same judge, having driven the unfortunate people in at one end and forced them into marriage against their wishes, the moment they are married turns around and sees the marriage as having evaporated because of the sexuality of one of the component elements.  It is another illustration of my contention that one should be sensitive primarily to the individual components of a marriage rather than to the institution.  We should allow people to emerge from a broken marriage.</P>
    <P>It is also better for the children, who are usually dragged into this.  It is said <Col N="1942" /> that people ought to stay together for the sake of the children.  It was said to me at the weekend that a gay couple who are friends of mine were staying together for the sake of the furniture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>Or the mortgage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not even that; it was the furniture.  When one introduces the notion of the children one really needs to understand what the welfare of children really means.  I believe &mdash; and there is a lot of sociological statistics and documented evidence for this view &mdash; that for children, although it is traumatic when the parents separate, it is much better for them in the long run than being locked into a bitter, divisive and sometimes physically threatening marriage.</P>
      <P>I ranged fairly widely on this Bill, although I said little of any immediate technical import to the discussion.  I did not intend to speak on the Bill, but when I heard this paean of praise for the family unqualified by any critical examination of that institution and its elevation above the human happiness and welfare of the constituent elements, I felt I ought to make this plea, not for the destruction of the family, but for a careful, sympathetic and humane analysis of what is merely one among many, but an important human institution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not easy to follow Senator Norris after such an interesting oration.  He certainly ranged far and wide over all aspects of people's relationship with each other in different circumstances.  However, he failed to deal with one type of relationship, namely, polygamy, which bears a relationship to what he said about nullity, which has been removed from the Bill to a large extent.  When talking about the apparent nonsense of people living together for many years, having children and then becoming involved in a nullity confrontation, he overlooked the possibility that one of the parties could have been married before, which <Col N="1943" /> would give rise to some difficulty.  I do not know whether he considered that point.</P>
      <P>I am sorry Senator O'Kennedy, who spoke at length, and Senator Farrell are not here because I would like to have said a number of things to them.  Both Senators were at pains, in a mild way perhaps, to remonstrate with me that this Bill deals with cases of family breakdown whereas we should be concentrating on preserving, maintaining and doing everything we possibly can to support the family.  They both dealt at considerable length, in the nicest possible way, with that theme.</P>
      <P>Having urged me at great length to deal more with family support than family breakdown, it was interesting that Senator O'Kennedy went on to talk about the wonderful work done by the Catholic Marriage Advisory Council throughout the country and I am glad he mentioned that.  He omitted to mention that in 1994 I more than doubled the money to CMAC for counselling to enable it to do its work &mdash; supporting marriages in difficulty &mdash; and that I inserted in this year's Estimate a similar amount of £1 million and an appreciable sum for family mediation also. However, when the Government fell last November and an interregnum Fianna Fáil Government took over, the party to which Senator O'Kennedy and Senator Farrell belong, the acting Minister for Equality and Law Reform &mdash; I apologise to Senator McGennis, but the truth must be told&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;came into the Department and slashed by half the Estimate which I included for counselling and mediation.  Happily, on resuming office in that Department, I fully restored the original Estimate, that is, the sum for marriage counselling, which remains for this year and was adopted in the budget as the Estimate for my Department for 1995.  That is an <Col N="1944" /> indication of the regard this Government has for the institution of marriage and an indication in practical terms of the support of this Government for the institution of marriage.  Nobody should accuse it, least of all the Fianna Fáil Party after what it did to the Estimate, of being in any way short in giving support where needed to the institution of marriage.</P>
      <P>Having said that, this Government recognises that when, tragically, marriages break down, we cannot bury our heads in the sand and pretend it has not happened.  It is all very well for Senator Farrell to harp back to the circumstances which pertained 20 or 30 years ago.  I remember that time well, and perhaps to a large extent he may be seeing the events of that period through rose tinted spectacles.  It was not quite the rosy spectacle he paints.  However, whether it was or not, we must deal with the situation as we find it, do our best to assist people and to meet the needs of the situation as it faces us now.</P>
      <P>I thank all Senators who contributed to this interesting debate.  I appreciate the welcome for the legislation and I was heartened by the response of the many Senators who contributed.  I am glad to know there is broad consensus in the House on the measures contained in the Bill.  I welcome Senator McGennis's contribution and I agree with most of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is committed to a caring society and a system of laws which deal comprehensively with marriage breakdown.  I believe that what is proposed in this Bill is clear evidence of the Government's commitment in that regard.  I would like to deal with a number of issues which have been raised by Senators in the course of the debate. Senators McGennis and Henry welcomed the inclusion of the revisions relating to pensions.  The pensions provisions in the Bill were subject to extensive and full discussion with the pension industry and the pensions board and I thank them for their help in that regard. During the course of the Bill's progress it was fine-tuned and that would not <Col N="1945" /> have been possible without their help. Much of that help was given on a voluntary basis from people who specialise in this complex area.  As I said at the outset, discussions are ongoing with the pensions industry and I will bring forward some further amendment in this area on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Provisions in the Bill to raise the age of marriage from 16 to 18 years and requiring persons intending to marry to give three months' notice were warmly received by most Senators.  The notice requirement reflects the belief that marriage is an institution of the greatest importance which should not be entered into lightly.  In the UK, for example, when one signs on to buy a Hoover on hire purchase, there is a cooling off period. We should not regard marriage as less important than the purchase of a Hoover.  A time for reflection and consideration is necessary before marriage. A period of reflection is required. Senators will know that the question of notice of marriage was addressed in the White Paper on Marital Breakdown, which concluded that the balance of arguments favoured a minimum waiting period before marriage.  The provision in the Bill is in line with the three months waiting period recommended by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marital Breakdown.</P>
    <P>The referendum on divorce was referred to during the debate.  The White Paper on Marital Breakdown has helped to focus attention on the various options for amendment to the Constitution and it sets out details of possible divorce legislation, including the substantial powers which the court would have to make orders in support of dependent spouses and children.  The paper sought views from interested groups and individuals and the wide range of submissions received are being taken into account in the context of finalising the proposals.  I can assure Senators that all aspects of divorce are being examined, not only in my Department but in the other Departments which are also involved.  The Government intends to deal with these matters <Col N="1946" /> as comprehensively as possible in the lead up to the referendum and to face up to all the issues in a considered and responsible manner.</P>
    <P>The definitive proposals of the Government for an amendment to the Constitution on divorce will, of course, be in the form of a Bill since a precondition of the holding of any referendum is the initiation of a Bill.  It is the Government's intention to proceed with the necessary legislative framework as quickly as possible with a view to holding the referendum this year.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate the question was raised about the type of orders at present made by the court on property of separated spouses.  Senators may be aware that in 1992 the White Paper on Marital Breakdown included statistics on the operation of the property adjustment order provisions of the 1989 Act.  The general practice of the courts in applying the property provisions in the Act has been to give both spouses an equal share in the family home or the proceedings from its sale.  I can confirm that the court, in making property orders relating to the sale of the family home, is still most likely to order that the net proceeds of sale be split evenly between the parties.  Also where an order is made transferring legal title from one spouse to another or giving residency of the family home to one spouse &mdash; usually a mother with dependent children &mdash; to the exclusion of the other spouse, it is usually the case that a declaration is made by the court at the time of making such an order that each spouse will have beneficial ownership in the home on an equal basis.</P>
    <P>Statistics indicate that where decrees of judicial separation are granted, court orders relating to property are made in respect of almost 75 per cent of those decrees.  The orders include property transfer orders, orders for residence in the family home, property settlement orders and orders for sale of the family home.  These statistics indicate the continuing importance of the property transfer provisions in the context of separation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1947" /> Senator Honan referred to the Matrimonial Home Bill.  As Senators will know, I was the Minister who advanced that Bill and brought it forward and it was my wish to see it enacted into law. That Bill had laid on the stocks of previous Departments for 13 years before I brought it forward with the unanimous support of all Members of the Dáil and Seanad.  It lay there abandoned and neglected by many Governments, including the Government of which Senator Honan's party was a member for three and a half years.  I do not accept criticism in that regard.  I regret that this Bill was found to be unconstitutional, but I have to accept that.  There is little point in asking me what I intend to do about that.  That is the constitutional position, but at least I tried to deal with that situation. It is right, appropriate and proper that a woman working in the home, whether it is experiencing marital breakdown or not, should, as of right, be entitled to an equal share in the family home and its contents, which is why I devoted much of my own and my Department's energy to bringing that legislation forward.  Unfortunately, we were not able to achieve that position.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I would emphasise that the Matrimonial Home Bill was applicable to situations not of marital breakdown but of marital harmony.  In a marital breakdown situation, as Senators know, it is the position that all the property of the marriage, including the matrimonial home, its contents, the family business, farm, pensions, bank and building society accounts, stock on the land and other aspects of family property are on the table for division in the fairest possible manner between both spouses.  That is currently the position under the Judicial Separation Act and this Bill and that will stay the position, irrespective of whether the people vote to introduce divorce.  In many cases courts order the transfer of the matrimonial home &mdash; I have been involved in many such cases &mdash; in its entirety into the name of the wife, never mind only on a joint and equal basis, which I agree <Col N="1948" /> is more the norm.  However, in some cases the courts consider it appropriate for one spouse, usually the wife, to be given the entire matrimonial home and that is done on occasions.</P>
    <P>I refer briefly to the important new text provisions which have been included in this Bill.  These measures were included in the passage of the Bill through the Dáil.  The areas of the tax code to which these provisions relate are stamp duty, capital acquisitions tax, capital gains tax and probate tax.  The main effect of these provisions is to extend the property tax exemptions which currently apply in financial and property dealings between married couples to those cases covered by the Bill where foreign divorces are recognised here.  These provisions will ensure that couples who are divorced abroad will not be at a disadvantage in terms of our tax code.  The added significance of these tax provisions, however, is that they will, in substance, be the same as those in any future divorce legislation that may apply for domestic divorce if people vote to introduce it.</P>
    <P>Provision is being made to exempt from stamp duty the transfer of property which is the subject of an order under the Bill between spouses whose marriages have been dissolved abroad and where the decree of divorce is recognised in this State and the order provides for the transfer of property. There are already similar provisions in the law for spouses who have been separated. The effect of the Bill is also that instruments of transfer do not have to be adjudicated on by the Revenue Commissioners, thereby minimising the costs involved.</P>
    <P>I have to refer to Senator O'Kennedy's comments on foreign divorces and orders being made consequent on that, which I found rather puzzling and strange.  I do not think the Senator really understands the Bill.  It is the position in Irish law at present that certain foreign decrees of divorce are recognised by the State and there are many such cases.  This Bill provides that in such a circumstance a dependent <Col N="1949" /> spouse, or former spouse, who is resident in this State may go to our courts to seek to have a relief order made for their support and/or for the support of their children of that marriage.  Is Senator O'Kennedy suggesting that we should not provide in such circumstances for a dependent spouse or children of that former marriage?  I do not think the Senator fully understands what that provision of the Bill is directed towards.</P>
    <P>It was mentioned in the course of the debate that there is little point in bringing forward legislative proposals in the area of family law if in the final analysis adequate resources were not provided. I am conscious of the importance of providing improved access to justice through the legal aid scheme.  To this end I succeeded in increasing Exchequer funding for 1993 immediately on taking over responsibility for the Legal Aid Board.  In addition, in 1994 I secured £5 million and this year I succeeded in obtaining £6.2 million as grant-in-aid for the Legal Aid Board for 1994.  This compares with a provision of only £2.7 million in 1992.  An increase of this magnitude has never been matched since the legal aid scheme was initiated. I do not want to embarrass Senator McGennis any further by referring to the depredations on the Estimate of my Department for legal aid at the turn of this year and I will refrain from doing so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">

      <P>I wish to inform Senators &mdash; I know they will be pleased to hear this &mdash; that waiting lists in law centres have been significantly reduced.  I am confident that the developments which have taken place and those which are planned for the coming year &mdash; I hope to open some new law centres &mdash; will have a major impact in reducing further the waiting period in the existing law centres.  My hope is that lengthy waiting lists, which have already been reduced significantly, will be a thing of the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1950" /> Senator Honan called for more expenditure on legal aid, counselling and the courts and for more judges and court support staff.  These are good objectives, but I remind her that these items of expenditure are referred to in other circles as State spending.  I have often heard it said that the State is a big spender and that spending by it keeps increasing.  These items are part of State spending, are important and this Government supports them.  Other Senators and parties who criticise State spending should bear in mind the sort of things on which these moneys are spent.</P>
    <P>Senators touched on several other matters which are part of the Government's programme and fall outside the direct application of this Bill.  I already referred to legal aid.  Over £1 million is provided this year for the development and improvement of the family mediation service and the counselling services generally.  It is my intention to facilitate the continued development of those services.  With regard to family courts, the Minister for Justice intends to bring forward proposals for improvements in the way with which family law cases are dealt.</P>
    <P>In my introduction to the debate I stated that the Minister for Social Welfare will introduce specific legislation to deal with certain social welfare matters raised by provisions in the Family Law Bill.  This will be aimed at ensuring that no spouse will be disadvantaged in terms of his or her social welfare entitlements as a result of his or her legal status being changed from married, separated or deserted to divorced.  This is a very important difference in the position which will pertain in 1995 compared to the time of the divorce referendum in 1986.  Likewise the taxation measures included in this Bill were, unfortunately, not before the people in 1986.</P>
    <P>This Bill is an important part of the Government's programme of family law reform.  The individual measures in that programme, administrative and legislative, are important social initiatives in their own right, apart from the question <Col N="1951" /> of divorce.  They should also be seen as part of an integrated approach aimed at strengthening the institution of marriage while at the same time addressing the consequences of marriage breakdown and improving access to the law for persons affected.</P>
    <P>Senator Gallagher and other Senators referred to the <i>in camera</i> system which applies at present in the hearing of family law cases.  I am glad they did because a speech I made recently opened up that subject for debate and discussion.  I am glad that challenge is being taken up. We have to look at this again very carefully. There are considerations from two angles.  It would be highly advantageous if a body of precedence, practice and conformity between the various courts hearing these cases up and down the country was arrived at and this cannot be done as long as they are heard <i>in camera.</i>  Even if they were opened up, it is true that names would and could not be mentioned.  There is still the fear that, perhaps in some rural areas at least, the particular circumstances of a particular family might be known and identifiable as a result of a description being given in a newspaper of a particular case.  This is a worry and concern. It may not be adequate and we should discuss it.</P>
    <P>I was pleased that Senators raised this and I look forward to ongoing debate on it.  If the feeling is that this should be done, I am prepared to seriously consider lifting that ban on reporting in family law cases, to a limited extent at any rate.  I thank Senators for their contributions to what has been a valuable and informed debate and I look forward to discussing the Bill further with them on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and hope that he makes as big an impact in his present Ministry as he did in his last one.</P>
      <P>The primary function of agriculture in Europe in the past has been mainly directed towards providing food to sustain a growing population.  The position has now changed radically with agriculture possessing the capacity to produce food greatly in excess of demand.  Consequently, a number of measures, including set-aside land, have been introduced to curtail food production in the EU.  This has accelerated research to utilise land, particularly set-aside land for growing crops which can be used to produce non-food products, including biofuels which can replace imported fossil types.  Consequently, in order to utilise the land and associated human resources no longer required in the production of raw materials for food, new uses must be found if the economic and social balance of rural areas is to be maintained.  Alternative outlets for farm crops such as cereals, sugar beet and fodder beet, grass and fibre crops are urgently needed.</P>
      <P>Future growth in the agricultural industry will largely depend on the development of non-food farming and it is suggested that in the right economic circumstances many jobs could be created and substantial amounts of land currently set-aside could be used to supply feedstocks for a range of industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1953" /> Using biomass, including conventional agricultural crops, as energy sources is now under intensive investigation. Some biomass can be used as fuel without modification.  This is largely confined to the burning of materials such as wood or straw for direct heat or as feedstock for producing electricity. While such uses will undoubtedly be of considerable importance in the future, liquid biofuels offer more immediate prospects.</P>
    <P>The use of biofuels is now actively promoted by the European Commission. An upper limit of 10 per cent tax on biofuels is recommended for EU member states.  A recent Commission proposal suggested that biofuels should constitute 5 per cent of the EU's total transport fuel by the year 2000.  This would absorb the production of approximately six million hectares.  It is essential that procedures are now put in place by this Government so that Ireland will be in a position to capitalise on this new opportunity.  Already extensive demonstration projects on using plant oils, mainly rapeseed oil, as fuels are in place in France, Germany and Italy.</P>
    <P>A number of industrial plants to produce esterified oil &mdash; rapeseed methyl ester or RME &mdash; are in operation or under construction in France and Germany.  Esterified oil is mainly used in blends with diesel oil to power urban/city transport vehicles.  Projects are supported by national Governments together with city and town councils.  I am also delighted that Teagasc's Oak Park research centre in Carlow has led the way in this country in this whole area and has demonstrated the possibility of using such biofuels in buses, farm vehicles and boats.  Liquid biofuels can be produced from a wide range of biomass feedstocks.  They may be used alone or in mixtures with fossil fuels. The two biofuels most developed to date are ethanol and plant oils.</P>
    <P>Bioethanol can be produced from a wide range of crops, particularly those which contain high levels of sugar or <Col N="1954" /> starch.  In Brazil ethanol for fuel is produced from sugar cane and in the USA from maize.  In Ireland sugar beet, fodder beet, cereals and potatoes are the most likely of the currently grown crops. Production of ethanol from cereals is well established in the brewing industries.</P>
    <P>Starch from potatoes is also commonly used for ethanol production in continental Europe.  While the technology to produce ethanol from cereals, and to a lesser extent sugar beet/fodder, is well known there is a need to further examine their potential in light of new developments and more enlightened EU policies towards renewable fuels.  Production of the feedstock raw materials would present no technical difficulties in this country.  The existing sugar processing and malting industries should be capable of producing fuel alcohol without excessive capital investment.</P>
    <P>Ethanol alone or in a petroleum mix is a well proven fuel.  Ethanol could be used as an octane enhancer in Irish petroleum based fuels with considerable environmental advantage.  Exemption from tax, plus lower priced cereals and other crops &mdash; as emerged in CAP proposals &mdash; together with other appropriate measures could make this economically attractive.  The economic production of bioethanol in Ireland would, of course, require a political decision to waive the excise duty involved and/or an EU policy decision that ethanol should be used as an octane booster in petrol.</P>
    <P>In recent years several significant developments have taken place which have rekindled interest in oil seed rape as a biodiesel fuel:</P>
    <P>(i) development of engines which can burn unrefined rape seed oil; (ii) development of a new process to allow RSO to be burned in most conventional diesel engines; (iii) increasing concern about atmospheric pollution &mdash; the urban traffic problem and the more widespread concern about atmospheric CO2 levels; (iv) uncertainly about mineral fuel supplies <Col N="1955" /> in the long term; (v) overproduction of crops for food use with a consequent increased interest in non-food uses of traditional and novel crops; (vi) CAP reform proposals encompassing land set-aside.</P>
    <P>Cold pressed and esterified rape oils are now under commercial type demonstration tests in a number of EU countries, particularly France, Germany and Italy.  Commercialisation is also at an advanced stage in Austria.  The high cost of biodiesel relative to fossil fuels has been the main constraint to expanding its use to date.  This could alter greatly if the carbon tax proposals come into effect in the EU.  Exemption of biofuels from present fuel taxes by Governments would also be a critical factor.  Policy in this direction has already been implemented in France.</P>
    <P>I am proposing that the present Government puts in place procedures which would de-excise bioderived fuels, taking into account the greater environmental and economic good which would accrue from such a measure.  It is now possible under the reformed CAP to use set-aside land to grow crops for non-food use and this should also have a positive impact especially if the excise difficulty is tackled.</P>
    <P>Because of its low pollutant potential relative to diesel, biodiesel could have major benefit in cities with high traffic density and in environmentally sensitive areas.  Dublin buses, for example, could use biodiesel with consequent environmental benefit.  Vegetable based fuel oil could be used in motor powered boats and cruisers.</P>
    <P>Production and use of liquid biofuels in Ireland would have the following advantages.  It would afford the opportunity for additional use of land, including set-aside, and reduce dependency on imported fossil fuels.  It would improve the environment, reduce CO2 emissions at local, regional and global levels and reduce sulphur containing derivatives.  It reduces non-combustible hydrocarbons, the risk of water/soil contamination &mdash;<Col N="1956" /> which is harmful to plant and animal life &mdash; and provides a clean extraction/ processing operation.  It would improve the trade balance and afford additional employment opportunity in production, processing and distribution.  It would mean additional income for farmers growing oil seed rape, additional activity in the crop production supplies sector, additional personnel in the construction and operation of processing plants and additional personnel in the transport of raw materials and end products.</P>
    <P>As well as this being highly desirable, there is also an urgency in this important area because when GATT negotiations were being finalised the Blair House Agreement limited the area of oil seed that can be produced for biodiesel use to about 850,000 hectares. I believe that France and Germany produced in excess of 120,000 hectares in 1994 alone.  Italy also has a substantial area and what concerns me is that, at this rate, the total area will be taken up quickly.  If the Government does not become involved immediately to copperfasten an allocation for the country we might lose this opportunity forever. I am, therefore, requesting the Minister to take whatever action is needed to maximise Ireland's potential in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  I will deal with a slightly different aspect of bioenergy.  The challenge that faces us at the end of the 20th century is how the limited resources of this planet may be used to support a population of 5.4 billion people without using up all of those resources to the detriment of future generations.  We must realise that the fossil fuels we now predominantly use are finite and cannot be replenished at the rate they are being consumed. Environmentalists agree there are three interconnected and interrelated problems that the world faces: growth of population, energy consumption and disposal of waste.  Since 1900 world consumption of primary energy has risen from 600 million tonnes of oil to 8.2 <Col N="1957" /> billion tonnes in 1990.  In the developed world ever increasing quantities of waste are being generated.  It must remembered that there is no convenient global rubbish bin.  Whatever we waste we keep with us on this planet.</P>
      <P>The agricultural, industrial and domestic sectors produce a wide variety of organic waste.  In the natural environment organic waste is decomposed and easily recycled into the biosystem. Difficulties arise from the concentration of waste production, be it in towns and cities or large animal intensive farms. The question we must face is how we can utilise this production of waste to our advantage.  Micro-organisms can be harnessed to treat large quantities of waste and recycle these wastes into useful products.  This can be done aerobically or anaerobically.  The difference is that aerobically the energy from the waste is released as free energy, anaerobic bacteria convert organic material, in the absence of oxygen, to a mixture of gaseous products, principally methane CH4 and CO2.  In this way the energy contained in waste products can be converted to more accessible and useful forms.</P>
      <P>Agriculture can be used as a form of energy production.  The concentration of pig production has grown from large, widely spread units to a concentration of huge units.  In the Loughsheelin area in 1968 there were 68 units and over 9,000 pig-finishing places; in 1982 the number of units had decreased to 45 but the number of places had increased to 39,000.  When one considers that one pig produces as much waste as four people that presents a major problem.  Yet this effluent can and is being used in anaerobic digester units to harness this waste &mdash; which would be a problem &mdash; into biogas which is then used to run farm machinery and heat farm pig units.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, at the Bethehern Abbey Farm, Portglenone in Northern Ireland there is a 210 cubic metre digester tank which treats the waste from 300 beef cattle, a 20,000 chicken unit and the silage effluent from 2,000 tonnes of silage. The biogas is used to heat the monastery <Col N="1958" /> and the grain drying unit.  The liquid effluent &mdash; which is high in nitrogen &mdash; is used as a fertiliser and the solids, having been heat-treated to rid them of pathogens, are then used as compost.  One can have then, within the farm unit, a complete energy cycle that uses waste products to run machinery, heat the house and the farm production units.</P>
    <P>This anaerobic digester system can also be used in urban areas to treat municipal sewage waste.  In Denmark near the town of Odense the sewage plant produces not only enough bioenergy to fuel the plant itself and supply its energy requirements but provides energy for a housing district in the locality.  In Tullamore the 300 cubic metre continuous system produced almost enough energy to satisfy the plant's overall requirements.  I feel more can be done in Ireland to deal with the twin problems of waste disposal and the need to rid ourselves of our over-dependence on fossil fuels as a source of energy.</P>
    <P>The Limerick County Enterprise Board is currently promoting the extraction of gases from the county's old landfill sites as a means of alternative energy.  When one considers that a tonne of municipal sewage waste can yield between 60 and 90 cubic metres of biogas and 390 kilograms of compost one can see that usage of a source &mdash; which is there and otherwise giving us a problem &mdash; is something we should encourage.  Pilot projects are in use in other parts of Ireland, for example, North Kerry Products, Carberry Milk Products and Pfizers Chemical Corporation are all using this system to combine the elimination of waste from their plants with the production of energy. The harnessing of waste to produce energy helps solve two problems: how to have energy and how to dispose of waste.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the motion and support the concept, on this very windy evening, when much energy will be expended elsewhere in the city at a <Col N="1959" /> very famous sporting event.  I welcome the Minister to the House and I congratulate him on his reappointment.  It is nice that the midlands got a Minister of State.</P>
      <P>The demand for energy in the next ten to 20 years will greatly outstrip the capacity of existing resources and may pose a serious threat to the environment. The Government motion to introduce a progressive energy policy is timely and this debate affords us an opportunity to express our views on this important matter.  We must take a fresh look at our energy policies and the Government must clearly spell out its intentions on these issues which are important and relevant to the people.  It must not be deterred from dealing with these issues because of an ideological attitude, especially among our friends in the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>Conservation is important for the future of our country.  There is widespread and unnecessary waste of energy resources and millions of pounds could be saved by the introduction of an energy conservation policy.  Business and private consumers know that electricity is wasted, and this could be avoided.  Advice and initiatives are invaluable in the energy conservation drive and this could make a large contribution to the elimination of electricity waste.  Electricity is wasted in our homes and businesses.  Everyone who uses electricity, whether in motors or for light, knows how much we rely on it. This is brought home to us in a special way when there is a power failure.  We even rely on electricity in this distinguished building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the development of alternative energy, the work done by the Government and the ESB to date has been disappointing.  Since the building of Ardnacrusha in 1929 little work has been done on the generation of electricity from water resources, apart from Turlough Hill.  Lough Derg and the mountains around the lake offer great opportunities for the construction of pump storage facilities, similar to those <Col N="1960" /> at Turlough Hill.  There is enough water at present to generate electricity. However, the ESB has adopted a policy of using imported coal at Moneypoint and imported oil at Tarbert.  I live in the midlands and the lake district where there are enormous opportunities to use the same ideas as those used in the Wicklow mountains.  While I have no objection to these projects, which are welcome in those areas, they are based on expensive imported products, and this is brought home to us during an oil crisis.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is aware of the great national resource in the peatlands of the midland counties of Kildare, Laois, Offaly, Meath, Westmeath, Longford, Roscommon, Cavan and Carlow and of how important this area and peat and its products are to us.  We await the announcement of the power station in the midlands and we know the Minister will not be found wanting in bringing this to a successful conclusion.  I need not tell the Minister how important this is for the villages of Carbury and Rochfortbridge which were built as a result of the employment provided in these peatlands.  We are the proud representatives of the people who sent us here. Perhaps the Minister could tell us if progress is being made in relation to this power station.</P>
    <P>As an island we have a great opportunity to develop electricity from wind and wave power.  The waves off the west coast must be our most valuable resource but we are not using it to its full potential.  Small projects based on wave power would provide energy for cities, such as Galway or Cork, or small towns.  Research would have to be carried out to make this a viable proposition but it would be cost effective.</P>
    <P>I concur with the previous speakers and I can identify with them because I also come from rural Ireland.  I agree with the suggestions put forward for the Minister's approval.  A distinguished father of this House and a holder of the Offices of Cathaoirleach and Leas-Chathaoirleach piloted a project for the past number of years where his motor <Col N="1961" /> car &mdash; the Lord Mayor of Dublin has a similar car &mdash; is run on oil grown from the products of set aside land.  This could be used to keep imports down.</P>
    <P>The amount of money spent to pay for oil to run motor cars in this country must be enormous.  If one considers the increase in motor transport during the next ten or 20 years, it is mind boggling to think what could be saved if the use of this alternative fuel was encouraged. I am not familiar with the agricultural community, although I married a person from it, but enormous wealth is generated in this area.  The former Senator from Laoighis-Offaly had his motor car on the most popular television show on RTE 1 a few months ago.  I wish that project luck.</P>
    <P>I concur with references made about the waste of energy at Lough Sheelin in the parish of Castlepollard, Castletown and Finnea.  This is in the heart of pig fattening country which gives reasonable employment.  Resources were wasted there until the former Tánaiste, Mr. John Wilson, used a dredging unit on that lake and brought it back to its former glory.  An enormous amount of energy could be used from pig production. The Minister faces a great challenge in this area and there are marvellous opportunities for him to make his mark here.</P>
    <P>How many times have we heard the name of the late Donogh O'Malley mentioned in both Houses and in every cumann and club throughout the country? He made his mark in education. Surely here is an opportunity for a distinguished Member, the Minister for State, Deputy Stagg, to pioneer a change in imports.  We pay for oil while we have great natural resources, and many suggestions have been made in this debate alone.</P>
    <P>This motion has been put down by the Labour Party.  Fianna Fáil concurs with it but we do not want it placed on the agenda if nothing happens afterwards. I suggest to our friends in Government of all persuasions that we have another discussion on this matter in 12 months, to see what the Minister <Col N="1962" /> and his Department have done to achieve these aims and what support we can give them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Forgive me if I am slightly puzzled by the tone of this debate because I am always slightly suspicious when I find all sides in agreement on a motion.  As discussed so far this is a motion on which we can all agree.  We are all in favour of fresh air, a clean environment and what is called here &ldquo;energy conservation and the production of energy from renewable sources&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know we do not conserve enough energy and some of the statistics bandied about this House this evening are not only true but staggering.  It is fairly easy for a Government to remedy these statistics with an education programme. Ms Sue Scott of the ESRI, an expert on domestic energy, said two months ago that fewer than 60 per cent of Irish homes have a lagging jacket, even though there is a return on that payment in a short period.  She also said more than 60 per cent had attic insulation, which has a payback period of three to four years.  In other words, we do not know anything about energy conservation but we agree it is a good thing, <Col N="1963" /> which is half of this evening's motion. No one has said anything on that topic with which anyone will disagree.  It is so obvious it is almost bland.</P>
    <P>While we have concentrated on that part of the motion so far, the energy policy in <i>A Government of Renewal</i> can be supported by us all, as far as it goes. However, it does not recognise we are facing an energy crisis because the two great energy providers, Bord na Móna and the ESB, are in a critical position.  I would like to hear from the Minister not just what he will do for renewable energy causes or how much he will do to encourage people to conserve energy but what he intends to do about these bodies which will implement and effect his policy.</P>
    <P>As the Minister knows there is an EU competition directive on the way which will mean dramatic changes.  The ESB has been crying out for a price rise, which has been denied since 1986 &mdash; probably for good reasons &mdash; but it cannot continue to operate unless it is allowed to do so on a commercial basis. In the future a lot of energy will be generated from abroad and imported.  The ESB will be subject to open competition whether we like it or not.  A clear policy on this must be pronounced by the Government in the near future.</P>
    <P>In July 1994 the ESB itself produced a document, <i>ESB in Transition;</i> it is a <i>cri de coeur</i> to the last Government which applies to this one also.  From the point of view of this great provider of energy the position is totally unsatisfactory and alarming.  In the few minutes I have I will concentrate on the relationship between the ESB and Bord na Móna and how the Government intends to resolve it.  This is not an easy problem because the relationship is almost incestuous and the bodies and successive Governments have been unable to resolve it.  The problem is that the relationship is totally artificial and cannot be sustained in a competitive environment. I hope to hear the Minister say what he intends to do in this case.</P>
    <P>The document states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1964" /> Neither peat-fired electricity nor alternative energy sources can compete with conventional fossil fuels in their present state of development.  If Government policy decrees their use [&ldquo;decrees&rdquo; is a strong word, &ldquo;dictates&rdquo; could have been used &mdash; in other words, if the ESB is forced to use peat-fired electricity], they must be allowed to operate outside the free market environment, with the extra costs of the power they generate shared fairly among <i>all</i> electricity users.</P>
    <P>To my simple mind that means peat-fired electricity is no longer economic and is uncompetitive and if the Government insists or decrees the ESB must use it, then we must acknowledge it is operating outside the free market.  That is the ESB's point of view.  It is a strong point of view and no doubt the Minister will be able to contradict it but it has been expressed by a semi-State body which is not lacking in guilt on uncompetitive practices in the past.</P>
    <P>The document goes on to state, under the heading &ldquo;Use of Peat&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>Government policy requires the use of milled peat for electricity generation with a view to maintaining a native fuel contribution to long term electricity production while utilising the resource as efficiently and economically as possible.  Peat is very significant to the economy of the midlands [which is exactly what Senator Cassidy said].</P>
    <P>For a variety of reasons, however, relating to the nature of the fuel, the high cost of energy conversion and the capital structure of Bord na Móna itself, electricity produced by existing stations is expensive.  These stations are run as base load plants even though the electricity output is dearer than from other sources.  This cost is passed on to the electricity customer and represents about 5 per cent of the electricity bill as present.</P>
    <P>In an industry where generation competition will be a major factor, the additional costs associated with continued or expanded use of milled peat will have to be clearly and transparently <Col N="1965" /> identified and charged as a cost on all electricity users irrespective of the source of production.  Similar provisions for local fuels already exist in the UK and Germany.  [In other words if we are going to have this type of electricity, the costs must be transparent so that we are aware of them.]  Given the inevitable decline in milled peat usage as ageing plants close, a proposal to build new milled peat capacity in line with stated Government policy is under discussion. The price of power from such plant is unlikely to be competitive with alternative production costs.</P>
    <P>They are saying that we can, if we wish, use peat to generate electricity and we can force the ESB to do so but it will be working in an uncompetitive environment. The ESB, in thinly coded language, is saying to the Government that this is unacceptable but it cannot do anything about it.</P>
    <P>We must look at not only the ESB but Bord na Móna.  The twin energy providers of this nation are in a state of bankruptcy.  They are both bust.  They have Government loans and net deficits that are unsustainable.  Recently the Minister apparently has let it be known that the huge debt of Bord na Móna is to be moved off the balance sheet of Bord na Móna to the NTMA.  Perhaps we could be enlightened about this. That is not the right way to run an energy policy: to signal to the ESB and to Bord na Móna &mdash; Bord na Móna's debt is £170 million &mdash; that such debts can be incurred with a faulty energy policy and can then be removed from the balance sheet.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and the debate on this motion.  It is important to remember that the need to find renewable sources of energy is not just an Irish problem.  It is an international problem and I wish to discuss it from that point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cases made by Senator Townsend for crop growing as a source of energy and by Senator Kelly for the use of biogas have been ably made.  However, there are other sources of renewable energy in this country which we could <Col N="1966" /> investigate.  Senator Ross has just pointed out how uneconomic are some of the sources we are using at present. Perhaps the economy of some alternative methods might be more competitive in this country than in others.</P>
    <P>In the Seanad I have often tried to press the point that this country with its well educated &mdash; particularly with the introduction of free third level education &mdash; graduates should put more time and energy into research and development.  We should try to become the centre for research and development into renewable sources of energy within the European Union and try to secure support and funding for that from other countries in the Union.  We have the personnel.  We have excellent engineering graduates, chemists, physicists and back-up personnel from the regional technical colleges so we would have no shortage of well qualified technical personnel to do such research.</P>
    <P>In many cases we will find that we have the raw materials.  Senator Townsend pointed out that land in set-aside can be used for the production of rape seed and so forth.  Senator Kelly is quite right in saying that there is plenty of methane gas produced here while Senator Cassidy mentioned areas where it could be produced.  As far as I know, only 15 per cent of the gas produced by both landfills and slurry has been garnered for productive use.  Surely we could do research in these areas so that more could be produced.</P>
    <P>If we have one raw material it is wind. While there is a wind farm and research centre in County Mayo there is an enormous amount of research to be done.  It is well known that 100 windmills do not produce the same amount of power as one windmill multiplied by 100 because they interfere with each other. However, surely there is the possibility of researching what size units would constitute maximum benefit units and so forth.  We could also investigate if they are only applicable for small towns or for just one farm.</P>
    <P>Tidal energy has been looked at in the past but because of the salt in the sea there have been great difficulties. Sometimes I wonder if this has not been <Col N="1967" /> rubbished by vested interests.  New alloys, plastics and coatings for machinery are produced every day.  I have heard distinguished people in the energy sector say that there is great scope for further research and development in this area.  With all countries becoming more interested in the global decrease in the availability of fossil fuels it is an area worth investigating.</P>
    <P>Solar energy is being utilised.  Look at the new civic offices which use solar energy.  Perhaps we should look at what is the maximum efficiency unit for various constructions bearing in mind that while we have plenty of cloud cover we also, for much of the year, have very long days so that one can make up for what is lost as a result of cloud cover.</P>
    <P>These are other areas worthy of research.  Geothermal energy is being used in Temple Bar.  We have tremendous ground water at a temperature of between 13 to 15 degrees Centigrade all the time.  It has been there for hundreds or thousands of years and it has the advantage over other sources I have mentioned in that it is a constant source of energy.</P>
    <P>Senator Cassidy mentioned Turlough Hill and the damming of rivers.  That suggestion appears to have gone out of fashion but perhaps it should be looked at again particularly when one looks at the economy of scale in the fossil fuel plants we are using at present.</P>
    <P>These sources can be looked at from a research and development point of view with this country acting as the European Union centre for such activities. In addition, recognising that many of the sources are intermittent, we could look at the serious criticism levelled at them, for example, the problem of slotting them into the national electricity or gas grids.  We could investigate what size units they could supply, etc.  Having the personnel for such research and having the raw materials readily available, perhaps we should try to put forward a comprehensive project on the investigation of alternative sources of renewable energy to the European Union.  We might be surprised at the support we could get from other countries which do <Col N="1968" /> not have these resources so readily available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an honour and privilege for me to address this motion this evening and I commend the Senators who proposed it for affording me the opportunity to do so.</P>
      <P>While debate in the Oireachtas since the formation of the <i>Government of Renewal</i> has focused primarily on overall policy issues &mdash; with the emphasis of late on its fiscal and economic policies &mdash; it is timely that the Legislature should now focus attention on the pillars on which overall Government policy is constructed.  One such crucial pillar is in the energy area and, in particular, in the energy conservation and renewables sphere.  While the two areas are inextricably interwoven, for the sake of clarity I propose to cover them separately.  However, first let me set out Government policy objectives in these areas as enunciated in the policy agreement <i>A Government of Renewal.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That policy agreement recognises the economic as well as the environmental case for energy conservation.  It subscribes to the belief that progress must be made in this area through a combination of incentive and charges.  To this end the following objectives are set: to contribute to the preparation of a pan-European taxation policy on carbon and fossil fuel inputs, commonly known as carbon tax; to implement a national energy conservation programme for local authority housing and the homes of those living on low incomes; the provision of advice and support for improved energy use in business, including an examination of extending the BES to those companies which would install energy saving technologies; the strengthening of the policy making function of the Department of Energy in order to oversee a coherent national energy policy guiding the activities of the State energy utilities &mdash; the ESB, BGE, Bord na Móna and INPC; the setting of targets for electricity generation from renewable sources and removing any remaining obstacles such as the lack <Col N="1969" /> of proper pricing and adequate incentives to their integration with the national grid.  These overall objectives encapsulate a few objectives in this area and are, in essence, the major points of reference <i>en route</i> to policy ends.</P>
    <P>The thesis underlying these objectives is fairly straightforward.  The message is that energy efficiency and conservation matters to all of us.  By using energy wisely we can reduce cost, improve the environment and create jobs in the country, all without sacrificing comfort. Energy wasted is money wasted is opportunity foregone.</P>
    <P>Energy is an unavoidable requirement for activity in all sectors of the economy.  In a country such as Ireland, where economic development is incomplete, there is an increasing demand for energy.  It is therefore critical, from both an environmental and economic perspective, to ensure that such demand is moderated and efficiency maximised. This can be achieved by raising awareness of the importance of energy efficiency and by ensuring efficient and rational use.  Ensuring that energy is consumed as efficiently as possible is one of the three primary objectives of Irish energy policy.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, surveys in a number of sectors over the past number of years have confirmed the potential to save up to 20 per cent of current energy consumption and, at present, that 20 per cent final cost to the consumer is the unbelievable figure of £2,500 million per year.  That is the saving that could be achieved according to the surveys which have been carried out on a 20 per cent reduction of present use, by the effective use of that energy.  Government programmes in recent years have increased awareness, but it is recognised that an enhanced and concentrated effort in that regard is now needed.  The promotion of energy conservation is therefore identified as a high priority for the Government.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, many ways in which one can look at the cost of energy conservation.  These varying views, such as the macroeconomics' view, the environmental view and the social view, place different demands on Government. <Col N="1970" /> It is a function of Government to adjudicate on the various competing and conflicting demands and to chart a balanced and reasoned policy response. That policy response must reduce energy consumption, improve the environment, enhance industrial competitiveness, contribute to employment, respond to EU policy, demonstrate benefits of energy conservation and increase the awareness of energy efficiency.</P>
    <P>The Economic Infrastructure Operational Programme sets out clearly what we hope to achieve in the energy conservation and renewable areas up to the end of the century.  I am happy to say that we have already begun to see results.  The highlight of the energy conservation element of the programme is the establishment of an Irish Energy Centre.  The driving force behind the establishment of the centre is the need to give a renewed impetus to the energy conservation area.  Policy in this area has tended down the years to be reactive rather than proactive.  That is not to denigrate the very valuable work done in the past, especially when most needed at times of energy crises.</P>
    <P>Maintaining an energy conservation presence has now paid dividends on two fronts especially: a body of expertise has been built up and will be quick to deliver on the new programme initiatives and real resources have been allocated to the sector for the period of the Operational Programme 1994-99.  A total of £36 million is being made available to the conservation and renewable area in a combination of EU and Exchequer funds over the operational programme period.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Irish Energy Centre is to devise and deliver energy conservation grant schemes on behalf of my Department, to deliver technical advice on energy conservation issues to all sectors of the economy, to raise energy awareness levels throughout the country through publicity, promotional and information campaigns and to co-ordinate the different aspects of the overall energy conservation programme.</P>
    <P>The Irish Energy Centre is a novel departure in public service terms, with <Col N="1971" /> an independent public profile and linked to a National Energy Advisory Board.  The centre is a joint initiative between my Department and Forbairt and will be funded primarily through a mixture of Exchequer and EU moneys. It will have a budget of £21 million approximately over the next five years.</P>
    <P>In one of my first ministerial acts in this new area, I finalised the Memorandum of Understanding with Forbairt necessary to solidify the IEC's standing and to formally launch it.  This is a unique accommodation between a semi-State agency and a line Department other than its parent Department.  It is an arrangement which overcomes some of the inherent rigidities in the public policy system and it is a model which could be used elsewhere.  It allows for a target driven relationship between my Department, Forbairt and the Irish Energy Centre.  One of the targets is the realisation of energy savings of £50 million by 1999.  My Department is in the process of agreeing a whole range of ambitious targets with regard to all the centre's activities.  In addition, the centre is a State agency and I would encourage industry and the public to use it to the full.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the Irish Energy Centre recognises that, in order to promote energy efficiency effectively, it is necessary to create a new culture with regard to energy consumption, to provide detailed advise and expert guidance with regard to best practice in individual centres, to encourage the development of companies offering energy audit facilities and advise and provide incentives to companies to invest in new systems and technology.  A proper infrastructure is required to develop and co-ordinate activities within this programme and the centre, with its regional presence, responds to that need.</P>
    <P>The Irish Energy Centre has already launched a number of measures, and others are at an advanced planning stage.  Already there are two grant schemes in place, the energy audit grant scheme and the energy efficiency investment grant scheme.  Under the audit <Col N="1972" /> scheme, grants of up to 40 per cent are available to energy users in the industrial, commercial and institutional sectors towards the cost of hiring consultants to conduct energy audits and to advise on the steps to be taken to improve energy efficiency.  A total of £1.6 million is available for this scheme.</P>
    <P>Under the energy efficiency investment scheme grant assistance will be provided to energy users in the business and institutional sectors for investment in energy efficient technologies.  This scheme covers the implementation of the recommendations of energy audits and provides grant support for investment in targeted energy efficient technologies. A total of £3.6 million is available under this scheme.</P>
    <P>The industrial sector is one of the most reactive to financial signals.  The impact of expenditure in the sector is relatively easy to measure.  The services sector is no less reactive.  However, the services sector's costs are not a significant element of its overall expenditure. Nevertheless, this sector is an important user of energy and it is therefore important to encourage energy conservation. This measure addresses both sectors.</P>
    <P>The provision of technical advice is an important element of the Irish Energy Centre's remit.  This covers the provision of technical advice and support to industrial and commercial companies, including seminars on specific energy conservation, and an initial point of contact for advice on energy efficiency matters will be provided.  In addition, the preparation and publication of a series of good practice guides on critical areas will be provided.  Aspects, such as the efficient use of fuel, will be covered and action will be taken in specific subsectoral areas, including the agri-food and dairy industries.  Each good practice guide will have the back up of workshops held on a regional basis.  The provision of training for architects, surveyors, engineers and managers in energy analysis skills will also be provided, which meets the point made by Senator Henry.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, the Irish Energy Centre will be organised on a <Col N="1973" /> regional basis.  In this regard, the centre recently invited proposals for regionally based bodies, who would provide national services in the areas of renewable energies and professional training in energy conservation and efficiency. The Irish Energy Centre will place contracts of two to three years duration for the operation of two such offices.  These offices will be located so as to give the Irish Energy Centre a real presence throughout the country.  It is, therefore, a truly national initiative.  These new offices will complement the existing outlets at Sligo and Cork.</P>
    <P>The centre's promotional work will include initiatives such as the co-ordination of an annual national energy awareness week, market research on energy conservation attitudes and a series of education initiatives such as the current transition year display project and a cross-Border schools project. These educational projects seek to involve and interest schoolgoers in energy conservation issues.  An interest forged at an early age tends to remain with children and, additionally, they also get their parents involved in these projects.</P>
    <P>The cross-Border project is a joint initiative between the Irish Energy Centre and Co-operation North and one which my Department has been very pleased to support.  As well as encouraging the study of energy related topics, the project helps to build understanding between the participating students, North and South, as the prizes involve an exchange programme.  Further promotion through the sponsorship of the high profile television programme &ldquo;Our House&rdquo; will continue and also the use of appropriate media to increase the profile of energy conservation and efficiency.</P>
    <P>Funding will also be provided for initiatives which will promote the energy conservation message.  Actions to be carried out will include encouraging the establishment of audit and house certification companies, to which I will refer in more detail later: developing companies to help provide energy conservation measures for the elderly and <Col N="1974" /> low income groups, to which I will also return later; and examining the potential for using renewable energy sources.</P>
    <P>The National Energy Advisory Board is another important element in the renewed vigour with which energy conservation and renewables issues are being tackled.  The board is interposed between me, as Minister, and the centre's executive and is charged with the task of co-ordinating the implementation of Government policy in relation to energy efficiency, renewable energy and research across the various energy utilities.</P>
    <P>The board's membership is drawn from the ESB, Bord na Móna, the Irish National Petroleum Corporation, Bord Gáis Éireann and the social partners.  It provides a cross sectoral forum within which to examine the progress of programmes in these fields.  It also avoids unnecessary overlap between the agencies. It has also a key role in identifying gaps in the overall strategy and proposing measures to fill these.  It allows for more co-ordination in the energy conservation and efficiency efforts of the individual members of the board.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the area of renewable energy, for which I thank Members for homing in on in their contributions so far.  Renewable energy offers undoubted benefits, both in terms of sustainable development and protection of the environment.  Some renewable technologies are already economically competitive today; others could become so in five to ten years.  This development process must be encouraged and supported.</P>
    <P>It is of interest to note that only 2 per cent of Ireland's energy requirement is currently being provided by renewables and, in line with current overall EU trends, the biggest contributor to this share comes from biomass, particularly wood.  However, other renewables such as hydropower, wind and solar energy are also represented.  It is this increasing degree of diversification in recent years which is, perhaps, the most welcome trend.</P>
    <P>The main initiative at the moment is the ongoing alternative energy requirement scheme being run by the ESB at <Col N="1975" /> the request of my Department.  Under this scheme, independent contractors will develop up to 75 megawatts of new installed electricity generating capacity utilising alternative energy sources by 1997.  The ESB will contract to purchase this electricity.  The sources will include combined heat and power and renewable energy such as hydro, wind, landfill gas, biomass and waste, many of which have been referred to by Members.</P>
    <P>The scheme known as the 75 megawatt alternative energy requirement comprises a combination of price support and grant aid, the eventual cost of which will be transparently identified and passed on to the consumer by the ESB.  The price per kilowatt payable under the AER is set down in two tariffs for contracted electricity purchase &mdash; an average of 4p for renewable energy generators and 3p for combined heat and power generators using fossil fuels.</P>
    <P>To date, the ESB has assessed the projects for technical merit and issued connection quotes to the successful applicants.  These applicants then submitted business plans and grant applications before 3 January 1995 and the ESB assessed them for commercial viability.  The ESB finalised a set of recommendations to my Department which were received in my office yesterday evening.  The ESB report is currently being examined by my officials and a final decision on the precise contribution to be made by each technology will be made by me in the very near future.</P>
    <P>Following the completion of the competitive process, it is intended to build on this scheme and the setting of further policy will be determined on the basis of conclusions drawn from the current scheme.  I am very pleased by the healthy and enthusiastic response to the present scheme with applications far exceeding the available 75 megawatts. This is a factor which will be very much to the fore in my examination of the future options.</P>
    <P>Regarding the domestic sector, the following initiatives are at present being pursued.  My Department is currently in consultation with the Department of the <Col N="1976" /> Environment on the implementation of a national energy conservation strategy for local authority homes.  Indeed, I am proud to recall from my time at the Department of the Environment that I was responsible for two major initiatives on local authority housing.  I sanctioned the installation of full central heating systems in houses &mdash; the practice up until then had been to install back-boilers or ranges with no radiator outlets. Additionally, I sanctioned the replacement of external doors and windows with more durable hardwood or weather proof material.  Both these initiatives increased the comfort levels in local authority homes and, of course, contributed to energy conservation.</P>
    <P>As mentioned earlier, in a separate initiative the IEC and my Department are currently devising a strategy targeted at the homes of the elderly and those on low incomes.  This will entail the extension of the energy action model, which will be known to many Senators.  We plan to tap into the dynamism of the local area or community approach which is involved in energy action.  In addition, the Irish Energy Centre is currently working on an energy conservation booklet for households.</P>
    <P>My Department is also in consultation with the Department of the Environment regarding the amendment of the building regulations.  This amendment arises from the need to strengthen the energy conservation elements of the regulations so as to provide for the energy ratings of buildings.  Home energy rating is a priority for my Department and a pilot scheme has been running for the last two years.  Rating involves a measure of the energy use of a home or building and it provides an index against which the relative energy efficiency of a house can be assessed.  It is the equivalent of the miles per gallon usage of a car and would, in the same way, provide invaluable information to home owners and prospective tenants and purchasers.  My Department is committed to the widespread adoption of home energy rating and is, at present, pursuing the matter vigorously with the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1977" /> The IEC, as mentioned already, and of course the ESB through its demand side management initiatives, will deliver advice and support right across the business spectrum.  A large part of the thinking behind our energy conservation programme was the growth of service and support companies in the independent sector and the creation of new jobs there.  The programme will create the conditions for that growth to take place and these companies will complement the activities of the centre and the ESB.</P>
    <P>The implementation of an energy policy has to have due regard for its potential effects on the environment.  There is close co-operation and consultation between my Department and the Department of the Environment to ensure that energy considerations are integrated into environmental policy and environmental considerations are implemented into energy policy.</P>
    <P>In essence, the primary objective is that a balanced approach is pursued and that any environmental measures which are adopted should not lead to the imposition of excessive energy costs on industry and other economic sectors with little or no environmental benefit. The recent establishment of a green network of Departments has given added impetus to the integration of environmental considerations into key sectoral policies and general decision making processes.  This is a formal forum where representatives from key Departments meet on a regular basis to consider current environmental developments and how they might impinge on their spheres of responsibility.</P>
    <P>It is also true to say that the increased emphasis being placed by the Government on energy conservation and efficiency and on the development of renewable energy sources will also be environmentally friendly and will contribute to the realisation of our targets for the stabilisation and limitation of greenhouse gas emissions and acid particulates.</P>
    <P>We are in times of great change in the energy sector and, as has been said by a number of speakers and as I said at the outset, I welcome this debate and the contributions made on all sides on the <Col N="1978" /> House.  I am taking careful note of contributions made and I look forward to fulfilling the invitation issued to me by Senator Cassidy to return in a year's time and to account for my stewardship as to how I have managed the brief.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I wish the Minister of State a happy and positive period in office in the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications.</P>
      <P>We should not underestimate the importance of the Energy side of the Department and the work of the ESB and Bord na Móna.  The Minister dealt with renewable energy.  This is of immense importance.  We must examine the position where only 2 per cent of our energy requirements come from renewable energy sources.  There have been many attempts to date to generate further electricity from biomass and wood, for example, but they have not been as successful as we would wish. However, I hope the ESB, in conjunction with Bord na Móna, will continue these initiatives and research because the issue is of immense importance.</P>
      <P>I welcome the policies set out in <i>A Government of Renewal</i> with regard to energy.  One item mentioned is the strengthening of the policy making function of the Department of Energy in order to oversee a coherent national energy policy, guiding the activities of the State energy utilities, the ESB, Bord Gáis Éireann, Bord na Móna and INBC. It is important that there is a positive overall approach to energy.  In the past I have requested successive Governments to produce a White Paper on energy policy but without success.  A White Paper, which later becomes Government policy, takes a long time to prepare but in the past number of years we have not been sufficiently prepared for the changes that are taking place.  I ask the Minister and the Government to consider preparing a White Paper, not just for the lifetime of this Government but for future Governments so that they can decide the priorities best suited for the years ahead.  Such a policy would be of immense importance to everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1979" /> Other speakers mentioned the debts incurred by the ESB and Bord na Móna. I admit that I have a vested interest in the working of the ESB and Bord na Móna because I reside in an area surrounded by bogs.  No matter which direction I take from my house in the morning, I encounter people employed by the ESB and Bord na Móna.  Since they have played a major part in the economic life of the midlands, I am interested in this subject.  However, Bord na Móna's overall capital debt is in the region of £120 million.  This debt was incurred by the company as a direct result of the policies of successive Governments who directed it at different times to proceed with building power stations and briquette factories, to buy bogs, to arrange drainage of the bog at a massive cost and then the other briquette factories which were planned did not go ahead because of the considerable costs involved.  On occasion I feel very hurt and angry when people say that Bord na Móna accumulated that debt.  To date, it has received no capital funding from anybody and anything it has achieved has been by its own hard work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I pay tribute to the late Todd Andrews and others like him who had a vision of Ireland and the role of the ESB and Bord na Móna.  We need vision as to where we are going.  It should be clearly understood that if the £120 million debt continues to hang over Bord na Móna, it will bring down the company; I have no doubt about that.  In the past, people referred to Bord na Móna as the jewel in the crown of semi-State bodies.  This was correct because the company had a great record.  It was held up as an example to all other competing boards.  During the various oil crises, Bord na Móna was directed by the Government to expand and develop.  This resulted in the company incurring substantial debts and the consequent problems.  However, if the debt problem is allowed to continue, it <Col N="1980" /> will sink the ship of Bord na Móna.  This cannot be allowed.</P>
      <P>In <i>The Irish Times</i> last Saturday and the <i>Irish Independent</i> last Tuesday references were made to the point that perhaps the National Treasury Management Agency or some such body could take over Bord na Móna's debt.  I make the strongest appeal to the Minister to take such measures, to ensure this debt is removed and then to proceed to provide equity to Bord na Móna.  There are a number of power stations in County Offaly, Shannonbridge, Ferbane and Rhode, and every effort must be made to keep them going.  Bord na Móna and the ESB have great futures.  We should remember that we are a sovereign and independent nation and we must have our own energy source.  The day we have no alternative to imported energy is the day the country is weakened.  This is why the ESB and Bord na Móna must be strengthened and supported, particularly by this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which is most regrettable, we will not force it to a division. <Col N="1981" /> It is also interesting to speculate to what extent the hot air, which is occasionally generated in this House, could contribute to a reduction in the national energy need.  Perhaps this could be harnessed at times.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise a number of specific matters with the Minister, one of which will not surprise him, that is, the Europeat power station and its possible future.  Given the Minister's constituency, he is aware of what has happened to the rural communities of west Kildare and parts of Counties Offaly and Laois and the job losses in the ESB and Bord na Móna over the years.</P>
      <P>For the last eight or nine months the carrot has been held out to people in that area that Europeat 1 will be constructed by Bord na Móna.  It was in the National Plan which was submitted to Brussels; it was &ldquo;opened&rdquo; on about 16 occasions by the former Minister, Deputy Cowen, but we still do not know whether it is to come.  It is incumbent on the new Administration to let the people know exactly what is the position of Europeat 1.  Is it to be built and if so when and where?  There will be a lead in period of about three years before it will be up and running.</P>
      <P>The station itself will not create many jobs, although 60 jobs in the area concerned would be significant, but there would be a significant spin-off in the peatland communities through the work of Bord na Móna.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross cast some doubts on the efficiency of these stations.  He spoke about transparency.  He was reading from a document produced by the ESB so the conclusion is probably not very surprising.  In this case, as in the other cases the Minister has mentioned where we would be using electricity from hydro or wind generation, the power would be sold to the ESB at a commercial rate because these companies would have to generate the power at a commercial rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The old element of cross subsidisation and hiding the true costs does not arise in this case.  It is imperative that the uncertainty surrounding this development be removed.  I realise it was subject to scrutiny by Brussels and that was <Col N="1982" /> used as an excuse for the delay, but how long will it take before we know the answer?  A station of this size and nature, given the technology which is now available, can be operated efficiently and profitably &mdash; there are precedents in Finland of which we are aware.  Some of the criticisms made in respect of its viability are wide of the mark.  It can be operated economically.</P>
    <P>The motion addresses the question of alternative sources of energy.  I commend Senator Townsend and his colleagues for their approach to the debate.  It is unquestionable that the supply of fossil fuels which is available and which is being frittered away will diminish as time goes on.  At some point in the future we will have to rely on alternatives to produce energy.  There is a superficial attraction in saying that oil seed rape should be used for fuel or that beet and potatoes can be converted into fuel.  However, the cost is a central question. All I have read about his matter suggests that there is a negative energy balance in producing a litre of fuel.  In other words, more energy goes into the system than will come out at the other end.</P>
    <P>Experiments were conducted on a commercial scale in France where some of that theory was tested and unless there was a significant degree of subsidisation from the state these schemes would not operate.  One gets to a point when the fossil fuels become so scarce and expensive that they are no longer viable.  However we are some way from that point.</P>
    <P>I, like many other Senators, find it absolutely objectionable &mdash; I speak as a practising cereal grower &mdash; to have land producing nothing.  It is difficult to come to terms with that psychologically and it is difficult to explain to a starving world. Superficially, it is attractive to suggest that oil seed rape or other fuel crops should be grown to provide energy.  As a farmer it is my view that unless the product was substantially subsidised coming out of a set aside field I would not be able to produce it at a profit if it were to be viable fuel.  That needs to be addressed, probably at European level.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1983" /> I have to dispute what Senator Cassidy said about Lough Sheelin being restored to its former glory.  It is far from its former glory, but that is by the way and underlines the Minister's and my interest in angling.  The economics of methane digestion from pig units are extremely questionable except on large units with a big supply of slurry available. I know studies have shown that there would be a pay back period of five years.  However, one would need fairly significant subsidisation to achieve the energy savings required.</P>
    <P>Wind farms would appear to be the most viable option.  I have seen them in Denmark and I know they work.  Given that on the west coast of Ireland the highest mean wind speeds in Europe prevail, it would seem that a strong case could be made for the development of wind farms.  I do not see why that could not be done on a private commercial scale apart from State input into the process.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to hydropower and solar power.  With regard to angling there are worries that there is to be a significant number of hydro units put into rivers on a private basis, particularly in salmon rivers, that could damage the stocks.  We are confronted with a conflict between the development of tourism and what might happen.  One other solution is nuclear energy but I would not recommend it and I am sure it would get no support in the House. That debate is well and truly over and it will not be reopened.</P>
    <P>I share Senator Enright's suggestion that we have to produce a national vision of the scale produced by those who created the ESB and other facilities in the early part of the century.  We need to look at our policy and ask if it is radical enough to meet the needs of the next century.  Is it radical enough to respond to the decline in fossil fuels and to respond to the increases in energy costs?</P>
    <P>The carbon tax worries me.  I know the Minister did not say he would introduce it &mdash; he said he would have an input into the policy at European level. I do not want him to adopt the green <Col N="1984" /> agenda on that matter.  With regard to Turlough Hill the energy balance is questionable.  One is using energy off peak to pump water to the top of a hill so that it can be reintroduced into the system at peak times and when the need arises.  The energy balance is questionable but I can see the strategic and economic reasons for doing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and I wish him well in his new portfolio. I thank him for his help and co-operation when he was at the Department of the Environment dealing with housing. He was most approachable with regard to issues which were important to those involved with local authorities.  I have no doubt that he will give his full energy to his present portfolio.</P>
      <P>Energy, its conservation and energy policy are important issues at present. Their importance is brought to the fore in light of ongoing discussions about two of our commercial State bodies, the ESB and Bord na Móna.  I welcome what the Minister said about the extension of offices.  He did not home in on an area where there is considerable loss &mdash; our generating plants.</P>
      <P>Dr. Paul Monaghan of UCG is one of 15 experts in Europe who combined their expertise and have presented a report which proves beyond doubt that efficiency from a generating station is approximately 35 per cent and that 55 per cent at least goes into the atmosphere. It is wasted because it is emitted through coolers or whatever.  Dr. Monaghan and others have suggested an alternative generating process known as combined heat and power or CHP, which has been implemented in Finland and in America.  The question of CHP is exciting given that some Members have spoken about a vision for the future. The report presented by Dr. Paul Monaghan and his colleagues should be studied in depth by the Government, public representatives and semi-State bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer to some of the ideas put forward by Dr. Monaghan in relation to a vision of generating capacity in the year 2000.  The report recommends a combined CHP plant approximately 5 to 10 megawatts located at or near a peat bog <Col N="1985" /> supplying electricity to the ESB grid and supplying heat to housing, industry, horticulture, fish farming and hotel and leisure facilities.  He explains why it should be 5 to 10 megawatts rather than 80 or 120 and why the location is important, that is, beside towns, industrial estates, etc.  I investigated the situation in Finland to see if such a system works.  In Finland a combined heat and power peat burning plant supplies power to a town of 65,000.</P>
    <P>The vision we should have as regards generating capacity over the next 20, 30 or 40 years should home in on research on combined heat and power.  If 100 acres of glasshouses were located close to a power station, heating costs would be considerably reduced because at present 50 to 55 per cent of heat is emitted into the atmosphere or into a cooling system.  While we might consider lagging jackets and other measures important, their benefits are minuscule compared to the considerable loss of energy at generating stations.  We have the most inefficient generating capacity in Europe, and possibly in the developed world.  Even in our most modern plant, the coal burning plant at Moneypoint, there is up to a 35 per cent loss in efficiency.  Although it is hard to believe, these are the facts.</P>
    <P>While a short debate in the House will not resolve the matter, it gives us an opportunity to highlight the inefficiencies in the present system.  I do not blame any Minister or the semi-State bodies in this regard.  They have had to work under stringent conditions over the years and with financial handicaps.  It now time to review the situation and to consider the vision which is being spoken about as regards generating efficiency.  The Minister and the Department must use the technology and research compiled by experts all over Europe.  They must look at the system which has been implemented in the United States and in Finland because this country is more suited to that type of development.</P>
    <P>While it may seem appropriate to have one large power station &mdash; I am told departmental officials will say it is <Col N="1986" /> totally uneconomical to have a second or a third generation station at this time &mdash; experts will tell us that we should have five small stations.  The Minister should investigate that before opting for one large peat power station.  If he initiates a debate or asks the officials to wait until somebody looks at the options, he will have done a good job.</P>
    <P>There are large deposits of peat in this country and in my area alone there are 19,000 acres of unused peat.  In 1984, 250 people worked on these bogs, while ten or 12 work there today.  I hope more people will be employed seasonally and that the works in Derrynafada in Ballyforan will be maintained.  The development of our peat resources are of vital importance and has a vital role to play provided we do proper research and use proper technology.  If we do that, we will not only develop our peat resources, which would be environmentally friendly, but we will provide opportunities in terms of energy to other areas, including industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  The debate has been interesting and a number of new ideas and concepts have been discussed.  In many ways Senator Enright and the two previous speakers touched on what this motion is about.  We must try to be as self-sufficient and as environmentally friendly as possible in terms of the energy we use.  At present only 2 per cent of our energy comes from renewable resources. It is only a small percentage in terms the EU objectives of doubling the 1991 contribution of renewal energy sources to a total EU energy demand of 8 per cent by the year 2005.  We have a long way to go in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Mooney's call that we should return to this debate in a year's time was wise &mdash; we will probably need to return to it for many years.  In that context, I support what Senator Henry said &mdash; that we need to concentrate on research and development because we have a long way to go in replacing non-renewable energy with renewable energy sources.  I welcome the fact that an energy centre and an advisory board have been set up and that we have systems in place to <Col N="1987" /> improve the situation, including energy audits and various grants, to ensure that industries will take steps to make their technology more efficient.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran referred to the wasting of energy by many of our systems, both domestically and industrially. Appliances that are often not efficient are used in many homes.  I understand there is a forthcoming EU directive on labelling appliances with regard to their energy efficiency.  This will contribute to an increased awareness of the problem.</P>
    <P>Awareness is one of the problems which does not yet impinge very much on our consciousness.  We did not begin to think about issues such as making homes more energy efficient until fairly recently.  Indeed, the Minister referred to his tenure in the Department of the Environment; that issue has only begun to be addressed in the last few years in relation to local authority housing.  In many ways, we are only beginning this debate and taking action on the issue. Those actions that have already been taken are to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>There are many kinds of energy sources available to us &mdash; some of them, such as wind and solar power, have been referred to already.  There have been some experiments with solar energy but since we do not get a lot of sun here, that would not be a great factor. However, wind and wave power would be two sources that could be used more. We should support whatever research is being done in those areas.  As the Minister again pointed out, there is much scope and potential for job creation in many of these areas and there are many new areas that need to be tested and tried out.</P>
    <P>Members from the midlands talked about the turf generating stations; many people referred to stations close to where they live.  I grew up about two miles from Ardnacrusha power station in the shadow of the Headrace, which is the canal that brings the water from the River Shannon at O'Brien's Bridge to Ardnacrusha, where it generates electricity. It is then returned through the Tailrace to the River Shannon.  This was regarded as a miracle at the time it was <Col N="1988" /> built.  Elderly people around the region said people came from all over Ireland to see this wonderful construction, which was built with the assistance of German engineers.  It was an extraordinary technological feat at the time.  As Senator Dardis said, maybe we need men of vision to use their imagination.</P>
    <P>The concept of generating energy through hydroelectric power has served us well.  It would have been our main source of energy at certain stages, although this is not the case now.  There is a perfection about it in so far as the water is used and then goes back into the river.  I would like hydroelectricity to be part of our energy policy in the future.  Ardnacrusha has served the Irish people well, although it currently constitutes only a small part of our national grid.</P>
    <P>I welcome the points the Minister made regarding the ESB.  Obviously the ESB is crucial to the use of renewable energy because it controls the national grid and will be vital in bringing other forms of energy into the national grid.</P>
    <P>This is an important debate not only on the national but on the world stage. The world resources are running out. We owe it to future generations as well as our own to think seriously about these issues and to ensure that action is taken on them.  The Minister indicated that he would take up Senator Mooney's suggestion that we return to this debate in a year's time.  We will need to return to it many times in the future until the percentage of energy from alternative sources is much higher and we are using renewable resources to a much greater extent than at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator O'Sullivan, I was reared close to Ballyshannon and the hydroelectric scheme there.  While there is now great praise for those schemes, I wonder if they would be built today?  What would be the environmental impact today?  We would be told about the damage to fish stocks, etc., although after all these years no damage has been done to the environment. Hydroelectric power is the cheapest form of energy to harness.  I know we have many rivers, but when the ESB <Col N="1989" /> decided to buy electricity from private generators, some of those who looked at using rivers for generating electricity were told they would damage the environment. To become involved in hydroelectric schemes today would be well nigh impossible.</P>
      <P>There should be a greater concentration on solar power.  Not enough research has been put into developing solar systems for private houses.  Most houses have central heating but more research could be done into making units to harness solar energy.  They could then be sold to augment central heating systems.  That would certainly save fuel because most houses are heated either by oil or gas.  Wave power was tried as a source of power but the main problem would be harnessing them.  Waves are hard to control and we all know the damage they can do. However, that problem could be overcome if enough energy was used to develop a means of doing it.</P>
      <P>Oil companies may not be too interested in anyone doing research into an energy which would cut into their business.  A number of people have experimented with running cars without petrol.  Ex-Deputy McDonald has a car which runs on waste oil.  He told me that even after 180,000 miles it was still going strong.  He did not get any financial backing to get this project off the ground.  I wonder why no one has looked at that.  Nothing pollutes our atmosphere as much as the car.  The modern car has been improved but it still burns the same fuel.  Many experiments were carried out on using methane gas as a power source for farm enterprises.  Farmers used methane to supply their greenhouse and home heating. This may be an area where more research could be done.  In that way we could again produce energy to do the work at home.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and hope he will be invited to my home town of Mallow within the next 12 months.  Cork County Council and Mallow Urban District Council have put forward a proposal for the development of a national natural energy park in <Col N="1990" /> Mallow and some progress has been made and research done.  It will be based on renewable energy resources and a pilot scheme is under way.  In Mallow we already have power from geothermal wells and I look forward to the project being expanded and properly resourced.  All alternative sources of energy will be explored in that national energy park.  It appears, from the early debate on the issue that the potential is enormous.</P>
      <P>One of the focuses of the Government's programme is the principle of sustainable development.  This impacts on a range of policy areas from energy production to planning practices.  During the past few decades we have been slowly killing the environmental goose which lays the golden egg.  The Government has its work cut out to reverse this damage.  In this regard I particularly welcome the Government programme's commitment to set targets for electricity generation from renewable sources.</P>
      <P>Over the past few years I watched State enterprises, such as Irish Steel, wrestling with Government indifference. I welcome the Government programme's commitment to revitalise public enterprise and ensure that change is managed in the best interest of employees, taxpayers and consumers. Workers in the ESB have adopted a constructive approach to the demands of EU deregulation.  However, change must be negotiated rather than imposed. The original proposal for the loss of 2,900 jobs by closing half of the country's 103 ESB offices is likely to run into both union and public opposition.  I am also extremely concerned about the proposal to scrap the intervention of the welfare authorities in cases where individuals cannot meet their bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is vital that the different companies in the State sector be brought into line with EU deregulation policies and made more competitive.  However, any attempt to unilaterally impose new structures at the expense of workers and local communities will only lead to the kind of dispute that could have devastating wider economic implications. Social and environmental sustainability <Col N="1991" /> are two sides of the same coin and must be treated as such by our policy makers.</P>

      <P>This is a very useful debate and we heard many exciting things.  The Minister's speech on energy conservation was excellent and contains food for thought.  I was disappointed with the part of the speech dealing with the production of energy from renewable sources.  This might be more appropriate to the brief of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.</P>
      <P>When we entered the EU over 20 years ago we forgot about our fishing industry, even though there was a large quota to be gained.  I am afraid that if we are not on the ball in relation to renewable energy sources, we might fall into the same trap.  When the GATT negotiations were being finalised, the Blair House Agreement limited the area of oilseed that can be produced for biodiesel use to about 850,000 acres. The farmers and Governments of France, Germany and Italy are not fools.  They have already taken up a large amount of this quota already.  We should not take our eye off the ball but seek to get some of this quota and keep our options open.</P>
      <P>People spoke about the price of biodiesel. This diesel can be used in any diesel car without the need to modify its engine.  The main arguments against its use are the costs of producing it and excise duty.  I am told by people at the research station in Oak Park that they are developing another crop which will be able to produce biodiesel at half the cost of producing it from rape seed.  I am almost certain that the EU will demand that each member state use a certain amount of oil or diesel from renewable sources and if we are not producing such oil or diesel we will have to obtain it from other countries and forego the excise duty on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>The suicide rate has increased dramatically in Ireland since the early 1960s, particularly among the young.  In most European countries it ranks among the ten most frequent causes of death.  In 1992 there were 354 official deaths from suicide in Ireland, the highest ever recorded.  Those most at risk are young men aged between 15 and 34 years, in particular young farmers and people living in rural areas.  The distressed young person today is more likely to consider suicide as a solution than a similar young person was 30 years ago.  The purpose of raising the <Col N="1993" /> matter on the Adjournment is to ask the Minister for Health to identify suicide as a public health issue and introduce measures to assist in the prevention and reduction of suicides in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The British Government in its <i>Health of the Nation</i> paper has set two targets for suicide prevention &mdash; to reduce the suicide rate by 15 per cent among the general population and by 33 per cent among severely mentally ill people by the year 2000.  The World Health Organisation has set a target of reversing by the same year the current rising trends in suicide and attempted suicide. It has called on all member States to take steps to develop national programmes for the prevention of suicide, to establish national co-ordinating committees, to promote the co-ordination of current research and to stimulate further research.</P>
      <P>Two approaches to preventative programmes are suggested by international experts.  The first of these is the population approach where an attempt is made to reduce the prevalence of suicide risk factors for the whole population. The second approach is to concentrate primarily on high risk individuals, but the difficulty is in identifying them.  In addition, the factors present in high risk individuals must be understood before they can be used to combat such risk.</P>
      <P>Suicide preventative programmes should be directed at the general population and at individuals thought to be at risk of suicide.  The most strongly associated risk factor in suicide is the diagnosis of psychiatric illness as more than 90 per cent of suicides have suffered at some time from mental illness, the most common of which appear to be depression, alcoholism and schizophrenia. Since depression is the most common psychiatric disorder, an important aspect of any suicide prevention programme would involve its recognition, prevention and treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is well know that suicide rates are influenced by socio-demographic factors such as age, sex, marital status, employment status, social and cultural attitudes, and whether people are living <Col N="1994" /> alone.  Employment opportunity also has a considerable effect because those most at risk are people whose employment has become insecure and where there is a real threat of redundancy, or they have recently become unemployed.</P>
    <P>Access to the means of suicide is also regarded as a risk factor.  Between the late 1950s and early 1970s the incidence of suicide by domestic gas poisoning in the UK declined rapidly following the reduction in the carbon monoxide content of domestic gas.  The availability of firearms is another factor which may influence suicide levels, and some studies have found that a reduction in their availability has reduced the incidence of suicide.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out that the prescription of drugs such as tricyclic anti-depressants, which are toxic in overdose, may have possibly increased the incidence of suicide by being readily available to potentially suicidal patients. Since tricyclic anti-depressants are regularly prescribed to depressed or potential suicide patients, this is an area of concern.  There is an onus on doctors to exercise caution in the prescription of those potentially toxic drugs to potentially suicidal patients, and consideration should be given to the newer generation of anti-depressants such as SSRIs which are thought to be non-toxic in overdose and can be equally as effective.</P>
    <P>It is well recognised that following para-suicide there is a significant risk of eventual suicide.  Some 1 per cent of adults who commit suicide do so within one year of a suicide attempt, thus the para-suicidal group are at high risk. Despite these theories there is, as yet, no clear evidence of the best way of preventing suicide, or a repetition of suicide attempts, among this group.</P>
    <P>The Minister should look at the establishment of suicide prevention programmes, but prior to doing so, if targets or objectives must be clearly stated they should be formulated by a multi-disciplinary working party and must be realistic.  A second prerequisite is adequate funding to establish and maintain <Col N="1995" /> such a programme.  Education has a vital role in suicide prevention, and educational programmes must be directed both at the general public and at professionals.</P>
    <P>In Ireland particularly a stigma remains associated with suicide which can only be reduced by freely providing information and discussing the topic. The decriminalising of suicide in 1993 has contributed greatly to reducing this stigma.  AWARE, the voluntary organisation operating since the mid-1980s, has made a major contribution towards educating the general public about suicide.</P>
    <P>If a national suicide prevention programme is to be established, and we suggest that it should be, contributions will be required from a wide range of disciplines including the medical, social, legal and political ones.  Good communications in pooling information and resources will be vital.  The collection of accurate suicide mortality statistics and ongoing research into suicide will provide the way forward in suicide prevention.</P>
    <P>To deal with the problem of suicide it is necessary to acknowledge that a major problem exists which requires urgent attention.  We must identify those at risk.  The Samaritans have provided a valuable list of suicide risk signs to look out for which could help to save lives. Those most at risk are people who have been recently bereaved or who are experiencing the trauma of a break up or violence in the home.  Also at risk are those who are suffering from a downturn in health, employment or finances, those who have a painful or disabling illness, dependency on drugs or alcohol, and those who experience suicide in their family or the suicide of a friend.</P>
    <P>The signs which can identify a person as suicidal include being withdrawn and finding it difficult to relate to others, talking about suicide or death, putting their affairs in order or giving away valued possessions, experiencing a feeling of failure or lack of self-esteem, dwelling on problems which may have <Col N="1996" /> no solution or attempting suicide or self injury.</P>
    <P>Suicide programmes are available in the United States, in the UK and other countries.  The simple solution of transporting these into Ireland has often been suggested but I disagree with that because our culture, background and problems are totally different.  While we can learn from what is happening in other countries we cannot transport their solutions to our situation.  We need intensive research to identify what the Irish solution should be as well as preparing our own suicide prevention programmes. While we may take the headlines from other countries, we need a lot of domestic research.  This is a new issue for the Department of Health because two years ago, when it was considered a crime, suicide was dealt with by the Department of Justice.  Nonetheless it is a vital and important one and for that reason I urge the Department, the Minister and the Minister of State to take on board what we have said.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Neville for sharing his time with me, and I welcome the Minister to the House.  I wonder where we would stand as regards suicide if it had not been for Senator Neville's tenacity in pursuing it.  I want to address the area of suicide in prisons. I am sure the Minister is aware that in some countries it is the Department of Health and not the Department of Justice which runs prisons.  The incidence of suicide in our prisons is very serious. When we put people into prison they are, at least, supposed to be safe, but if they come out dead having committed suicide &mdash; or injured having attempted suicide &mdash; it is a tremendous indictment on society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Health needs to take a far more active interest in the health of prisoners.  This matter ties in well with some serious deficiencies in the Department of Health at the moment.  For example, what happened to the White Paper on mental health legislation about which I have been hearing for a long time?  People are <Col N="1997" /> being discharged from psychiatric hospitals where they may have been voluntary patients, into inadequate community psychiatric care.  They become homeless, get involved in crime and are committed to prison, without adequate psychiatric assessment, where they commit, or attempt to commit, suicide.  This is a terrible indictment not just of the Department of Justice but also of the Department of Health.  We have no knowledge from the Department of Justice concerning the level of psychotropic drugs, sedative drugs and sleeping tablets which are being given to prisoners who may be suicidal.</P>
    <P>The Samaritans have some, but not total, access to prisoners.  The supply of cordless phones in prisons is important in that those prisoners who feel suicidal will now be able to phone the Samaritans who are more than willing to back up the splendid service they already do by trying to help those in prison.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to ask the Department to take far more interest in the health of prisoners who, after all, are members of the community even though they may be confined for a period laid down by the courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Neville and Senator Henry for their very informed and constructive contributions on this very serious issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Around the world many thousands of people end their lives through suicide and thousands more make non-fatal suicide attempts, that is, perform para-suicidal acts.  Suicide is probably the most personal act anyone can perform. In the past the rate of suicide in Ireland was genuinely low but over the past 20 years there has been a continued increase.  In 1974 there were 118 deaths attributed to suicide; in 1992 the number of reported deaths from suicide was 354 and in 1993 it was 357.  This increase in the numbers of suicides has not been accompanied by a fall in other causes of unnatural death, such as accidental poisoning, accidental drowning and open verdicts in coroners' courts.  For this <Col N="1998" /> reason, it is accepted that there has been a genuine rise in the number of suicides.</P>
    <P>The factors giving rise to suicide in society have been the subject of debate for many years.  Changes in the fabric of society, depression and social isolation are factors which can contribute to individual distress.  Few acts have such deep roots in social and human conditions or have such farreaching consequences. Suicide not only affects the person's immediate social circle but also the local and wider community in which the individual lives.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper on mental health which was launched in June 1992 discussed the challenge of promoting mental health and the prevention of suicide. It outlines the role mental health personnel can play in the prevention of suicide and emphasises the important contribution of voluntary bodies, such as the Samaritans.</P>
    <P>Investigation and detailed research into the causes of suicide has not been easy at national and international level. In the past there has been an understandable reluctance to even discuss the issue and this made the compilation of accurate data on the frequency and pattern of suicide more difficult.  It is clear, however, that reliable information on the occurrence of suicidal behaviour is essential if help is to be made available to those considered to be at risk of suicide.</P>
    <P>I believe that the traditional public custom of regarding suicide as a taboo subject can be altered.  In recognition of the need for further research on the factors which lead people to take their own lives and the most effective way of intervening to prevent premature loss, the Department of Health is contributing towards the cost of a pilot project on attempted suicide in Cork carried out by the staff of the Southern Health Board under the direction of Dr. Michael Kelleher, consultant psychiatrist. The aim of this project is to reduce the occurrence of para-suicide and to develop intervention skills which may be applied in this area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1999" /> The Department of Health also provided financial support towards the cost of the Fifth European Symposium on Suicide and Self-poisoning which took place in University College Cork from 31 August to 3 September 1994.  This symposium was attended by researchers from diverse backgrounds from all over Europe.  It enabled medical and nursing personnel, social workers, voluntary groups and others to exchange experience leading towards a better understanding of suicide and suicidal behaviour. The proceedings of this symposium &ldquo;Divergent Perspectives on Suicidal Behaviour&rdquo; are of interest and would inform any discussion on the issue of suicide.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that my colleague the Minister for Health recently gave his support to the participation of the Cork study to which I have referred in the WHO-EURO Multi-Centre Study on Para-Suicide.  This was started in 1988 and covers two broad areas of research. These are the monitoring of recent trends in the epidemiology of para-suicide, including the identification of risk factors and follow up studies of para-suicide populations as a special high risk group for further suicidal behaviour, with a view to identifying the social and personal characteristics predictive of future suicidal behaviour.</P>
    <P>With research into the factors that influence an individual to undertake a suicidal act, it is also important to look at the services which are already in place and to look at ways of improving and making services more accessible and user friendly.  I am glad to say that the development of psychiatric services in line with the aims of &ldquo;Planning the Future&rdquo;&mdash; a service which is comprehensive, community oriented, sector based and integrated with other health services &mdash; has led in a short time span to a position where there is a greater level of understanding and public tolerance of psychiatric illness.</P>
    <P>The World Health Organisation in its &ldquo;Targets for Health for All&rdquo; has recommended action to reverse the rising <Col N="2000" /> trend in suicide by the year 2000.  It highlights the importance of early detection and treatment for depression, alcoholism and schizophrenia.  These are all being addressed in the context of reorganisation of our mental health service.</P>
    <P>The World Health Organisation also suggests the need for improvements in the underlying societal factors that put a strain on the individual, such as family stress, social isolation of elderly people living alone and failure at school.  It emphasises the need to develop the individual's ability to cope with events of life and provide a better network of social support.  The ability of people to cope with life is a crucial factor in preventing and managing mental illness. Health boards are already involved in a number of ways in promoting better coping skills through parenting programmes, pre-school play groups, life skills education in schools, alcohol and drug awareness programmes and social support for elderly people living alone. The health strategy &ldquo;Shaping a Healthier Future&rdquo; recognises the importance of health promotion, including the promotion of mental health.  Over the next four years the health services will continue to support and provide programmes to promote mental health and prevent suicide.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Health, and I are open to other suggestions from this House as to how, as a society, we can reduce the incidence of suicide in this country.  In this context I have noted the recent proposal of Dr. Kelleher that a review group be established which would examine the annual statistics on suicide and make recommendations which might help to prevent some suicides.  I would like to discuss the role such a review group could play with my colleagues, the Minister for Health and the Minister for Justice.  I will keep Senators informed of any developments in this regard.</P>

Para-suicide is a cry for help; suicide is a wilful attempt to take life.  I thank the Minister for his openness in asking for further contributions.

      <P>Late last year it was announced that approximately 170 acres at Lucan Demesne were to be put up for public auction.  At that time local community groups, the local community council and the Liffey Valley Defence Alliance contacted the public representatives on the Kildare side, the Lucan side and the Blanchardstown side of the area concerned and asked us to lobby the local authorities and central Government to have this land taken into public ownership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pay tribute to those groups who have worked tirelessly for 20 years trying to ensure that the integrity of the valley would be retained.  They have done everything in their power to ensure that it was protected.  We had a series of meetings with the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins, and Deputy Stagg, then Minister of State at the Department of Environment.  The response was extremely good and very favourable.  That was a major achievement because we were trying to establish a precedent.  Various Ministers accepted the special significance of the Liffey Valley and were enthusiastic about the possibility of public ownership. Unfortunately, the events of November had many consequences for everyone, but particularly for the people who were pushing for public ownership of this land.  We had reached <Col N="2002" /> the stage where an offer was going to be made, but then the Government changed and this left a hiatus.  People felt that this issue was threatened again.</P>
    <P>The Liffey Valley is a major amenity and anyone living in the Dublin area recognises it as such.  It was the subject of the only special area amenity order signed in this country in 1989 by the then Minister for the Environment, Mr. Pádraig Flynn.  Any development &mdash; I do not mean desecration, but the proper development &mdash; of the Liffey Valley is hampered by the fact that little, if any, of it is in public ownership.  While we may have great ambitions or aspirations for the Liffey Valley, they may not become reality because it is in private ownership.</P>
    <P>We cannot under-estimate the significance of purchasing this land.  It has great tourism and recreational potential. The Minister is aware &mdash; I believe he fought off a similar attempt in his own county &mdash; that there have been several well publicised attempts to rezone the land for houses.  This was done by barter &mdash; if part of the land was developed some of it would be used for recreational purposes.  Attempts were made to do this with the three new local authorities but they were unsuccessful and the land was protected.  If the land, which is currently for sale, does not come into public ownership, such threats will always hang over it.  Even if the local authorities and local politicians did not give in to the carrot of amenity land in place of possible development, the opportunity to purchase a significant amount of land in the Liffey Valley would not occur again.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to proceed with the purchase of Lucan Demesne; I know there was a commitment by the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government to bring this unique area into public ownership.  I ask the Minister if the deal has been done and if this will become public property.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to be able to confirm for Senator McGennis that, at the request of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, the <Col N="2003" /> Office of Public Works is in contact with the representatives of the owners of this property with a view to negotiating a purchase.  The purchase of this property is pursuant to a commitment made in the policy agreement for Government, <i>A Government of Renewal.</i></P>
      <P>The question of the purchase price is part of the ongoing negotiations with the representatives of the owners.  It is not possible at this stage to give a specific timescale for the acquisition of the property but I assure the Senator that the Minister will, for his part, be making every effort to ensure that the acquisition is completed as soon as possible. In tandem with this acquisition process the Minister has asked officers of his Department to meet with officers of the local authorities concerned, Kildare County Council, South Dublin County Council and Fingal County Council, to discuss the questions of use and management of the property.</P>

    <P>The Lucan Demesne has, of course, an interesting connection in its association with Patrick Sarsfield, the Earl of Lucan, but unfortunately no house or other building survives from that period. However, the property, which I understand amounts to 154 acres, has a number of attractive features.  It includes 34 acres of woodland, mostly deciduous, approximately 23 acres of <Col N="2004" /> land which would be suitable for sports facilities, ten acres of river with associated fishing rights and I am told that last year, which was admittedly an exceptionally good year for fishing, around 130 salmon were caught on this stretch of river.</P>
    <P>I assure the Senator that every effort will be made to complete this acquisition and to make this amenity available to the public at the earliest possible date.  I also acknowledge the role which Senator McGennis played with the groups she mentioned in bringing this issue to fruition.  This is a first step in acquiring further lands along the Liffey Valley to ensure that there is a suitable linear park along the length of and beyond that amenity order.</P>
    <P>I want to put on the record my abhorrence of the practice by developers who own land of offering social bribes, that if they get planning permission to destroy the area, they will provide a football field.  The Government should introduce legislation to ban this practice.</P>
