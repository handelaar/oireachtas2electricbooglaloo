      <P>I have received notice from Senator Byrne that, on the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Education when construction of Cahir community college, County Tipperary, will commence and if it will be included under the 1995 capital programme.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Kelly of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to give approval and financial support to the concept of a Gael campus which combines a Gaelscoil and Gaelcoláiste in Newcastlewest, County Limerick.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine to outline the up to date position regarding the proposed marina for Greystones, County Wicklow.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator McGennis of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="210" /> The need for the Minister for Education to make a statement regarding the inability of a child (details supplied) to secure a place in a special school for the last year and a half; and the action she intends to take to ensure that this child's right to education, as provided for in the Constitution, is provided.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to immediately grant funding to Limerick County Council to alleviate the disastrous situation of the regional and county roads.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senators Byrne's and Kelly's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take item 1 and item 2.  With regard to item 1, it is proposed that the opening speaker for each group will have 20 minutes and each speaker thereafter ten minutes.  The debate will continue until 10 p.m. and if it has not concluded by that time I propose to make further time available at a later date.</P>
      <P>With regard to item 2, which will be taken between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m., it is proposed that the spokesperson for each group will have 30 minutes and other speakers 20 minutes thereafter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader of the House for the arrangements for item 1. The time allocated will hopefully afford most Senators an opportunity to discuss the matter.  I also appreciate that arrangements will be made in the coming weeks to facilitate those Senators who do not get a chance to speak today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to item 2, it is the intention of my party to ensure that all Stages of this Bill will be dealt with this week. <Col N="211" /> Hopefully, and in the interests of the problem which exists at present, the Government will agree to this Bill and tomorrow's Order of Business can be arranged accordingly.</P>
    <P>Over the past couple of weeks we asked for a debate on the Price Waterhouse report.  Hopefully the Leader of the House will be able to give a definite time when the Minister will attend the House to discuss the report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>

      <P>Will the Leader of the House indicate the proposals, if any, to debate the findings of the special subcommittee of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security, and more especially the proposals which the Government has to ensure that committees of this nature, and the committees which are being established at present, have powers of compellability and have powers to reach findings within the context of Oireachtas reform?</P>
      <P>I support Senator Wright's request for a debate on the Defence Forces. This has been a recurring call since the present session commenced after Christmas.  What are the consequences of the Price Waterhouse report and the report of the EAG group?  At present we appear to be confronted with a series of leaks and denials and it is important that the Minister attends the House to tell us specifically what is the Government's policy with regard to the future of the Defence Forces.</P>

      <P>Senator, you are not supposed to carry on with material like this.  Have you a question to the Leader of the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is made in Indonesia. We have two questions on today's Order Paper dealing with atrocities by Indonesians against the people of East Timor.  Will the Leader ask Aer Lingus to stop dealing with the Indonesians and selling their products on our national airline?  It is a scandal when one considers the atrocities which have been carried out by that country.</P>

      <P>Can the Leader of the House give guidance in respect of the role of the Seanad and leaders of the party groups in the Seanad because a statement which undermines the independence of the Judiciary was made by a leader of a party group in this House, namely Senator Magner?  I seek the Leader's guidance as there are provisions in the Constitution which enable us to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very important procedure of the Oireachtas.  The independence of the Judiciary has been undermined by the leader of the Labour Party in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair and the House try to maintain the independence <Col N="213" /> of the Judiciary.  Therefore, it is not discussed openly in the House and certainly not on the Order of Business.  I understand the point the Senator is making.  This would be appropriate for discussion by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and the Senator can ask the Leader to take it up there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that you are concerned about maintaining the independence of the Judiciary.  I ask the Leader of the House, through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, to ensure that no Member of the Oireachtas feels free to undermine that independence unless they propose to adopt the constitutional provisions of impeachment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not say anything about the Judiciary.  I want to ask the Leader a serious question.  Would it be possible to have a debate in the near future on the whole area of neutrality?  I know there is a White Paper on foreign policy due but the issue of neutrality and our membership of the Western European Union and NATO will be of maximum importance to this country.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the people of Swinford for having taken up a suggestion I made here on numerous occasions to invite Orange bands to march in the St. Patrick's Day parade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate in the near future on the tourism industry.  Additional funding <Col N="214" /> is available now and I want to ensure that this House has a voice in supporting the west.  Small tourism developers have not got their fair share up to now.  I hope the new funding from the EU will provide support for small developers.  I am sure the Leader will accommodate the House by arranging a debate on the future of tourism as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Ireland is involved in the Human Genome Project and the European Parliament is debating the directive on biotechnology today.  This is the legal protection of biotechnological invention which allows for the patenting of human life and permits commercial companies to own human genes and cultures of human cells.  It is very likely that this directive will be passed today.  I ask the Leader of the House if the Government has anticipated any of the legislation which will be needed here to follow this extremely serious directive from the European Union?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask about the ongoing review of the Road Traffic Act. What is its current status?  What is the position regarding the drink driving sections and the amendments introduced recently?  Many people directly involved are anxious to know what is happening.  Does the Leader have any information for the House?</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to make time available to discuss drug related crime in Ireland.  He will be aware of the huge quantity of drugs washed up on to the coast recently.  He will also be aware that drugs fuel crime, which affects thousands of families.  I ask the Leader to make time available to debate the drugs issue and law and order.  The Leader's continued reluctance to invite the Minister for Justice to the House raises the suspicion that she has something to hide.  This side has asked many&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Maloney's call for a debate on relations with Indonesia and the question of East Timor.  The point the Senator visually underlined with the small animal is highly important and serious.  I attended a meeting of COSAC in Paris in the last couple of days and I raised the question of East Timor with the French Foreign Minister, Alain Juppé.  The reply I received was basically to the effect that the European Union was not a human rights organisation.  I do not think that is a satisfactory response on behalf of Foreign Ministers of our allies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is relevant that the Minister should be asked to come to the House.  I have asked the Leader to ask the Minister to come to the House.  Barbarism and crookedness have taken over what was the sport of boxing.  The Irish Government has provided £25,000 to run this particular event.</P>

      <P>I referred to Pakistan three weeks ago.  We should keep the pressure on the Government of Pakistan in view of the fact that it is now trying to introduce the Sharia law, which would overpower its civil law.

      <P>It is proposed to take Second Stage of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill, 1995, tomorrow. I understand the Government is to publish a Bill next week which will address some of the problems raised by this Bill. However, I am concerned that the Government would not address all of the issues.  Could the Leader confirm that the Government will extend protection to cases taken under the 1935 Act? There is currently no reporting restrictions at all for sexual offences with under-age girls.  If this is not done, we will be pressing to have this Bill debated.</P>

      <P>There was a request made by a Senator &mdash; I forget by whom &mdash; for a debate on the banking industry.  If a 28 year old yuppie &mdash; as happened in the Barings Bank case &mdash; can affect the British and Irish economies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The point made by Senator Wright about the Arterial Drainage (Amendment) Bill, 1995. anticipates tomorrow's business, so I do not want to deal with it now.  I am surprised, indeed shocked, to see proposals for the curtailment &mdash; I would not use the word guillotine, it was never used in the old regime &mdash; of time proposed for a Bill.  When this Bill was introduced, I said I would give it a reasonable amount of time to be dealt with and I intend to do that.  I do not intend to break with precedent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The business for this week was agreed at the end of last week and there were no objections or counter-proposals.  I intend to stick to the business ordered for this week and if the Bill is completed, well and good; if not, I will make time available next week.  I have no desire to see this Bill either stonewalled or debated for longer than is necessary. <Col N="221" /> It is an important Bill and we are doing the Opposition a courtesy by taking it seriously and allowing time for a full debate.  I hope there will be no talk of guillotines or unseemly motions of this nature tomorrow.</P>
    <P>As regards the Price Waterhouse report on the Defence Forces, the Minister for Defence, Deputy Coveney, has made a number of statements clarifying aspects of it.  He will be in the House next week in his capacity as Minister for the Marine, but Members may be able to ask him questions on defence.  I will try to arrange a debate on defence matters as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis raised a question about the Select Committee on Legislation and Security.  Early next week when the House establishes the new committees &mdash; I intend to allow time for a debate on them &mdash; there will be an opportunity to examine some of the technical questions arising from its report.  It is a matter for Members if they want to discuss the contents of the report.  I am not sure that any useful propose would be served by such a debate, but if Members believe it would be useful, we will do our best to make time available.  The technical question can be discussed next week.</P>
    <P>As regards Senator Maloney's point about the animal which he brought into the House, I will convey his feelings and those of a number of other Senators to Aer Lingus and the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Senator O'Kennedy raised a point which has in part been dealt with by Senator Magner, namely, Senator Magner's status as a first class Whip of the Labour group, but not quite the leader.  As far as I am concerned, Senator Magner spoke in an individual capacity outside the House, as he is entitled to do.  It is not my function to bring this matter to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, but other Members may do so if they wish.  I do not see that the matter warrants referral the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>

      <P>Senator Lydon referred to neutrality.  Reports regarding developments in the EU are still on the Order Paper and neutrality could be debated then.  Perhaps we could discuss Senator McGowan's motion on tourism after we have discussed his motion on the Border areas.  Senator Henry raised some profound questions on biotechnology to which I do not know the answers. This matter, which I heard discussed this morning, warrants further debate. The matter raised by Senator Finneran would probably be better dealt with on the Adjournment and if he is not satisfied that the relevant information has been made available, we could then put it on the Order Paper.</P>
      <P>I have learned in my short time here that it is always one's friends who ask difficult questions.  Senator Cotter asked about the Road Traffic Act, 1993.  I do not have the information he required, but I will try to find it and convey it to him.  I would advise Senator Mulcahy to do his homework a little better.  There was a debate on the drugs situation a few weeks ago; it was one of the first in this session.  Perhaps it passed his notice.</P>

      <P>The Minister will be here in a moment and if the Senator wants to ask her any questions he is free to do so.  Senator Lanigan raised the issues of boxing and health.  I will convey his views to the Minister but I suspect the matter goes beyond the remit of the Minister for Health.  His views on Pakistan were conveyed to the Department <Col N="223" /> of Foreign Affairs and I do not know what action has been taken.</P>
      <P>Senator Kelleher raised the matter of accommodation; that issue is being addressed at present and, I hope, will be resolved shortly.  In reply to Senator Honan I cannot anticipate the Government's Bill on the matter referred to, and I suggest she wait until the Bill is published and if it does not meet her criteria she could raise the matter then.</P>
      <P>Senator Magner raised the matter of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security and I have dealt with that. If a number of Senators want a full discussion on banking, perhaps they would get together, put down a motion and we will try to make time for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard a comment as I was waiting outside that perhaps I was afraid to come to the Seanad.  I assure the House nothing is further from the truth.  I will be happy to come to the Seanad any time as Minister for Justice and answer any questions the House might wish to put.  That applies also to Senator Mulcahy &mdash; I will be happy to answer any questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted to have this opportunity to open an historic debate in this Chamber.  The Taoiseach would have been here if he was not confined to bed with a serious 'flu.  He recognises the enormity of this historic occasion in the Seanad.  The Joint Framework Document, <i>A New Framework for Agreement</i>, <Col N="225" /> is potentially of enormous significance for the future political, social and economic development of this island. Those of us privileged to be present in Belfast when the document was launched by the Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, and the British Prime Minister, John Major, could not fail to have been moved by the sense of history in the making.</P>
    <P>It is our job now to get on with the political debate generated by that historic event and to ensure that the publication of <i>A New Framework for Agreement</i> marks a major step towards a new beginning in the history of this island in which violence for political ends has no place or part to play.</P>
    <P>The publication of the Framework Document creates an unrivalled opportunity to consolidate the peace process on this island and to secure its integration into the wider talks process.  The publication of <i>A New Framework for Agreement</i> follows from other achievements of the past 14 months &mdash; the adoption of the Joint Declaration in Downing Street on 17 December 1993; the announcement by the Provisional IRA of its cessation of military operations on 31 August last; the announcement by the Combined Loyalist Military Command of its decision to cease all operational hostilities on 13 October last; the establishment of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation by the Government, and the engagement of the Governments in dialogue with Sinn Féin, the Progressive Unionist Party and the Ulster Democratic Party.</P>
    <P>Those developments have combined to replace despair with hope.  They have combined to create a unique sense of opportunity unmatched on the occasion of any previous initiative intended to address the problems of Northern Ireland during the past quarter century of conflict.  People throughout this island are looking to their political representatives, both North and South, to grasp this opportunity to secure a lasting peace and an equitable political settlement. They will not easily or quickly <Col N="226" /> forgive us if that opportunity is squandered or lost.</P>
    <P>That places a heavy burden on all those involved to approach the wider dialogue that should follow publication of the Framework Document in an open and constructive way.  We need to be sensitive to the concerns of those whom we seek to engage in dialogue and we must be constructive in addressing those concerns.  That duty applies to all parties involved in the process and I hope that parties on all sides of the debate will enter dialogue in that spirit.  The moment for instant analysis and comment is already past.</P>
    <P>Now is the time for calm reflection and consideration of the actual content of the Framework Document.  It is a complex document that has evolved over a considerable time.  It addresses the most intractable political problem on this island and deserves the deepest study and analysis on all our parts.  I now wish to turn to the document itself.</P>
    <P>Central to the approach in <i>A New Framework for Agreement</i> are a number of guiding principles which inform its treatment of the different aspects of any arrangements that might flow from future talks.  Those guiding principles are not new but what is new is the manner in which they have been applied across the spectrum of the relationships that need to be addressed if lasting peace and stability on this island are to be secured.</P>
    <P>In that way, those guiding principles ensure the necessary balance in the proposals <i>A New Framework for Agreement</i> contains.  The principles concerned are: the principle of self-determination as set out in the Downing Street Declaration adopted by the two Governments in December 1993; the principle of consent; the principle that agreement must be pursued and established by exclusively democratic means without resort to violence or coercion; and the principle that any new political arrangement must be based on full respect for the rights and identities of both traditions.</P>
    <P>The structures and arrangements proposed in the Framework Document <Col N="227" /> which those principles inform are concerned with three distinct relationships which need to be part of any settlement: the relationship between the two communities in Northern Ireland; the relationship between both parts of the island of Ireland; and the relationship between the two sovereign Governments. The requirement, for the purpose of the establishment and operation of structures within Northern Ireland itself, is that they are capable of securing cross-community support.  <i>A New Framework for Agreement</i> confirms that this remains an essential requirement in the view of both Governments.  Moreover, these structures should be capable of enabling the elected representatives in Northern Ireland to exercise shared administration and legislative control over all those matters that can be agreed across both communities and which can most effectively and appropriately be dealt with at that level.  The two Governments believe that those structures can be most effectively negotiated through direct dialogue involving the parties in Northern Ireland itself, as part of a comprehensive three stranded approach.</P>
    <P>The new North-South structures referred to in the document are for the purpose of addressing the relationship between the two parts of Ireland.  Any such structures must be capable of creating a new beginning for relationships within the island of Ireland.  They also need to acknowledge the simple fact that there are many matters of common interest to both parts of the island.</P>
    <P>That is why the Framework Document suggests new institutions to cater for future political, social, cultural, economic interconnections which would permit elected representatives of democratic institutions.  North and South, to enter into new co-operative and constructive relationships.</P>
    <P>What the two Governments propose in that regard is a new North-South body involving Heads of Department on both sides, that would be duly established and maintained by legislation in <Col N="228" /> both sovereign Parliaments.  The intention is that that body would bring together Ministers representing the Irish Government and political Heads of Departments from the new democratic institutions in Northern Ireland. They would discharge or oversee delegated executive, harmonising or consultative functions over a range of matters which the two Governments would designate in the first instance in agreement with the parties, and to which the two Administrations, North and South, could subsequently add.</P>
    <P>The criteria which the Governments suggest should be applied in determining which functions could usefully be discharged by the new North-South body are objectively based.  Those criteria include the common interest in a given matter on the part of both parts of the island, the mutual advantage of addressing a matter together, the mutual benefit which may derive from the matter being administered by the North-South body, the achievement of economies of scale and the avoidance of unnecessary duplication of effort.</P>
    <P>Maximum flexibility is ensured by providing that functions designated in accordance with these criteria could fall into three broad categories where the objective would be consultative, harmonising or executive.  That will enable specific functions to be dealt with in the manner appropriate to the particular needs of the function in question.  Thus in some cases the only requirement would be for the two sides to exchange information and consult with each other about existing and future policy while in others the requirement would extend to the establishment of an agreed policy and its implementation on a joint basis.</P>
    <P>In keeping with the principles which underlie all their proposals, the Governments propose that the new North-South body should operate on the basis of agreement and democratic accountability. It will be a matter for the two Governments in the first instance to designate the functions to be delegated to it acting in agreement with the parties and, thereafter, a matter for agreement <Col N="229" /> between the two Administrations, North and South.</P>
    <P>Equally the Governments envisage that decisions within the body would be by agreement between the two sides and that the Heads of Department would exercise their powers in accordance with the rules for democratic authority and accountability in force in the Oireachtas and in the new institutions in Northern Ireland.  The operation of the North-South body would also be subject to regular scrutiny in agreed political institutions in Northern Ireland and the Oireachtas generally.</P>
    <P>The two Governments also believe that there is need to address again the relationship between the two Governments themselves.  The intention would be to enhance the existing basis for co-operation and to support and underwrite the fair and effective operation of the new arrangements.</P>
    <P>What is envisaged is a broadly based agreement which would maintain a standing Anglo-Irish intergovernmental conference serviced by a permanent secretariat of civil servants drawn from both Governments.  The conference will continue to provide institutional expression for this Government's concern and role in relation to Northern Ireland.  The conference will also represent the principal instrument for an intensification of co-operation and partnership between both Governments.</P>
    <P>Matters for which responsibility is transferred to new political institutions in Northern Ireland will, of course, be excluded from consideration in the conference except in the specific circumstances provided for in the document. One issue, however, that is likely to remain a matter for east-west co-operation for the time being at least is the issue of law and order in which I, as Minister for Justice, naturally have a particular interest.</P>
    <P>The Framework Document recognises that the issue of law and order is closely linked to the issue of political consensus.  It identifies policing and the task of enhancing community identification with policing in Northern Ireland <Col N="230" /> as an important issue and an area in which the climate of peace and the growth of agreement may offer new possibilities and opportunities.</P>
    <P>Consolidating the peace process can provide an important dividend in relation to policing in both jurisdictions. New opportunities to enhance community identification with policing in Northern Ireland will be created and imagination will be required if those opportunities are to be fully realised. Resources will be freed in both jurisdictions to tackle forms of criminal activity which are a source of real concern to communities throughout this island.  One of the peace dividends will be additional resources to tackle the scourge of drugs and the pushers who prey on our youth.  North and South, additional resources to tackle the activities of organised criminal gangs and the creation of a more secure environment which can be enjoyed by all.</P>
    <P>An overall settlement in Northern Ireland requires a balanced constitutional accommodation which recognises the legitimate aspirations of both traditions on this island.  The two Governments recognise that fact and signal their readiness to address constitutional issues as part of an overall settlement in <i>A New Framework for Agreement.</i>  That means ensuring that the basic law of both jurisdictions adequately reflects the commitments entered into and the reality of the diverse aspirations of the two traditions.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government is prepared to introduce and support proposals for change in the Constitution to implement the commitments contained in the Framework Document and in the Downing Street Joint Declaration. Those changes will fully reflect the principle of self determination and consent. The principles underlying those changes will be to remove any jurisdictional or territorial claim of legal right over the territory of Northern Ireland contrary to the will of its people and to provide that the creation of a sovereign united Ireland could therefore only occur in <Col N="231" /> circumstances where a majority of the people in Northern Ireland formally choose to be part of a united Ireland. That will not affect the maintenance of the existing birthright of everyone born in either jurisdiction to be part of the Irish nation as of right.</P>
    <P>The British Government equally signals its readiness to uphold the democratic wish of a greater number of the people of Northern Ireland on the issue of whether they prefer to support the union or a sovereign united Ireland and will also embody the principles and commitments in the joint declaration and in the Framework Document in their constitutional legislation.  That will be effected by way of an amendment of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, or by its replacement by appropriate new legislation and appropriate new provisions entrenched by agreement.</P>
    <P>There has been some comment about the fact that details of proposed amendments to the Constitution were not published by the Government in conjunction with the publication of the Framework Document.  The Government decided against publishing details of the proposed amendments because it believed that it would not be appropriate to do so.  The detailed wording of changes to the Constitution is a matter for the Government, the Oireachtas and ultimately the people.  We have spelled out the principles which will be involved and have given our commitment as to the nature of the changes which we are prepared to support.  What has been said leaves no room for doubt as to our bona fides.</P>
    <P>It has been emphasised by those of us who spoke on the Framework Document in the Dáil and by the British Government representatives also that it is not a blueprint to be imposed on anybody but is intended essentially to assist discussion and negotiation involving the Northern Ireland political parties.  It represents the considered and shared assessment of both Governments as to what might constitute an agreed outcome from future talks involving the <Col N="232" /> Government and the parties.  The accommodation which it suggests is intended to enable the people of this island to work together constructively for their mutual benefit without compromising the essential principles or the long term aspirations or interests of either tradition or community.  It does not and is not intended to threaten either tradition but &mdash; and we make no apology for this &mdash; it is intended to challenge both.</P>
    <P>Neither Government claims a monopoly of wisdom and both remain open to proposals or suggestions from the parties themselves.  We fully expect the parties to come forward with their own proposals but the challenge for them &mdash; as it has been for us &mdash; will be to achieve balance and demonstrate the necessary willingness to accommodate legitimate recognition of competing aspirations. The Governments will be fully prepared to build on any area where general agreement can be secured provided that that agreement contributes to a comprehensive settlement which addresses the three sets of relationships involved.</P>
    <P>The important thing now is for the process of dialogue and debate to get under way and this debate is part of that process.  We see the publication of <i>A New Framework for Agreement</i> as providing direction and a basis for structured discussions.  The Irish Government wants comprehensive negotiations to get under way as quickly as possible. The people of this island want those negotiations and are looking to their political representatives to engage in that process.</P>
    <P>I would, in conclusion, like to pay tribute to those who have been involved in the process leading to publication of <i>A New Framework for Agreement.</i>  It is the product of considerable work by both the Irish and UK Governments and their teams of advisers.  A special mention in that regard deserves to be made of the former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, who played a crucial part in moving the process forward in particular through the momentum created by the peace process.  I pay tribute to <Col N="233" /> Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn who, as Minister for Justice, played a vital role in the process and in the discussions on the Framework Document.  I also pay tribute to the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, who was involved in this historic process from the beginning.</P>
    <P>I commend <i>A New Framework for Agreement</i> to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Minister in putting on record our appreciation of the efforts of those who brought about this happy event which enables us to discuss the historic document, <i>A New Framework for Agreement.</i> Her generous recognition of the role of the former Taoiseach, which I endorse, of the current Tánaiste and of others, is a signal of the type of approach we must adopt while reflecting on and discussing this issue. Each of them made a major contribution during their time.  I hope that whatever we say in this House will help to advance the peace process and I am confident that will happen.</P>
      <P>The contributions in this House to the Northern Ireland debates over the years have been positive and, I hope, tolerant. One must also recognise the role of the SDLP leader, Mr. John Hume, and his contribution to peace over the years, which puts him in a unique position not only on this island, but in Europe and, perhaps, in our relations with other countries.  His steadfastness throughout difficult periods and experiences, some of which I witnessed in his own home, has been vindicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Framework Document embodies all the principles which brought about the ceasefire.  Those involved in that ceasefire also deserve our recognition for their contributions, despite more negative contributions in previous years. We should endorse their courage to turn back from violence.  For that reason I include the people who represent the views of paramilitary organisations with those who have brought about the historic basis for agreement.  On the Sinn Féin side.  I include Mr. Gerry Adams and his associates who have committed <Col N="234" /> themselves to maintaining, continuing and building the peace process so that we will never again sink back into violence. We must also recognise the loyalist paramilitaries through their loosely connected political representatives, such as Mr. Gary McMichael and company, who, apart from making a major contribution through the cessation of violence which they announced last October, have also adopted a positive and vigorous attitude which can be expanded through the peace process.  One must recognise this as a significant change and a message of great hope.</P>
    <P>Those who have been involved in bringing this process to where it is today must not only be allowed but encouraged to continue their common purpose in the democratic negotiations through agreement which, as the Minister pointed out, are crucial to this process. Without agreement no further steps will be taken with this programme.  All those who have brought the process to the current stage must be encouraged to build on it together for the future.  The commitment of those people, who have taken political and other risks, will be vindicated through success, hopefully sooner rather than later but even if it is later, there will be eventual success.</P>
    <P>I address the Unionist people and their political representatives in a sense not just of recognition and appreciation but also of respect for their separate, valid, historic identity.  Regrettably, at this point the only voices against what may be achieved through this framework are those of the DUP and OUP representatives, although that does not apply to all shades of unionism.  They have absented themselves from and are depriving themselves of a role with huge potential.</P>
    <P>The only criticism I make of Unionist representatives is this: we celebrate the peace which has lasted to date but how much have they contributed to it?  Their people want to see this peace maintained. The Unionist politicians have not contributed to the end of the peace, far from it.  However, how much thought have they given to the contribution they <Col N="235" /> can make to securing the peace permanently?</P>
    <P>If any group on this island, from any background or tradition, wants to see peace and normality on a permanent basis, it must be the often isolated and under siege northern Protestant Orange community.  We must now reassure them.  We must show them the prize of peace; and one can hear from individuals on the Shankill or on Sandy Row that is a prize they do not want to lose. For that reason their political representatives should take up this huge new challenge and opportunity.</P>
    <P>The reaction of Unionist representatives was predictable but in one sense one could empathise with their apprehension, even with their suspicion.  As one of their spokespersons said recently, they now see both Governments, the SDLP, the Alliance Party, Sinn Féin and the Popular Unionist Party combining to bring about the conditions for this framework; and alone against them are the people who have isolated themselves.</P>
    <P>It is not surprising in those circumstances that they are apprehensive about the contents of this document and suspicious of where it may lead them. For that reason the only guarantee they have for the future is the role they will insist on playing themselves.  I have no doubt of their capacity to play a positive role.  In a sense they see themselves as deserted by their guarantors.  They protest &mdash; as we have seen during the last weeks and months &mdash; individually and collectively against what they call the treachery of the British Government, how they have been misled by that Government and how it duped and deceived them.  They protest day in and day out.  I do not believe that they have been duped, deceived or misled but one must recognise that the British Government is giving them clear signals which is clear from the tone of this document.</P>
    <P>Could anybody imagine the British Government drawing up a framework for agreenient of this nature in respect of Scotland and Wales?  That is what the <Col N="236" /> Unionists expect it to do and they should recognise this clear signal from the British Government.  Does anybody imagine that the British Government would make the historic declaration &mdash; as it has made in the context of Northern Ireland &mdash; that it has no strategic or selfish interest in Scotland, Edinburgh or Cardiff?  However, it is saying that up front in respect of Northern Ireland in both the Framework Document and the joint declaration.  The Unionist representatives are realistic in saying that this document creates a new dimension and something quite different from the guarantee they had hitherto as part of the United Kingdom.  Looking at the document one would have to agree with their observation.</P>
    <P>Why not turn to other opportunities without turning from their inheritance which has made them distinctive and proud?  Why not seek to achieve new potential, dignity, status and &mdash; if I may call it that &mdash; new independence rather than a dependence on others who may reject them, as they have recently perceived them to do?  Why not seek mutual interdependence on a range of other people who will respect them and the dynamism they can offer in new arrangements?</P>
    <P>Another matter is significant to Unionists although they might not find it reassuring.  The statements from Sinn Féin at its annual ard-fheis &mdash; which would otherwise have been censored &mdash; were significant in their attitude to their fellow countrymen in the Unionist community. The focus of that árd-fheis was on reassuring and appealing to that community &mdash; I realise it will not be achieved overnight &mdash; and even on helping people to forget the injury of the past to move towards the promise of the future.  I have never seen such a theme emerge from a Sinn Féin Ard-Fheis.  In a sense they were saying that the independence they can demonstrate together, with whatever agreement will be achieved with the British and Irish Governments, is the best and, perhaps, the only guarantee for the future.  I share that opinion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="237" /> The joint declaration acknowledges the current situation as the cause of conflict. It acknowledges in the first paragraph that &ldquo;the most urgent and important issue facing the people of Ireland, north and south, and the British and Irish Governments together, is to remove the causes of conflict, to overcome the legacy of history and to heal the divisions which have resulted....&rdquo;. That is stating in effect that the position hitherto is a cause of conflict, a regrettable legacy of history and a cause of divisions that must be healed.  That is, perhaps, an unduly negative view.</P>
    <P>The role and tradition of the Protestant Orangeman is vital and dynamic and should not be simply associated with the cause of conflict, the legacy of history or a division that needs to be healed.  In a negative view it can be seen thus.  However, look at the positive independent spirit of the Unionist Orangeman and Protestant entrepreneur in building up industry and agriculture over the years.  We often pride ourselves on our contribution to American history but look at the contribution of the Protestant tradition.  It contributed five or six presidents before a president from what could be called an ethnic Catholic background was elected. As a fellow Irishman sharing this island, I insist that it is a positive inheritance. We should not simply focus on matters of regret.  I regret that such a huge and powerful dimension for good and achievement has been suffocated. However, I hope it can be released to positive effect through the Framework Document.</P>
    <P>The irony is that the biggest problem the Unionist representatives have with the Framework Document is in relation to North-South institutions.  Oddly enough, I consider that to be the biggest opportunity for Unionist representatives. North-South institutions will work by agreement and only on what will be ceded by agreement between the power sharing parliament to be established in Northern Ireland, our Government and the British Government.  How can they be afraid of something to which they <Col N="238" /> will agree?  There are other reasons this attitude is inconsistent and almost incomprehensible.  These institutions will open avenues of involvement, influence and decision making &mdash; of which they have been deprived for so long.</P>
    <P>A range of areas in the European Community are of vital importance.  I have witnessed &mdash; since I first attended Council of Ministers meetings in 1972 &mdash; representatives from Northern Ireland locked outside on the corridors.  Why should they lock themselves out of the institutions of the European Community? Why should they deprive themselves &mdash; or what right will we have to deprive them &mdash; of a direct and meaningful role by agreement at the Council of Ministers or of direct representation in the Commission where they have not been represented, are not represented and, under current structures, never will be represented?  In the areas such as agriculture why should Northern Protestant farmers have had to approach me furtively through informal contacts or on my visits to Balmoral to ask us to protect their interests &mdash; which were in line with our interests and opposed to the interests being expressed by the British Minister for Agriculture &mdash; at the Council of Ministers?  That is not a criticism, it is a simple fact and it is for that reason that I believe they should not deprive themselves of the opportunity to be involved.</P>
    <P>I want to say a brief word about Article 2 and any constitutional agreements we come to.  I could never accept that Article 2 represents, or could represent, a claim by Dublin on Northern Ireland.  We have no right to make any such claim.  All we do is say that together we have a common inheritance and as long as they understand that it never can or will represent a claim of right by us on them, and then I think they may be further reassured.  At the end of the day, this offers an opportunity to see equal opportunity, equal treatment and real parity of esteem for all across the whole range of issues and ironically, this is something we need to demonstrate to our Unionist colleagues. <Col N="239" /> We want to see a parity of esteem for them when the reaction to the Unionist community, not just in Britain &mdash; as recent opinion polls have demonstrated &mdash; but throughout Europe and the rest of the world, is not as healthy, warm and kind as it will be when they play a positive role in their own interests under the opportunities afforded by <i>A New Framework for Agreement.</i></P>
    <P>In 1975 I introduced a policy statement on behalf of my party which was based on that coming together by agreement. It was misunderstood at the time and I regret that very much.  I am happy to see that now &mdash; collectively, as with the Anglo-Irish Summit at Dublin Castle when we talked about the totality of relationships &mdash; we have a Framework Document that embodies, in a positive and sympathetic way, all the opportunity I tried to introduce in policy statements and in the totality of relations agreement as long ago as 1975 and 1981.  I am confident this will get the result it deserves.  As the old Irish says: &ldquo;Toradh a shaothar&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>As a student in the early 1960s, I remember working &mdash; as many students did and still do &mdash; canning peas during the summer in Wisbech, East Anglia to make money.  It was the first time I met students from Northern Ireland from the Protestant tradition at close quarters and over a sustained period.  Up to that time I knew a great number of northern students at University College, Dublin, but they were all from the one tradition; they played football well, hurling badly and rugby not at all.  They were all Catholic, Gaelic, great companions, friends and partygoers but they all came from the Catholic Nationalist tradition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was my view of Northern Ireland until I met these students from the Protestant tradition and I became friends with many of them.  What struck me most about them at that particular time was that for them, as for most of us, the history of the recent past if not dead, was fast receding and old bigotries <Col N="240" /> were fast dying out.  Bigotry was not fashionable and the mood was very much influenced by the mood of openness and change which affected all parts of society then.  I remember returning that summer thinking and believing it was only a matter of time before the issues which had dominated the past would disappear and what we called normal politics would become the norm on this island.  Sadly, due to political mismanagement, malevolence, lack of imagination and failure to grasp opportunities, all of us on this island &mdash; particularly those in the north-eastern corner &mdash; have had to live through 25 or 26 years of hell; the problem grew steadily worse, lives were lost, destruction became the norm and the possibility of a lasting political settlement seemed most unlikely.  There were many attempts to resolve the problem.  Different Taoisigh and Ministers for External Affairs did their best over the years but on every occasion their efforts failed. Thankfully on each occasion lessons were learned and past mistakes were, for the most part, not repeated.  For the first time we are at a stage where we can believe, with a fair degree of confidence, that there is a framework in place which will allow for a long term resolution of the problem in a way not overly threatening to any of those involved.</P>
    <P>The first thing we should do is to contrast the reaction last week to the Framework Document with the reaction to the Anglo-Irish Agreement in 1985; remember that the Anglo-Irish Agreement meant two new principles &mdash; that the Irish Republic did have a legitimate interest in what was happening in Northern Ireland and that the Irish Government should have a voice in some decisions affecting the Nationalist people of Northern Ireland.  Contrast the present situation with that of 1985; the fanatical rejection by thousands of people of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, the unwillingness to even discuss it or to accept that any part of it might have been justified or was actuated by anything other than malice or ill will on the part of the Irish and British Governments. <Col N="241" /> Contrast that with the calm acceptance of the document last week. Contrast that with the queues lining up to get copies of the document to read and discuss.  Many people may not have liked part or all of what they found, but they were at least discussing, in small reasonable groups, what that Framework Document contained.  That, in one sense, is the best indication of what has happened over the past ten years, and what has happened since the miracle of peace descended on Northern Ireland based on the Downing Street Declaration and the cease-fire six months ago to this day.</P>
    <P>The effect of peace in Northern Ireland has transformed the way people look at both the present and, more particularly, the future.  When we look at the reaction of the Unionist community we can see that the reaction, although somewhat agitated and angry, did not contain the same degree of virulence or intransigence that was obvious ten years ago.  In some cases there was almost an acceptance that certain motions had to be gone through and certain positions stated before the real talking began.  Again contrast the reaction in 1985, in this part of the country, to the present situation.  This time every party in this House is unanimously behind the Framework Document, unlike the situation in 1985.  Contrast the position of Sinn Féin in 1985 to that of today.  In 1985 Sinn Féin was as violently opposed to the Anglo-Irish Agreement as was lan Paisley.  Today Sinn Féin has accepted the Framework Document calmly, methodically and is prepared to debate it line by line.  That is an enormous change from what happened in 1985.  Sinn Féin, out of the shadow of violence, has all the potential of a strong, powerful political party of the future which, away from the tyranny of the gunman and based on democratic principles and practices, could revolutionise the politics of this country.</P>
    <P>These are things which have changed in ten short years and particularly in the year since the Downing Street Declaration. When this document appeared, <Col N="242" /> some commentators tended to see it and its progenitors as grey and boring.  One commentator described it as badly written with no great style or drama.  I could not agree less.  Every sentence in this Framework Document is pregnant with meaning and possibility.  There is not a spare, surplus word in the entire document. Virtually every aspect of the political life of the two parts of the island, and of relationships between the two islands, is covered in it.</P>
    <P>The possibilities are enormous and the Minister focused on some of them. When history comes to be written about this period the Framework Document will be the great document of the last 25 to 26 years and will rank in the history of this island with perhaps the Proclamation of 1916 as a defining, signifying document, because all the principles upon which we would want to base our political life &mdash; the political life of the two parts of the island &mdash; are contained within it.</P>
    <P>The document also signifies very strongly the common sense of purpose of the two Governments.  Never before in our history have the two sovereign Governments, which have responsibility for these two islands, been so united in common cause in their determination to give the problem their best shot, and this document is their best shot.  They have examined, studied, discussed and debated the problem and the accumulation of their own involvement, and of history, are all contained in the document.</P>
    <P>However, coming out clearly, in virtually every sense of the document, is the determination of the two Governments that they will see this document through.  They will bring to fruition every part of it that they can, irrespective of whether they have the co-operation of all the parties involved, although it is obviously to be hoped that they will.</P>
    <P>In her speech the Minister placed great emphasis on the central question of consent in the document.  I do not intend to dwell on this, but it is no harm to reflect on this issue, and to be honest <Col N="243" /> about our attitude to consent in the past.  It is only in comparatively recent times that we have come to have a generous sense of what the word &ldquo;consent&rdquo; seems to mean.  In the past, consent seemed to mean that the northern Unionists would some day get sense and join us.  They would see that we were right and they were wrong and that we would be generous.  It was, in a sense, a slightly biased type of ecumenism, an ecumenism on our terms.  It is only in recent times that all parties, and especially Sinn Féin &mdash; and I hope that its actions will match up to its words in this regard &mdash; have come to realise that consent means consent, the right of people to remain British if they so desire, to express their sense of Britishness and their right to withhold as well as to give consent.</P>
    <P>The document also has, in its short number of pages, a sense of space. There is room for both traditions to breathe within the confines of the document &mdash; to flex their muscles and live their own lives without being crowded by the other.  It is this non-threatening aspect of the document which people should find reassuring, and I hope they will.</P>
    <P>The possibilities of growth within the document are striking.  The Minister made very interesting references to the whole concept of policing, of the possibilities in the very near future of the redeployment of police resources &mdash; North and South &mdash; of inter-community and new forms of policing, but also tackling the kind of problems which are eating away at different aspects of our society, especially gangsterism, drugs and so on.</P>
    <P>There is, therefore, within the document a sense of growth.  Another example is the growth of the democratic institutions, such as the new North-South parliamentary body.  What a wonderful thing it would be if we were sending our representatives from this House and the other House to meet our elected opposite numbers in Northern Ireland, discussing the problems which <Col N="244" /> are common to politicians in all parts of the island and working together within a democratic political assembly for the whole island.</P>
    <P>There are also all the other possibilities, for example co-operation over a huge range of functional areas.  In some ways this is one of the most heartening aspects of the document.  One of the things which strikes me about it is how ordinary most of the activities are with which it deals.  They are ordinary, everyday things of life, but vital and essential nevertheless such as railways, roads, drainage, co-operation in education at all levels, tourism and agriculture.</P>
    <P>If the two Governments can be seen, through the new agencies, working together in the common interest on these ordinary everyday problems, then the process will gain enormous strength. Governments do not have to be loved; few Governments are.  Governments have to be accepted and they must be competent.  If, in what follows from this document, new institutions can be seen to be doing a good job &mdash; for example, for the northern farmers and fishermen &mdash; if they can provide better railway services, better roads and common cause in tourism, then the people on both sides of the Border, but especially on the northern side, will come to realise the effectiveness and the value of what has been done in the things which matter most to them in their everyday lives.</P>
    <P>This can be done away from the domination of symbols which threaten one side or another, and if the work can be undertaken, therein lies the great strength for the development of the institutions.  It is no accident that the integration of Europe began like this &mdash; the integration of various economic functions, spread out bit by bit until there was an integrated Europe, but a Europe which still allows the identity and the sense of self of each of the member states.  I, therefore, welcome and am excited by the possibility of co-operation over so many areas.  Already people on both parts of the island are applying their imagination to see how this co-operation can work and how <Col N="245" /> they can, in a real sense, benefit from the very real cash possibilities which are there to facilitate it.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects to the document, for example the sense of openness in it.  The history of relations in the past, North and South, is bedevilled by charges of had faith, hidden agendas and secret deals.  Everything in this document is open, above board and on the table.  I do not believe the Government has any hidden agenda or ulterior motive and is not saying what it means fully, other than in the document.  Similarly, John Major does not have a hidden agenda.  Of all British Prime Ministers, John Major, beset by great domestic difficulties, has given the Northern Ireland problem his full attention and energy.  I believe totally in his good faith.  We all know that he has enormous, delicate political problems within the House of Commons and we all wish that he had a bigger majority. However, in spite of all this, he has stuck resolutely with the purpose, of bringing the Framework Document to fruition and advancing after that.</P>
    <P>There are huge issues involved, for example, the question of the decommissioning of arms is enormously difficult. One only has to think about it a little to realise how difficult it is on both sides.  The sense that there are arms, that they may be used again and that they have been used in the past against loved ones is something which brings an element of distrust and emotion to the debate.  This morning, the Tánaiste was on to what may well be a fruitful and positive line of discussion when he talked about &mdash; not immediately but down the line &mdash; the possibility of some outside agency acting in the decommissioning of arms.</P>
    <P>There are arms on both sides, there are problems associated with policing and with the presence of the British army, all of which must be addressed. There cannot be a unilateral decommissioning of arms on one side and it would be a great mistake if the debate was distracted into this issue away from <Col N="246" /> the real substance it should be addressing.</P>
    <P>Perhaps one of the most positive signs of all in the Framework Document has been the degree of international support it has achieved.  This has not happened by accident, nor is it an empty gesture. Other countries who are our partners in the EU know that the politics of Northern Ireland have been an anachronism for a very long time.  They also know that the politics of Northern Ireland have distracted the efforts of people on both sides of the island from what we might call normal, ordinary politics.</P>
    <P>They have put their support and money behind the Framework Document and what it entails. So, too, have major countries, particularly the US, the commitment of whose President, at what is a difficult time for him, is something from which we must all take sustenance. The extraordinary degree of support right across the two great parties of American politics among Senators and Congressmen, the very high level of knowledge and the almost total commitment to what the two Governments are doing must give us all cause for hope that their good wishes and advice will not be ignored by those who can make the document fail or succeed.</P>
    <P>I wish to conclude by reading into the record part of a speech by Senator Patrick Leahy, a Democrat from Vermont who is one of the great friends of Ireland in the US Senate.  He was here two weeks ago and I had the honour of meeting him.  Last week, after the issuing of the Framework Document he made the following statement in the US Senate about his visit to Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>It made a profound impression on me.  Change in Northern Ireland is inevitable but the Framework Document should threaten no one.  It would give a majority of the people of Northern Ireland the right to decide their future.  It is equally important to recognise that any lasting <Col N="247" /> peace, any healthy society, must be rooted in equal justice.  The fundamental civil rights of both Catholics and Protestants must be protected.</P>
    <P>He sees those rights protected in the Framework Document.</P>
    <P>I commend this document to the House.  I believe it is the single most important document to appear in my lifetime and I hope it will prove to be what we all want it to be &mdash; the basis and framework within which lasting peace and reconciliation can be achieved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. F. Quinn Mr. F. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make four quick points, all of which aim in a practical way to move the peace process along.  My first point is about the need to get the parties around the table talking, about which we heard a great deal in the past week.  The Framework Document is seen as a stepping stone to interparty talks in the North.  I suggest that the time and the need are not for talking but for listening.  History, including the history of the past week, has shown that both traditions on this island are bad listeners. We talk a great deal but we listen very little.  However, the only way to get an agreement is by genuinely listening to what others have to say, which we do not do often enough in either tradition, North and South.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have an American friend from Chicago called Michael O'Connor who interrupted me some years ago to say that God gave us one mouth and two ears because he expected us to listen twice as much as we talk.  That is a lesson we might learn on this island because we tend to listen not in order to understand the other point of view but to search out weaknesses in it to which we can then respond.  In the field of communication we are much more <Col N="248" /> ready to give than to receive.  Instead of looking for talks we should look for &ldquo;listens&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Second, we will move forward faster and more surely if we defuse the present sense of urgency.  We need patience and not pressure.  The &ldquo;Berlin Walls&rdquo; in people's minds do not come down overnight and we slow up the process by expecting that they will.  It is critical to start the healing process which is genuinely urgent.  However, for the healing to be a real reconciliation we must accept that it will take a very long time and it is only when that healing process itself is eventually complete that we will ever be able to put together a permanent settlement of our differences.  I was delighted that the Minister, Deputy Owen, stressed the importance of patience in her speech.</P>
    <P>Third, we will not get far if we take the phrase &ldquo;Framework Document&rdquo; literally. It is only an appropriate term if it refers to a framework people must agree, where the framework is fixed but the details are up for grabs.  If that is not what is meant it is not a framework but a straitjacket, which is the very last thing we need in these circumstances.  We are getting conflicting signals.  The rhetoric accompanying the document says that it is not a blueprint but just a suggestion in which everything is up for grabs. However, the document itself reads in a far more hard edged way.  It is not just the name, although that is part of it. Running right through the Framework Document is the assumption that there are only two choices facing the people of Northern Ireland: one is the present constitutional position with frills that genuflect to the National tradition; the other is a united Ireland with frills which genuflect to the Unionist tradition. The first choice will remain until such time as the people change their minds and the second choice will then come into play.</P>
    <P>The whole Framework Document is based on the assumption that there are only these two possibilities.  That, in itself, is sufficient argument for regarding it only as a consultative document. <Col N="249" /> We should not restrict ourselves to those two models but seek as many as we can find to expand our choice.  We must do that because I doubt whether the choice of two options with which the document presents will perform the miracle of squaring the circle and reconciling the two traditions.</P>
    <P>My final point is addressed to people in the South.  It is time we considered making a unilateral gesture of goodwill to the Unionist community to show that we approach this process in a spirit of friendship and that we can give something without always demanding something in return.  I say this from my experience of difficult business negotiations where, out of the blue, one side is generous.  That generosity breaks deadlocks and suddenly the other side says that perhaps they can trust the people with whom they are negotiating.</P>
    <P>We should look for a gesture to show the Unionists that we are open to change and can do something difficult which genuinely hurts us as a contribution to the peace process.  There is a time for hard ball, face to face, across the table, tough negotiation.  However, there is also a time for generosity and goodwill.  Now is the time for generosity. Let us put our heads together and see if we can find an act of generosity to put on the table without looking for something in return.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Quinn for sharing his time and I welcome the Minister to the House.</P>
      <P>This document is very welcome.  It is one of the most important documents which I have seen about Northern Ireland where, despite all our rhetoric, we have shown very little genuine concern for the people whose day to day lives have been so tragically affected over the last 25 years.  This Government must be congratulated but also the previous Government of Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party.  Deputy Reynolds and the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, put such work and energy into drawing up this document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="250" /> Congratulations are also due to the British Government, the Prime Minister, John Major, and Sir Patrick Mayhew.  In a time of real crisis the British Government has continued to keep this development going and we owe it a great debt of gratitude.  I hope that 10 p.m. tonight will not bring anything too dramatic to the fortunes of John Major.</P>
    <P>This document merely expresses the great need for co-operation between people in Northern Ireland and all the people on this island.  One of the most fascinating things I find is that everybody who talks about the document picks out areas where they can see that co-operation would be beneficial for everyone on the island.  I have bored everyone to death at the forum by talking about my all-island health institution, which I would run single handediy if necessary.  It would involve those from Northern Ireland and the South who could join me in setting up a preventative medicine programme, health promotion and various other policies, such as what can be done about drugs.</P>
    <P>I note that Minister Owen again mentioned looking at the drugs problem here on an all-island basis.  This type of thing is not unusual.  For example, all the Nordic countries co-operate in the Nordic council.  We must look at other models abroad and examine where they can be applied here because they are to the material advantage of all on the island.  It is not that one group will be more advantaged than another, this will help us all.</P>
    <P>This is a time when tremendous courage is needed by everyone to keep the momentum going.  In particular, Unionists need courage.  Given that I am a Protestant in the South, I always try to express what I think some of the northerners might feel about some things down here.  I receive a healthy amount of support in general, which I hope they notice.  However, it is a time when they really need to have courage and to try to consider that their position is not being threatened.  I see no signs of people trying to march in Northern Ireland and force them into a situation down here.  I <Col N="251" /> say with all my heart that all they need is to have courage and co-operate with us.</P>
    <P>In this respect, we owe a great debt of gratitude to the members of the Alliance Party who have shown great courage in coming to the forum.  I gather they have received a substantial amount of support in Northern Ireland for what they have been trying to do, which is interesting.  They do not come down to the forum and tell us that everything in the garden is rosy here as far as they can see.  They come with tremendous criticism. I long for the day when Unionists will come down and say that the people of Ballymena are disgusted, or whatever they feel obliged to say.  I assure them that they will receive a reception here and a hearing to whatever complaints they have.</P>
    <P>The Nationalists in Northern Ireland also need courage.  I listen to talk about arms, which we must not get hung up on.  However, it is most dangerous to have the pike in the thatch, not just with a view to terrorist crimes taking place. Arms in the community are not good and the area of domestic violence in Northern Ireland has far more problems in terms of arms, even those which are legally held, than elsewhere.  We must point out to those who are in a difficult situation regarding the handing in of arms that it is not just that we fear the revival of terrorism.  Even if that does not happen, the presence of arms within a community is not good.</P>
    <P>Change here and elsewhere is needed.  I often point to Article six of the Downing Street Declaration, which spoke of the changes we would make down here.  I am sure Albert Reynolds and John Major did not insert that for entertainment.  The Government could spend the rest of its lifetime putting in quite an amount of changes here.  As far as I am concerned, we do not need to do this just to make ourselves seem more socially acceptable to the Unionists.  We need to do it for ourselves, to show that we genuinely believe we are trying to create a pluralist society here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="252" /> The document is well named by being called a &ldquo;framework&rdquo;.  Now we must start filling it in.  This relies on us all; it is not just a Government effort.  I urge all Members to go to Northern Ireland and talk to groups there.  I am going twice this month and I assure Members they will be asked if they show they are willing to go.  If one looks at the statistics of the number of people who come south of the Border compared to the number who go north of the Border, the situation is fairly shabby.</P>
    <P>This is an area where great effort by Members of the Oireachtas in particular could be made.  We must know of various groups in Northern Ireland to whom we can talk and I urge all Senators to try to get themselves involved in some project or organisation there.  In this way they will at least hear our views.  It is unfortunate that a fair number of people do not receive RTE in Northern Ireland.  We have a much more balanced view of what life is like there than they do of life here.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government will continue all its efforts.  I also hope that this time next year we will see that even greater progress has been made in this area, which has caused such great distress on the whole island for 25 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>Chuirim fáilte arís roimh an Aire.  I have made a blunder, a Leas-Chathaoirligh.  For the first time since coming to the House, I have prepared a text with the result that I am now thoroughly confused about what I think on this matter.  I hope the House will forgive me if silences intrude on my thought process, which does not happen very often.</P>
      <P>I very much welcome the Framework Document.  It is a constructive and imaginative contribution towards a civilised solution of a problem which has bedevilled Irish history for nearly 400 years.  It deserves to make a major contribution towards ensuring permanent peace on this island and a genuine friendship between Ireland and Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend any reflection on the work of the politicians in the previous <Col N="253" /> or present Administrations, their advisers or the civil servants involved if I dwell on doubts about some of the implications.  This is at a high level of abstraction so it will not intrude on the day to day business of trying to implement it in the short term. However.  I hope some of the long term principles, with which I am concerned, may not seem entirely irrelevant.</P>
    <P>In his speech in the Dáil, the Taoiseach said that it is the beginning of work towards a wholly new form of expression of traditional aspirations, focusing on individuals and communities rather than on territory.  He said that by expressing aspiration in this new way, it is hoped that the two otherwise irreconcilable sets of aspirations can, in fact, be reconciled.  I very much sympathise with that approach which is central to an enduring and just solution. However, its operation is very difficult. I do not think that many of us are very clear on how one operates or implements that type of thinking.  At the same time, it is crucial to try to push that type of thinking forward and to see how theory and practice can be blended.</P>
    <P>I am puzzled by a couple of the recommendations, which may pertain perhaps to the far distant future.  These seem to run contrary to this principle, not on the grounds of expediency or pragmatism but on grounds of an alternative principle.  The implications of people thinking rather than territory thinking seem to be rejected in two key long term recommendations.  The principle of self determination enshrined in the document is self determination on the basis of territory, rather than of people or identity.  People are defined by territory, of the 50 per cent plus one criterion, rather than territory defined by people &mdash; however that can be done. There may be a good political case for this.  This is obviously so in the short term.  However, it should then be presented as a political case and not as a matter of principle.</P>
    <P>Self determination on the basis of majoritarian democracy will not ever finally resolve the underlying problems <Col N="254" /> that have plagued us in this country.  I find it curious, in terms of the suggested internal arrangements in Northern Ireland for the functioning of all the various bodies there, that the concept of consensual democracy is essentially espoused, that is to say that there should be agreement across the two traditions. This is the basic principle underlying the variety of recommendations.  However, when one shifts to the more fundamental issue of the existence of Northern Ireland, one reverts in paragraph 17 to the principle of majoritarian democracy. This may seem to be so far in the future that it does not really matter.  However, we ought to be as consistent as possible in our thinking about the possibilities of long term developments as on short term ones.</P>
    <P>It seems utterly impractical to ever think in terms of the contents of paragraph 17, that it would be possible to shift authority from the North to an all-Ireland body as things stand.  It may be that by the time that came, if ever, people would have learned to work together.  As the principle stands, it seems to be incompatible with what the Taoiseach was saying as a basic criterion.</P>
    <P>I do not want to confuse some of my listeners by suggesting sympathy for Unionist positions out of any sympathy for unionism.  Some of my practical proposals involve trying to see matters from a Unionist perspective, but as long as the principle of majoritarian democracy prevails in this country, the majority political tradition on this island has, in principle, the right to determine its political arrangements.  There is no argument that has ever been, or that can logically be, advanced for the protection of a Unionist identity or certainly for the establishment of Northern Ireland &mdash; to perhaps broaden the protection identity &mdash; on the basis of majoritarian democracy in favour of a united Ireland. In practice, the current Border was not the product of any democratic decision, majoritarian, consensual or otherwise. However, to seek to impose on Unionists the principle of majoritarian rule <Col N="255" /> implied in paragraph 17 of the document would simply be to operate on the other side of the coin.</P>
    <P>I reject the territorial thinking underlined in paragraph 17.  Representatives of the Irish Nationalist tradition should now state unequivocally that they have no aspirations to rule Unionists against their will, irrespective of the numbers game in Northern Ireland.  If the Unionist vote ever became the minority vote in Northern Ireland, we would still not claim as a right what is contained in paragraph 17, that one would then claim the right to rule them.  We have an obligation to recognise their right and the protection of their identity irrespective of the precise territorial arrangements at any given time.  We should not move from an absolute position in which we are now to an alternative one without trying to think through, at the very least, transitional arrangements which would respect all rights.  I would like to see that concrete proposal coming from an Irish Government, not as a bargaining issue, but as a matter of principle for a new philosophy of Irish nationalism.</P>
    <P>Of course the future of having to move on the basis of the Framework Document may never emerge; who knows?  If it were to do so, changes would be necessary both in the governance of Northern Ireland and in relations between the jurisdictions.  For instance &mdash; many Members may not have considered this &mdash; if Nationalists were to constitute a majority in Northern Ireland, they might decide not to join our State even though they had the right and the votes to do so.  They might not think it was worth joining.</P>
    <P>I now want to refer to a slightly more realistic point; the implications for paragraph 21 and the changes in Article 2 presumably, and possibly in Article 3, of the Constitution.  That is also based, I regret to say, on the concept of majoritarian democracy.  We will drop or adjust our territorial claim to the North until 50 per cent plus one there think differently. That principle should be rejected. We should not move from one polarised <Col N="256" /> position to another.  Although no one seems clear what the adjustments to Article 2 are likely to involve, I would like to see the principle that we will not operationalise territorial thinking in that way.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was right to say that adjusting the Constitution was a matter for the people and not a matter for discussion with another sovereign power. Surely, if we are still maintaining, in whatever hypothetical way, a possible claim on the allegiance of the people in Northern Ireland, we should be willing to discuss the possible changes with both Nationalists and Unionists.  Some of them may not want to talk to us, but we should at least extend that possibility to them and not try to impose a unilateral claim, however adjusted to their interests we might think it would be, without at least offering to consult them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GordonWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator O'Sullivan for giving me her space in the debate.  I have to admit a certain nervousness in speaking after Senator Lee because he has an intellectual facility, a turn of phrase and use of language that I do not possess.</P>
      <P>The House is making statements on the Framework Document.  I note happily that it is not a Framework Document but &ldquo;A New Framework for Agreement&rdquo;.  That last word is very significant. It is a complex document; not everyone understands it.  I am not sure that I totally understand it, but I will try to take it on board as a whole and not just dwell in isolation on the parts that I do not like.  It is a Framework Document for agreement, no more and no less; it is not being imposed.  It is a basis for thought and discussion and I urge that those in this part of the island give those in Northern Ireland time and space to take it on board.  It calls for consent, trust and respect.  It is a big step on the road to peace and I welcome it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already written to the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the British Prime Minister and the Secretary of State giving my welcome to, and support for, the <Col N="257" /> document.  It is the best opportunity for a lasting peace that we have had in the last 25 years, a period in which approximately 3,000 people lost their lives. Only one person was killed in Northern Ireland in the last six months.  It is a delight both to me and the great majority of people in Northern Ireland to turn on the radio or the television in the morning and not hear of another death and another family being asked to go through what my family and 3,000 others had to face.  The fact that there is a ceasefire, freedom to walk the streets and to go to bed without fear is getting through to people.  People in Northern Ireland yearn for peace.  They want it and pray for it.  The atmosphere is right for a settlement.  It is a time for change but it will not be easy.  However, I am optimistic, I have hope.</P>
    <P>I understand the doubts being expressed by the Unionist politicians. They feel exposed, isolated and unloved by both Governments.  However, I was shocked to hear words such as &ldquo;sellout&rdquo;, &ldquo;insult&rdquo; and &ldquo;betrayal&rdquo;.  These are strong words and I hope they are only what might be called knee-jerk reactions. I am amazed when I see the histrionics of the David Trimbles of this world and I was saddened when my local MP said in the House of Commons last Thursday that in his opinion, the document had put us back ten years.  I cannot believe Ken Maginnis wants to go back ten years when we lost a life a day in Northern Ireland and when our towns were bombed to pieces.  Yet that is what he said.</P>
    <P>In my book 1690 was three centuries ago and the world has moved on as we approach the 21st century.  I ask Unionist politicians to stop playing politics with people's lives and to listen to the grassroots.  I made it my business to meet as many people as I could in Enniskillen over the weekend.  They want their political leaders to sit down and talk.  Without exception, that is what they said to me.  The worst I heard was from a middle of the road Unionist with perhaps leanings to the right who said <Col N="258" /> the document was a little too green, which I understand, but he too wants his party politician and MP to sit down and talk.</P>
    <P>People shoud be prepared to compromise, which is not giving in or losing out. it is maturity.  Let all political leaders sit down, listen to their electors, present their policies, love their neighbours and common God and, by doing so, help us to achieve a lasting peace because that is what this document is about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>As always on these occasions it is difficult to follow Senator Wilson's manifest authority and Christianity in respect of these matters.  Once again I find myself in agreement with him.  Without consulting him before he spoke, he has said many of the things I wish to say.  It is no harm that we have waited a week to debate this matter as it has given us time to reflect and come to a more mature judgment than we might have had last week.  Once again the value of debates in this House on such matters and in respect of Northern Ireland is demonstrated in that we adopt a moderate and, I hope, a constructive tone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must acknowledge that both Governments have played a good role in the preparation of the Framework Document.  We should acknowledge the work done by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, and Mr. Major and, in particular, the public servants who helped draft the document.  The response to it has been varied.  The Unionist community, particularly Unionist politicians, have expressed criticism.  I congratulate the smaller parties in Northern Ireland on the way they received the document.  It is ironic that some of the parties which came from a &ldquo;paramilitary&rdquo; background found enough generosity to welcome and accept the document.  I am disappointed with the response from Unionist politicians, not the Unionist community. I am disappointed that Unionist politicians would use the voting vulnerability of the British Government to underline their criticism because I do <Col N="259" /> not believe that is a useful or a productive road to go down.</P>
    <P>As Senator Wilson said when he mentioned his local MP, there can be no going back because to do so would be to revisit upon the community in Northern Ireland the death and destruction it experienced over the past 25 years.  It is not useful to go back to the Battle of the Boyne or even the injustice which created the Northern Ireland state because we are where we are and we had better decide how to go forward. There is a blueprint in the Framework Document for going forward.  It is obvious from the judgment of the people in Northern Ireland expressed in opinion poll findings, which we all read over the weekend, that they will not tolerate a revisitation of a process which would lead them back to the politics of the bomb, gun and bullet.</P>
    <P>Our consideration should be detailed, complete and above all devoid of instant reaction.  As frequently stated &mdash; it was stated here recently by the Taoiseach when we abolished the state of emergency &mdash; the document is not an end in itself.  That must be repeated over and over again.  It is just another milestone, albeit an historic one in a long and tortuous sequence.  We are on a road on which we must travel further; we are only a few steps on that road and it is not useful to predetermine where it might lead us.</P>
    <P>The document is not a threat to anybody and it is worth re-emphasising the words of the document itself which were repeated in this House by the Taoiseach when he said it was not a rigid blueprint to be imposed.  It establishes the guarantees required by both communities in Northern Ireland and it is a major disappointment that some sections of the Unionist community do not want to accept the guarantees contained in the document.  From a Unionist point of view, the explicit acceptance that the status of Northern Ireland cannot be changed without the consent of the majority of the people in Northern Ireland should be reassuring.  I support <Col N="260" /> the view expressed by Senator Lee that it should not be a case of a numbers game and that when the balance shifts from 50 minus one to 50 plus one the matter will be concluded and we will proceed from there.  I do not see it in those terms.</P>
    <P>The Unionist community should also be reassured by the proposal that the Government will introduce and support proposals for change in the Constitution to fully reflect the principles of consent in Northern Ireland.  They should be further reassured that the document states that these changes will be such that no territorial claim of right to jurisdiction over Northern Ireland contrary to the will of the majority of its people will be asserted.  I fail to see how the union is not safe as is the Unionist requirement under the terms of the Framework Document.</P>
    <P>Nationalists in Northern Ireland have a legitimate right to hold and pursue their aspiration by democratic and peaceful means.  As someone who in the past sympathised with and defended the Unionist right to hold its aspiration, I must say that some of the actions and language from Unionists' sources over the past few weeks do little to support its case.  The Ulster Democratic Party has been closer to public opinion in accepting the Framework Document.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about parity of esteem, something which recurs regularly at the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.  There are many definitions of parity of esteem depending on one's standpoint and where one is coming from.  I do not believe parity of esteem means one community saying to another that it is sorry for what happened in the past, that it will ensure its views will be taken into account in the future and that it will be secure in the institutions it established for it.  It goes well beyond that and is defined in paragraph 10 (iv) of the document which states: &ldquo;... that any new political arrangement must be based on full respect for, and protection and expression of, the rights and identities of both traditions in Ireland and even-handedly <Col N="261" /> afford both communities in Northern Ireland parity of esteem and treatment, including equality of opportunity and advantage.&rdquo;  That is as good a definition of parity of esteem as we are likely to find.  Parity of esteem means creating a system of Government and democratic structure to which both traditions can give their support.</P>
    <P>Given the history of the past 25 years this will inevitably be a slow process, as Senator Wilson mentioned.  We have to be prepared to accept that it has taken a long time to get to where we are and there must not be an unholy and unseemly rush to try to jump all the remaining fences in a short space of time.  The Framework Document is really an important element in that process; an important milestone.</P>
    <P>The Unionists have criticised the document for being &ldquo;Nationalist&rdquo;.  It is not very surprising that it is Nationalist given the amount of catching up the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland is faced with.  If they are to achieve the parity of esteem of which I spoke, it is inevitable that the tone of the document would appear Nationalist to some.</P>
    <P>The one area on which Unionism could and did focus was the creation of the North-South institutions, particularly those with Executive powers. There seems to be a presumption abroad that everything will come within the scope of these Executive powers. The document has defined three areas of activity: one at executive level, one at harmonising level and one at consultative level.  In defining what might be covered by institutions with an executive function the document states in paragraph 31:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...it is intended that these proposals would include at the executive level a range of functions, clearly defined in scope, from within the following broad categories: sectors involving a natural or physical all-Ireland framework; EC programmes and initiatives; marketing and promotion <Col N="262" /> activities abroad; and culture and heritage.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a long way from that which is being represented to us as the scope of Executive functions.</P>
    <P>There is a fail-safe within that where it says in paragraph 46:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where either Government considers that any institution, established as part of the overall accommodation, is not properly functioning within the Agreement or that a breach of the Agreement has otherwise occurred, the Conference shall consider the matter on the basis of a shared commitment to arrive at a common position or, where that is not possible, to agree a procedure to resolve the difference between them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let us be clear when talking about what is covered by cross-Border institutions. Let us say that in many areas where there is common interest under the EU there should be no difficulty about those matters.</P>
    <P>The most effective action that could be taken to allay the Unionist fears &mdash; they have some legitimate fears &mdash; and the most telling message that could be sent is for the Provisional IRA to say that it will dump its arms, that it will decommission them and the Semtex. That is the most effective message which would lead us to meaningful talks on the way forward.  Were that to happen I would ask the Unionists to come to the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation where those of us from the South have learned enormously from those in Northern Ireland in commerce, farming and the youth movement who have spoken to us.  We need to keep talking to one another; we need to see that there is no threat to anybody from either side of the Border.</P>
    <P>The other solution is to empower communities on either side of the Border to allow them to progress their economic and social advancement.  That is the path to progress.</P>

      <P>Like other Senators I welcome the publication of the Framework Document.  It is worth noting the point made by Senator Wilson that its title is <i>A New Framework for Agreement</i> as it is important that the word &ldquo;agreement&rdquo; is in the title.  When the Minister spoke at the beginning of this debate she used the word &ldquo;agreement&rdquo; and &ldquo;agreed&rdquo; many times reflecting a thread that runs through this document.  It is intended that any of its proposals are to be implemented only by agreement.</P>
      <P>The subtitle of the document describes it as &ldquo;A shared understanding between the British and Irish Governments to assist discussion and negotiation involving the Northern Ireland parties.&rdquo;  It is presented as a basis for discussion rather than a strait-jacket framework, as suggested by Senator Quinn.  It would be a mistake if it was to be a framework in the form of a straitjacket.  There is a more open concept of a framework as something upon which one builds out and around, rather than something which encloses people and limits the extent to which they can reach agreement, and I see it as a framework of that kind.</P>
      <P>The document is also presented as a shared understanding between the two Governments and has the firm basis of being the agreed thinking of the two Governments as to how we should move forward.  The document is detailed and took a great deal of time to bring to fruition. It is the product of a lot of work and I acknowledge the work done by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, Prime Minister John Major, the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring and Sir Patrick Mayhew.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is most welcome to see the amount of copies of the document that have been taken and read in Northern Ireland since its publication.  It is a feature that people in the North wanted to <Col N="264" /> read the document and that is to be welcomed above everything else.  It shows that people living in Northern Ireland want to know what is in the document and to deal with it constructively.</P>
    <P>It was to be expected that their leaders would feel the need to be firm in their objections to the document.  We knew that we would have such a reaction, particularly from the DUP and the UUP.  With others, I acknowledge and welcome that the response of the other Unionist parties has been more constructive. The reaction was inevitable but, at the same time, those on the ground, like Senator Wilson, see hope and a positive basis for discussion in the document.  I hope the Unionist leaders will lead their people to discussions on the document.</P>
    <P>We need to look for areas of agreement and mutual benefit, of which there are many in the document, and we can build on those.  The firm principles underlining the document of consent, agreement, self-determination and of respect for the different traditions have been clearly enunciated.  In his introductory speech Mr. Major talked about the triple lock &mdash; the agreement of the assembly that would be created in Northern Ireland, the agreement of the people in a referendum and the agreement of the Westminster Government. Again the focus is on agreement and discussion and reaching an accommodation of both communities.</P>
    <P>I read an article by the historian Robert Keyes following publication of the document.  He pointed out that the insecurity of Unionism goes back 81 years to the discussions on home rule when there was an attempt to square a circle.  The circle still has not been squared.  Senator Lee made a good point when he talked about the need not to try to square the circle but to develop a new shape; not to look simply at majoritarianism, at one community or the other reaching its goal, but to look at coming up with a new structure, a new organisation, that will not satisfy either community totally but will satisfy both in some parts and in which there <Col N="265" /> will have to be give and take by both communities.</P>
    <P>In the context of the various structures in relation to the North/South aspect, the point needs to be made that we will be conceding a certain amount of power as well.  The various areas of discussion that Senator Dardis outlined will involve the southern Government discussing economic issues, such as-marketing, tourism and so on, with the northern Government, as well as EU funding from which we have benefited more than the North in some ways.</P>
    <P>The constitutional changes will be decided by the people, by way of a referendum. In regard to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution, the commitment that we should not have a territorial right of jurisdiction over the North will be fully supported by me and by my party.</P>
    <P>If there was not a challenge in this document to both communities, it would not be any use.  We need a challenge because to continue would mean going back to the situation of the last 25 years. There has to be challenge, there has to be change, we must look at what people stand for and be willing to argue at the table but we must, in the end, be willing to compromise.  I hope this reconciliation will lead to a pluralist society.</P>
    <P>It is now six months to the day since the announcement of the IRA cease-fire. We all have a duty to make that peace last.  At the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation last week we focused on children.  We should focus on those children we saw at the forum last week and on where they will be in the future and hope that they will not still be sitting around trying to work out a way in which the two communities can live and work together.  This Framework Document offers us a hope for the future for those children growing up today, that they will be able to live in a peaceful Northern Ireland.  I hope this document will be the basis for that peace.  I believe it will.</P>

      <P>Yes, with Senator O'Sullivan.  I welcome the Minister to the House on this historic occasion.  I welcome the publication of the Framework Document.  I would describe it as a landmark agreement in the building of a lasting peace on this island.  This is a discussion document; it does not provide for joint authority by the British and Irish Governments over Northern Ireland.  It has been published to stimulate discussion and public debate and deserves a calm and measured response from all quarters.  I hope it will draw all parties in Northern Ireland to the negotiating table.</P>
      <P>For too long we have sat apart.  Now is the time for all parties to enter into genuine and meaningful talks.  Those of us who live in Border areas have suffered more than anybody else from the Troubles of the past 25 years.  Now we have an opportunity to work together on the basis of what is outlined in the document.  The proposals to set up a joint North-South body comprising of elected representatives and accountable to a Northern Ireland Assembly and to the Dáil is particularly interesting.  For the first time both sides of the community would feel an equal sense of allegiance to authority.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party will play a complete role in the ongoing peace process which is now entering a new and crucial phase.  We are committed to establishing a just and lasting peace which recognises the rights of all the people on this island. Our party has been to Northern Ireland on a number of occasions and met political parties there.  We have met the DUP, the Ulster Unionists and the smaller parties.  Talks are ongoing and are to be welcomed and I have no doubt they will continue in the future.  I acknowledge the enormous amount of work that has been undertaken by the last three Governments and I particularly congratulate my colleague, Mr. Hume in Derry, for his work towards establishing a lasting peace on this island.  Mr. Hume has probably done more than anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="267" /> In regard to North-South bodies integrating for the good of the country, I would be interested in looking at the areas of tourism, sport and agriculture. On the tourism front, I read recently that consideration is being given to establishing an all-Ireland chamber of tourism.  This idea was proposed last week at the Irish Hotel Federation meeting in Cavan where 300 delegates were told they would like to see Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland tourism body formed into one international marketing body to attract visitors to Ireland.</P>
    <P>Figures released recently show a 10 per cent rise in holiday visitors to Northern Ireland for 1994.  Visitor numbers are expected to double, bringing in an extra 1 million guests over the next five years.  It has been forecast that in 1995 alone 1,000 new jobs will be created in the tourism trade in Northern Ireland. There is definitely a mood of change out there and people are now asking how they can come to Ireland, both North and South, for their holidays.  Some experts have said the cease-fire has provided a climate which could create 20,000 jobs over the next five years in Northern Ireland alone.  There is a tourism boom there and we must do all we can to see that these figures are achieved.</P>
    <P>In the past, people stayed away from the North of Ireland.  I come from Donegal.  I wish to look at one area in Donegal, the Inishowen area, which I always describe as the forgotten peninsula. Many of the people in that area depend on tourism for their survival and all their visitors come from Northern Ireland.  People stayed away from the North of Ireland for one reason only and that was violence.  Now that the violence has stopped we must all work together to take advantage of the tourism boom.  A boom in tourism means a boom in jobs, and that is most welcome.</P>
    <P>I was delighted this week when I saw that Jersey European Airways have announced new air routes from Derry to Belfast and Dublin at a cost of £20 <Col N="268" /> from Derry to Dublin.  For people like myself this is to be welcomed.  If I want to go on to Leeds or Bradford it will only cost me another £12.  This means that for £32 I can travel from Donegal to Dublin and on to Leeds.  This is another indication of the change that has taken place.</P>
    <P>I would welcome Southern holidaymakers to the North.  I have said on many occasions in this House that people must meet with the people of Northern Ireland.  I emphasise that politicians must go there because I have listened to people here who do not understand what Northern Ireland is about. Some of them have never travelled north of a line drawn from Dublin to Galway.  That is just not good enough. We must get to know each other and work together, not just for the good of the people of the country but for the children who will come after us.  Hopefully they will not have to endure another 25 years of the violence which the young people in the North have had to endure.</P>
    <P>Sport and the co-operation in sport are areas in which we could make progress. The GAA and the Irish Rugby Football Union have done tremendous work as has another excellent organisation which for the last 20 years has organised the community games. The latter organisation has done more for cross-Border co-operation than any other 32 county organisation.  These organisations have brought together people of all kinds at local, provincial and national level.  We should support these institutions.  Senator Wilson said that the politicians were out of touch with the people.  I agree with him to some degree.  I am in Strabane, Derry and Belfast on a regular basis and the people in Northern Ireland are telling me that we should give the peace process a chance.</P>
    <P>The peace dividend from Europe will bring in £240 million, and surely the consultation process of bringing both groups together to decide how that money is to be spent will shape the <Col N="269" /> future for this country.  People from both traditions can decide together how this money is to be spent to gain the maximum benefit for both communities in the North.  There are enough ghettos in Northern Ireland in Catholic and Protestant areas and something must be done to alleviate the mayhem and deprivation that exists there.  This is a marvellous opportunity for people to come out of these ghettos.  People and political parties will have to be encouraged to make up their minds that this is a wonderful opportunity.  We should make a meaningful and lasting impression on those who have been worst affected by the 25 years of violence.  I look forward to and sincerely hope for the continued success of peace talks and I sincerely welcome the publication of the document.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Framework Document.  For the first time in Irish history it is proposed to place the decision as to the sovereignty of Northern Ireland in its people.  At the inception of Northern Ireland Sir Edward Carson, one of the founders of unionism, envisaged a common market on the island of Ireland.  Now, 75 years later, there is still reluctance on the part of sections of the community to engage in cross-Border institutions which would promote trade and industry which would benefit all the people of Ireland. It must be a mighty fear that impedes such a very natural opportunity.  The fear must be addressed, rationalised and understood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Understanding surely can be achieved through dialogue.  I ask the Unionists to please come and talk so that we can understand them better.  The Framework Document is clearly not an Irish manifesto for the future of this island.  It is a discussion document which was born out of the Brooke dialogue and the Downing Street Declaration.  It has three main elements, as had the Brooke talks, and is tripartite in its make up in that it provides for discussion between the two communities in Northern Ireland, between those two communities <Col N="270" /> and the Government representatives of this State and between the Dublin and London Governments.  It requires a plebiscite on both sections of this island separately.  Surely this must be the greatest guarantee of protection of the democratic rights of the majority of people to determine their own destiny.</P>
    <P>It has to be said that all the politicians on both sides of this House have acted with great restraint, consideration and understanding and, most of all, have had a consolidated sympathetic approach to resolving a problem that has haunted us for far too long.  We have now taken a major step on the road to peace and reconciliation.  We have for the first time recognised in the Downing Street Declaration the right of self-determination of the people of Northern Ireland and the principle has been reiterated in the Framework Document. It was a courageous step for the Government of the day to take.  It was a Fianna Fáil led Government but we must congratulate and salute the present Government on its continuation of the process that has started and for ultimately delivering what no doubt will be an instrument for resolving the divisions which have bedevilled our people.</P>
    <P>One already sees the commercial benefits of the peace in Northern Ireland: the influx of tourism, even over the winter period, following the ceasefire; the enormous interest in Northern Ireland that now exists among city investors; the commitments of the United States Government to industrial investment and input, not to mention the money being made available to directly benefit the community.  There is to be a straightforward cash injection of almost $30 million from the US.  Yesterday we had the announcement of at least £1.26 million from the EU for cross-Border projects.  This is in addition to the earlier £240 million from the European peace fund.  We had Mr. John Major's announcement last week that the British Treasury will maintain for many years to come the same amount of money as is at present being <Col N="271" /> budgeted for Northern Ireland.  This means that the vast amount which has been spent on security or other Troubles related matters can now be used to enhance the Northern Ireland economy.  This will benefit this State as well by increasing cross-Border trade. The increase in such trade must be capitalised to create a unified economic approach throughout the entire country.</P>
    <P>Jobs are as important to the people of Castleblayney as they are to the people of Crossmaglen and to the people of Lisbellaw as they are to the people of Letterkenny.  It is my belief that the lot of these townsmen can be improved more by a single economic approach than through diverse economic policies.</P>
    <P>The Framework Document alludes to co-operation in education.  Such co-operation makes sound sense, particularly at secondary level as both economies are already seeing the benefit of the excellent relationship and co-operation that exists at university level, and this can be further enhanced.  We now have only one veterinary school in Ireland which is in University College Dublin.  It is a very expensive faculty to maintain.  The agricultural industry and the Department of Agriculture in Northern Ireland require annually a large number of qualified veterinary surgeons.  A substantial number of them at present qualify at UCD.  I would urge the Department of Agriculture in Northern Ireland to seek a partnership with UCD to enhance this well established and internationally recognised veterinary school which is at present involved in a major development and needs substantial investment.  In return a specific number of places could be allocated in the faculty for Northern Ireland students to relieve the pressure for so many Northern Ireland veterinary students who have to cross the Irish Sea to receive their qualifications.  Surely this is an area where the United Kingdom Government could lead by example and blaze the trail in co-operation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="272" /> The Framework Document is balanced. Its contents seek to accommodate the fears and apprehensions that to date prevented dialogue and thus a political solution to embrace our divisions. I hope and pray that all parties will recognise the enormous opportunities being presented to us.  Our children will not readily forgive us if we throw these opportunities to the wind.  I hope the Unionist politicians will shortly see their immediate interpretation of the proposals in this document was ill founded and that its authors have the very best intentions towards all the people of Ireland and that they will see fit to sit down will all parties to discuss how peace with honour can best be framed to mutual benefit.</P>
    <P>It has to be recognised by all parties that we are equal.  We are all entitled to the democratic process, parity of esteem, our aspirations, to earn our living and to reside in any area of this island where we have our own particular peaceful political aspiration and our pride and know that it is on merit alone that our achievement will be judged.  We hunger for the day when every man is able to become whatever his being and vision can combine to make him.  Too many people for too long have been unable to enjoy the rights and aspirations which this document seeks to harbinge. This document is the nucleus of a future society which can be achieved in which all the inhabitants of Ireland are honoured and respected instead of suffering political isolation and commercial avoidance by our partners in Europe and other countries.</P>
    <P>The Treaty of Rome is centred around economic union.  It has been the ointment for healing the great division that existed in Europe after the Second World War.  The French and German Governments are now preparing to exchange Government Ministers.  The Anglo-Spanish difficulties regarding Gibraltar have receded and the political differences in Belgium, France and Holand have calmed.</P>
    <P>The Framework Document provides for possible enhancement of economic <Col N="273" /> liaisons.  The partition of Ireland in 1920 envisaged a council of Ireland mainly centred around economic co-operation. It was recognised then by the forefathers of the present Unionists that Ireland could only survive and compete as one economic unit.  Alas, realisation was not to be then but could now come to pass as conditions are surely right.</P>
    <P>Yesterday Monika Wulf-Mathies, European Commissioner in charge of regional policy and cohesion funds, in announcing the last spending for economic cross-Border money programmes said: &ldquo;I am very pleased to be able to approve these programmes at a time when due to the peace process, conditions for economic development and cross-Border co-operation in the island of Ireland are better than ever&rdquo;.  This language is commensurate with the confidence of our European partners.  This is the prize of peace.  Surely no one has the right to deny us this prize.  Any section of the community or political leader who sullies this confidence by putting peace at risk will be castigated by history and all mankind.  Let us learn from what we have seen.  There is only one step from fanaticism to barbarism.</P>
    <P>I cannot let this occasion pass without making a special reference to the former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, who, I have no doubt, history will record as having made a major contribution to the peace process on this island.  We also must recognise the enormous contribution of the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring. He straddled both Governments and continued to make enormous progress to deliver the document.  We have to recognise the Taoiseach who also made an enormous contribution.  They are all to be congratulated and we are proud to have three men of their calibre in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers on all sides of the House I welcome the launch last Wednesday of <i>A New Framework for Agreement</i> by the Taoiseach, Deputy Bruton, and the British Prime Minister, John Major.  I record my thanks to them for their historic commitment to further <Col N="274" /> action and dialogue over the coming months and years.  In passing I also congratulate the former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring. Sir Patrick Mayhew, John Hume and all other Ministers and officials on both sides who contributed to the months and years of preparatory work.</P>
      <P>The Framework Document provides a carefully thought out structure for the future development of the political, social and economic life of the whole of Ireland.  It is no more and no less than what was clearly laid out at the launch. The document is for discussion by all interested parties at all levels of society in Ireland.  It does not impose any settlement or decide on anyone's behalf how they should be governed.</P>
      <P>The document has, quite rightly, been presented as an opportunity to analyse and tease out how we might advance from the dreadful situation we have witnessed over the last 25 years in Northern Ireland.  On that note I extend my sympathy to all those who have been bereaved by the violence during that period or suffered injury or intimidation in both communities.  The goal of a permanent and peaceful solution is within our grasp through the Framework Document.</P>
      <P>Those who are most directly affected, the Nationalist and Unionist communities in Northern Ireland, are now being given breathing space to consider all the valuable details contained in the document. Essentially we are talking about people with different backgrounds and beliefs learning to live with each other on a relatively small island.  John Hume has often referred to a divided people rather than a divided land and I echo his view.  It is surely not beyond hope or ingenuity to create a formula that will be acceptable to both sides and I believe this can be achieved with generosity and understanding between our neighbours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most encouraging response to the Framework Document has come from the Unionist population.  They have shown no sympathy with their leaders' threats to boycott the political talks. Their response in the latest opinion poll <Col N="275" /> shows that they desire to seize the opportunity offered by the IRA and loyalist ceasefires to secure a conditional alternative to the violence of the last 25 years through a lasting political and peaceful settlement.  We have a serious obligation to play our part as parliamentarians to reassure our Unionist neighbours that the ultimate prize for Ireland as a whole is peaceful coexistence which can only lead to a better quality of life for all in the future.  The people of Northern Ireland see that there is nothing to be lost by talking.</P>
    <P>Clear terms of reference are set out by the Irish and British Governments in the joint Framework Document which is more a discussion paper than a rigid blueprint as the Taoiseach, Deputy Bruton, made clear in the Dáil.  The proposals of the two Governments are meant to facilitate dialogue, not to pre-empt it.  The checks and balances proposed through the triple lock of consent of the parties, people and parliament offer an effective guarantee to the constitutional stability previously lacking.  It ensures no settlement can be imposed and that the majority cannot be coerced.</P>
    <P>All this should offer the Unionists ample reassurances of their future within the United Kingdom, not least when accompanied by the Government's willingness to drop the daim to jurisdiction over the North as part of the overall agreement.  Any settlement, as both Governments have made clear, must be based on a balanced accommodation of the interests of the North's two divided communities, the Unionists and Nationalists.  The success of that settlement also requires a high level of mutual compromise from all those involved.</P>
    <P>I would like at this point to refer to an aspect of the joint Framework Document in which I have an ongoing interest.  The Framework Document refers in detail to setting up North-South structures and institutions.  It clearly states that new political structures in Northern Ireland must depend on the co-operation of elected representatives <Col N="276" /> and that cross community agreement is an essential requirement for the establishment of such structures.  Consensus is the key element in all this and I am confident that if the will is there, much can be achieved in the short term, never mind in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I welcome the inclusion of a commitment to discussion on institutions to cater for political, social and economic interconnection on the island.  The proposal for a North-South body is a challenging and exciting one and I believe it will be the vehicle through which progress between both communities can be achieved.  Like, Senator Henry I have a special interest because I have been a member of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body for many years.  I assure the House that the experience in that body has been wholly successful.</P>
    <P>The body met for the first time five years ago and the next plenary session takes place at the end of March in Dublin. The body operates through steering committees and the main work between plenary sessions is undertaken via four committees, namely.  Political and Security, European Affairs, Economic and Social Affairs and Culture, Education and Environment.  I am involved in the third committee.  The House will be interested to leam that among the reports and issues we have dealt with are Irish communities in Britain and development of tourism and fisheries in Ireland.  These are practical issues which clearly indicate that joint consideration of relevant topics can be beneficial to the island of Ireland.  I ask that the preparation of reports involves discussion and contact with individuals.  Governments and organisations whenever necessary.  The reports are debated in the plenary session and the formal views of both Governments are sought and received.  In addition, the relevant Ministers, in the UK or Ireland, are invited to the plenary session and take questions on relevant issues during public sessions.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the structures and mechanisms we use are a successful blueprint for the future.  We have proven <Col N="277" /> beyond doubt that the system works and that there is no reason a similar structure should not be extended to the structures referred to in the document. The British-Irish interparliamentary body will have an increasingly important role in future and there is no reason it should not be used as a vehicle on which to build.  I remind the House that since its inception in 1990, the body has allocated two seats to the Unionists, which, to date, they have not accepted. I would like to use this opportunity to once again appeal to Unionists to participate in the work of the body.  They would be greatly surprised at the opportunities for progress which exist on behalf of the communities through the results which can be achieved from the programmes of action we undertake on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>Since 1969 three major initiatives have been taken in an attempt to bring peace and stability to Northern Ireland. Some 22 years ago the British Government was prepared to acknowledge the necessity of an all-Ireland dimension in any solution to this problem but Sunningdale was rejected because it sought to establish a council of Ireland comprising a council of Ministers and a consultative assembly.  While the Framework Document envisages cross-Border institutions with a role similar to that of Sunningdale's council of Ministers, it makes no suggestion of a consultative body drawn from the Northern Ireland assembly and the Dáil.  The Sunningdale Agreement came into being without an amendment to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning spoke about the principle of consent.  In 1969 Fine Gael broke Nationalist ranks and established the principle of consent as central to the quest for unity and since then other political parties have followed suit.  The principle of consent was endorsed in the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement, but, yet again, it was rejected by the Unionists.</P>
    <P>The climate in which the Framework Document is presented to us has changed.  Unlike the two previous occasions, political violence has ceased <Col N="278" /> and the public mood for consolidating the peace process after 25 years of violence is overwhelming.  In addition, Sinn Féin has accepted the precondition of consent and it is agreed by all the Nationalist parties that this ideological transformation should be reflected in changes to Articles 2 and 3 of our Constitution. On this occasion Unionists are asked for a compromise of lesser significance. They are not asked to abandon the central tenet of unionism, continued constitutional union with the United Kingdom, but to agree to all-Ireland institutions which will go some way towards representing the Nationalists' identity in that territory and to share Executive powers internally with Nationalists who fully endorse the principle of consent.  If Unionists accept, or at least acknowledge this compromise, we can reassure our Unionist neighbours that the ultimate prize for Ireland is peaceful coexistence, which can only lead to a better way of life for all parts of this island in the future.</P>
    <P>As Senator Haughey said, part of that prize must be increased confidence on the part of investors from Europe and further afield.  That in turn will translate into jobs and will ensure that families in the North and South will no longer have to face the level of emigration to which we have become accustomed over past generations.  We owe it to our young people to work closely together and to do all we can to build on the Framework Document.  Dr. Garret FitzGerald said recently that what is new and yet unrecognised by most Unionists is the emergence of a powerful economic case for Northern Ireland, the development of closer links with the State and the fact that these processes will be entirely compatible with continued participation in the United Kingdom.  The Framework Document offers enormous opportunities to both parts of Ireland to live in peace and harmony with each other.  On this occasion no one can afford the luxury of saying no.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  It is appropriate that we <Col N="279" /> have an opportunity to discuss the Framework Document a week after its publication.  I am worried about the way the discussion has drifted, including the well meaning words spoken in this Chamber.  I want to put my experience on the record.</P>
      <P>Partition is to culture what protectionism is to trade.  People are hiding behind it and those who seem to be the greatest opponents of partition are the people who will greatly resist change over the next six months.  I have had experience over the past month of trying to bring about change in areas which will lead to harmonisation, but I see no prospect of success.  It was heartening to hear the way people spoke last weekend. We are aware of the survey in Northern Ireland and in Britain to establish points of view.  We were quick to say that the Unionist leadership was out of touch with its grass roots, but there is a similar situation on this part of the island.  The <i>Sunday Press</i> poll last Sunday gave a clear indication of how open people are to change.  We are aware that our political leadership has shown an openness to change, although there may be slight differences of opinion on different sides of the House. That has stopped the necessary thought process and there seems to be little prospect of change among decision makers who are immediately underneath the political process.  I am talking about the Church, education, sporting organisations and other important and influential all-Ireland groups in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened carefully to the presentation of the Framework Document by the British Prime Minister and the Taoiseach. I was interested in the area of education to which Mr. John Major particularly referred.  I looked closely at the definition of &ldquo;harmonisation&rdquo; in the Framework Document, which requires us to establish common policies, identify the obstacles to them and then ensure their removal to implement the common policy by two different administrations. The other aspect of the <Col N="280" /> Framework Document is a commitment to a charter of rights for all citizens on this island.  That charter is promising open, fair and unrestricted access to equal opportunity in all social and economic activity, regardless of class, creed, gender or colour.</P>
    <P>As regards education, Mr. John Major mentioned &mdash; and it is mentioned in the Framework Document &mdash; the recognition of teachers' qualifications.  It seems like a small move to ask people to make.  The North of Ireland has generously given full recognition to teachers who qualified in the South. However there is no reciprocal recognition of northern qualifications in the South because this State requires all teachers to have an Irish qualification. In a new Ireland, we would need to change our approach to accommodate two men who were primary school principals in Northern Ireland, Mr. Séamus Mallon and Mr. Ken Maginnis, both of whom went on to full time politics representing different sides of the community. As of now, neither would be recognised as teachers in the Republic.</P>
    <P>My organisation, the INTO, today published its submission to the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.  One of our proposals was to make such a change; this was leaked within the last fortnight.  The response from the Irish language organisations has been reactionary beyond belief. I have argued this position on radio and television, and we in the INTO will not retreat on this issue, although it has earned us much criticism.</P>
    <P>I would welcome public support on this matter.  People must be asked what price they are prepared to pay for what they want, whether that is harmonisation, a united Ireland or something else.  However, in the Ireland foreseen by Conradh na Gaeilge, there is no way for Mr. Mallon or Mr. Maginnis to get their old jobs back unless they are prepared to take a crash course and obtain a qualification in Irish.  That is unacceptable but it is the current position.</P>
    <P>The northern conference of the INTO is taking place this weekend in Newcastle. <Col N="281" /> County Down.  It is an historic occasion because it is the first time &mdash; if the security arrangements permit me to say this &mdash; that both Ministers, from North and South, will address the conference. It is also the first time any two Ministers from the two Governments will be together at one forum since the publication of the Framework Document.</P>
    <P>I hope both Ministers will say something about teachers' qualifications since it has been mentioned by Mr. Major, and it is discussed in the Framework Document.  This would be a good opportunity to make a statement.  I had negotiations on this issue last year with the Rev. Paisley, with people from Official Unionist Party headquarters and with Mr. John Hume on a number of occasions.  This is a disgraceful and unacceptable position.  We can protect the Irish language and ensure its survival without having this element of compulsion.  That is just one issue.  One could expand from there to discuss integrated education as a whole.</P>
    <P>As of now concessions are made to children born outside the jurisdiction who move into the education system here.  In the future there may be only one system in Ireland.  At present if a Unionist family from the North moves from Newry to Dundalk, the children may be compelled to learn Irish, in other words, they will be made to feel inferior.  Such action would ignore what is required in the forum document, where we are asked to remove barriers of distrust on the basis of promoting respect for the equal rights and validity of both traditions and identities.  There must be movement on these issues.</P>
    <P>Similar problems exist with the attitude of the Catholic Church and other churches towards the teaching of religion.  A delicate balance must be struck in protecting the pluralist State and the denominational requirements of parents, who are entitled to ask for Catholic or Protestant education for their children.  It is a disgrace that in this State there is no room for non-denominational education.  I presume the Minister <Col N="282" /> in her White Paper on education will change the anomaly that people who want to create multi-denominational schools have to put themselves through hoops because under the rules of this State they are not entitled to such schools.  That is wrong.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with only a number of areas; I could deal with many more.  The challenge for change is not being taken up at a sub-political level.  These people are hiding behind partition.  Partition is the same protection for culture as protectionism was for trade.  There must be openness.</P>
    <P>The question is not why we need to change the National Anthem but are we prepared to allow it to be changed. Some people say symbols are not important to them.  That may be so but they are important to others.  Are people prepared to get rid of or change symbols if they insult or offend in some way?</P>
    <P>This is all to do with openness to change and I do not see it there at present.  On this side of the Border we should look into our hearts to make sure there is an element of openness.  I despair at the response my organisation is getting on trying to push through some of these issues.  I do not see openness to change, but rather an assertion that everything will be fine if others join us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the decision by this House to make provision for a series of statements on the joint Framework Document. The Tánaiste regrets he is unable to take part in today's proceedings.  He is in Washington briefing senior members of the US Administration on the Framework Document and the potential it represents for political progress. On behalf of both him and myself, I will contribute some observations on <Col N="283" /> the unique significance of the document and the way ahead as we see it.</P>
      <P>The Framework Document is a historic first on many levels.  It is an ambitious and innovative set of proposals which breaks with traditional doctrine in several decisive respects and urges a new approach on all sides in the search for a new accommodation.  It is by far the most comprehensive and detailed account yet provided by the two Governments of their thinking on the future of Northern Ireland and relations between the two main traditions on this island.  In outlining a shared vision of the way forward it enters previously uncharted constitutional and institutional territory, signalling our willingness to contemplate major change in both areas.</P>
      <P>It sets out a generous vision of an Ireland in which greater protection and expression will be afforded than ever before to the two main traditions, nationalism and unionism.  It capitalises on the extraordinary new opportunity for political movement which has been created since last September.  The context of peace, in which the threat of violence has been lifted, has immeasurably strengthened the prospects for a lasting political accommodation.</P>
      <P>Never before has there been so clear an emphasis on the need for agreement between nationalism and unionism as the key to all future arrangements on this island.  Never before has the principle of consent in all its facets been so strongly endorsed.  Further, never before has the role to be played by the political parties in Northern Ireland in the search for agreement been so clearly recognised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Framework Document is intended first and foremost as a powerful stimulus to the parties to engage in comprehensive dialogue with the two Governments on the way forward.  It describes the key issues which we believe will feature in a new talks process. It indicates possible approaches to these issues which we believe could attract consensus in negotiations among <Col N="284" /> all concerned.  It also defines in the clearest terms the contribution which the Irish and British Governments are each prepared to make as part of the search for a new consensus.</P>
    <P>The document opens up a range of avenues which we believe could be profitably explored by the two Governments and the parties at future talks and could lead to a successful outcome.  It represents a carefully calculated judgment of where, with the necessary flexibility and goodwill, we believe a fair and honourable accommodation between the various interests could be found.</P>
    <P>We have strongly commended our ideas to the parties in the hope and expectation that they will find in them the broad lines of a possible new accommodation and that they will be prepared to sit down with us to discuss these further.  We hope the document will help the parties review their traditional approaches and identify possible new areas of consensus which would still leave their essential principles and values intact.</P>
    <P>The document offers pointers, not directives.  It suggests but does not dictate. It is intended to open up debate, not pre-empt it.  Its primary purpose is to encourage the parties towards a renewal of dialogue and negotiations with the Governments and to facilitate a new agreement.  It does not seek to limit that dialogue in any way or to foreclose consideration of other proposals or ideas.</P>
    <P>It is our considered response to the many requests addressed to the two Governments over the past few years, from the parties themselves and from other quarters, for an indication of our views on how progress might be made. The proposals we make are the result of a process of intergovernmental negotiation unprecedented in its duration and complexity.</P>
    <P>In the course of these negotiations, the two Governments dealt with the concerns of both traditions in a scrupulously fair-minded and sensitive way. Many months were spent in a painstaking search for balance and fairness and <Col N="285" /> for expressions of our position which would be manifestly reassuring to both traditions.</P>
    <P>We believe that we managed to achieve this difficult balance.  It was an essential ingredient &mdash; indeed, the essential ingredient &mdash; if the document was to be offered to the other participants as a basis for dialogue conducive to a new agreement.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day, each Government concluded that the framework which we had produced was indeed balanced. Indeed, if we had not reached this conclusion, the document would not have been agreed between us.</P>
    <P>In addition to stimulating a new talks process, the document is designed to prompt sustained reflection in the wider public arena on the kind of political structures and arrangements required as part of a balanced and equitable accommodation. Balance is the essential criterion.</P>
    <P>The premise of our approach is that an agreed Ireland must be founded on a careful and profound balancing of the needs of the two traditions.  This calls for a fundamental reassessment of all existing relationships in Ireland &mdash; both within Northern Ireland and between North and South.  In the Framework Document, the two Governments propose a major redefinition of the key relationships and ways in which a new balance might be struck within them.</P>
    <P>The central reality to be addressed is that there are two sets of rights in Ireland which are equally legitimate and merit equal respect and treatment. What the Governments are saying in the Framework Document is that these two sets must be brought into a lasting balance with each other.  The document shows how this might be achieved.</P>
    <P>Neither set of rights.  Nationalist or Unionist, can be seen to prevail in any way over the other.  The &ldquo;winner takes all&rdquo; approach must be abandoned permanently. The guiding optic henceforth must be that of parity of esteem between both communities in Northern Ireland.  A completely level playing field must be created for both traditions with <Col N="286" /> just and equal treatment and freedom from discrimination guaranteed for all citizens, irrespective of their political ethos or allegiance.  The future stability of Northern Ireland will depend in large measure on the degree to which these principles of parity and balance are given practical effect.</P>
    <P>What is indisputable is the central need for balance.  The Framework Document describes the two Governments' best judgment of how that might be achieved.  Others may have alternative suggestions and, if so, we will be very happy to hear them.  However, what cannot be questioned is that the search for agreement must start from a recognition that no accommodation will work unless it is properly balanced. There is an onus on those who have criticised some or all sections of the Framework Document to demonstrate how the balance which is required might otherwise be achieved.</P>
    <P>There are, after all, inescapable political realities to be confronted.  Northern Ireland is a deeply divided society which reflects two conflicting aspirations and two distinct political traditions.  This fundamental reality cannot be altered and it is futile for anybody to attempt to do so.</P>
    <P>We cannot afford the luxury of pretending to ourselves that the other tradition does not exist or that it does not have needs every bit as legitimate and as compelling as our own.  Reality cannot be redesigned to suit our own particular needs and perspectives.  It is not, and it never was, one dimensional.</P>
    <P>All sides must recognise that the political circumstances of this island are considerably more complex than we might like them to be and that new political structures are required to cater to and to express this complexity and diversity.  Our very diversity, indeed, should be seen not as a threat but as a potential source of enrichment in our relations with each other.  A willingness to embrace movement and change in the search for a new consensus is required on all sides.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="287" /> The essential safeguard for both traditions is the acceptance by both Governments that the constitutional future of Northern Ireland is vested entirely in the wishes of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland.  Their wishes are the decisive factor.</P>
    <P>The two Governments are agreed on the need for conditions to be created in Northern Ireland which will ensure a level playing field for both aspirations. This will enable members of both traditions, freed from coercion or pressure of any description, to work through the process of democratic persuasion alone to build support for one or the other option.</P>
    <P>The political realities which we must address are indeed complex.  The interlocking political structures and arrangements which the two Governments propose in the document reflect this.  They involve a recognition that traditional structures have not worked and that what is required on all sides is a new and imaginative approach which will help to bridge differences and to develop common ground between the two traditions.</P>
    <P>Only a comprehensive settlement which adequately acknowledges and accommodates the essential duality which lies at the heart of Northern Ireland, and of Ireland as a whole, can work.  Political agreement, which alone will facilitate lasting peace and stability, cannot be achieved unless each tradition is ready to abandon the simplistic approaches of the past and to adjust to this more complex reality.  Liberating oneself from the shackles of past orthodoxy is never an easy or comfortable experience.  However, there is no alternative if we are to attempt a new understanding and consensus between our different traditions.</P>
    <P>Over the past decade and a half Irish nationalism has been engaged in an exercise of this kind.  Beginning with the New Ireland Forum, Irish Nationalists have set out to reassess their most sacred tenets and to recognise the overriding need for agreement among the Irish people, North and South, on the <Col N="288" /> political future of the island.  The Joint Declaration and the Framework Document reflect many of the new values espoused by Irish nationalism.</P>
    <P>The document extends a number of crucial reassurances to the Unionist tradition. It proposes to enshrine and to reinforce the principle of consent through constitutional change in our jurisdiction.  It commits the Irish Government, as part of a balanced accommodation, to ask the electorate to change the Constitution so that Articles 2 and 3 would not contain any jurisdictional or territorial claim of legal right on behalf of the Irish State over the territory of Northern Ireland, contrary to the will of its people.  The reintegration of the national territory could, therefore, only occur in circumstances where the majority of the people of Northern Ireland formally choose to be part of a united Ireland.</P>
    <P>We recognise that the present wish of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland is for no change in its status. Our formal endorsement of the consent principle in our Constitution would underline more clearly than ever before our acceptance that the union would continue for as long as a majority of the people of Northern Ireland wished it to do so.</P>
    <P>The document also envisages recognition by the Irish Government of the legitimacy of a new dispensation for Northern Ireland, including whatever choice is freely exercised by a majority of the people of Northern Ireland with regard to its constitutional status.</P>
    <P>Among the institutions envisaged by the document, the two Governments propose a North-South body involving Heads of Department on both sides in which all decisions would be by agreement between the two sides.  The Heads of Department would exercise their powers in accordance with the rules for democratic authority and accountability in force in new internal institutions in Northern Ireland and in the Oireachtas. The document makes clear that the operation of the body's functions would <Col N="289" /> be subject to regular scrutiny in these institutions and in the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Both sides, Unionists and Nationalists alike, recognise that there are substantial practical benefits to be had from North-South co-operation across a range of areas of mutual interest.  There are many areas which would benefit from a rationalisation of effort and resources or from functions being handled on an all-Ireland or cross-Border basis.</P>
    <P>The North-South body would facilitate the systematic development of such co-operation on a basis agreed between both sides and in accordance with full democratic accountability.  The body would enable people in both jurisdictions to work together for the common good, to build on the shared features of both economies and to achieve important economies of scale in the use made of our island's scarce resources. The two Governments see very considerable scope for joint action in major sectors of economic endeavour and for the expansion of North-South trade and business co-operation.</P>
    <P>We see enormous potential for the economies North and South in the dramatic new context which has been created by the cease-fires and we see the North-South body making a crucial contribution to the realisation of this potential and a decisive impact, therefore, on the material prosperity of all the people of Ireland.  The body will also have a key role to play in the development of an agreed approach for the whole island in respect of the challenges and opportunities of the European Union.  There are countless new opportunities in that context which we can address much more effectively by acting together in partnership and in co-operation.</P>
    <P>Co-operation between North and South in the different economic sectors means that all the energies and resources of this island can be harnessed in the most efficient way for the common good.  Both Governments envisage, in a more general sense, that the North-South structures will also serve to help <Col N="290" /> heal the divisions between Unionists and Nationalists and to promote understanding and agreement among the people and institutions in both parts of the island.  It is in all our interests that any new structures should not only incorporate equality of expression and treatment between both traditions in Northern Ireland but also as a necessary and central dimension, provide a framework for the overcoming of divisions and the promotion of harmonious relationships on the island as a whole.</P>
    <P>Throughout the document, emphasis is laid on the need for agreement and also on the principle of consent.  The latter concept has, of course, more than one dimension.  At one level, it rules out any change in the constitutional position of Northern Ireland other than by the wishes of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland.  At another, it signals the need for political structures to be designed in such a way as to attract the consent of the Nationalist tradition.  For as long as there is no change in the constitutional position of Northern Ireland, the approval of Nationalists must be won for the political structures under which they are to live.  Consent and agreement are the cornerstones of the entire Framework Document.  They are clearly labelled as essential ingredients for stability in any political arrangements.</P>
    <P>Nothing in the Framework Document prejudices or threatens the rights of Unionists in any way.  Unionists have absolutely nothing to fear from it.  On the contrary, it guarantees to members of the Unionist tradition that in all circumstances their rights, aspirations and identity will be fully respected and allowed full expression.  The Irish Government make it clear that we seek no more for Nationalists within Northern Ireland than we would wish for Unionists to enjoy if the situation were reversed.  The entire document is grounded on the principle &mdash; long insisted on by the Unionists &mdash; that the wishes of the majority of the people of Northern Ireland are paramount.  The constitutional anxieties claimed by <Col N="291" /> Unionists are answered with a comprehensive commitment on the part of the Irish Government to constitutional change as part of an overall package.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing that both the promotion of the principle of majority consent and the commitment to constitutional change in the document have not been acknowledged by the Unionist side.  We are, after all, proposing significant change to the Irish Constitution against a background of persistent and vociferous Unionist complaints about Articles 2 and 3.  We are doing so notwithstanding the fact that this is a matter of enormous sensitivity for Nationalists, North and South, which touches on the most profound issues of ethos and identity for them.  Yet our initiative has been greeted by Unionists either with silence or with barely disguised hostility. It is not encouraging that the commitment to a change which has constantly been represented to us as the essential precondition for all future progress in North-South relations should be dismissed by some as of no value or consequence. The Irish and British Governments have shown in this document a willingness to move from traditional positions in order to facilitate political agreement.  We believe there is a reciprocal need for all others involved in this process to demonstrate that they too are willing to move.  All of us must show that we are willing to adjust our thinking and to compromise if the differences which exist are to be bridged and a new accommodation reached.</P>
    <P>The Framework Document is now on the table.  The two Governments hope it will be studied closely by the political parties over the coming weeks and that the parties will engage in early dialogue with us in order to give us their considered responses.  We hope that that will lead in turn to the launching of comprehensive and inclusive talks at the earliest possible opportunity.  The two Governments have put forward the Framework Document in a constructive spirit as a basis for dialogue and negotiation. We merely ask the parties to <Col N="292" /> respond to us in the same spirit.  We see it as incorporating the necessary balance and supplying the necessary impetus and direction for future talks.  People are free to disagree with our assessment. We do not require their agreement as a precondition for talks.  If the parties wish to put forward alternative proposals, we will be happy to consider them.  We have already welcomed the tabling of papers by the two Unionist parties last week.  We are ready to respond to all constructive suggestions by the parties for alternative approaches which would meet the essential criterion of balance.</P>
    <P>The negotiating table is where this dialogue should take place.  We invite parties to come to the table &mdash; initially in informal bilateral contacts, if they wish &mdash; to give us their reactions to the document and to set out their own positions in full.  No political interest can be jeopardised by participation in a frank and sincere dialogue without preconditions. If, however, the political representatives of one community decide not to engage in such dialogue, then they cannot claim to be serving that community's interests.  The task of seeking a fair and balanced accommodation is a collective one and those who opt out of it render the most profound disservice to the community whom they represent. Recent opinion polls, conducted since the publication of the Framework Document, have highlighted the overwhelming desire on the part of the public in Northern Ireland to see political talks begin without delay.  There is no question of the Governments ever seeking to coerce the parties into agreement on any set of arrangements &mdash; either that outlined in the Framework Document or, indeed, any other.  Everything is for discussion and everything is for agreement.  The new order which we wish to inaugurate must be built on consent, partnership and trust.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Unionist parties will weigh carefully the implications of abstaining from dialogue and will recognise the overriding need to play their part in seeking a balanced and fair <Col N="293" /> accommodation.  The two Governments are ready to build on all areas of possible agreement which emerges from contacts with the participants.  The present climate for peace offers a historic challenge from which none of us, North or South, Nationalist or Unionist, can afford to shrink.  Now is the time to draw a line under the failures and missed opportunities of the past and to start afresh in the search for a lasting political settlement.  The Irish Government are determined to exploit this unique opportunity to the full.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment Bill is to extend legislative authority to the Commissioners of Public Works to undertake works to relieve, prevent and undertake maintenance in the areas that have been subjected to localised flooding and for which the Commissioners of Public Works do not have the specific authority to undertake under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.</P>
      <P>The 1945 Act was designed in the main to undertake major schemes on the basis of a priority list drawn up in the Schedule to the Act.  Some of the major catchments on the priority list were completed in a very satisfactory way and they made an important contribution to the reclamation and drainage of thousands of acres of land.  These works had a major beneficial impact on farmer's incomes in the affected areas and relieved thousands of homes and thousands of acres of lands from floods.</P>
      <P>Development in the agricultural sector, which has resulted in the overproduction of certain agricultural products, and EU policies, which discourage certain forms of agricultural production, have resulted in a situation where the benefit from land drainage does not match the costs involved.  The prospect now is that undertaking catchment drainage schemes like the Mulcair and the Arrow/Owenmore on the lines of the arterial drainage projects of the past are remote.  Despite the fact that there are areas within these catchments where flooding causes great hardship on a regular basis, it is not possible to devise a scheme with a positive cost benefit ratio which would enable schemes to proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The arterial drainage programme has been steadily reducing over the past few years while at the same time localised flooding problems are becoming more and more acute and are occurring on a <Col N="295" /> more regular basis.  These incidents are causing widespread hardship and inconvenience and under the 1945 Act the commissioners are powerless to deal with the situation.  Accordingly, an amendment of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, is now an urgent necessity. The amendment Bill I have proposed provides the required powers to the Commissioners of Public Works and also makes other improvements, especially with regard to compensation for damages arising from floods.</P>
    <P>The main amendment, in section 3 (2), states:</P>
    <P>The Commissioners shall, without the necessity of preparing a scheme, execute drainage works for the relief and prevention and maintenance of localised flooding of lands, water-courses, coastal and estuarine incursions, including urban lands, buildings and properties as shall appear to them to be necessary or expedient.</P>
    <P>Under the 1945 Act the commissioners had the power to draw up a scheme for a major arterial catchment.  The procedure which was followed was that the scheme was designed and published and opportunities were provided for examination and objection.  However, the scheme was for a full catchment area and it would appear that specific areas cannot be dealt with under the legislation, which is why this amendment Bill is necessary.</P>
    <P>Before preparing the Bill I studied carefully the Local Authorities Works Act, 1949 and the coastal protection legislation to ascertain whether there might be another way of dealing with the problems involved.  However, the Local Authorities Works Act would not, even if amended, be adequate to meet the present requirements.  When it was in operation, programmes under the Act got into many difficulties, indeed some schemes which were commenced under the 1949 Act were never completed. In addition, the coastal protection legislation is cumbersome and involved and has not been used to any <Col N="296" /> great extent in dealing with coastal protection problems.</P>
    <P>I therefore propose to extend the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, to cover certain urgent coastal projects where continuing problems, unless remedied soon, will cost millions of pounds to resolve, over and above the present costs of undertaking minor works at present.  I have proposed therefore to extend the power to the commissioners to deal with coastal areas, especially the estuarine incursions, water-courses and urban lands.</P>
    <P>The estuaries have been very badly damaged in some respects in recent years due to changes in the pattern of tides and so on.  This can be seen in the lower Shannon estuary, especially in areas around Kilrush, where huge damage has been caused by tidal movements in the past few years leading to the breakdown of old coastal protection walls.  These were erected back in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s and have got into a state of disrepair, allowing thousands of acres to be flooded.  Some of these walls were erected under the old Land Commission schemes with participation by local farmers.  However, the Land Commission has been dissolved and there is now no mechanism to undertake this kind of work.</P>
    <P>Some of the criticisms of the arterial drainage works in the past has been to the effect that they did not take adequate account of the impact they would have on fisheries and the environment generally.  When I was considering the 1945 Act it occurred to me that we should consider amending the Act to have the Commissioners of Public Works comply fully with the Fisheries Acts, as they are exempt from complying with these Acts under the 1945 Act even though the Act provides that consultation be held with the Minister for the Marine &mdash; although at that time it would have been with the Minister for Agriculture and Lands.  Many of these matters of responsibility have been changed and it is now very difficult to ascertain who is responsible for these matters.  In some respects ministerial <Col N="297" /> responsibility has been given to the Minster for the Marine to deal with coastal protection matters, even though legislative provision is not granted.</P>
    <P>This is a huge area which needs amendment and examination, but to do so now, given the urgency of the present situation, would be too time consuming and would not meet present urgent requirements.  However, I have proposed that the Commissioners of Public Works would have consultations with the Minister for the Marine before completing any works on this new provision and that they would also consult with the Environmental Protection Agency to ensure, first, that there would minimal damage to fisheries, and, secondly, as little damage as possible to the environment while undertaking some of these works.</P>
    <P>There has been widespread criticism of the failure of the local authorities to undertake vital drainage maintenance works.  In fairness, the authorities did not have the necessary finance to undertake meaningful drainage maintenance schemes.  This measure will enable the commissioners to execute maintenance programmes to help eliminate localised flood problems in specific areas.  Where the 1945 Act provides that a council has responsibility for the maintenance of drainage works in a drainage district or that a joint committee has responsibility to furnish a report to the commissioners every year, I propose to extend this to ensure that notice is given locally that such a report is being prepared and that the public, or any person interested, can inspect the report in the council office or with the joint committee.</P>
    <P>This provision will ensure transparency in the matter as to what maintenance works have been undertaken and it will enable the public who are interested to inspect the report and ascertain precisely what has been done during that year.  It would offer the opportunity to many people who have been critical of maintenance programmes to look at the report when published and see what work has been undertaken in specific areas with regard <Col N="298" /> to maintenance undertaken by local authorities.  The purpose is to broaden the existing powers to allow for transparency at local level.</P>
    <P>Section 5 sets out the procedure for making application for payment of compensation. This is the most important aspect of present legislation which has been subject to severe criticism.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State will be fully aware that there has been very widespread public condemnation of the fact that householders have suffered from flooding over successive years, sometimes for weeks on end, which is the present situation in Gort.  They are demanding that the Minister will take action to declare such areas disaster areas.  The view is that widespread damage has been done and that, even with the announcement which the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry made in relation to agriculture, many householders are in a very bad financial state because of the recurring flooding problem and their inability to get insurance at a reasonable cost.</P>
    <P>We set out in section 5 the procedure for application for compensation by householders and businesses seriously affected by localised flooding.  The section is quite simple and I have also provided a remedy for people who are dissatisfied whereby they can lodge an appeal to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that the Minister shall pay compensation as determined by the committee.  Every application for compensation under section 5 shall be referred to the committee by the Minister. The function of the committee shall be to investigate such applications, to ascertain whether the applicant is entitled to compensation, to calculate the amount of the compensation and to report in writing to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I have also provided that the committee would have further powers, at the request of the Minister, to advise the Minister in relation to these matters, monitor and review the causes and effects generally of flooding and perform any other functions as the Minister may assign to it from time to time.  For <Col N="299" /> instance, the Minister could ask the committee to draw up a list of priority areas in need of attention.</P>
    <P>I have refrained from attaching a schedule of priority areas to this Bill because the old priority list was not very satisfactory.  There were continuous complaints that areas in need of attention which were not on the schedule were neglected.  There were also complaints &mdash; I cannot say if any were sustained &mdash; and a widespread perception that the lists were being changed.  If a schedule was attached to this legislation, unless an area suffering from unexpected local flooding problems was on the schedule it would not be possible to undertake relief work there.</P>
    <P>I have refrained from attaching a specific schedule although I know that 90 or 100 areas are subject to localised flooding on a regular basis.  However, it would be unwise to put a specific schedule in place because, as happened recently, areas which had not previously been subjected to flooding could be seriously affected for a long time.</P>
    <P>Subsection (6) authorises the Minister to dissolve the committee.  Subsection (9) deals with the referral of applications to the committee.  In section 101 have provided a penalty for giving false information in relation to applications for compensation.</P>
    <P>I have endeavoured to keep the provisions of the Bill as simple and straightforward as possible.  I appreciate that at a time of strict financial management it would be unwise to put a legislative framework in place which would be open ended or would allow for misuse or abuse of public funds.  For this reason, although there may be some objections, I have given substantial authority in the payment of compensation to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Overall, I believe that this Bill is an adequate and reasonable response to the very severe personal crises which have arisen for many innocent people who have been completely overwhelmed and left powerless to deal with localised flooding problems, not of their <Col N="300" /> making and over which they have little or no control.  Those whose homes have been flooded and, in some cases, abandoned, and who have seen their lands under water and have lost stock and businesses are looking to the Government for assistance.  I refer in particular to areas in my locality, such as Gort in Galway and the north Clare and Burren region, where some people have had to leave their homes and are residing in bed and breakfast accommodation.  This has also happened in other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>We in the Houses of the Oireachtas have a responsibility to act now to bring them some relief and some prospect of hope for the future.  Recounting the shortcomings of the past is no consolation to those who are awaiting an indication of what we propose to do to resolve these problems.  This Bill is the proposal of Fianna Fáil.  If Members feel that we should add to or subtract from the Bill we are prepared to examine any suggestion or amendment which they wish to put forward.  I believe that there is all party support for this measure and I commend this Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. J. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Little did I think when I was appointed Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works that I would find myself back in my old Alma Mater, so to speak, three weeks in succession.  I am, of course, very happy to be here to listen to the views of Senators on the important topic of flooding and the hardship which it has caused &mdash; and in come cases is still causing &mdash; and to deliberate on the measures which need to be taken in order to deal with the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also glad of the opportunity to outline once again my own views and those of the Government on this matter. I also want to avail of the opportunity to once again assure all those who have suffered hardship because of the flooding of the Government's continuing concern for their situation.  The speedy response which we have shown so far <Col N="301" /> will be continued and wherever it is reasonably possible we will make immediate assistance available.  There are some aspects of the flooding problem which will require more long term remedial action and we are already pursuing these matters actively also.</P>
    <P>The drainage and flood problems in Ireland are long standing, so much so that they have been the subject of consideration by a number of drainage commissions and other reports dating back to the last century.  The conclusion of all of these was that Ireland had an extensive drainage problem.  Coupled with the very high rainfall and consequent run off, the saucer shape of the countryside with its high maritime rim and flat interior leads to sluggish rivers flowing through inadequate channels which even at low tide provide poor outfalls.  If left unattended, these slow flowing rivers tend to silt up, conditions degenerate and the need for remedial works is recurrent.  Consequently, State involvement in arterial drainage has a long history, dating back to pre-Famine times.</P>
    <P>For upwards of 100 years prior to 1945, drainage works in Ireland were carried out on a piecemeal basis and dealt with problems in localised areas of river catchments.  Several hundred of these minor schemes were carried out under various statutes in what came to be known as drainage districts.  The maintenance of these subsequently became the responsibility of the local authorities under various statutes. There are still more than 150 drainage districts in existence, the remainder having been absorbed into schemes carried out under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.</P>
    <P>The inadequacies of this piecemeal approach to deal with drainage problems were highlighted by the various drainage commissions, particularly the Browne Commission, 1938-40.  It commented adversely on the haphazard creation of individual districts without consideration of the interests, problems and requirements of river basins as a whole.  This was judged to be inconsistent <Col N="302" /> with the idea of a planned drainage policy.  Lack of maintenance was also a feature to such a degree that many schemes deteriorated to the extent that works had to be redone, often on more than one occasion.</P>
    <P>Among the main recommendations of the Browne Commission was that there should be a central drainage authority based in the Office of Public Works with responsibility for the construction and maintenance of arterial drainage schemes on a catchment basis.  The Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, gave effect to the recommendations of the Browne Commission.  It is now the sole basis of the commissioners' statutory authority for arterial drainage.</P>
    <P>Following the passing of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, a national drainage programme was initiated.  It was based on priority lists of 60 or so of the most important river catchments in the country, excluding the Shannon, which because of its size has had to be considered separately.</P>
    <P>The priority lists were divided into major and minor catchments with works proceeding simultaneously on the two categories.  When the priority lists were drawn up in 1946, catchments with large scale flooding problems, whose relief would benefit a substantial number of people and present no special technical or legal difficulties or involve extensive works of very high cost, for example, major rock cuts through built up areas, were given a high ranking.  Essentially, the policy was to bring relief to the areas of greatest need as quickly as possible, allied to a fairly even distribution of schemes throughout the country. With a few exceptions, these lists have been upheld by successive Governments.</P>
    <P>In the late 1950s, a further category of catchments was devised to enable field drainage contractors and others to tender for arterial drainage work which would be within their capacity and capability. This category comprised relatively small catchments with an outfall directly to the sea or to the Shannon. In addition, a number of embankment <Col N="303" /> schemes have been constructed under Part IV of the Act, mainly on the Shannon, Fergus and Swilly estuaries.</P>
    <P>In the 50 years since the passing of the Act, some £500 million in constant terms has been expended on the construction of more than 40 drainage and embankment schemes so far completed or in progress while an additional £140 million has been spent on maintenance. During the period 1979-89 substantial grants towards the capital cost of the work were paid to the Exchequer from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund in respect of the Corrib-Mask-Robe, Boyle and Bonet schemes under the western drainage programme and Blackwater schemes under the cross-Border drainage programme.</P>
    <P>In addition, the European Regional Development Fund part financed schemes in respect of the Boyne and Maigue catchments.  Total EU receipts amounted to well over £40 million in present day terms.  In this period drainage schemes also attracted project related low interest loans totalling another £40 million from the European Investment Bank.  In keeping with the criterion of fair geographical distribution in the drawing up of the priority lists, I wish to mention that the programme of works so far completed has extended to 23 of the 26 counties.  In all, in excess of 650,000 acres have benefited from works on a total of some 7,300 miles of river channels and coastal and estuarine embankments.</P>
    <P>I have dealt in some detail with the history of drainage and flood relief works, both prior to and following the passing of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  At this juncture, I wish to elaborate on what arterial drainage consists of. The purpose of arterial drainage is to relieve chronically waterlogged agricultural land and make it capable of production. This is done by the opening or enlarging of the main channels and tributary watercourses of a catchment by the deepening, widening or removal of obstructions, such as weirs, and by <Col N="304" /> making new cuts and easing bends.  A comprehensive scheme was intended to cater for a catchment as a whole, solving all its drainage problems in so far as such was expedient and economic.</P>
    <P>An arterial drainage scheme would not be embarked upon without a thorough study of conditions throughout a river basin, including tributaries, large and small.  Detailed engineering and valuation surveys of hydrological, topographical, environmental and land usage conditions are required, occupying invariably a number of years.  There is also a lengthy statutory exhibition and consultation period to be followed before any scheme can commence.</P>
    <P>With the ever increasing demand in recent years on the public purse, there has been a greater awareness of the need that major expenditure projects should meet certain criteria, both in the context of their economic merit and environmental impact.  Cost benefit analysis was first applied in the Office of Public Works in 1970 to a drainage scheme then proposed for the Maigue catchment, situated mainly in County Limerick.  While the primary objective of arterial drainage is to increase the incomes of those whose lands are affected by waterlogging and flooding, other benefits include the provision of employment in areas, often of high unemployment, as well as flood prevention and drainage of urban areas.  Public roads and bogs are also taken into consideration. The main costs comprise the capital outlay on the construction of a scheme, including compensation to those claiming losses from work, followed by maintenance of completed schemes, and landowners' investment in field drainage, additional livestock, buildings, etc.</P>
    <P>Since its introduction, cost benefit analysis has been applied to a total of eight schemes.  For many years, too, it has been the practice in the preparation of drainage schemes to endeavour to assess the likely effects of works on various matters relating to the environment. Among the issues considered are wildlife, flora and fauna, fishing and <Col N="305" /> fisheries, landscape, etc.  In the design and execution of schemes regard is had to these matters and necessary changes in work practices have been adopted: comprehensive fishery rehabilitation programmes are undertaken: spoil is buried and the lands rehabilitated rather than heaped on the river bank as had been the practice and areas of scientific interest are, where possible, excluded from schemes at planning stage.</P>
    <P>With the passing of Directive No. 85/337/EC for the assessment of the effects of certain projects on the environment, which was subsequently incorporated into national legislation, it has become obligatory on the Office of Public Works to carry out detailed environmental impact assessments for all schemes and to publish the reports as part of the scheme documents.  Given the lengthy gestation period of a scheme, it is a testament to the efforts of the Office of Public Works that so much work has been done when one considers the huge area of land, extended as I have said over 23 counties, which has benefited.</P>
    <P>I have dealt in some detail with the history and execution of works under the arterial drainage programme both prior to and following the passage of the 1945 Act.  I now wish to mention the maintenance aspects of schemes undertaken. The importance of maintenance has been highlighted over the years and the following extract from the report of the Browne Commission serves to illustrate the point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>It would help if the Minister could provide a copy of his statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>My apologies.  Senator Daly.  The circulation of copies will follow soon.  They are en route.  My apologies to the House.  I quote from the Browne Commission report to underline the importance of and need for maintenance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="306" /> The maintenance of completed works is a problem which we regard as of utmost importance and to which we have given very serious consideration. It would be folly to expend millions of pounds on construction works unless some system is devised which will guarantee effective maintenance of the completed works.  Constant vigilance and regular attention are essential if a drainage system is to be kept in good working condition.  Disrepair of a road is purely local in its results but the failure to maintain a stretch of river may seriously affect the efficiency of the river for miles.  Failure to maintain the outfall of a river in one county may react on the whole river system in several counties. Maintenance must be of a uniform standard.  Such a standard is difficult to secure if maintenance is entrusted to several authorities.  Neglect of maintenance is cumulative is its results.  A small regular expenditure may preserve good conditions, but neglect over a number of years will lead to such a state of deterioration that the job ceases to be one of maintenance and becomes one of costly restoration.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence to suggest that these recommendations are any less valid today than 50 years ago.  Under sections 37 and 38 of the 1945 Act, the Office of Public Works carries out an annual programme of maintenance in accordance with its obligations to maintain schemes in proper repair and effective condition.  Annual expenditure on maintenance works now stands at approximately £7 million.</P>
    <P>The subject of the debate is the Arterial Drainage (Amendment) Bill, 1995, which was introduced by Senator Daly.  The Bill has two primary objectives &mdash; the amendment of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, to allow works to be undertaken to deal with localised flooding, and the establishment of statutory provisions in relation to the payment of compensation for flooding.  I am asking the House to oppose the Bill on <Col N="307" /> the grounds that in the first case the Government will introduce as quickly as possible its own legislation to permit work to relieve localised flooding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>When?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about weeks and months and certainly not years, like the promises of the past.  It will be at the outside weeks and, hopefully, within three months.  The promised provisions are unnecessary since there are already adequate provisions and mechanisms in existence for paying compensation where that is appropriate. I will develop both of these points in more detail later, but before doing so may I commend Senator Daly on his initiative in introducing the Bill and assure him that the objectives he is setting out to attain will be more effectively achieved by the measures which the Government has already taken on in proposing this new legislation.</P>
      <P>I know that Senator Daly's decision to prepare his Bill was prompted by his experience of flooding in his own constituency of County Clare.  Senator Daly was one of those who accompanied my predecessor, Deputy Hogan, when he visited Clare in the course of a tour of areas affected by flooding as early as last January.  I am conscious that County Clare suffered widespread flooding, in particular the west of the county, with flooding in Ennis, Sixmilebridge, New-market and Corofin causing people to leave their homes, imposing hardship on the agricultural community and resulting in numerous road closures.  It is indeed commendable that the Senator has tried to respond to the difficulties of his area, which of course are mirrored around the country, by promoting these measures in this Bill.  I believe, however, that the Bill, though clearly well intentioned, is defective in a number of respects and that I will be able to establish that fact to the satisfaction of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will be aware that the Government has established an interdepartmental <Col N="308" /> committee to co-ordinate its response to the effects of bad weather. The committee, which I will chair, will have representatives of the Departments of the Taoiseach, Tánaiste, Finance, Justice, the Environment, Health, Defence, Agriculture, Food and Forestry, the Marine, Social Welfare, Transport, Energy and Communications and the Office of Public Works.  This is a broadly based committee indicative of the range of Government Departments and State agencies whose resources have been deployed and will continue to be deployed for as long as is necessary in response to the flooding.  The committee will be in a position to take an overview of the situation and to co-ordinate the responses of the various Departments and agencies.  It will not be the job of the committee to usurp any of those functions but rather to ensure that the overall response is effective and coherent and, of course, if there are any shortcomings or gaps in the response, to initiate the necessary corrective measures.  That committee will sit for the first time next Tuesday.</P>
    <P>I must say at this stage that the response of the various Departments and agencies to date has been magnificent and I thank and compliment all concerned.  I want to compliment especially here this evening the work of the Air Corps which has been absolutely critical in recent weeks, especially in relieving the situation in south Galway. The conditions in parts of that area are unbelievable and the supplies which are being brought in by the Air Corps have been absolutely vital to the maintenance of some semblance of normal living there.</P>
    <P>I have already begun to receive, in my capacity as chairman of the interdepartmental committee, interim assessments of the effects of the flooding.  These reports illustrate clearly the widespread nature of the problem.  South Galway is, of course, the area worst affected at present.  The scale of the problems are so great there that it has, I think, caught the public imagination more than any other and has given rise to a determination, <Col N="309" /> first, to try to identify the causes of the problems there and, second, to go on from that and find solutions to them. In passing I would like to pay tribute to the work of the media in general and of RTE in particular in bringing the problem so clearly and graphically to public attention and helping us all to be aware of the distress of many people in the area and of their anxieties and concerns for the future.  I also pay tribute to the Senators and Deputies who have assisted their constituents and highlighted some of the problems.</P>
    <P>In south Galway thousands of hectares of land are still under water, roads are still flooded and farms and farm buildings are waterlogged and flooded. Of course, there has also been losses of fodder and livestock.  In some cases I understand that farmers have been forced to sell livestock.  Most importantly, some homes are still flooded and people are, therefore, dislodged and dislocated.  This is a tragedy by any standards and my heart goes out to those affected, with whose situation I am at this stage very familiar personally from my visits there.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, while south Galway is by far the most seriously affected area, it is by no means the only area to have suffered.  North Galway was also affected, particularly Glenamaddy and the adjoining areas.  Last weekend I again visited the Dunmore/ Wiliiamstown/Glenamaddy area to see the devastation there because they did not have their hour in the sun either on radio or on television.  To see 33 families isolated was something to behold; seeing is believing.  However, I understand that the floods on this occasion were not as high as the floods which occurred in January of last year.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonagh gave us a detailed account of the problems here last Tuesday in this House.  County Roscommon and the Suck catchment have also experienced severe flooding.  Senators Naughten and Finneran spoke eloquently in this House about the problems in that area, especially around Clonown and Ballyforan.  I understand <Col N="310" /> that fodder, particularly baled silage, has been lost in that area.  I referred already to the problems in Senator Daly's area of County Clare.  Agriculture, as well as roads and houses, have suffered in this area too.</P>
    <P>Serious flooding occurred in Carlow and Graigenacullen and through the Barrow valley from Carlow to Bagnalstown. Here again the pattern of houses being flooded, roads being submerged and blocked, land flooded, with fodder lost and livestock threatened, has been repeated.  The Mulcair river, which unfortunately floods all too regularly, again caused major problems on this occasion.  Cappamore was most seriously affected, flooding on a number of occasions, while Newport was also flooded.  Extensive areas of low lying farmland and grassland were also flooded.  Some dwelling houses and farm buildings were also cut off for a time.</P>
    <P>While these appear to have been the worst hit areas, they are by no means the only ones affected.  Exceptionally heavy rainfall, in many cases more than twice the norm, was experienced throughout the country and hardly any area at all escaped.  The reports currently available to me show that County Kilkenny and east Waterford were also affected, with urban flooding being experienced in Kilkenny city and Graiguenamanagh. In County Wicklow, flooding was reported in several areas, including Tinahely, Shillelagh and Carnew. In County Wexford, the River Slaney burst its banks and flooded houses in Bunclody.  I have also received reports of flooding in the Owenmore catchment area in Sligo and, of course, in my own county of Mayo.  While by no means the worst affected, it, as Senator Burke will testify, was also affected.</P>
    <P>Extensive flooding has, of course, also occurred in the Shannon basin.  Areas around Castledaly, Tubbrit, Moydrum, Glasson, Killinure and Mucknagh in County Westmeath and Banagher, Shannonharbour and Clara &mdash; Senator Enright brought this to my attention &mdash; are all reported to have experienced significant <Col N="311" /> flooding.  Some families have had to be moved temporarily from their homes and of course the pattern of flooding of land and farm buildings and the loss of fodder and livestock has been experienced here too.  In one case alone it has been reported that a farmer lost 58 ewes near Clara.  The incidence of flooding in the Shannon basin is another particularly intractable problem.</P>
    <P>At this juncture I would like to make some reference to the position regarding the Shannon.  The enormity of the problems associated with the Shannon have been highlighted over the years and on many occasions, both in specially commissioned studies and in various debates in the two Houses of the Oireachtas.  In short, there is no simple or obvious solution.  The channel, particularly in the 27 or so miles between Athlone and Meelick, is simply too narrow and shallow to cater for the huge volumes of water involved.  While in the circumstances it has been possible to carry out major engineering works on some of the main tributaries, others, along with the main stem itself, have had to be deferred in the national programme. The Shannon has often been described as a series of large lakes, notably Loughs Alien, Ree and Derg and many other smaller lakes connected together by a series of sluggish channels. It is these characteristics of the river which cause so much flooding of its basin.</P>
    <P>It is now generally accepted that the problems associated with the flooding of the Shannon cannot be solved economically by drainage works and some other means of dealing with them must be found.  It has to be borne in mind that part of the area which has been subjected to regular flooding, the Shannon Callows, is now regarded as being of major significance in ecological terms.  It is also worth noting that while the flooding in the Shannon basin does cause problems, especially for farmers, there are far fewer cases of peoples' homes being flooded or of people being marooned by flood waters than occur in <Col N="312" /> other areas where the floods may be less extensive.  This appears to be due to a policy pursued over the years by both the Land Commission and local authorities of relocating people from the flood plain to areas of higher ground in the same area.  The apparent success of this policy may offer some guidance as to one method of alleviating the hardship caused by regular flooding in other areas.</P>
    <P>It has also been stated that the operation of the power station at Ardnacrusha is a contributory factor to the flooding in the Shannon basin.  I understand Ardnacrusha is an important element in the ESB power generating network and I am assured that it has full regard to the consequences, including the risk of flooding at times of high rainfall, in exercising its statutory authority to control water levels in the Shannon.  There is no evidence that the operation of Ardnacrusha exacerbates the flooding problem in the Shannon basin.  While the Office of Public Works has no powers to regulate the water levels on the Shannon &mdash; as I have already said, the statutory control rests with the Electricity Supply Board &mdash; I will nevertheless keep the situation under review in the context of the work of the interdepartmental committee.  As I indicated at the outset, I ask the House to oppose this Bill on the grounds that it is unnecessary and defective.</P>
    <P>I will deal first with the argument that the Bill is unnecessary.  When I first addressed this House I indicated that I was confident that the proposals for the amendment of the Arterial Drainage Act which had been prepared by the Office of Public Works on the instructions of the previous Government would shortly be cleared by him for submission to the House.  I am happy to be able to inform the House that the Minister for Finance, after careful study of the proposals, has now cleared them. They are being circulated to the relevant Government Departments for observations in accordance with the standard procedure.  The proposals will be brought to Government in the shortest <Col N="313" /> possible time.  I will also be asking the Attorney General to accord them priority in the parliamentary draftsman's office with a view to having a Bill submitted to the Oireachtas as quickly as possible.  I am advised that it has already been agreed between the Whips that the Government's Bill will be initiated in this House.  It is the intention, in the interest of expediting-the Bill and ensuring it is enacted as soon as possible, that it will be initiated in the Seanad where Members will have ample opportunity to amend, discuss, add and delete from it and improve the Bill if so fit.  The Bill will then proceed to the Dáil.  By initiating the Bill in the Seanad we are acknowledging the contribution of Senator Daly and ensuring that it will be expedited by the other House as soon as possible to be signed by the President.  Effective action will follow as a result.</P>
    <P>We have been assured in this House and in the Dáil of the support of the Opposition for the Office of Public Works's proposals if the Government was prepared to introduce a Bill to give effect to them.  I welcome those assurances and I am confident that with the support of all sides in the Oireachtas, the Government's proposals can be quickly enacted.  The Government's proposals in relation to the amendment to the Arterial Drainage Act will, I am confident, meet fully Senator Daly's objective in relation to the relief of localised flooding.  I believe all sides of this House would agree that a Government Bill, brought forward after full consultation with all of the relevant Departments and drafted by the parliamentary draughtsman, is likely to be superior to a Private Members' Bill, however carefully that Bill may have been prepared.  Therefore, I would urge Senators to await the Government's proposals, which, as I have assured the House, will be brought forward here as a matter of priority.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be critical of the drafting of Senator Daly's Bill since, as I said, I share his objective of putting the Office of Public Works in a position <Col N="314" /> to deal with the localised flooding. There is however one consequence of the Bill as drafted that causes me great concern and which I feel should be drawn to the attention of the House. Under the terms of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, section 8 (20) where a drainage scheme provides for the inclusion of all or part of existing drainage works, the drainage district containing such works ceases to exist.  The effect of this could be and would be in many cases that if Senator Daly's Bill, which contains no provision to deal with that situation, was enacted and used as the authority to do work in localised areas, the entire drainage district in which the local area was situated would cease to exist.  This would leave a substantial catchment area without any authority with responsibility for the maintenance of its watercourses.  That would be a disastrous outcome.</P>
    <P>Several Senators speaking in this House last week referred to the importance of basic maintenance of watercourses in the prevention or limiting of flooding.  That is a view with which I wholeheartedly agree.  I have asked the Commissioners of Public Works to investigate whether they could use the limited supervisory powers which they have in respect of drainage districts to try to bring about more effective maintenance of rivers.  The Government's Bill, when it is introduced, will contain a provision to ensure that the maintenance structures will remain in place in districts where work to relieve localised flooding is undertaken.  I believe this is of critical importance and is in itself sufficient reason to oppose this Bill.</P>
    <P>I might also point out to the House that the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945. contains detailed provisions setting out the information that must be contained in a drainage scheme and which must therefore be published and subjected to consultation.  Senator Daly's proposal would allow the commissioners to execute work for the relief of localised flooding without the necessity of preparing a scheme.  While I have no doubt that the intention of the Senator is to <Col N="315" /> relieve the commissioners of their present obligation to prepare a scheme for an entire catchment, the effect of the provision could in fact be quite different. This example illustrates the wisdom of waiting for the Government's Bill. which, as I indicated, will have the benefit of scrutiny by the Government Departments and drafting by the parliamentary draftsmen.</P>
    <P>I do not intend that the time while the Government Bill is being processed will be wasted.  There are a number of areas where the Commissioners of Public Works have sufficient data to enable them to commence immediately the design of schemes to relieve localised flooding.  I intend to proceed without delay to engage consultants to undertake the design of these schemes.  I am satisfied that there are sufficient powers available to the commissioners under the existing legislation to enable them to proceed with the design stages of these schemes.</P>
    <P>There are a far greater number of locations where the information currently available is inadequate to allow the design of flood defences.  I have asked the Commissioners of Public Works to proceed as quickly as possible to install the necessary data collection equipment and to commence the collection of information.  This can also be done under the legislation as it stands. In fact the availability of the equipment may be the constraining factor in this area.</P>
    <P>I have also asked the commissioners to commence work on compiling information on matters such as the extent and frequency of flooding in various areas, the extent of loss and hardship caused, the nature of problems to be overcome and the likely cost and time-frame for doing so as well as impediments that may exist to the execution of relief works, such as environmental considerations.  I intend this information to be used as a basis for drawing up a priority list for schemes to be undertaken in the future.  I realise that there was criticism of the priority lists for <Col N="316" /> catchment drainage schemes &mdash; mostly, I have to say, from those who were in areas unlucky enough not to be high up the lists.  However, there is a large programme of work to be done and it cannot be done all at once.  It is, therefore, necessary to have an orderly programme of work laid out and to assign priorities to various schemes to demonstrate that the work is being tackled in a fair and objective way.  It would, however, be my intention that the priority list should be reviewed from time to time to ensure that changing circumstances are taken into account and that it is always relevant and up to date.</P>
    <P>I have already announced to the House that we are going to undertake a major study to try to determine the causes of flooding in south Galway and, if possible, to identify the economic solution that would also be environmentally acceptable.  This study can be undertaken under the existing legislation. I envisage that any remedial works which it may be decided to adopt as a result of the study could be executed under the provisions of the amending legislation which the Government will be promoting.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly's Bill also deals with the issue of compensation.  I have already advised the House that it is my intention to travel to Brussels and put Ireland's case for a share of the special fund established to assist victims of flooding in the EU.  My initial contacts with Brussels have indicated that the emergency fund is being channelled through the Red Cross Society in member states.  I have, therefore, invited the Irish Red Cross Society, which, I understand, has also put forward a case for funding, to join me in seeking funds and to undertake the distribution of such funds.</P>

      <P>They have it.  Senators may recall that in June 1993 Ireland experienced exceptionally heavy rainfall. This followed on the wettest month of May on record and resulted in widespread flooding, particularly in the east of the country.  As a result of the hardship caused the EU allocated approximately £160,000 to assist the victims of the flooding.  This aid was distributed by the Irish Red Cross Society.  On that occasion it assisted 122 victims in eight counties.</P>
      <P>An analysis shows that damage to the homes of those affected by the flooding consisted mainly of the following: structural damage, water damage to floor covering, water damage to wall paper and paint work, water damage to furniture, water damage to electrical appliances, loss of personal items, books clothes and musical instruments, loss of fuel from outbuildings and damage to gardens.</P>
      <P>The analysis also showed that the majority of applicants who applied for assistance from the EU flood damage fund found themselves in severe financial distress and, in many cases, had nowhere else to turn for assistance but the Red Cross &mdash; Fianna Fáil was in power at the time.</P>

      <P>Many applicants found that they had insufficient or no insurance cover on their property at the time of the flooding.  Where people had to leave their homes local authorities assisted through the provision of temporary accommodation.  The relevant health board in some cases was in a position to provide financial aid to the victims, contributing toward the replacement of household furnishings and domestic appliances, and made cash subventions where deemed necessary.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment, in answer to questions put to him in Dáil Éireann, advised that &ldquo;individuals affected by the flooding who need assistance should contact their local community welfare officer&rdquo;.  Community welfare officers in turn referred individuals to the Irish Red Cross Society where and when they were unable to give assistance themselves.</P>
      <P>In administering the EU aid in 1993, the Irish Red Cross Society established a number of ground rules to guide them in considering individual applications. As individual circumstances were the most important factor in arriving at an award, the society decided that no inflexible rules would apply to the disbursement of aid, and each application was processed on its merits by a small committee established by the society. Most importantly, the cheques issued quickly when assistance had been approved.</P>
      <P>The scale and extent of the most recent flooding is greater than what occurred in 1993 but I have no doubt that the Irish Red Cross Society has the skill and expertise to undertake the distribution of any funds we may be able to secure from the EU on this occasion. They will also bring to the task an essential ability to act quickly and flexibly with a minimum of red tape.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I informed the House when I spoke here last Thursday that the legislation governing the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is funded by the Department of Social Welfare and administered on its behalf by the health boards, contains provisions which <Col N="319" /> enable the health boards to respond to exceptional and urgent needs.  While supplementary welfare allowance is normally payable only to those on social welfare or health board payments, there are provisions in the legislation which allow boards to respond to the urgent needs of those normally excluded, for example, those in full-time employment. Guidance given to boards over the years gives flooding as an example where boards may assist persons normally excluded.  I am saying, therefore, that the health boards may be in a position to assist people with exceptional or urgent needs arising from non-insurable risks due to the flooding.</P>
    <P>I understand from interim reports I have received that a small number of claims have already been submitted and are being processed.  The House will also be aware that provision was made in the budget for a £2 million compensation fund for the relief of hardship in the agricultural sector, in particular loss of fodder and livestock.  Details of that scheme have been announced by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and he has promised that applications will be dealt with speedily.  During the statements in this House last week my attention was drawn to some apparent difficulties with the scheme in relation to the forms, etc. and I have brought these to the attention of my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates.</P>
    <P>I should, of course, emphasise that it would be expected in the normal course that risks would be covered by insurance and that a burden of compensation for insurable risks should not fall on the State.  In saying that, I am conscious of the point made by a number of Senators last week and the previous week that there will be circumstances where, purely because of a history of previous flooding, people may have been simply unable to secure insurance. I agree that such cases would merit special consideration.  The budget also contained an additional provision of £4 million for county roads.  These funds <Col N="320" /> will be available through the Department of the Environment to assist the local authorities to deal with the additional damage which the floods have caused to many roads.</P>
    <P>I hope I have demonstrated to the satisfaction of the House that there are already in existence ample mechanisms for the payment of compensation or the provision of financial assistance to those who may be entitled to it.  I see no need to introduce a further measure to deal with the situation and I hope that, on reflection, the House will agree.</P>
    <P>If there was a need to provide a new statutory mechanism for the payment of compensation to victims of flooding, and I reiterate that there is not, the Office of Public Works would not be the appropriate body to administer such a provision.  I realise that the Arterial Drainage Act does at present contain provision in relation to the payment of compensation to persons who suffer loss or damage as a consequence of the execution of an arterial drainage scheme.  However, Senators will acknowledge that flooding due to bad weather is quite a different matter.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works has within its ranks a wide range of expertise on a variety of disciplines.  However, it has no expertise in assessing hardship due to the effects of bad weather.  It has been blamed for many things over the years but I am surprised that Senator Daly, a former Minister with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, apparently wants to blame it for the weather.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">

      <P>We fully share his objectives and we are already acting on them.  Our position is, quite simply, that in relation to the amendment of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, we will be bringing forward our own Bill which will achieve that shared objective, but will do so in a more effective and efficient way.  We will do that with all possible speed.</P>
      <P>On the question of compensation the existing mechanisms are adequate and are already in operation.  There is no need for further legislation in this area, and if the proposed legislation were to result in the imposition of a further layer of bureaucracy and to introduce less flexible procedures for processing claims, as it might well do, it would end up hindering the very people it is genuinely intended to assist.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>In this debate I have tried to be responsible and not to be critical especially from a party point of view and I will do my best to continue in that vein.  However, I am extremely disappointed in the speech by the Minister, Deputy Higgins.  It is not like him.  I am disappointed that he has chosen to read out what can only be described as a Civil Service script.  The Minister said that he wants</P>
      <P>... to assure all those who have suffered hardship of the Government's continuing concern at their situation. The speedy response which we have shown so far will be continued and, wherever it is reasonably possible, we will make immediate assistance available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has not been one ounce of response to this problem so far.  I attended a meeting this morning in Tiernievan in Gort.  Many people came to the local school to express their concern. Since St. Stephen's Day houses in the south Galway area have been under water, and today is 1 March and the only thing the Minister can tell us this evening is that the health board may be in a position to offer some assistance to <Col N="322" /> those people.  I have to be critical of this Government which has given no response to date to the worst crisis experienced in this country in regard to flood water.  I have a great admiration for the Minister, Deputy Jim Higgins. He is a good politician but he has fallen under the spell of the civil servants and he is unable to act.  It a Fianna Fáil Minister was sitting in the House, I would be saying the same thing.  I want to reiterate that I am not toeing political about this.</P>
    <P>The situation in south Galway is appalling.  There is a young lady in the visitors' gallery who got out of her bed last week and stepped into six inches of water.  That happened last week and we had the worst of the flooding four weeks ago.  There are now 19 houses under water in south Galway.  To tell us that the Red Cross will do something for them at some stage is a far from adequate response.  For the Minister to tell us he has a continuing concern at this stage is of no benefit to the people I heard this morning talking and crying about their plight.  The Minister spoke about the speedy response he has shown so far but I do not know of any such response.</P>
    <P>The Government introduced a £2 million fund in the budget.  Last Friday night 250 farmers attended a meeting organised by the IFA in Gort and the local IFA chairman asked them who would qualify for funds under this scheme to raise their hands.  I counted eight people who had lost stock and seven who had lost fodder.  Those people are in the most seriously affected area in this country.  There were over 250 people at the meeting and 15 people qualified for help.  This shows clearly that the scheme announced is totally inadequate to solve the problem.  There are farmers in south Galway whose entire farms are under water.  Why somebody whose land is under water cannot be compensated under this scheme if he does not lose fodder is beyond me because that land will not produce anything this year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="323" /> I do not wish the Minister present or anyone else to take my remarks personally, but I have to express in the strongest terms the level of frustration &mdash; I am sure Senator McDonagh will bear me out on this &mdash; that now exists in the south Galway area.  It has been five weeks since the worst flooding started, five weeks while most of the houses and land are under water, yet we have had no response other than a scheme which will help very few people.  So far there has been no response from the Government on whether assistance can be given to those with the most serious problems &mdash; those whose houses are under water. I had hoped the Minister would take the opportunity tonight to say categorically that funds will be provided by the Government, where they will come from, who will allocate them, etc., to help these people.</P>
    <P>There are people in south Galway who have been five weeks out of their houses.  They are either living with relations or in rented accommodation. The frustration and the inevitable difficulties that arise when people are forced to live with their in-laws or have to spend money on rented accommodation for five weeks are coming to the fore.  I saw three women at a meeting this morning crying about the situation in which they find themselves, yet we come in here this evening and all we can get from the Minister is a statement that the relevant health board may in some cases be in a position to aid some of the flood victims.  I have to say in the strongest terms that that is not good enough. We must have a much more positive response from the Minister and the Government.</P>
    <P>I have written to the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Environment. The Minister for the Environment has passed the letter on to the Minister present.  Deputy Higgins, because he says he has no responsibility in this area.  The Minister for Finance writes a full page, again telling me that he has no responsibility.  I emphasise that a Fianna Fáil Minister in that position <Col N="324" /> would write the same letter.  I appeal to the Minister tonight, as a west of Ireland man like myself, to take the bull by the horns, forget about the civil servants and respond to the crisis in south Galway and in other parts of the country.  The only response there can be is to designate the south Galway a disaster area and to put in place this week a fund of £1 million.  I do not care how it is distributed.  The Minister can get the Red Cross or whoever he likes to distribute it; he must give some hope to householders, farmers and business people.</P>
    <P>The last thing I want to see is people protesting at the gates of Leinster House but I am afraid that when the contents of the Minister's speech this evening are made known people will take to the streets.  Once again we, as politicians, will be labelled as people who talk but who do nothing about the problem.  Much of the discussion this morning was about politicians.  We have all been there; I am no different from anyone else and I take it on the chin. We have examined the problem again and again.</P>
    <P>Last year, between April and the end of the year, I led three deputations to the Office of Public Works and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry to try to get compensation and limited action for farmers in the Tarmon area of Gort whose lands were under water from January to July and August. I might as well have been leading those deputations to the House of Commons for all the attention we got.  The civil servants gave us every possible reason that those problems cannot be solved.</P>
    <P>I got a commitment from the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, that he would provide the money to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry but the officials from that Department did not even bother to apply for it.  Their excuse was that if it was given to the Tarmon area of Gort there would be a precedent for people all over the country to look for it.  There is no such precedent because no other area has had land under water for over <Col N="325" /> six months of the year.  We asked for £100,000 for remedial work on some swallow holes to improve their efficiency but this was refused by officials all over the place.  The reason given for this refusal was the same as that given by the Minister, whose speech included technicalities, regulations and so on.</P>
    <P>I am terribly disappointed with this speech.  I say to the Minister with all sincerity that if he is going to depend on the mechanisms he is now undertaking &mdash; preparing legislation, going to all the Government Departments and dotting all the &ldquo;i's&rdquo; and dotting all the &ldquo;t's&rdquo;&mdash; he will never solve the problem.</P>
    <P>This should be contrasted with what is happening on the ground, which I fully support, where two Fine Gael activists went to the local bank, opened a bank account and, under Deputy McCormack's initiation, started a little drainage scheme.  It is working and the water is flowing.  They have spent thousands of pounds on a scheme which was estimated by the Office of Public Works six months ago to cost £2 million.  There is not much doubt that they will be able to operate a scheme which will not be a drainage one but will take off the top level of the water.  They will probably do this for between £50,000 and £100,000.</P>
    <P>This is what the Fine Gael organisation is doing on the ground and I praise it for this, but I cannot understand why its Minister goes the opposite way.  He is tying himself up in red tape.  I blame the civil servants and I blame the Minister for being said and led by them.  If we are going to operate drainage schemes as we have in the past, we will never see the problems that exist in south Galway being solved.  I made an appeal to the Minister a fortnight ago but it obviously fell on deaf ears.  There is only one way to solve this problem and that is to introduce legislation.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that the Minister would take on board Senator Daly's Bill and introduce amendments to it if they were needed, which we accept is the case.  He said the Bill was unnecessary and was not good, but there is very little in it <Col N="326" /> which he stated to be so.  He referred to section 8 (2) and said that the whole drainage district would cease to exist if this section was passed.  However, section 15 (2) states that &ldquo;the Commissioners shall have regard to the impact on the entire catchment of any works undertaken in the local area&rdquo;. There may be technicalities which may have to be changed.</P>
    <P>I beg the Minister to accept this Bill and let us move to the next stage.  The people in the Civil Service should move as quickly as necessary to make the changes and obtain the agreements which are necessary so that we can proceed to the next stage, which is that the expertise of the Office of Public Works, the engineers in Galway County Council and the Department of Agriculture would be put at the disposal of the local community, which should carry out the drainage works.  We know from experience that a local co-operative effort will do a job about five times cheaper than the State because of the inevitable difficulties and responsibilities it has and which the local community does not have.  The IFA in south Galway has offered to undertake simple drainage or cleaning works that will not have any negative effect on the ecological balance of the area, which is one of the most significant in the country.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that we do not want to hinder areas of scientific interest, such as Coole lake, which is the main cause of the flooding in south Galway.  We simply want to allow the water to go in the natural way it has always gone and to reduce the level of water which has come into Coole lake in the last few months.</P>
    <P>We must accept that this year has been most abnormal.  In the last week of December and in January we had 11 inches of rain in south Galway.  This corresponds to the annual normal rainfall for the area.  The water is four to five feet higher than it was in 1990, when the area had the worst rainfall on record. We have a unique situation this year and it calls for much faster and drastic action.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="327" /> A number of businesses in the area have been affected.  A saw mill has been closed since Christmas and five people are sitting at home and are on the dole. Last year that mill did not reopen until June, when there was not anything like the level of flooding we have this year. That business has had no response whatsoever to its difficulties.  I appeal to the Minister to respond in some way and give hope to the proprietor of that business, which makes hurleys, roof timber and other things, because very soon he will not be able to continue because of the pressure on himself and his employees, who are at home.</P>
    <P>A quarry in south Galway, which supplies all the road making material for Galway County Council, has been closed since Christmas.  As a result the county council has to draw gravel from 20 miles away to undertake road raising works to open up some of the roads which have been closed.  A number of shops have been flooded repeatedly and have had difficulty in obtaining compensation.</P>
    <P>We have a real problem in south Galway. I am very disappointed to have to tell people what I heard tonight.  It is absolutely essential that the Minister has a change of heart with regard to what he read from his 27 page speech.  I appeal to the Minister to accept this Bill.  We have tried to be responsible and to take an all party approach to the issue.  We certainly do not blame the Minister or his party because we were not any different.  For goodness sake could all of us together as a first step accept this Bill and make the changes which are needed to be made to it?  As a second step, the Supplementary Estimate, which the Minister said had been agreed in principle but for which he has no money, should now be agreed by the Government.  South Galway, being designated a disaster area, should be given a £1 million to give some compensation to those genuinely at a loss.</P>
    <P>The lady at the back of the Public Gallery has a small equestrian centre. This centre and her house are under <Col N="328" /> water.  A sand workout area for horses, which is worth £15,000, has been blown away.  It is no use telling that lady that in six months we may be able to do something for her through the Red Cross.  She needs to be told now.  I asked her to come here tonight because she is indicative of so many other people for whom Civil Service jargon is no use at this point.</P>
    <P>I beg the Minister to respond now to the problems these people have by providing £1 million for south Galway and starting the hydrological survey and other investigations which need to be done on the ground to establish the water patterns as they recede over the next couple of weeks.  Up to today the levels have been rising and unless they are monitored carefully over the next couple of weeks as they go down, the necessary investigation will not be done properly.  We have had the surveys done.  Donal Daly of the Geological Survey Office of Ireland conducted a comprehensive survey and another was done last year by an excellent engineer in the Office of Public Works.  Last year's survey drew two conclusions.  The first was that superficial cleaning of the swallow holes would improve their efficiency, which undoubtedly is true. The second was that a channel from Coole to Kinvarra would take down the worst levels of the flooding.  I appeal to the Minister to take those actions.  As a fellow west of Ireland man I appeal to him to ignore the red tape and start the action now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State back to the House.  I compliment Deputy McCormack for the initiative he has taken in south Galway.  Maybe we need more Fine Gael TDs in the south Galway area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Flooding has always been an issue in Ireland, particularly along the west coast where it has constituted a serious problem.  There are very few winters when flooding does not occur and it has been particularly acute this year.  The extensive flooding results from the extremely high rainfall and has caused <Col N="329" /> serious hardship over a wide area of the country.  I have seen much of the damage in my own county.  The consequences for the people who have suffered are horrendous.</P>
    <P>Heavy rain is part of the Irish way of life and it has caused irreparable damage to the roads and land as well as flooding rivers.  The biggest problem arising from this is that of household insurance claims.  It is vitally important that corrective action is taken by the authorities and the Government since people will not be able to insure their household goods because of the high cost of insurance premiums.  The Minister has assured us that the Government is very concerned at the range of problems experienced by people living in the affected areas and by the flooding of recent weeks.  Everyone will have seen the pictures in the newspapers and, more graphically, on the television of areas covered in water and houses and business premises flooded, in some cases to considerable depths.  Roads which are impassable are causing tremendous inconvenience and sizeable areas of agricultural land are inundated. The flooding in south Galway is unique because of the geological structure, the lack of an outlet to the sea for the water and, in particular, because it takes such a long time for the flood waters to recede.  Farmers in the area say it will be April before the present waters recede.</P>
    <P>I point out again that flooding is not new to this country.  The last Fianna Fáil dominated coalition Government did nothing to alleviate the flooding that occurred in 1990, 1991 and 1994.  It was hypocritical of the leader of the main Opposition party, Deputy Ahern, to visit south Galway recently because when he was Minister for Finance in the last Government he did nothing to alleviate any flooding problem in any part of the country.  I note that a former Minister for Energy commissioned a report in January 1992 on the flooding of south Galway.  Neither that Government nor the last Government did anything to alleviate the problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="330" /> We note from a recent television report that the weather we have at present is the wettest this century.  We further note that there is an increase of 200 per cent in the rainfall in the Shannon region and an increase of 117 per cent in the Waterford region.  There has been an increase of up to 250 per cent in other regions.  It is quite clear that flooding is not new to this country and that this year has been particularly hard.</P>
    <P>There is no quick solution to flooding here.  In my view we will not see flooding completely alleviated in our lifetime. I have to compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Higgins, and his predecessor, Deputy Hogan, on their quick response to the flooding problems in this country.  Deputy Higgins has stated that the Government has decided, in light of all the information that has been made available, that it is necessary at this stage to have a coherent, co-ordinated response to the problem now facing individuals and communities in the aftermath of the flooding.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has set about establishing an interdepartmental committee, which he will chair.  It will be the vehicle which will oversee the response and co-ordinate the input from the various Departments and agencies with responsibilities in this area.  Our thanks must go to the staff of the various local authorities, the Garda, the fire services, the Army, the Air Corps, the Civil Defence and, of course, to the friends and neighbours who lent invaluable assistance to those in trouble.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that there are two aspects to flooding which must be considered. They are compensation where appropriate and the implementation of measures to mitigate where possible the effects of flooding due to adverse weather conditions in the future.  The Minister has called on the European Commission to send officials to see at first hand the scale of flooding in this country.  He will be seeking European Union compensation for landowners and householders affected by the flooding and also assistance in finding a long term solution to the problem.  It is <Col N="331" /> important that the European Union officials visit the areas that are most affected to see the devastation for themselves.</P>
    <P>Slurry at farm level is of huge concern. Huge volumes of slurry are stored at farm level and the problem is aggravated by the heavy rainfall.  It cannot be disposed of and, if it overflows, it will affect many rivers and cause serious problems.  The serious problems caused by the volume of effluent and intensive agriculture must be recognised.  Unlike other areas where intensive farming is practised, no farmer, big or small, has the storage capacity to cope with the weather in Ireland.  Special concessions should be made available to Irish farmers for the storage and disposal of slurry.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that changing farming practices in this country have some effect on flooding in some areas.  We can see how some of the changes have taken place.  We have seen recently that the overgrazing of hills leads to water flowing down the hills faster, which clogs the streams and leads to the overflowing of rivers.  The greater use of fertilisers and slurry does not help the free drainage of the land.</P>
    <P>The use of heavier machinery, bigger tractors, bigger harvesters, bigger slurry tankers and bigger equipment generally adds to the compaction of the soil.  This creates a pan in the ground and does not allow the water to go its natural course and soak away through the soil into the cracks and crevices.  This causes its own problems because the water does not get away fast enough.  We are left with floods which lead to turloughs which further lead to lakes and bigger lakes. The result is that the rivers are unable to take the floods.  The heavy rainfall we have had for the last three months, coupled with changing farming practices, has led to a disastrous situation with devastating consequences for the country and the people, particularly in rural areas.  There is no doubt that the farming sector is vulnerable and that <Col N="332" /> small livestock farmers have been hardest hit.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look at our county roads.  There is no doubt that the adverse weather over the past three or four months has caused serious damage to our national county roads network, which is breaking up.  Our national primary and secondary roads are funded by the European Union, but the county roads are underfunded.  I come, as the Minister does, from a county which has more miles of county roads than any other county.  We are not getting our fair share of county road funding and I appeal to the Minister to rectify this situation. Lack of funds from Governments over the past number of years and adverse weather conditions have led to the deterioration of our roads. The Government should consider greater use of FÁS schemes by local authorities.  These could be applied to works which are not being carried out at present by local authorities and which would not affect their fulltime staff.</P>
    <P>As regards the serious flooding which has taken place over the past number of months, there should be greater co-operation between local authorities and the Office of Public Works.  We must remember that local authorities know where the rivers, watercourses, water tables and swallow holes are and where flooding has taken place; in other words, they know the lie of the land.  While the Office of Public Works does great work throughout the country in building, restoration or drainage &mdash; and it must be commended for that &mdash; it must co-operate more closely with local authorities for the betterment of the rural people and the farming community in alleviating the disastrous situation in parts of the country.  Perhaps funds should be dispersed through the local authorities so that works might be carried out by them in conjunction with the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>I have already spoken to the Minister about the problem areas in County Mayo, with which he is familiar.  There is no need for me to mention the flooding in the Ballinrobe area or on McHale <Col N="333" /> Road in Castlebar, Manulla and Clogher.  The high level of rainfall has added to the serious problem on McHale Road and I hope the Minister will be able to do something about it. There are serious flooding problems in other areas of County Mayo which I am sure the Minister will consider.</P>
    <P>Senator Fahey said today and last week that he had been on three deputations about the flooding but that nothing had happened.  He also stated that land was submerged from January to July last year.  Senator Fahey recognises this is not a new problem and that nothing was ever done about the flooding even when his party was in Government. Rather than draining major arterial catchment areas, I welcome the approach to respond immediately to the flooding in the south Galway area and to whatever may happen in other areas throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works is the main agency which deals with flooding problems under current legislation.  I welcome the new flexibility promised by the Minister and his intention to amend the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  The last arterial drainage scheme was sanctioned by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy J. Bruton, in 1981 when he sanctioned works on the Boyle-Bonner drainage scheme.  It is 14 years since the last arterial drainage scheme was sanctioned. The Act has always been interpreted as conveying power to deal with drainage only on a complete catchment basis.  The Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, was introduced in response to the findings of the Browne Commission, which met between 1938 and 1940.  The Browne Commission discovered that drainage work previously undertaken on a piecemeal basis only shifted the problem from one area to another because of the failure to take account of the improvements throughout the river catchment areas.  It recommended that future schemes should be designed to take into account the effect of works throughout the entire river catchment.</P>
    <P>While I commend Senator Daly's initiative, it would be wise to wait for <Col N="334" /> the Minister to introduce his legislation to amend the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  He has given a commitment to initiate it in this House and I welcome that decision.  More Bills should be introduced in this House.  I congratulate the Minister for his commitment on this occasion.  I ask Senator Daly to withdraw his Bill to allow the Minister introduce his Bill.</P>
    <P>Once the Minister has received the relevant information from the various agencies throughout the country, he will be in the best position to decide what type of Bill will be introduced in this House.  The interdepartmental committee, which he will chair, will collect information from local authorities, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Commissioners of Public Works and in consultation with the Department of the Environment, urban councils and anyone who seeks to help to alleviate the enormous problems which lie ahead. The Minister appreciates the complexities of the problems we face.  The Minister and the Office of Public Works must also take into account the role which the central and regional fisheries boards and the local angling clubs play in our communities.  They must work closely with the Minister, the local authorities and the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the way he has reacted to the flooding problem. He immediately inspected the various areas which were flooded and, although he has only been in office a short time, he has visited Counties Mayo, Galway, Clare, Roscommon, Westmeath and Offaly.  It takes time to establish the full extent of the serious problems.  As a measure of the Government's commitment to and concern for the serious problem, it has allocated £2 million through the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry to assist those who lost fodder and stock.  I welcome this development.  I also welcome the Governments inclusion of £4 million in the budget for our county roads network, which is breaking up.  I would like more than £4 million.  Another indication of the Government's commitment <Col N="335" /> to the disaster is the supplementary welfare allowance, which is being dealt with by the health boards.  The Minister has taken swift action in this regard by setting up the interdepartmental committee.  As he said, the committee's first meeting will take place next week.  Senator Fahey can see that action has already been taken by the Minister in a short time.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works is cooperating with the Red Cross, which is the agency responsible for distributing EU funds in emergencies.  The Office of Public Works supports that application for assistance.  The Minister obtained agreement in the budget for Supplementary Estimates to be introduced. He has called on the EU to see the devastation at first hand.  He will make a submission to the EU for funding and has given a commitment to introduce in this House a Bill to amend the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, which must be welcomed.</P>
    <P>This Government is committed to going some way towards alleviating the problems in south Galway and other areas.  I ask Senator Daly to withdraw his Bill to allow the Minister to introduce his legislation.  It can be seen from his contribution that he is dealing with the problem.  The first meeting of the interdepartmental committee is next week, some funds are being provided for relief, he is looking to Europe for further funds; and he has agreement from the Minister for Finance to introduce a Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>It would be better to leave this with the Minister.  He has given a firm commitment to introduce his legislation in this House and he is to be congratulated for that.  The Minister sees the significance of what Senator Daly wants to do in putting this Bill before the House &mdash; and the Senator is to be complimented on that &mdash; but I ask him to leave this in the hands of the Minister.  He knows the urgency of the problem and I congratulate him on the swift action he has taken in a short period.</P>

      <P>I rise to support the Arterial Drainage Bill, 1995, brought to this House by Senator Daly.  I compliment him on his initiative because the public awaits a response from the Houses of the Oireachtas to the serious flooding crisis in many areas of the country.  The severity of the flooding is shown by the fact that Bord na Móna has recorded the highest flood levels ever at Shannonbridge, three-eighths of an inch higher than ever before.  Flooding brings many problems with it and a response is needed.  A response has been made by Fianna Fáil, in particular by Senator Daly, who proposed and put together this Bill.  It has two main provisions addressing the position in a practical way.  The Bill does not just deal with the present position; it clearly sets down how flooding could and would be addressed in the future.</P>
      <P>The first provision gives the Office of Public Works the opportunity to carry out relief drainage maintenance and other such works as would eliminate flash flooding, etc.  The second provision is the opportunity for compensation. Under those two headings most of the problems being experienced today as a result of the flooding could be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am somewhat taken aback that the Minister is not prepared to accept this Bill.  In fairness to him, he said he intends to bring in similar legislation.  I suggest to him that he should adopt this Bill.  If he, his Department or the other Departments he is consulting think that certain provisions of the legislation are not the best ways of dealing with flooding, he should bring forward amendments. His draftspersons or officials may find a number of areas are not covered or that areas are included which he would wish to exclude, although I cannot see why exclusions would be made.  He should amend this Bill rather <Col N="337" /> than have it voted down and prevent this opportunity to have the flooding problem dealt with practically.</P>
    <P>Flooding is not confined to specific areas on this occasion, nor has it been at other times.  However, a number of aspects of the current position should be outlined.  People who have long experience of flooding have been taken aback by the level of flooding in upland areas this year.  It appears to them such flooding is higher than ever before.</P>
    <P>We have not measured flood levels in upland areas to any great extent; we have always concentrated on the Shannon, the Suck, the Mulcair and such areas.  Members may not know vast tracts of uplands are underwater.  In County Roscommon people with fine upland holdings have more than two-thirds and in some cases seven-eighths of their farms under water.  One person with a 40 acre holding has 37 acres under water; another with 54 acres has 47 under water; another with 72 acres has 60 acres under water.  Those cases are in Roscommon and can be checked.</P>
    <P>I am perturbed by the Minister's contribution because it appears there will be no relief for those people.  He said the Shannon cannot be drained and other means will have to be employed. I do not accept that; it runs counter to everything I and Senator Naughten, from south Roscommon, said here recently.  The Office of Public Works allows a situation where 50,000 acres of bog are drained into a river on which we do not use so much as a shovel, never mind a machine, to carry out maintenance.  It makes no sense to drain so much bog &mdash; and I am not even mentioning land drainage projects &mdash; into the Shannon and Suck while there is no maintenance of either river.  As I said during the debate on flooding, it is vitally important that maintenance is carried out on the Shannon and Suck to remove silt that has built up over the years and is blocking the rivers' flow.</P>
    <P>The Minister has pointed out that in the 27 miles of river between Athlone and Meelick the channel is narrow and is incapable of taking the flow during <Col N="338" /> floods.  Certainly, there are problems with the channel but those problems are being aggravated each year because of what is flowing into the Shannon from the main Bord na Móna works on the Leinster and Connacht sides.  That is clearly visible to anybody whether the person is a technical staff member or a lay person.</P>
    <P>The Minister must respond to this situation and the only way he can do so is through amending the Arterial Drainage Act.  He cannot do so under that Act in its present form because he cannot put a machine on the River Shannon unless he decides to drain the whole catchment area.  Under the legislation proposed by Senator Daly that provision would be excluded thus providing the Office of Public Works with the opportunity to install a machine at Meelick and clean the river from there to Athlone.  It could also clean the River Suck from Shannon harbour to Ballinasloe thereby removing the silt and allowing the water to flow in both rivers. That would prevent the massive flooding we have seen along the bank of the Shannon from the Clonown area to Ballyforan, Athleague, Ballygar and surrounding areas on the Suck.  Anybody who travels from this city to County Galway or who takes the Tuam road from Athlone will know exactly what I am talking about</P>
    <P>The Bill introduced by Senator Daly also deals with an important aspect of the livelihood of the people in those areas.  The Minister acknowledges that the flooding problem &mdash; apart from the drainage issue &mdash; must be tackled.  He has provided money for loss of livestock and fodder.  However, livestock farmers in that area have lost their grasslands and in some cases they might have lost next year's meadows.  They have certainly lost their horticultural land.  There is a major horticultural area in the basin of the Shannon and Suck.  People have made a livelihood from horticulture and have brought their produce to the Dublin market for years.  They require compensation for flood damage.  The Minister <Col N="339" /> appears to address that problem to some extent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take three more minutes.</P>
      <P>Those farmers require compensation and Senator Daly's Bill provides for that.  I am not as familiar with other areas, such as south Galway, Clare or Carlow, but I can speak with some authority about the area of County Roscommon between the Shannon and the Suck.  The Minister should accept this Bill.  If he objects to some parts of it or wishes to amend it I am sure an accommodation can be reached.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that he will introduce legislation.  I am worried that he must go through an extensive consultation process with many Departments and that in itself might frustrate his efforts.  I do not doubt that he wishes to address this matter but I fear that he will be frustrated.  When one involves five or six Departments there will be problems.  It will be a long drawn out process and by the time a final draft is reached we will have had more floods.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he does not think it appropriate that the Office of Public Works should assess compensation after flooding; he does not think the Department would have the expertise &mdash; I am not sure of his exact words &mdash; and he does not expect it to be involved in that area.  The Office of Public Works would have special expertise in this area.  The Office of Public Works already deals with compensation when it carries out drainage work.  Who would be better to deal with compensation?  It is one of the few groups with such expertise and could deal with the matter objectively because it has precedents dating back to 1945 on which to base its evaluations of compensation for flooding.  That should not be an objection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to reconsider his position.  This is a good Bill.  It addresses <Col N="340" /> the present problem of flooding and gives the Office of Public Works the opportunity to relieve flooding and pay compensation.  They are the main proposals in the Bill and if they are in force we will be able to respond to future flooding.  Otherwise, we are simply talking about the problem.</P>

I thank the Leader of the House, Senator Manning, for the spirit in which he accepted the <Col N="341" /> Bill but I hope the co-operation does not end with these niceties and formalities. We are all experienced enough to know that this can be seen as just an exercise.  The average member of the public, listening and recording, knows it has to be more than an exercise.  There has to be a positive response to this Bill. There is no point in saying that another party was in power in a certain year and it did not act.  We are talking about the present time and we are talking to a Government that has the responsibility for the serious problem that now exists. We must get the parameters straight now.</P>

    <Title>A New Framework for Agreement: Statements (Resumed).</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the opportunity to say a few words on the Framework Document which is of paramount importance.  It is the most important item on the political agenda, North and South.  I do not share the gloom expressed by many sectors, especially in the North of Ireland, and I live very close to the North.  I am a member of a cross-Border group that has been in existence for 18 years and I know where we can co-operate.  I have a document, drafted before the Framework Document, entitled: &ldquo;North-West Region Cross-Border Group &mdash; Shaping the Future Together&rdquo;.  As I said, that group is 18 years in existence so the outcry over North-South institutions has a very hollow sound to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Eighteen years ago, three local authorities on the northern side and one on the southern side, in County Donegal, came together and formed a cross-Border group.  There were a lot of difficulties and a lot of mistrust.  We wanted to have a balanced approach.  We had six members from Donegal County Council, two from Derry City Council, two from Limavady Rural District Council and two from Strabane District Council &mdash; six members from each side of the <Col N="342" /> Border, representing 280,000 people in an area that had been severely affected by the Border trouble and had been almost brought to a standstill when small businesses, from the petrol station to the shirt factory &mdash; were almost completely wiped off the map.  In that environment, the four local authorities felt an obligation to get together and work together.</P>
    <P>We could not get any Unionist to join our cross-Border group.  Nevertheless, we went ahead and eventually we were approached by the three local authorities on the northern side to see if we would mind if they increased their numbers by one for every local authority. Donegal County Council's representatives agreed to three members from each of the local authorities on the northern side to accommodate an internal political arrangement within those local authorities.  Soon after this, we were approached again to allow the three local authorities on the northern side to increase their numbers by one. Donegal local authority agreed, thereby giving four members from Derry, four from Limavady, four from Strabane and six from Donegal &mdash; 12 against six.  We had no difficulty in agreeing to that. That request from the three local authorities on the northern side was to accommodate the Democratic Unionist Party and the Ulster Unionist Party.  We now have a cross-Border organisation which is working perfectly and is recognised and participated in by people of all shades of political and religious opinion.</P>
    <P>We have a document, fittingly called: &ldquo;Shaping the Future Together&rdquo;.  We have had many meetings and we have established a trust &mdash; total trust &mdash; because we recognise that the problems on the northern side are no different from the problems on the southern side.</P>
    <P>When I read in the Framework Document the provision for setting up institutions &mdash; and I hear an outcry against those institutions &mdash; I ask myself if this is kite-flying, brinkmanship or political manoeuvring.  I do not accept that the Unionists will not ultimately join in the <Col N="343" /> Framework Document discussions.  I believe that the hard line Unionist is a very clever politician and an astute operator and, however it might appear at the moment, I have several indications to confirm my beliefs.  Yesterday, the European Commissioner for Regional Policy was in the North of Ireland to announce funding for the Border region; he was invited to Belfast, even though the funding is for the Border region.  The three MEPs who were part of the delegation that met the Commissioner were Mr. John Hume, Dr. Ian Paisley and Mr. Jim Nicholson.  Nobody from the Border region was there. However, I look at all the barometers that are there.  Those three MEPs had no difficulty whatsoever in coming together where it was fundamentally important for them to recognise each other and being part of the process of meeting the Commissioner to announce funding for the cross-Border area. Unfortunately, we have a small problem and it is one we can put right, and that is that nobody south of the Border has yet met the Commissioner who announced that funding for the cross-Border region.  Nevertheless, I believe that matter will be resolved.</P>
    <P>President Robinson said yesterday that there were genuine fears held by the Unionists in the North.  I am sorry but, with respect, I have to disagree.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your guidance on the matter, a Chathaoirligh. <Col N="344" /> There are no genuine fears among the Unionists at present.  There may be political movement and brinkmanship, but there are no genuine fears because there is nothing in the document about which any reasonable person could be afraid.</P>
      <P>I received an invitation, dated 23 February 1995, from the chairman of Strabane District Council, who is a Unionist representative, inviting me to participate in a conference which is being organised in the North of Ireland.  In his letter he states:</P>
      <P>We see your role in a cross border context as being essential and central to the development of our mutual interest.  With that in mind, I am writing to cordially invite you to chair one of our key sessions at the conference.</P>
      <P>I have been identified with a political party for long enough and if a Unionist chairman in the North of Ireland sees fit to invite me to chair a conference then there is not a major problem.</P>
      <P>The Unionists are clever and astute enough to make the best out of the Framework Document.  They would be right to do so, because Britain owes the people of Ireland, and especially the people of the North of Ireland and the Border counties, a lot.  Britain is largely responsible for creating the situation and has now recognised that the best way forward is to encourage all of those involved in the political process.  North and South, to come together and solve the problem on the island of Ireland. Any reasonable person would understand that there is no future in Europe for two sections of a small island who engage in fighting and killing each other.  It will take years and millions of pounds to rectify the deprivation which has been caused in the Border region and to put the island, especially the North of Ireland and the area south of the Border, into a position to compete in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently I attended the launch of a boat in Killybegs costing £32 million. The boat was build outside the country, in Norway.  The owner of the boat had another boat which was taken to the <Col N="345" /> shipyard in Belfast to be repaired. However, some misguided hard line Unionist maliciously damaged the boat and it had to be towed out of the shipyard to a Norwegian port.  The owner then sold the damaged boat and bought a new one for £32 million.  It was tragic that it was not recognised that the shipyard in Belfast, which is under severe economic constrains and finding it difficult to maintain employment, could be building boats for the fishing industry in this country.</P>
    <P>How short sighted can people be and for how long, given that customers for fishing boats are forced to go outside our own island to have them built elsewhere? Issues such as this must be spoken about, and loudly enough to register with those who are so narrow minded and bogged down in the past. They must be told that their future is in total co-operation &mdash; economically, politically and every other way &mdash; on this island.</P>
    <P>There is a future, and hopefully we will encourage all those who are now opposed to debate to come together and negotiate, whether it takes a year or two years.  I have confidence that trust will be established and that the people in the North and the South, Unionists, Nationalists and those of every persuasion will ultimately reach an agreement. I am satisfied that this will happen in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>Like all in this House and the other House, I welcome the publication of the Framework Document.  It is good that we have unanimity on the document as it provides a solid foundation for progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember exactly where I was when the IRA ceasefire was announced.  I was many miles away from this House and the country; I was in Africa during the summer holidays working with the Rwandan refugees.  I was working in a part of Zaire where there were no communications whatsoever, but a rumour filtered around our camp that peace had broken out in Ireland.  We rejoiced, but we were so busy that our <Col N="346" /> rejoicing had a short life.  We went back to work, but we were very happy and, although we could not confirm it had happened, we immediately believed that the ceasefire was true.  When I came home a few weeks later I discovered this to be the case and I found that most people in Ireland had been quietly rejoicing over a period of a few weeks.</P>
    <P>The rejoicing was somewhat restrained, and when the Framework Document was published last week by the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister there was, once again, a great sense of relief.  Peace was still holding and we had a new document which brought with it new promise.  Although the reaction from the Unionist side was somewhat harsh, most people have made up their minds that this was to be expected.  It did not mean that the document was to be torn up and thrown away, but that it will at some stage in the future form the basis of talks.</P>
    <P>There is a certain restraint on the rejoicing of people at present because of their concerns.  Most people in the South of Ireland, especially those in the Border counties, understand some of the intricacies of what is happening in the North and most people see that the Unionists are genuinely afraid that what they have will be taken away from them. They are afraid that somebody will take over the house and throw them out into the yard.  By contrast, the Nationalists need a new status; and the frustration which they felt, and which eventually led to warfare in the North of Ireland, must be removed.</P>
    <P>The huge challenge facing everybody at this stage is how to bring the opposing forces together.  How does one reconcile a set of aspirations on the one side which is entirely different from a set of aspirations on the other side? There is not much we can do in the South except to try to set in train a chain of events which will lead to talks between all the parties involved in the North of Ireland and our own involvement at a later date.</P>
    <P>Over the centuries people in the North have developed very well defined <Col N="347" /> intellectual positions, as those us who live on the Border are very conscious. However, as Senator McGowan mentioned, we are also aware that there is a great desire among the ordinary people in Northern Ireland, on both sides of the divide, for economic progress through co-operation.  I want to see, for the people whom I represent, a system worked out in the North where that co-operation can flourish and where we can join hands and climb the mountain together.  No matter how steep the mountain is, if we join hands we can get to the top by pulling one another along.</P>
    <P>I firmly believe that dialogue will begin within a reasonable period of time.  With the Framework Documents and all the other documents produced by the Unionists and others on the table, there is at least a basis for discussion. I am convinced that once those discussions begin we will end up with some sort of an agreement whereby we can all live on the island in peace and harmony.  People see the alternative to that as entirely out of the question; nobody wants to return to the days of bombs and bullets.</P>
    <P>I have lived on the Border for the past 29 years and I know many families who have been bereaved by bombs and bullets.  I have seen the bullet marks on the walls of the square in Crossmaglen. That is a terrible intrusion into the lives of ordinary people which must never be allowed to happen again.  I believe that most people who are familiar with that do not want to return to it, which the opinion poll last weekend verified to some degree.  Therefore, I have huge confidence that talks will begin and that they will be fruitful.</P>
    <P>I am not that concerned about what agreement will emerge at the end of the day.  I will leave it to people at a different level to work out exactly what they want in that respect.  I want people who have been deprived for years to have the ability to co-operate and to build good, decent lives for themselves and their families.  I am almost certain that <Col N="348" /> we will have that within a short period of time.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Governments in London and Dublin have done a great amount in the past.  Seán Lemass took the first faltering steps when he visited Belfast.  That was a momentous event at the time and created ripples in the North which eventually led to the downfall of Terence O'Neill.  It was a huge risk to take which had its price.  We have come a long way since then.  Former Taoiseach, Liam Cosgrave, together with the members of his Government, managed to put together the agreement which brought about a power sharing executive in 1974, which was also a momentous event at the time. Of course, it did not last; but if it had not happened we would not have had the Framework Document today.  At a later date Garret FitzGerald jumped into the breach and in 1985 we had the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  It did not achieve everything it set out to and probably could not have done so. However, without it we probably would not have had the Framework Document either.  All of those steps were necessary to prepare people and to move them an inch at a time, which was, in effect, what happened.</P>
    <P>The Governments in London and Dublin have done a great amount, but I ask them to prove that they understand what has happened in the Border counties and in Northern Ireland since this State was founded.  If they do understand they will respond in a very positive way, which is very different from the way which they are indicating at this point in time.</P>
    <P>People should realise that the development of the Border counties has been held back at an incredible rate, not just since 1969 but since the State was founded.  The normal crossing of county boundaries was not possible in the Border counties.  I remember the time when one needed a bond for one's car in order to cross from the South into the North.  This was very tedious and prevented people from crossing.  That was before the Troubles, so there has <Col N="349" /> always been restricted movement of people in the Border counties.  Therefore, development was restricted, as anybody who knows the area can verify.</P>
    <P>When the Troubles broke out and bombs started exploding everywhere, people stopped travelling between the North and South.  Although the Border was opened when we joined the EEC in 1973, we did not have the movement of people which other counties had.  There was some exchange of ideas, local spending and tourism, but not the normal quantity.  Development in the Border counties is light years behind the development of the rest of this island and the rest of the United Kingdom. That is why I am asking the two Governments to show that they understand what has been happening in the North and how to move the process on.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough for the peace dividends to roll in from America, Europe and elsewhere; there must also be a movement within Ireland to make a huge investment in the areas which matter.  The people on the ground must see the results of what has happened.  As our development is so far behind, in order to bring us up to date we will have to have a large injection of funds.  Local authorities, in particular, cannot find matching funds.  If we are offered grants we cannot take them up.  I ask the Governments to look at that and to provide matching funds for local authorities so that we can see a change on the ground within a very short period of time.  It is the Government's duty to do this.  It is not enough to be part of talks and to be in a position to support development without supporting it in the most practical way, which is with money.</P>
    <P>Many business people, whose markets were reduced because of the Border and the lack of co-operation between the North and South, are also in difficulties. The normal grant aid which applies to the rest of Ireland is not suited to the Border areas.  I ask the Government to show that it understands what is happening and to put together a new type of package to regenerate the Border <Col N="350" /> counties.  When I see that, I will say that they understand.  I will continue to harp on that issue until the Government acts upon it.</P>
    <P>For example, we will get some Structural Funds under the operational programme for tourism.  Because of how it is structured, hotels with 20 or 30 bedrooms can apply for grant aid &mdash; they have already done so because the final application date was yesterday &mdash; but smaller hotels cannot apply because they are outside its terms.  As there has been no tourism whatsoever in the Border counties in the last 70 years, how can we develop tourism?  We will not be able to do so unless we receive a set of operational programmes which reflect reality on the ground.  I ask the Members of the House to understand my points and support me.</P>

      <P>I welcome Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, to the House.  It is the first time I have had the opportunity to contribute in his presence.  He is a former Seanad colleague and I am happy he is here.</P>
      <P>I congratulate both Governments for publishing the Framework Document, which hopefully will be studied carefully and at length by our political parties. There is now an historic opportunity to take the gun out of Irish politics forever and to achieve a new and farreaching political accommodation in Ireland in a transformed atmosphere.  The aim of both Governments is an agreed Ireland. where the principle of self-determination is balanced by the requirement of consent.  There is now a clearer realisation than ever before of the futility of attempting to resolve the differences between our two communities by force or by coercing one community into a mould set by the other, whether in Northern Ireland or Ireland as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Framework Document is essentially the same as that negotiated by the <Col N="351" /> previous Government, except with no specifics on proposed constitutional changes.  I wish to pay a special tribute to former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds and the courageous, risk-taking role he played in his energetic pursuit of peace.  He was ably supported by the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, and it is a matter of regret for so many Irish people that others drove a wedge of suspicion and jealousy between them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Reynolds was trusted by all sides, a unique achievement.  He had many social and business contacts in the North which were invaluable in establishing contacts on both sides of the political divide.  He established a rapport with John Major and got him on side. This was another unique achievement, particularly at a time when the British Prime Minister was in some difficulty at Westminster and needed the support of the Unionist MPs.  On these two prongs, he worked with patience, perseverance and tenacity to establish the realisation that peace in our time was possible.  The talks process, which should be inclusive, should start straightaway.  Nobody loses by talking; everybody gains from peace.</P>

      <P>I also welcome the Minister to the House.  I am always pleased to see someone from my home area in authority.  It makes me feel good when I realise that Waterford people are not so bad after all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to express my views on the Framework Document.  It has been very well received and is one of the major documents of our time.  I wish to acknowledge the work of the previous Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds. Without his tenacity and approach to peace, the end of violence may not have happened.  I also acknowledge the roles of the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, John Hume and Gerry Adams.  It has been a long process but it all came together in the last year through the work of these people and people across the water, including the Prime Minister, Mr. John Major.  It is great that we are here <Col N="352" /> tonight discussing this historic document.</P>
    <P>The Framework Document is a set of proposals on ways to reflect the two traditions in the North of Ireland and on how best to reconcile the diversity which has existed for the past 25 years. I have no doubt, from talking to people from the North and to my colleagues, that there has been a great change in the last six months.  We hear of people going to the North and talking about how wonderful it is to go shopping there again.  This is a prize example of how far we have moved in the last six months, but what do we do now?</P>
    <P>As has been stated many times, we must have dialogue.  We must sit around the table and talk.  This process began with the forum, which started last October.  When we first went into the forum, we were all daunted by the number of groups from the North.  We were also apprehensive because we did not know these people.  We wondered how we should react and how we should put our presentation together.  After a couple of meetings with the Sinn Féin and the Alliance Party delegations, I found that I was totally in harmony with them.</P>
    <P>I was able to discuss matters with them and understand how they felt.  The forum is a prize example of how we can get together around the table and try to resolve the differences which have existed over time.</P>
    <P>How can this document be implemented?  Institutions will be established which will have common interest and advantage.  They will be of mutual benefit to all concerned.  The areas of common interest include agriculture and fisheries, trade and tourism and education.  This will have huge potential for co-operation between North and South.  We should try to get people to understand how communities and institutions in small work areas.  As I have stated many times, small is beautiful. Things can be done in a small way in each community, through the schools and our language.  The area which provides most hope is music which has the power to bring everybody together.  The <Col N="353" /> question of how symbols should be treated in the future also arises.  These matters will be considered when we examine how best we can integrate without losing our own identity.</P>
    <P>We must respect and have a feel for the other point of view.  This poses the biggest fear for Unionists and I hope we can finds ways which would enable them to come to the table.  One member of the Unionist party, Mr. Roy Garland, visited the forum.  He came in a personal capacity to explain his feelings.  We hope he will be the first chink in their armour and that others will follow.  The Unionist leaders have become so entrenched that we must find ways to get them to the table.  I believe this is the way forward.  We cannot go back to the gun.  If the Unionists do not come to the table, the problem will remain.  This is a very sensitive area.  The Framework Document is the way forward.  We must also have an intergovernmental approach, where the two Governments will sit down and oversee areas where dilemmas may arise in terms of reflecting the ethos of the other party. As a member of the forum, I am very pleased to be in a position to contribute to the process of peace and reconciliation. The concept of coming together is in itself very small step but if it is done in a way that people can understand, they will relate to it.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of putting various cross-Border projects into operation. When money comes from Europe people do not understand how it should be spent or how programmes can help to bridge the gap between Unionist and Nationalist. We have to start with community orientation.  That came through strongly from the various submissions presented to the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation. They felt the approach should be from the ground up.  It was clear these people want peace and to have their differences acknowledged.  Nobody wants to destroy another's identity.</P>
    <P>All we want is consensus, trust and an air of confidence to build up that trust. The full implications of this document <Col N="354" /> and the approach the intergovernmental conference will take are matters for the future.  All we can do is take one step at a time.  The Unionists should not fear that they will be dragged into a united Ireland in the near future.  We are talking about peace and reconciliation and cross-Border co-operation.  There are many areas at which we should look but taking matters one step at a time, which is what we are doing, is the only way we will get a permanent peace.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on the Framework Document.  I compliment the politicians and civil servants who have been involved in this process over the last number of years and have brought it to this historic stage.  It would be remiss of me not to mention to role played by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds. While many people thought the Hume-Adams negotiations would not lead to any substantive issues being dealt with he, as Taoiseach, always felt that further progress could be made, and that is what happened.  I also thank the Tánaiste, who has been there through all these negotiations and has played an important and pivotal role.  I also thank the present Taoiseach, who has played a very important role in bringing forward the publication of the Framework Document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach, Deputy Bruton, with the British Prime Minister, Mr. John Major, published the Framework Document last Wednesday, 22 February.  The document has been two years in the making and marks the next succeeding step in a gradual attempt at a resolution of the problems in Northern Ireland. Much has already been written and said about the document, with the benefit of selective leaks prior to the full publication. Now that it has been fully published. the document's full meaning and <Col N="355" /> input can be understood and appreciated.</P>
    <P>The document commences with the headnote &ldquo;A shared understanding between the British and Irish Governments to assist discussion and negotiation involving the Northern Ireland parties&rdquo;.  These words speak for themselves; discussion and negotiation are to be encouraged.  Paragraph 1 opens with the statement of a goal; &ldquo;to remove causes of conflict, to overcome the legacy of history and to heal the divisions which have resulted.&rdquo;  It may be stated that the roots of the problem in Northern Ireland are obvious and well documented. Nonetheless, they must be identified and restated with a view to tacking them.</P>
    <P>The following paragraphs in the document express the mutual regrets of the respective Governments for the often tragic events of Anglo-Irish history.  The Joint Declaration is acknowledged and the cease-fires are welcomed as a vital ingredient in the search for agreement. The search for agreement is the common theme running through the document.</P>
    <P>The immensity of the task at hand is nowhere under-estimated.  The document acknowledges that there are strongly held positions on both sides, a fundamental absence of consensus about constitutional issues and deep divisions on both sides over their views on the present status of Northern Ireland and any future relationship with Ireland and Britain.  The ground rules in search of agreement between the Governments are agreed as the principle of self-determination, the principle of consent, the observance of exclusive democratic and peaceful means and mutual observance of respect for both traditions in the North.</P>
    <P>Under the heading &ldquo;Constitutional Issues&rdquo;, the document acknowledges that &ldquo;Given the absence of consensus and depth of divisions&rdquo; an agreed new approach on both sides is required. Clause 16 states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="356" /> ...the British Government recognise that it is for the people of Ireland alone, by agreement between the two parties respectively and without external impediment, to exercise their right of self-determination on the basis of consent, freely and concurrently given, North and South, to bring about a united Ireland, if that is their wish;</P>
    <P>The Irish Government accept that the &ldquo;agreement and consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland&rdquo; is a prerequisite to any solution.  The agreed new approach to looking at the deadlock in the North of Ireland is suggested through the implementation of interlocking and mutually exclusive institutions on three levels; structures within Northern Ireland, North-South institutions and East-West structures.  The structures in Northern Ireland will depend on the co-operation of elected representatives exercised in the spirit of cross-community co-operation.</P>
    <P>The North-South institutions are to cater for political, social and economic relationships between North and South. The provisions given under this heading of the document stress the practicality of North-South interaction on this small island.  The specific provisions as to how this interaction will occur are exploratory and suggestive given that the document is as yet but a framework for discussion. They do, however, give a new dimension to the <i>status quo</i> on Northern Ireland.  The underlying theme of this section of the document appears to be that there is much to be gained for all sides in the mutual recognition of political, social, economic, cultural and geographic co-operation between the North and South.</P>
    <P>The East-West structures are to be a forum involving both British and Irish Governments and Northern Ireland parties to pursue agreement and reconciliation in the North.  An intergovernmental conference will be set up to monitor the progress of the agreement in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Under a heading entitled &ldquo;Protection of Rights&rdquo; it is acknowledged that there <Col N="357" /> is a large body of support, transcending the political divide, for the comprehensive protection and guarantee of fundamental human rights.  The document advocates the political representatives in both jurisdictions in Ireland to adopt a charter to protect the rights of free political thought, freedom of religion, the right to pursue democratic politics and change, the right to live where one chooses and the right of equal opportunity and social and economic activity.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the document urges the search for agreement underpinned by peace.  A new political accommodation is the inestimable prize which will transform relationships in Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and between both regions.  The document acknowledges that the issue of sovereignty has been symbolic on one community dominating the other.  The purpose of the document is to provide an equitable and fair set of ground rules so that if any changes occur, both sides will be able to accept them without fear or prejudice. If the majority of the population of Northern Ireland choose to preserve the union, there will be provision for the Nationalist aspiration to be acknowledged in the framework proposals and if, in the future, the majority in the North choose to opt for a united Ireland, the Unionist aspiration will be similarly acknowledged.</P>
    <P>The Framework Document brings home the realisation that whatever the future holds for Northern Ireland in terms of its union to either Britain or Ireland, agreement before change is a better option than change before agreement.</P>
    <P>As a Border county representative, I think the atmosphere transcending the whole of the North of Ireland and the island of Ireland has seriously changed since the cease-fire.  All political leaders in the North and here must show great courage over the next number years to bring peace and political uniformity to Northern Ireland.  I have no doubt the will is there.  It will take time; but we, as politicians, should help and encourage all sides to come together to discuss the <Col N="358" /> Framework Document because the parameters laid down are helpful.  I look forward to a fitting end to the problems in Northern Ireland over the next number of years.</P>

      <P>I join with other Members in welcoming the Minister to the House and in congratulating those involved in the publication of the Framework Document.  It is an important and historic document which provides the opportunity for people to enter into discussions without any preconditions. It is the culmination of much political activity which resulted in a number of measures being put in place before a Framework Document could be produced.</P>
      <P>The Joint Declaration by the Irish and British Governments was important.  It would not have been possible without the knowledge and information both Premiers &mdash; the former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, and John Major &mdash; had that matters could be progressed further.  All those involved at that time and previously &mdash; some are unknown because they are not public figures &mdash; played an important role in initiating dialogue and discussions which brought about a situation where the two sovereign Governments could decide on a document laying down the initial framework for what has taken place over a period of 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The resolve and, indeed, the single-mindedness of the former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, during those 12 months must be admired and complimented. Many, including some in public life, for a long time doubted his ability to see this through, to see the guns silenced and our republican brethren brought to the negotiating table; but he persevered and achieved a result.  Looking at the other people involved in that process, it would seem that he had most to lose at that time in so far as he was the leader of Government here, although most of the violence occurred in the North.  It took great courage for Deputy Reynolds to put himself out on <Col N="359" /> a limb, but it paid handsomely when peace was eventually achieved.</P>
    <P>I compliment John Hume for his trojan work over the years in trying to achieve the situation which exists today. We must acknowledge that Gerry Adams, as President of Sinn Féin, moved the process forward.  He was able to convince those in his organisation, the Irish Republican Army and its leaders to lay down their weapons and support Sinn Féin's initiative.</P>
    <P>The final cog in the wheel was the UK Premier, Mr. John Major.  The special relationship which developed between John Major and Albert Reynolds over many years played no small part in this process.  There was an understanding between the two men on issues relating to Northern Ireland.  They moved the situation forward and we now have the Framework Document, which had been spoken about for many months.  In the autumn many people, including some republican leaders, said that perhaps the Framework Document could be left aside and that direct talks could be entered into, because they feared it might not be produced.  At that time the then Taoiseach resolved to publish the document.  He and his officials played an important part in the preparation of that document, although he was not there to see it completed.  I congratulate those who took that final step and published the Framework Document, including the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, who was involved in discussions from an early stage.</P>
    <P>Now that there is a Framework Document, people must sit around a table and discuss the issues which are important to them.  That is the most important issue before us today.  In our capacity as public representatives we must always try to be accommodating and ensure that what we say is helpful rather than divisive.  We must appreciate the fears on all sides.  We must be particularly conscious of the fears of the Unionist community, who over the years have in some ways backed themselves into a corner.  Unionist political <Col N="360" /> leaders are now finding it hard to move forward.</P>
    <P>Some have said &mdash; they may be right &mdash; that Unionist leaders are to some extent out of touch with the public, including perhaps those who elected them.  If that is the case it is time for them to review the situation.  We do not want to aggravate or polarise any of the communities in the North, particularly the Unionist community.  If there is to be a final settlement on the Irish question it must accommodate Unionists.</P>
    <P>There may be major benefits if the Unionists' fears can be addressed and a proper accommodation for Republicans, Nationalists and Unionists can be set down in a further and final response to this Framework Document.  This country can then go about its business, take its opportunity for development and expansion in economic terms with a united front and take its proper place in Europe.</P>
    <P>All the European structures are supportive of this opportunity for peace and stability and their long term gains for this island.  Our representatives at European level must always promote that concept, and the advancement of the peace process should be top of their agenda.  The USA, through the Clinton Administration, has played a major part.  It would appear that there is an organised approach to bring stability to the peace we treasure so much and which we have had for the last few months.</P>
    <P>We now have an opportunity to ensure that the hand we extend to our Unionist brethren is a genuine hand of friendship across the divide which has kept us apart for so many decades.  If we can explain that there is an opportunity for friendship and development we can go forward.  The opportunities that will be available, not only to this generation but to following generations, cannot be measured.  The North and the South working in co-operation can make this island a better place in which to live.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this historic document and I welcome that the negotiations have concluded in its publication. I compliment the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste for bringing this to a conclusion so shortly after the formation of the new Government.  We should also recognise the role played by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, and the courageous steps he took in relation to the process at a time when many in his own party and elsewhere felt that it was not possible to proceed so rapidly with the peace process.</P>
      <P>Mr. John Hume and Mr. Gerry Adams also played a pivotal role in Northern Ireland in bringing about the peace.  The paramilitaries on the loyalist side must also be complimented in responding to the IRA's laying down of arms, which eventually brought a cessation of violence in Northern Ireland.  It took a lot of courage, skill, discussion and negotiation by all concerned before the Framework Document could appear.  Those behind the scenes, in particular, the Irish and British Government officials who worked so tirelessly, must be respected for their great work.</P>
      <P>We now have the Framework Document, which, as the Taoiseach said, is a discussion document.  It has been presented and all parties are invited to partake in discussions.  Nobody should attempt to make political capital out of the document.  It is a matter of peace, of life and death, and we must recognise that after 25 years of terrible atrocities and loss of life everybody must be responsible in their approach and presentation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are at a stage when discussions will commence.  I say to the Unionist community in Northern Ireland that the Irish people are not anxious to have a united Ireland; their first priority is to have peace on the island.  We must recognise that peace is central.  We in the South must recognise that the Unionist community is fearful; it feels under siege and powerless and that it has been let down by the British Government.  Some of them would trust <Col N="362" /> the Irish Government quicker than they would trust the British Government. We must also realise that the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland was for generations deprived and discriminated against by the Unionists while they were in government in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Unionist community must recognise that there has not been a government in the North because they could not self-govern and the result was direct government from Britain.  While the Unionist community would have concerns in relation to the North-South bodies, it must recognise that when there was a Government in Northern Ireland the Nationalist community did not get fair play.  The interests of the Nationalist community need to be recognised; and, insofar as that must be done, the North-South body offers some protection to the Nationalist community. One could say that this is compensation for the Irish Government proposing to hold a referendum in relation Articles 2 and 3.</P>
    <P>The Unionist community is represented in the British Parliament.  They must recognise the fears that exist in the Nationalist community, as the Nationalist community must recognise the fears that exist in the Unionist community. There is a particular responsibility on the leaders of all the political parties. Like the parties in the South, a certain amount of political play takes place and one party is watchful of the other.  One party wants to see who will move first on any aspect of the framework discussions. I compliment Mr. Roy Garland, who presented the Unionist view to the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation. It was a courageous step for him to take and I hope he will be the first of many others to do so.</P>
    <P>There are four Unionist parties in the North with varying views and it is important that each of them reviews the situation and realises that there is a fine opportunity for them to bring peace to this island and with it economic development, co-operation and goodwill, if they appreciate the value of the document.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="363" /> There has been a lot of argument about the difference between a nation and a state.  I hope that Fianna Fáil in Opposition will not make a political football of Article 2 and the concepts of nation and state.  We all recognise that a nation is a people with a common culture, language, religion and background. We also recognise that a state is a piece of land which is politically divided.  We all know that nations transcend states and that states are capable of incorporating more than one nation.  The Framework Document clearly lays the ground for accommodating and recognising various people.  The fundamental matter for all parties concerned is respect &mdash; respect for each other and for the varying viewpoints that exist.</P>
    <P>I hope that, as time goes on, all members of the Unionist community will involve themselves in discussion and in at least commenting on the Framework Document.  It is pointless to say that discussion cannot go ahead at this stage &mdash; it must go ahead.  There is a document there for discussion and the political leaders of the two Governments must proceed.  They must continue to forge discussion and encourage communication between all parties within Northern Ireland, between Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland, between Southern Ireland and Britain and between Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note that within this document there is an important role for the Northern Ireland Assembly, the Irish Government and the North-South body to deal with the challenges and opportunities presented by the European Union.  It is important to recognise that we as an island can benefit jointly from the European Union and that we should work together for our mutual benefit and development.  In addition we have the establishment of the parliamentary forum, which is a very important proposal, and the continuation of the intergovernmental conference structures.  The establishment of these two bodies and the continuation <Col N="364" /> of the intergovernmental conference is extremely important.</P>
    <P>The communication between the two Governments and between the Northern Ireland Assembly, if and when it is established, and the southern Government will continue.  I believe communication, dialogue and constant consultation can keep peace in this country. We must recognise that it is a very delicate matter and that the people of Northern Ireland still have great fears and concerns.  We must appreciate the difficulties that the leadership of the Nationalist communities and the leaders of the paramilitaries on the Unionist side had in bringing about the peace. We must recognise and respect the fragility of that peace.  Everybody has a responsibility to ensure that peace continues and becomes not just a cessation of violence but a permanent peace process, that proper institutions are put in place and that everybody is respected and recognised for what he or she is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for taking the time to come in to the Seanad to listen to our contributions on this very important document.  I will try in a broad sense to put this Framework Document into some type of historical context.  I advance the thesis that the Framework Document, although it is very welcome and modem in one sense, is not saying anything new, because there can be found throughout hundreds of years of history reverberations or deliberations on the three relationships identified as the three strands in this document.  However, I will skip through centuries to the Government of Ireland Act of 1920.  The heading of the Act is:</P>
      <P>An Act to provide for the better Government of Ireland.</P>
      <P>Section 2 of the Act states, and this has what is by now an almost familiar ring to it:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With a view to the eventual establishment of a Parliament for the whole of Ireland and to bringing about harmonious action between the <Col N="365" /> Parliaments and Governments of Southern Ireland and Northern Ireland and to the promotion of mutual intercourse and uniformity in relation to matters affecting the whole of Ireland...</P>
    <P>It is obvious that as early as 1920 it was thought in the body politic and in the English House of Commons and House of Lords that new structures had to be evolved for the governance of Ireland. Obviously, the events of the last few years are startlingly important.  To trace the document's recent lineage, we can go back to the original declaration between the former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, and former Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher in 1981.  Then there was the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1986, the Downing Street Declaration of 1993, the ceasefires of 1994 and now this new Framework Document.</P>
    <P>It is perhaps a mistake to try to read the Framework Document in isolation from the Joint Declaration, but there is again a historical reverberation that I would like to allude to in trying to place the Framework Document in context.  In the Joint Declaration of 1993 the Prime Minister, on behalf of the British Government, declares that they have no selfish strategic or economic interest in Northern Ireland.  That was recognised at the time as a very firm and ringing declaration and it does not come as news to anybody here or in England that this was a change of attitude.</P>
    <P>I am reminded of a passage from this excellent book, the <i>Oxford Illustrated History of Ireland</i>, edited by R.F. Foster, where the editor is describing the start of the Norman invasion at the beginning of the thirteenth century.  He says</P>
    <P>...the truth is, the purpose of English involvement in Ireland was beginning to change from acquiring lordship over men to colonising land.  The end of the twelfth and the beginning of the thirteenth centuries saw the last decades of a medieval population explosion in Europe which caused not <Col N="366" /> only land hunger and migration but high food prices and low labour costs.</P>
    <P>There was very clearly from those times a selfish colonial strategic interest on the part of the English in Ireland.  The change in attitude from that position that has come about in the Downing Street Declaration is tumultuous.</P>
    <P>
      <i>A New Framework for Agreement</i> is by and large an excellent first step in examining ways in which people can cooperate on these two islands.  As I said at the beginning, it is perhaps the first time that people of responsibility have sat down in a mature and measured way and had a dialogue as to how best to manage co-operation.  The very basis of any human co-operation is dignity between people on a one to one basis. The type of co-operation envisaged in this document is co-operation at an institutional level in the three strands already mentioned.  An outright rejection by the Unionist population of not just this document but of any form of co-operation with the South would be a travesty and reveal the existence of a time warp.</P>
    <P>The ordinary people of Ireland, North and South, want co-operation and peace.  There are enough guarantees contained in the Downing Street Declaration and in the Framework Document in terms of the consent.</P>
    <P>The Framework Document follows a very fine line of Irish Parliamentary involvement.  Daniel O'Connell was a Member of Parliament.  There was also Parnell and de Valera.  We now have people who may or may not be of that stature but who have certainly risked a great deal.  People have spoken of risk in relation to the last Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Mr. John Major. There certainly was risk.  Before the ceasefire was declared last August, the then Taoiseach might have been politically up a gum tree if a ceasefire had not happened.  We have performed our bit and the boot is now on the other foot. It is time for Mr. Major to take the courage which he undoubtedly has and convince <Col N="367" /> the people of Northern Ireland that their best future lies in the lines of co-operation as envisaged in this new Framework Document.</P>
    <P>The only specific point I will make about the document is on the question of East-West structures.  Policing is kept within the confines of these structures.  I would say to the Government and the British Prime Minister that the issue of policing by consent in Northern Ireland is an absolutely vital matter.  This was the subject of a recent debate in the Law Society in UCD.  An excellent paper on the topic was delivered by Mr. John Kennedy, the auditor of the society.  This issue is critically important. If I were to be critical of any aspect of this document it is that there seems to be an overreliance on the policing aspect of Northern Ireland and the East-West structures.  The people of Northern Ireland themselves and perhaps of all of Ireland have to become very much involved in the policing of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>There has never been an intention on the part of any of the founding fathers of this State to coerce anybody into a united Ireland.  In the Dáil debates in 1937 Eamon de Valera stated that</P>
    <P>I think there is no doubt about it that the vast majority of the people in this island would claim that the nation and the State ought to be co-terminous.... We have the moral right, under those conditions, to claim authority over the whole State.</P>
    <P>He stated that it was only in this part that &ldquo;we have effective jurisdiction, but we have the moral right to claim authority over the lot&rdquo;.  There was no attempt at that stage in the formation of this State to say that there was going to be coercion of the majority population in Northern Ireland.  I stated at the beginning of my contribution that the Framework Document is a restating of what we always knew.  I do not recall people in the parliamentary tradition in Ireland ever saying that the majority of the people in Northern Ireland were <Col N="368" /> going to be coerced into a united Ireland but it is good to now have that stated absolutely.</P>
    <P>The European Union is mentioned frequently in the document.  European law is supreme over Irish law.  The Maastricht Treaty makes it very clear that we are not just citizens of a State which is a member of the EU but are citizens of Europe.  The Unionists should be reminded that they too are citizens of Europe.  Karl Marx spoke of the withering away of the State.  I believe that in our lifetimes we will see the withering away of the State as we know it and will be citizens not just of Europe but eventually the world.  Only when that happens will those artificial divisions between us finally come down.  I commend this document to the Seanad.</P>

      <P>At this point we should all be careful of what we say.  The issue is at a very delicate stage.  We have had 25 years of violence and loss of life.  The economies of both northern and southern Ireland have been affected by this and many jobs were lost.  Thanks be to God we have had peace in the last six months and we hope this will remain. I pay tribute to the former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, for the major role he played in bringing about that peace, along with Mr. John Hume, Mr. Gerry Adams, the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, and the British Prime Minister, Mr. John Major.  I wish the present Taoiseach and his Government every success in their negotiations in the weeks and months ahead in the national interest.  We are all pleased that the peace has lasted; and may it last forever so that generations to come will never see such trauma, violence, injury and lack of jobs, with families being torn apart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hope to see the day when there will be more co-operation between North and South to make this island a better place in which to live and in which our young people can earn a livelihood.  I wish the negotiations every success in the area of North-South institutions. Together, through cross Border <Col N="369" /> co-operation, we can achieve a great deal in Brussels in areas such as business and tourism.  There is a long hard road ahead.  I hope common sense will prevail on all sides in the negotiations because nobody wants to see a return to the sad situation we had for 25 years.</P>
    <P>We must all be careful of what we say while the Government is trying to bring people together around a table to set guidelines for the future on North-South institutions, policing of the North or whatever the subject may be.  It could be dangerous if any of us were too loose in our statements.</P>
    <P>It took a great deal of negotiation and courage to bring about the peace initiative. The former Taoiseach had great courage.  Many people thought peace would not come about; but he was convinced it would, stuck to his belief and brought it about.  We should all be very thankful to him and to the others I mentioned. We should cherish the peace and build on it.  If something goes wrong, the last stage will be worse than the first. Peace is a wonderful achievement.  I thank the former Taoiseach and the others I mentioned and I wish the Government every success in the national interest in the weeks and months ahead.  I hope that on this island we can all live in peace and create jobs for our young people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and wish him every success in his post. This issue concerns the town of Cahir, which is in great need of accommodation for its students.  We have put much work into the proposed development <Col N="370" /> of a community college there. Cahir has three second level schools &mdash; the Convent of Mercy, the vocational education school and St Joseph's College. The latter has been under lay management since July 1994 and administered by the vocational education committee.  New school accommodation has been urgently needed for many years as classrooms in the schools consist mostly of prefabricated buildings and rented accommodation.  The prefabricated buildings are in a sorry state. The accommodation in St. Joseph's was so bad they had to move out of it last summer and rent accommodation; it was a fire hazard.</P>
      <P>Some 12 years ago the vocational education committee was about to build a new vocational school and had the plans drawn up.  The Department of Education stepped in and said they might be able to solve three problems in one.  Following lengthy negotiations on rationalisation and amalgamation involving the vocational education committee, St. Joseph's, the Convent of Mercy and the Department of Education, it was agreed by all parties in 1988 that a community college would be provided in Cahir.  We all welcomed this.  It was agreed that the board of management of the college would comprise the representatives of the Sisters of Mercy and the vocational education committee as well as parents and teachers.</P>
      <P>Planning for the college commenced and a ten acre site on the Cashel Road, Cahir, was purchased by the vocational education committee in 1990.  The Department had agreed that the college should provide accommodation for over 800 students.  I thank the Minister and the officials in the building section of the Department of Education for their co-operation and help.  Very little time has been lost since the site was purchased and planning permission sought. I acknowledge the great co-operation between the Department, the vocational education committee and all concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The planning process is currently at stage five &mdash; the preparation of bills of <Col N="371" /> quantities.  It is expected that these will be ready in early to mid-March.  The bills have then to be examined by the Department and, when found satisfactory, approval is given for the invitation of tender.  I hope the Minister has good news for me tonight as this process should be completed by early summer.</P>
    <P>It is vital that funding be made available so that the construction of the college can commence in the summer of 1995 because of the condition of the prefabricated classrooms and the cost of rented accommodation.  As a member of the board of St. Joseph's College and a member of the vocational education committee, I appeal to the Minister to do everything possible to speed up the process.  It would be greatly appreciated by teachers, parents and everybody involved in the three schools.  I hope he will have good news for me this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen) Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for this opportunity to clarify the position concerning the proposed new community college for Cahir and the question of whether the project will be included in the 1995 building programme.</P>
      <P>Initially, I would like to give some details regarding the background to this case.  In the Cahir post-primary centre there are three second level schools: St. Joseph's secondary school, the Convent of Mercy and the vocational school.  Following prolonged discussions at local level, agreement was reached in January 1989 with the school authorities for the provision of a single post-primary school for this town.  It was decided that the amalgamated school would be a community college under the control of County Tipperary Vocational Education Committee South Riding and it would be constructed on a site which the vocational education committee purchased in 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was originally envisaged that the new school would cater for 665 permanent pupil places and that any additional short term needs would be <Col N="372" /> catered for in temporary accommodation. Planning of the new building proceeded on this basis and in February 1992 the outline sketch scheme was approved.  Subsequently a developed sketch scheme was approved and in November 1993 the vocational education committee was authorised to proceed with the detailed design for the project.  However, in February 1994, following a review of the needs of the area and recent information on the demographic trends, the projected enrolments were reviewed upwards and it was decided that the school would now have 800 permanent pupil places.  As a result, the schedule of accommodation had to be increased and the plans had to be revised to include the additional area required.</P>
    <P>The current position concerning the planning of the new school is that the revised detailed design incorporating the increased accommodation has been approved by my Department and the bill of quantities is now awaited from the vocational education committee. When these have been received and examined by the Department the next stage will be the invitation of tenders. However, as with all capital projects, the timing of the invitation of tenders and the placing of the contract are dependent on the availability of capital resources.  The question of when construction might commence is therefore a matter which will be considered in the context of the building programme for 1995 which has not yet been finalised.</P>
    <P>The programme is currently being considered in light of the capital funding available and having regard to other commitment and priorities that have to be met.  Accordingly I am not in a position at this stage to indicate precisely when tenders will be invited by the vocational education committee or when construction will start.  I would like, however, to assure the Senator that the Department is fully aware of the urgent need for this new school and it was because of this that last year the Minister for Education designated this project as a priority for architectural <Col N="373" /> planning.  As this is still proceeding I will ensure that every effort is made to complete it as soon as possible so that the new building can commence at the earliest opportunity.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Alien to the House.  I want to speak about the Gael campus for Gaelscoil Uí Dhoghair and the Gaelcholáiste in Caisleán Nua Thiar.</P>
      <P>Tá an-suim ag muiuntir Chaisleáin Nua Thiar sa Ghaeilge.  Tá coiste Chonradh na Gaeilge an-láidir sa bhaile.  Gach seachtain bíonn fógraí pobail sna nuachtáin áitiúla as Gaeilge.  Deirtear go bhfuil cultúr na Gaeilge, damhsa, siamsa agus ceol go han-bheo sa cheantar agus dá bhrí sin ní raibh aon athbheochan den teanga ann mar nach raibh aon bhás.</P>
      <P>Ní raibh iontas ar duine ar bith nuair a bunaíodh Gaelscoil Uí Dhoghair i 1985.  Ón am sin tá an scoil ag dul ó fheabhas go feabhas.  Anois tá ocht muinteoir agus 225 dalta sa scoil.  I 1993 bunaíodh an Gaelcholáiste i dteach cónaithe atá athraithe ina scoil ag an vocational education committee.  I mbliana tá 22 dalta ag freastal air.  Tá an Gaelscoil suite i lárionad pobail agus i bhfoirgnimh réamhthógtha i gclós an lárionaid.  Níl sé sin oiriúnach ar chor ar bith.</P>
      <P>The Gaelscoil, as I said, is situated in the local community centre and in the prefabs located around the school.  It is currently under threat of eviction because the prefabs have limited planning permission and the authority is desperately looking for an alternative site. There are currently 225 pupils and 24 pupils were refused admission last September because of a lack of space.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There can be no doubt that there is a great deal of interest in the Irish language in the area and the pupils come not only from the town but from a radius of 15 to 20 miles.  It has now reached a crisis stage and children are being denied basic facilities.  The same is true <Col N="374" /> of the Gaelcholáiste which is located in a converted house.  It has a projected pupil population of 41 next September.</P>
    <P>The idea is that a Gael campus could accommodate the Gaelscoil and the Gaelcholáiste, a naonra for the young children and perhaps some element of Outreach adult education.  The Department oftered the Gaelscoil £30,000 for a site.  There were not too many suitable sites available in the town at that price or, when a suitable site was found, other factors deemed it unsuitable.  For example, one site was suitable, but the asking price doubled once the seller heard that the Department of Education wanted to buy it.  This site is publicly owned by Shannon Development and it has easy access to other community facilities, such as a vocational school, a library and an open air swimming pool.  The Courtney boys school is also close by.  I urge the Minister to consider the concept of a combined Gaelscoil and Gaelcholáiste as a suitable development.  This Gaelscoil has been successfully twinned with schools in Chartres en Bretagne in France.  It is known there as l'école Gaelique and French is also taught in the school.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Kelly said since the language never died in Newcastlewest, a revival is not taking place.  Newcastlewest has <Col N="375" /> been to the forefront in the encouragement and development of all-Irish education. Gaelscoil Uí Dhoghair, the all-Irish primary school, opened in Newcastlewest in 1985.  With the first intake of pupils due to leave the Gaelscoil in 1993, the Department approved the provision of an all-Irish post-primary facility &mdash; a unit attached to the vocational school &mdash; with effect from September 1993.  As Senator Kelly said, there are now more than 200 pupils in the Gaelscoil &mdash; she mentioned 225 &mdash; and over 20 pupils in the post-primary unit in its second year of operation. Both the Gaelscoil and the unit are at present accommodated separately in rented premises which the Department does not consider to be satisfactory for use in the long term.  As regards to Gaelscoil Uí Dhoghair, therefore, the Department, with the school authorities has been trying to identify and secure a suitable site.  A number of sites were inspected but proved either unsuitable or unavailable.</P>
    <P>As regards the all-Irish post-primary unit, its operation runs for a six year period initially, during which time its long term viability will be assessed.  It had been anticipated that the planning of additional accommodation for the vocational school at Newcastlewest, which has been under discussion <Col N="376" /> between the Department and County Limerick vocational education committee, would take into account the needs of the all-Irish unit.  A proposal has now been submitted to the Department jointly by the Gaelscoil Uí Dhoghair authorities and County Limerick vocational education committee to the effect that the provision of all-Irish education in Newcastlewest, primary and post-primary, should be located on one site in new, permanent accommodation. A potential, suitable site for such a development has been identified locally.</P>
    <P>There is one such development already in operation in Clondalkin, County Dublin, where Gaelscoil Cluain Dolcáin and Coláiste Chillian share the same building and campus; the merits of such an arrangement are characterised by the continuity of educational provision and the maintenance of an all-Irish ethos.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently assessing the feasibility of the proposal for the future provision of all-Irish education in Newcastlewest.  Of necessity, the assessment involves consideration of the proposal by a number of sections within the Department.  I hope, however, that the Department will be in a position to respond shortly.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 9.45 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 2 March 1995.</P>
