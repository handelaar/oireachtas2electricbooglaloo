      <P>I have received notice from Senator Roche of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to immediately include the towns of Bray, Arklow and Greystones in the proposed pilot scheme for the renewal of traditional seaside resorts.</P>
      <P>I also received noticed notice from Senator Cosgrave of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to examine the growing delays in cases coming to court, with the resultant hardship to those seeking legal redress.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine to outline the up-to-date position regarding the proposed marina for Greystones, County Wicklow.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Taylor-Quinn of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to address the problem of homelessness in Ennis.  County Clare, by the provision of accommodation.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Kelly of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to give approval and financial support to the concept of a &ldquo;Gael&rdquo; campus which, combines a Gaelscoil and a Gaelcoláiste in Newcastlewest, County Limerick.</P>
      <P>I have received notice from Senator Byrne of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3" /> To ask the Minister for Education when construction of Cahir community college, County Tipperary, will commence and if it will be included under the 1995 capital programme.</P>
    <P>I have received notice from Senator McGennis of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for IDA Forfás to commission an independent survey regarding the implications of a 360 acre dump in Mulhuddart on the development of the adjoining industrial zoned lands.</P>
    <P>I have received notice from Senator Cregan of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The extremely large number of people on waiting lists for the provision of dental services by the Southern Health Board in Cork city and, in particular, the hardship caused to many old age pensioners who have been on waiting lists for many years for the provision of dentures.</P>
    <P>I have received notice from Senator O'Kennedy of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health to provide adequate funding for the driving assessment and tuition service being provided by the Irish Wheelchair Association and to ensure specific departmental responsibility for the service.</P>
    <P>I have received notice from Senator Cotter of the following matter:</P>

    <P>I have received notice from Senator O'Sullivan of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to address <Col N="4" /> the problem of wandering horses in urban areas.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Roche, Cosgrave, Ross, Kelly, Taylor-Quinn, Byrne, Cregan, O'Kennedy, Cotter and O'Sullivan as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senator Roche and Senator Cosgrave and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. I regret I have to rule the matter raised by Senator McGennis as not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment on the grounds of lack of ministerial responsibility.  The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Before announcing the Order of Business I am sure all Senators will join with me in welcoming the publication today of <i>A New Framework for Agreement.</i>  We all hope it will prove to be just that, and will be seen as something which does not threaten and can be a framework within which all parties can seek to work out our problems.  On foot of the publication of this document I propose that we have a lengthy debate on its contents.  We can do so tomorrow or next Wednesday; my preference would be for next Wednesday so that we can reflect on the document but I will be guided by the views of other groups.</P>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is Item 1 until 6 p.m. and Item 8, motion No. 7, from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.  Item 8, motion No. 7, has been put down in the spirit of requests made by many Opposition Senators, including Senator Quinn and Senator Mooney, that this House be the first to have a discussion on votes for emigrants.  It is not the final word on the subject; this motion is on the Order of Business to elicit the views of Members of the House.  If there are any constructive proposals they will be taken on board.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to indicate that any Senator is speaking too much but I find some Senators have gone overboard.  I ask Senators to refrain from making speeches on the Order of Business.  I do not mind short explanatory statements but let us not have long speeches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Item 8, motion No. 7, Fianna Fáil strongly suggests that the issue be dealt with by an Oireachtas joint committee.  We believe that is the way forward.  We hope that will be agreed by this evening.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the publication of <i>A New Framework for Agreement</i> which is up for discussion and hopefully for agreement. We, on this side, discussed the matter this morning and we would welcome a debate on this next Wednesday.  We would suggest, Sir, that we sit extra hours on Wednesday next to ensure that every Senator who wishes to contribute to the debate on this most important document would have the opportunity.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader give Government time to debate Item 4 on today's Order Paper?  He made time available last week &mdash; and again tomorrow &mdash; to discuss the flooding disaster.  Today's weather makes my point even stronger and we will be asking that he include it in his Order of Business for next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Independent group have also considered <i>A New Framework for Agreement</i> and when it should be debated.  We share the view that it is better to deal with this after reflection. There will be activities over the weekend, and responses over the next few days.  A considered response next week is acceptable to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I put forward two points which were raised and which we would ask be considered: first, that the debate be taken by the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste; that is important and would be in line with procedure here in dealing with such debates.  Second &mdash; and this is important in the context of what the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste have said publicly about the need for an understanding, <Col N="6" /> as far as that is possible, on the document &mdash; that next week time would be provided for questions and answers as happened on a number of occasions in this House when dealing with major debates on education.  It is not an aggressive question time we seek but questions for clarification.  That would make the debate much easier.  This is a very complicated document, there are layers within layers, and it would be useful if points could be clarified during the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>On this historic day I take this opportunity, on behalf of my party, to welcome the document.  <i>A New Framework for Agreement</i> and to congratulate all who have put so much work into it over the years.  You could forgive me for picking out the Tánaiste in particular in so far as he has been extremely active throughout the whole process, and I am delighted to be here on the day this historic document is published.</P>
      <P>One of the points the British Prime Minister and the Taoiseach made this morning was that all discussion should be constructive.  There has always been constructive debate on Northern Ireland in this House and I support the view that next Wednesday would be appropriate for this discussion because it needs a great deal of reflection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome the document, <i>A New Framework for Agreement.</i> We should acknowledge the work that has been done by members from all parties, in this country, in Britain and in the North.  We regard this as an important milestone.  I would agree with the Leader's suggestion that we wait until next week to debate the matter fully &mdash; and I would stress debate it fully because I believe adequate consideration should be given to it before we speak.  As is frequently pointed out, we have a good history in this House of debating these matters in a dispassionate and balanced way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other matter I would like to see debated in the near future &mdash; it was <Col N="7" /> raised last week and I raise it again this week &mdash; is the future of the Defence Forces.  Now that we have the expert advisory group report, and it has very profound and deep implications for the future of the Defence Forces.  I think Government time should be allocated to debate this important matter.</P>
    <P>Last week time was made available for statements on the incidents which took place at Lansdowne Road at the Ireland/England soccer match.  It is a matter of regret that there was not a Minister, or at least a junior Minister, attending in the House for those statements. Could we ensure, through the Leader or the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, that when matters of that gravity are being discussed in the House, there is somebody from the Government here to listen to us?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I attended the launching yesterday of the Operational Programme for Fisheries, 1994-99.  I was disappointed with the programme and the amount of money being put aside for fishing.  I ask the Leader of the House if a debate on that programme could be proposed as soon as possible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I request the Leader of the House to raise with the Minister for Health the possibility of introducing the White Paper on mental health as soon as possible.  The Green Paper on mental health was published in June 1992 and a large number of submissions were received.  Three years is long enough period to have it debated.  I would like to see the White Paper brought forward and debated in both Houses as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader of the House for his quick response to the motion on emigrant voting.  However, that does not indicate my full support for the Government's proposals.  I am also pleased that he is prepared to consider the proposal from this side of the House on the possibility of discussing it further at joint committee level.  As I <Col N="8" /> pointed out at the time &mdash; many others, including Senator Manning, would share this view &mdash; there are extremely complex areas that have to be discussed and decided upon before any decision is taken on the admission of extra Senators.</P>
      <P>I also have a question in the context of comments the Leader made last week and again following a request as to when the Joint Committee on Broadcasting will meet.  I do not wish to press the Leader on this point but it is an important committee.  I am aware that changes are taking place in all House committees due to the transition in recent months but I would be grateful if he could expedite this matter and have the committee formed and meet as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Can the Leader give any indication when the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht will be publishing his Green Paper on broadcasting?  There was a substantive story on the front page of the <i>Irish Independent</i> last Monday about possible proposals that will be contained in that paper.  It would not be in the best interests of the future of broadcasting and to the stability of our national broadcasting network if selective leaks appear in the media in advance of the publication of this important Green Paper.  I ask the Leader, with all the respect that I can command, to convey to the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht the need for the publication of this paper as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>They are legitimate questions to the Leader.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="9" /> On your initiative, a Chathaoirligh, and that of your colleagues on the Committee on Procedures and Privileges, you circulated a document on the mode of behaviour in this House.  While I do not want to appear stuffy, adhering to those rules of procedure can only enhance the status of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GordonWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader for affording time so quickly for the discussion of the document <i>A New Framework for Agreement.</i>  He is wise to postpone discussing it until next Wednesday when we all will have had time to think about and digest it.  It will allow me the time to go home to Enniskillen and talk to both of my friends &mdash; I would like to think that I still have two &mdash; to assess their reactions.</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;debate&rdquo; has been used in connection with this matter.  Does this imply a division, a vote or does it constitute statements on <i>A New Framework for Agreement</i>?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Leader of the House, yourself and the Members in welcoming <i>A New Framework for Agreement.</i>  I live eight miles from the Border and have some experience of the horror and terrible destruction of the last 25 years.  In the Border counties, we have been quietly celebrating since last August.  We now hope that today's historic development will move matters forward.  We are obviously hoping for great economic development in the Border corridor and the northern six counties to help us over the next period.  I look forward to next week's discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for bringing forward the White Paper on mental health.  It is appropriate that this long overdue White Paper be published now.  The psychiatric services are being administered under legislation approximately 50 years old.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would the Leader of the House be prepared to ask the Minister for Health to come to the House and make a statement on the inquest that took place in <Col N="10" /> London on Kelly Fitzgerald or hold an inquiry into the circumstances surrounding her death because a number of questions remain unanswered?  Those questions need to be answered so the public can be assured that such cases will not happen again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, and your office for the circular on decorum which we all received.  I shall certainly attempt to abide by it.  I hope it will also extend to all areas of the House, including Ministers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Senator drafted it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who are frequently extremely distracting when one is trying to address them.  I seriously think this might be effectively drawn to their attention.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House whether there is any machinery for communicating with the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Mrs. Benazir Bhutto, who addressed this House and allowed a certain number of questions from the floor of this House on both the national and international dimensions of her Government policy.  I ask in particular about the operation of the blasphemy laws and she gave a very placatory answer.  I ask the Leader of the House whether there is a mechanism for transmitting to the Pakistani Government, in the light of that apparently misleading answer, our grave concern at the case of a now 14 year old boy and his uncle; the boy was arrested three years ago and I understand may be sentenced to death for the crime of blasphemy which consisted of distributing Christian literature.  We are entitled, as a House, to be concerned about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask also if time would be given &mdash; I am sure all sides of the House are concerned and we have raised this matter in the past &mdash; to debate the question of East Timor.  There are two Items on the Order Paper &mdash; Item 2 and Item 5.  I ask particularly about this today because last week a young human rights activist <Col N="11" /> was arrested in East Timor by the Indonesian authorities for making statements on human rights as reported in <i>The Irish Times.</i>  Simultaneously a case is going on in Strasbourg&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;where the criminal operations of the Australian regime are being exposed in a forum of international law.</P>
      <P>There is a third matter in which I wish to implicate you, sir.  You very kindly sent me the text of a resolution of the Portuguese Parliament which forms the basis of the resolution &mdash; this has just been passed by the Portuguese Parliament &mdash; and it would be appropriate for us to have a debate on this issue.</P>
      <P>Finally, I welcome the decision to have a debate next week on the framework document which we all welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to consider the results of the national youth survey which showed an appalling lack of knowledge among young people of what we, as politicians, are all about. If the survey results are true throughout the country, it shows that one in ten young people know their local TD.  I wonder how many of them know us? On that basis this issue would warrant urgent debate in this House.  This has serious repercussions for the future of politics and I ask the Leader to give time for a debate so that we might come up with some solutions to address that problem.</P>
      <P>Last week several Members asked for a debate on banking, an issue which affects everybody, whether they like it or not, and it is time we addressed it in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>To paraphrase Winston Churchill, today is not the beginning of the end but the end of the beginning. This is a most historic day.  Many people deserve our congratulations, not least Seán Lemass who took the first journey to Stormont in the modern era.  I am proud of the role my party leader has played in this process, beginning in the early 1980s with Dr. FitzGerald and continuing with Deputy Albert Reynolds, who will be remembered with particular honour for the role he played in this process.  The Leader has responded very rapidly to the request for a debate.  It is well to remember all those who created the conditions whereby Irish men and women of whatever ethos and background can today look forward and hope for an island of Ireland in which we can all live peacefully and happily.  As an aside to Senator Gordon Wilson, not alone has he two friends but he has friends the length and breadth of this country and will have for a long time to come.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the framework document and congratulate the people involved.  I intended to mention the former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, but Senator Magner stole my thunder and he named others who deserve to be mentioned.  Deputy Reynolds deserves mention for the part he played initially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Leader to afford time for a debate on the livestock export trade <Col N="13" /> because it is under threat.  I read in the newspaper today that the EU Ministers' discussion yesterday was deadlocked.  It is very important that this trade continues; it is worth £3 million to this country and employs about 800 people. I appeal to the Leader to give time &mdash; Government time rather than Private Members' time if possible &mdash; to debate this item.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In years to come our grandchildren may look back on 22 February 1994 and say that on this day Ireland changed.  I hope we will all be proud of this day.  I also welcome the framework document.  It is likely that this will entail a referendum on Articles of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Is it possible to find time for a discussion on the revision of the bail laws? I understand the situation is horrific &mdash; I will not go into details now &mdash; regarding the inability of keeping somebody in jail when there is a danger that person will commit another crime.  Since the Supreme Court said in 1966 that there are only very limited conditions under which somebody may be refused bail, it may be necessary to have a referendum on this.  If we are going to have a number of referenda, it may be time to debate the revision of the bail laws now rather than later so that all these referenda can be held on the same day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call by Senator Maloney and Senator Finneran for the publication of a White Paper on mental health.  I understand that a major international congress on mental health is to take place in Dublin next August and it would be fitting if the White Paper was published and discussed before then.  Having Acts pertaining to mental health which were enacted in 1945 does not look very good for us as the host country.  I urge the Leader to ask the Minister for Health to publish the White Paper as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Leader to give Government time to debate an amendment to the Arterial Drainage <Col N="14" /> Act, 1945, which I have circulated on behalf of my colleagues.  As the Leader will be aware, there is a crisis and an urgency to deal with this legislation.  I urge him to indicate what Government time he will give to this as a matter of priority.</P>

      <P>I join with other speakers in saying that today is an historic day and I am pleased that we will have an opportunity to discuss the important framework document. Given that there is such cooperation in this House on all sides I welcome the fact that the Leader has decided to organise a discussion on this document at the earliest opportunity.  Next week is the right time so that everybody will have had an opportunity to analyse it and think it over before making statements.</P>
      <P>Senator David Norris mentioned two important matters concerning Pakistan and East Timor, and I wish to add a third, the problem in Chechnya.  We have read about the loss of lives there and I hope the Leader, in conjunction with other interested parties, will organise another full debate on human rights.</P>
      <P>I also hope the Leader can let us know when we will have amending legislation to the Road Traffic Act, 1993, and I would be obliged if he could let us have some news on that before the tourist season.  This is a matter which has been mentioned in this House on a regular basis since we resumed.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators for their agreement on the arrangements for next Wednesday's debate.  It is wise to have a period of reflection before we discuss the document, as well as taking into account some of the issues which will be raised over the coming days. Next Wednesday an effort will be made to ensure that all Senators who wish to participate will be given a chance to do so.</P>
      <P>Item 4 concerns Senator Daly's Arterial Drainage (Amendment) Bill and I compliment him on producing it. When I was on the far side of the House I always said that a Private Member's Bill should, at least, be given the courtesy of a Second Reading and I have not changed my view.  I am therefore suggesting &mdash; and perhaps the Whips can discuss this &mdash; that the Bill begin in Fianna Fáil Private Members' time next Wednesday evening and on Thursday I will make Government time available for the continuation of Second Stage.  If that is acceptable I will go ahead along those lines.  As regards the point raised by Senator O'Toole, I will try to ensure that the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste will be present; I am sure one or other of them would wish to be here.  I will raise the point of taking questions and I am sure they would agree with that, but if we have a long day and everybody wants to get in, there may be a conflict. However, I will put the question anyway.</P>

      <P>When I began to reply I was not aware of the situation, though it is interesting.  We have had statements in this House before, taken at short notice, where the ability of the House to react quickly to a crisis may well conflict with the ability of a Minister to be present.  I thought there was a general <Col N="16" /> view that we should go ahead and have statements whether a Minister was present.  I did not put pressure on either Minister to attend last week but I reported back what was said and what was reported in the newspapers.  Senator Magner's statement formed part of <i>The Irish Times</i> editorial the next day, so the debate was noted.  There will occasionally be a conflict between our ability to react quickly by having statements and the ability of the Minister to be present. That perhaps explains the situation.</P>
      <P>Senator Fitzgerald mentioned fisheries. There will be a debate in this House on this matter on Thursday, 9 March, from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, will take the debate and he has indicated that he will be happy to answer questions at the end of that session.</P>
      <P>I will pass on the case for the publication of a White Paper on mental health which Senators Maloney, Finneran and Honan made.  I did not follow up the point on the broadcasting committee last week but I will try to do so today.  I will also pass on the question of the Green Paper and the leaks to the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht. I am glad Senator Mooney noted the request from Committee on Procedure and Privileges for a greater sense of decorum in the House.</P>

I am not sure if it would be appropriate for the House to have a debate on an inquest and a specific case.  However, I agree that very serious issues need to be raised and I will take advice as to the most appropriate way to do so.  I have great reservations about the House discussing the details of a particular case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Norris raised an interesting question on the mechanisms open to this House whereby we can convey our abhorrence of what is happening in <Col N="17" /> places such as Pakistan.  Last week I conveyed to the Department of Foreign Affairs the points raised by Senator Lanigan on the blasphemy laws in Pakistan. We do not really have a mechanism in our Standing Orders, of which I am aware, whereby we can act in a fairly speedy and emphatic way to make our concerns known.</P>

We are also long overdue an omnibus debate on foreign affairs to include areas such as East Timor, Chechnya, Pakistan and others.</P>
      <P>Senator Gallagher raised the point &mdash; I am not sure it was relevant to the Order of Business &mdash; on the national youth survey.  I am not sure how Senators fared but people knew very little about MEPs and they cannot say they have not been getting publicity of late.  I am not sure publicity is the answer.</P>
      <P>Banking is on the agenda and we will try to find time for that fairly soon. Senator Farrell's pothole is something I cannot sort out today.  Senator Kiely raised the question of the livestock export trade.  It is becoming increasingly topical and I will see if we can arrange a discussion on it.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn mentioned the bail laws.  There are a huge number of very important topics coming up and the bail laws is one which has been around for a very long time and is a cause of concern to all parties.  Perhaps it is suitable for the Independents' Private Members' Business or we could arrange another discussion.</P>

    <P>On the Defence Forces, I am asking the Minister to come in at the earliest opportunity.

    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  We appreciate the fact that this is the fourth Bill he has introduced in this House during his term as Minister for Equality and Law Reform and I hope he believes it is worthwhile doing so.  I hope the Minister thinks the debate and ideas put forward by the Senators are worthwhile.</P>
      <P>Since coming to office, the Minister has done more than any other Minister for the civil legal aid scheme, which was introduced in 1980 by the then Minister for Justice, and he is now putting it on a statutory basis, defining the authority of the Civil Legal Aid Board and making it permanent.  I support his efforts in this regard.  When the legal aid scheme was introduced, its purpose was to enable any person, whose means were within certain financial limits, to obtain legal services, subject to certain basic criteria of reasonableness.  We are sometimes critical of the Minister for not going far enough, although that is our purpose in the House.  While it is difficult to satisfy us, I thank the Minister for what he has done for civil legal aid. Since he assumed office, funding has more than doubled and the number of centres throughout the country has increased to 24; we will have 26 law centres in the future.  The Minister must be congratulated for doing this and for delivering on his commitment to the civil legal aid scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Civil legal aid was looked at by the Second Commission on the Status of Women, of which I was a member, because, as was stated earlier, 75 per cent of the law centres' clients are women.  This is hardly surprising because many women are financially <Col N="19" /> dependent.  They are engaged in home duties without rights to earned income or social assistance.  The lack of access to legal aid impacted on women more than on men.  That was why the Second Commission on the Status of Women looked at the civil legal aid scheme.  The Minister has greatly improved the situation for the clients of the civil legal aid system, most of whom are women.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the fact that the Civil Legal Aid Bill allows two parties to a dispute to be represented by one law centre.  Coming from a rural constituency, this is important because many people must travel long distances to law centres.  If both parties could not attend the same law centre it caused great difficulties, particularly in family law cases, which were the majority of cases dealt with through the free legal aid system.  I welcome this provision.</P>
    <P>When the Second Commission on the Status of Women looked at the civil legal aid system and the Civil Legal Aid Board, it was critical of the fact that it was an all male board.  I welcome the provisions in the Bill that not fewer than five members of the board shall be men or women.  We take it for granted that if nothing is done, women will automatically be appointed to these boards. Although the Government has accepted the 40 per cent representation on State boards and Ministers, in fairness to them, have done their best to ensure this happens, it has been difficult to achieve in many cases.</P>
    <P>I am a member of the Laois County Enterprise Partnership Board.  The then Minister, Deputy Quinn, added two women to that board as happened on all boards in the country.  Previously in Laois the only woman member was myself.  Although the boards had been told by the Minister they were required to have 40 per cent women membership, they did not meet that requirement.</P>
    <P>Recently in the health sphere a board was set up to deal with general practice. Both the Irish Medical Organisation and the Irish College of General Practitioners originally sent lists of nominees <Col N="20" /> which did not include any women.  The Minister had to tell them there would be no appointments unless 40 per cent of nominees were women.  This is disappointing because, although people feel women have arrived and are making an impact in many areas, this shows the resistance to appointing women to these positions.</P>
    <P>I support the provisions in this Bill and what the Minister is doing.  I am confident he will not appoint a board with fewer than five women.  Many will feel it is not necessary to make this point but when we see what happens and how difficult it is to get what we want, it is worth mentioning.  This matter has to be raised again and again until it is normal practice that when Ministers ask for 40 per cent representation of women on boards it will be done.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on providing for representation at tribunals in this Bill; the Minister will be empowered to extend legal aid to tribunals by order. Until now people qualifying for legal aid on a means test basis could not get assistance or representation before the Employment Appeals Tribunal, the Social Welfare Appeals Tribunal, etc.  I ask the Minister to clarify the scope of this provision and when he will introduce the enabling regulation.  The issue of equality cases was raised in the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women.  Previously such cases were not eligible for assistance and I ask the Minister to confirm they will be covered in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Last week many Members said that, while they support what is in the Bill, they were critical about what was left out.  I realise the Minister does not get everything he wants from the Cabinet and he has decided how best to distribute the limited resources available.  The Bill puts the old scheme on a statutory basis but it does not enhance it.  There are financial constraints and to do what everyone would like would require much more funding.  However, during his time in the Department he will undoubtedly improve both the scheme and the funding available.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="21" /> Senator McGennis mentioned the article, &ldquo;Legal Aid: it's not just Cash&rdquo; in <i>The Irish Times</i> by Mr. Gerry Whyte, a law lecturer in TCD.  I support the arguments in that article.  When we consider access to the law we think of litigation in court.  Many stages arise before that and perhaps matters could be prevented from getting to court if people knew their rights, were educated and given advice.</P>
    <P>When a person is an expert in their chosen profession they do not hold the subject in awe.  However, if one is outside the legal, medical or other professions one can forget that ordinary people are quite frightened or in awe of those professions.  Many people and particularly those who will seek the services of the civil legal aid scheme, do not know what the law is about; they do not even know if their problems have legal solutions.  They do not know that they could go to court or that they could secure legal redress for particular problems. That is why education and information are important.  I appreciate that the Minister will tell me that he is doing his best with limited resources, and I am not criticising him for not providing such services.  However, a civil legal aid system does not simply involve providing aid for people going to court.  In many cases, if people knew their rights their problems often would not escalate to the extent that they would have to go to court.  Education and information are important in that regard.</P>
    <P>This issue was looked at by the commission. It felt that there was a lack of public availability of information on family law matters and civil legal aid. The National Social Services Board provides information through local communities on these matters.  That system should be encouraged.  However, it is probably just the first step.  The Civil Legal Aid Board should have the function of educating and informing the public about these matters.  The Director of Consumer Affairs distributes leaflets and information about people's rights regarding consumer affairs.  Could there not be a role for the board in educating <Col N="22" /> and informing the public on legal matters?  Should there not be an educative role whereby its representatives could visit schools or talk to the public about civil legal aid, people's rights and entitlements and related issues?  That would be important.  Only then will we be able to say that we have a civil legal aid system that enables people to avail of its services and to know their entitlements.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would indicate whether he wishes to address these matters in the future when further funding is available.  The Minister said last week that certain designated matters were excluded from the scheme because of lack of funding.  However, in section 28 (11) the Minister may by order deem any of these matters to be no longer designated.  Perhaps the Minister would outline his thinking a little further on this issue and on where he sees the scheme going in the future.  We are not getting everything we would wish for in this Bill.  However, this is the first time the civil legal aid scheme has been put on a statutory basis and that serious funding has been allocated to it.  I would like to hear the Minister speak about his future plans for the system.</P>
    <P>In the original civil legal aid scheme there was a provision for the establishment of community consultative committees. This does not appear to be included in the Bill.  That is a backward step in the development of legal aid services. Would the Minister not consider amending the Bill to enable the Minister to establish such committees by regulation or would he outline his thinking on this issue?  Why has he decided not to provide such enabling legislation in this Bill?</P>
    <P>Other Senators have mentioned the fact that the people who will avail of civil legal aid do not know their rights and do not know that their problems might have a legal solution.  They perhaps have difficulty with solicitors and barristers who are not part of their community &mdash; they do not know them personally and there is a barrier between them.  The aspects of community <Col N="23" /> involvement and the community based centres, such as that in Coolock, are very good and enable people to be involved and to use the system.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with many of these matters in a detailed way in his address to the House last week, but I am interested to know where he will go from here.  In this respect, I am concerned about some of the issues which cannot be dealt with in the Bill.  If there was community involvement and consultation within an area, people could identify the problems and decide on the priorities which must be dealt with.</P>
    <P>On the issue of debt collection, does the exclusion apply to the person who owes the money?  For example, is it correct to state that if I owe money and apply for civil legal aid, I will not get it?  Perhaps the Minister will clarify this matter because many people who seek civil legal aid, or even advice, would have problems with money, debt collectors, etc.  This could be a problem for many people and I ask the Minister to clarify it.</P>
    <P>We had briefings from FLAC &mdash; the Free Legal Advice Centres &mdash; and one of the issues about which they are concerned is that the law centres will not have a role when it comes to making proposals for law reform.  Will the Minister indicate his views on this?  The fact that the centres deal with and are exposed to so many cases and issues, especially issues of family law, suggests that there should be some process enabling them to have an input into law reform.</P>
    <P>When we discussed the Family Law Bill recently, we addressed the fact that because family law cases are held <i>in camera</i>, much information is not reported and that the public is not aware of much of what is happening in family law, or in families, here.  The Minister indicated that he would consider the matter of <i>in camera</i> hearings of family law cases.  In this respect, the law centres could be useful in bringing forward law reform in the future.  I look forward to the Ministers views on this.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="24" /> Most of what I wished to say was addressed by other Senators last week, and I will not repeat what they had to say except to remark that civil legal aid came into existence as a result of the Airey case &mdash; which was taken to Europe in 1979 &mdash; and the Pringle committee on civil legal aid and advice.  The Minister said that many of the recommendations of the Pringle committee have been taken on board, but this is not the case in respect of many of the recommendations regarding community involvement and community consultation, together with the education and information roles etc., of the Civil Legal Aid Board.  Does the Minister agree that these recommendations should be included or is it just the lack of funding which is preventing him from proceeding on this basis?  What are his ideas for the future?  What would he hope to do if further funding was available?</P>
    <P>Equal access to justice for all members of society is something to which we would all aspire, and we would hope it could be achieved.  The Minister knows he has the support of all sides of the House for the Bill he is introducing, but we need not only a combination of the legal services; we need advice, education, information and community involvement.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill as far as it goes but there are many other measures I would like the Minister to take on board.  Perhaps we could discuss them further on Committee Stage.  I support what he is doing and I thank and congratulate him for what he has done so far for family law and civil legal aid.  I also thank him for introducing the Bill in the Seanad and for giving us an opportunity to discuss it before it goes to the other House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and thank him for introducing this Bill in Seanad Éireann.  The whole area of civil legal aid has come a long way since Mrs. Airey brought her case in the Court of Human Rights for access to the courts in 1979.  At that time, people had great difficulty gaining access to the <Col N="25" /> courts to have their cases heard.  To some extent, people were able to gain access to courts as many solicitors and barristers were prepared to take on cases where there was genuine hardship. However, due to pressure of work, time and finance this became increasingly difficult.</P>
      <P>It is essential that legal aid be put on a proper statutory footing and we have seen important progress in that regard. There have been sizeable increases in the level of funding for legal aid, particularly since 1992.  We have seen an important commitment from the Government to the cost of running the civil legal aid system.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the Civil Legal Aid Board by this Bill is absolutely necessary.  It is intended that the board's main function will be to deal with family law cases.  It is essential that we have separate court hearings for family law cases, that is, special days should be set aside for such cases.  In most summary cases, such as speeding offences, there are huge numbers of gardaí, solicitors and defendants in court.  The courtroom is packed, particularly with members of the Garda.  Those cases are followed by indictable offences and more serious matters, where there are also huge numbers of people present.  In many instances, civil cases are then heard. Finally, at the end of the day, family law cases are heard.</P>
      <P>I witness on a regular basis husbands, wives and children waiting to have their cases heard.  As the day progresses they grow more tired, worn out and exhausted this reduces whatever chance there might have been of a sense of goodwill and a spirit of co-operation.  As people become more tired there is less possibility of a satisfactory outcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that the workings of the court are very difficult and that an ever increasing number of cases is heard. However, we talk about the cost of Garda overtime and having to cut down on Garda services, yet huge numbers of gardaí have to attend courts in Dublin and the District Courts; their day is wasted hanging around the courts.  This <Col N="26" /> could be sorted out on practical basis if all those cases could be heard on a specific day each month.  There has been some amalgamation of District Court venues across the country, of which I am not totally in favour.  However, we have to make a genuine, positive, determined effort to ensure that family law cases are heard on a specific day.  I do not wish to labour this point but I want to get across to the Minister that while I support his Bill I want him to examine that situation.</P>
    <P>I have had many dealings over the years with the staff of the legal aid centres and have seen them working in very difficult circumstances and under enormous pressure.  They have been very courteous to the litigants with whom I have dealt.  I have had to ring the offices on many occasions and they have looked after the cases in an exemplary manner.  It is difficult to believe that people have to work under such pressure.  There are huge backlogs and staff often have to spend their whole day in court waiting for a case to be called.  I congratulate the staff on their hard work.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that there has been such an expansion in the number of law centres.  There is now a law centre in almost every county.  It is essential to have at least one in each county and some counties will need several. However, there has been a major improvement.  I note that the Minister intends to allow the solicitors in the legal aid centres to take on apprentices. This is a positive move with many benefits. Many young people who wish to enter the legal profession have difficulty getting apprenticeships.  In addition, people who wish to study law will get first hand experience of the practical side of family law cases.  This is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I am open to correction but I think the fee charged per case in the pilot scheme established by the Minister is approximately £75.  I have had just one case under that scheme, involving a solicitor from a well known firm in Dublin. I marvelled at the time, effort and <Col N="27" /> expertise put in by that individual because given the time spent, it involved a considerable loss for that firm and for the solicitor.  This situation needs to be examined.  There must be a sizeable increase in funding because the time spent on this case, for example, involved 30 or 40 hours and the individual would have received less than £2 an hour.  I was very satisfied with the professional manner in which the matter was approached.  The Minister should examine this situation.</P>
    <P>This pilot scheme may only be in Dublin but it should be extended throughout the country.  Funding must be very much increased.  It would be of tremendous benefit if both these measures were introduced.  This scheme would involve private practices but, given that many young solicitors are opening firms, I believe they would be anxious, agreeable and willing to practise in this field.  A special type of person is required for family law.  They need to have a special interest in this type of work.  One needs a particular approach because there is the legal side but also the human side.  The human factor must be taken into account by anybody involved in this area.</P>
    <P>With regard to members of the Judiciary, family law is entirely different from probate actions or those involving accidents or rights of way.  It is a particular field and great thought should be given to the appointment of members of the Judiciary to hear family law cases, whether they are Government appointments or otherwise.  Appointees should have particular skills in this area.</P>
    <P>The establishment of this board and its staffing is to be welcomed.  I will not go into the detail of the Bill at this point but I have some reservations about section 36, which states that costs awarded by a court or a tribunal to a person not in receipt of legal aid against a person who is in receipt of legal aid, the unsuccessful litigant, shall not be paid from the fund except in certain unusual circumstances.  Section 36 (2) (c) states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="28" /> ...the successful litigant will suffer severe financial hardship unless an <i>ex gratia</i> payment is made,</P>
    <P>This is unfair.  A person should not have to defend themselves in a particular manner, have costs granted and then show that they will suffer severe financial hardship unless an <i>ex gratia</i> payment is made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>If costs are awarded by a court of law, the case should go for taxation.  However, after the costs are taxed, they should be paid.  This situation as it stands means that if a person goes to the Civil Legal Aid Board, is granted legal aid and the case is fought, the person who had to defend himself and was successful then finds that he may get an <i>ex gratia</i> payment if he is suffering severe financial hardship.  This is a flaw in the section and I hope the Minister has the power to amend it.  It is inequitable.  I compliment the Minister on the Bill, which is well thought out, prepared, researched and formulated, but this is a flaw which I hope he will take on board.</P>
      <P>I wish the Bill speedy passage through both Houses and I wish the Minister well.</P>

      <P>My apologies, three solicitors. I pay tribute to the Minister for grasping the nettle with regard to this problem which has been neglected for too long.  I understand that this Bill will merely give effect to our international obligations, specifically the European <Col N="29" /> Convention on Human Rights.  There are relatively clear statements in that convention to the effect that citizens, who otherwise cannot afford it, should be given the opportunity of a fair hearing. The reality in the modern world is that a fair hearing is almost impossible without fair or equal legal representation. The Bill is most welcome in so far as it seeks to equalise this situation.</P>
      <P>There was never a Minister for Equality and Law Reform prior to the Minister's appointment.  I hope a time will come when law reform will no longer be necessary and that all our laws, many of which date back hundreds of years, will be brought into the 21st century.  I also hope, in a much shorter period, that there will be no need for a Minister for Equality because we will have finally dealt with that issue. However, until this is the case, there is a need for such a Ministry and for somebody to give their particular attention to this area.</P>
      <P>Other speakers made general comments on the Irish legal system as it pertains at present.  This is not really relevant to the Bill given that we are only dealing with one aspect of it.  However, to a certain extent, we must put the Bill in the context of the system as we find it.  We have a common law system and some laws, which predate 1922 and 1937, are still in force in this country. We have a written Constitution; other countries have unwritten constitutions. Ireland is a member of the European Union by virtue of the Treaty of Rome and the Maastricht Treaty, and it is also a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
      <P>By and large, we are fortunate to enjoy a highly respected legal system.  I emphasise the word &ldquo;respected&rdquo; because one can travel not very far from this country and be unpleasantly surprised by the way in which some countries go about settling disputes and prosecuting criminal matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know of an Irish person in prison in a member state of the European Community 16 or 17 months after an alleged incident who has not yet been formally <Col N="30" /> charged.  I will not mention the name or the exact circumstances but such a scenario is absolutely unthinkable in our jurisdiction, and there are many other examples of how our jurisdiction, in my opinion, compares very favourably with other jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>Similarly, we are well blessed in this country with the quality of the Judiciary &mdash; District Court, Circuit Court, High Court and Supreme Court.  To my knowledge, there has never been any question mark over the integrity of any judge while sitting as a judge in any Irish court; or maybe there was one of which I did not hear.  Certainly, one does not have to travel too far into mainland Europe before all sorts of accusations in that regard are made.  We can be proud of our Judiciary.</P>
    <P>There are certain things, of course, of which I am sure the Minister would agree we are not terribly proud.  Up to now, we have not been very proud of our legal aid scheme.  I do not think the Minister, any member of the Government or any of us, is particularly impressed or proud of the fact that there are such long delays in the courts. In Dublin Circuit Court the time between an incident occurring and it coming to trial could be three years; between the time when all the pleadings have finished and the matter is set down for trial by way of notice of trial, one could be waiting up to 18 months.  Justice delayed is justice denied.  This Civil Legal Aid Bill must be enacted in the context of looking at the entire judicial system in terms of speed and efficiency.</P>
    <P>Senator Enright mentioned one important aspect in relation to the family courts.  We now use video evidence in incest cases, and so on.  There are all sorts of improvements but I do not think there is any point introducing a Civil Legal Aid Bill if it is will not be in the context of a complete revamping, reassessment and modernisation of the entire courts and judicial system.</P>
    <P>Having said that.  I am sorry, Sir, if I was rambling but I felt I should put my comments about this Bill into some kind of context.  It has been approximately 22 <Col N="31" /> years since the case taken by Johanna Airey.  Since then, very good people working in under-resourced legal aid boards have struggled valiantly in difficult circumstances to do a job, but it was a well known complaint that people could wait weeks or months simply to get their first appointment.  Every politician has had experience of someone coming into our clinics saying they needed legal advice.  We are all perhaps a little reluctant to send people to the local legal aid centre because we are nervous as to how they would be received.  Obviously, they would be received courteously, and so on, but they might not get an appointment for months.  For many people that simply was not good enough.  If we can have a system under this Bill where people will be able to access legal aid relatively quickly, then that in itself will be a major improvement.</P>
    <P>There is one other aspect of the broad thrust of the Bill that I would ask the Minister to contemplate.  I have noted that the staff numbers have been increased from 99 to over 200 and that is very laudable in itself, but we should carefully consider the following question: do we want the legal aid service to be administered by people who are, effectively, civil servants, by people who are employed and paid by the State?  It is my understanding &mdash; I could be wrong and could stand corrected on this but I think it is the case &mdash; that in large measure the legal aid system in England operates by way of what we call the private sector.  In other words, if you have a case and get a certificate from the legal aid board you more or less pick your own solicitor and counsel and you are represented by them.  That system appears to work quite well.  The Minister is aware that their resources are far in excess of ours.  Solicitors and barristers can make a lot of money in this way in England but there should not be an over-dependence on public lawyers to represent members of the public when they seek legal representation and I politely ask the Minister to place less <Col N="32" /> emphasis on that.  Try to devise a scheme whereby, for reasonable fees, people can more or less choose their own solicitor and barrister having, of course, first received a certificate from the Legal Aid Board to the effect that they come within the financial criteria and that the case is one with which the Legal Aid Board should be involved.</P>
    <P>Another element in the context of the legal background in Ireland at the moment is the regrettable over-supply in the market of solicitors and barristers. I think there is in the region of 5,000 solicitors and 900 barristers.  I cannot say with accuracy what degree of gainful employment exists for that number of solicitors and barristers but, at a rough guess, approximately a quarter or maybe a third of each branch of the profession is under-employed.  It might be more economically viable to give a young solicitor or a barrister £95 or £125 to take a case.  In this way you do not have all the associated overhead costs of a solicitor or barrister with full-time staff because they must provide office accommodation, secretarial support, holidays, superannuation and so on for the staff.  We are constantly told people want to see reductions in their tax bills. The people went through a lot of pain in the late 1980s trying to get their tax bills reduced so, not wishing to preempt any changes the Minister might make and with a wry smile I say, do not be too socialist about this, do not be too hung up about the legal aid boards employing too many people directly. There is plenty of talent out there, there are many fully qualified young people out there willing to take on these cases. Let us have this scheme and let them take some of those cases.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to treat this as if it were Committee Stage but, in deference to the Minister, I feel we should make a few comments on some of the specific provisions in this Bill.</P>
    <P>It might be a good idea if in the preamble to the Bill we said, &ldquo;an Act to comply with our obligations pursuant to the European Convention on Human Rights&rdquo;.  That might be a tribute to Mrs. <Col N="33" /> Airey and to all those people who have had recourse to the European Convention on Human Rights, and it might be an acknowledgement of that convention.</P>
    <P>The setting up of the board is well done.  It is good to have a mix of people with experience of the law, the practice and procedures of the courts, business, finance, management and so on.  It is a good idea to have in the board a minimum of two barristers and solicitors, two staff members and a minimum of five men and women.  There is little room in the structure of the board for it to be unrepresentative.  It is not for me to give ideas to the Minister but maybe some former, or even current, members of the Judiciary might sit on that board. However, that is a matter for the Minister to decide in due course.</P>
    <P>I would also like to mention section 5 of the Bill, which has been touched on by other Senators and is the absolute kernel of the provision of a free legal aid service.  &ldquo;The principal function of the Board shall be to provide, within the Board's resources...&rdquo;.  This is the million dollar question; what will the board have as a resource?  From year to year it will consult with its Minister, who will consult with the Minister for Finance, who, with the Government, will make a decision on the resources of the board. This includes the possibility that the board may not have the resources to carry out its work in a certain year.  That is not good enough.  There should be an openended provision to the effect that the board must have the resources necessary to comply with its international obligations.  There are also precedents for it, which might soothe the objections of any mandarins in the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>The Refugee Bill is coming before both Houses because of our international obligations, in that case under the Geneva Convention and the New York Protocolumn If we have obligations, then we have to be serious about them.  There might not be a Labour <Col N="34" /> Minister for Finance one day.  If that happened one might find a Minister for Finance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or a socialistic minded Minister for Finance.  We have international obligations and we must comply with them.  Section 5 of the Bill gives the Government a let out clause in that the board can only fulfil its obligations to the extent that it has resources. Those resources, as the Minister fully knows, will come from the Minister for Finance of the day and not pursuant to a legal and international obligation.</P>
      <P>The same point can be made about sections 18 and 19, primarily section 18, which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may in each financial year, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, advance to the Board out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, such sum or sums as the <Col N="35" /> Minister, after consultation with the Board, may determine for the purposes of expenditure by the Board in the performance of its functions under this Act.</P>
    <P>This will take place only after consultation and that is too weak.  There should at least be some onus on the Minister for Finance to explain to the Oireachtas why they are deliberately not giving the Legal Aid Board the resources needed.</P>
    <P>Section 19, the setting up of a legal aid fund, is an excellent idea.  I understand the fund would consist of moneys provided by the Minister and also moneys which are obtained by way of court awards for costs or damages.  If the Legal Aid Board supports a successful litigant and gets an award for costs, those costs will be paid into the legal aid fund, thereby enabling the board to continue its work and the next litigant to make their case.</P>
    <P>Sections 26, 27 and 28 are the criteria for obtaining legal advice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will stop quoting from the Bill and speak from memory.</P>
      <P>There have been cases where people have gone to the Legal Aid Board office, a certain deciding officer takes a certain view of their case and decides, either on the financial criteria or the merits of the case, that they should not be supported.  That is giving a large power to that deciding officer.  In may ways it could be argued that it is unconstitutional. The Constitution guarantees access for all citizens to the courts. Accordingly, if a section or a deciding officer prejudges the merits of a case then they are putting themselves in the place of the court, which in itself is unconstitutional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not notice anywhere in the Bill any reference to frivolous or vexatious <Col N="36" /> clauses; perhaps there is.  There should certainly be a mechanism where a deciding officer can say &ldquo;This is a frivolous or vexatious case and we are not going to support you.&rdquo;.  It would be dangerous &mdash; I am not sure if it is adequately covered in this Bill &mdash; if a deciding officer or an officer of the Legal Aid Board can make that decision and it should be policed closely.  Maybe I have missed the reference and perhaps the Minister will address the House later on this point, but there does not seem to be an appeals procedure to contest the decision of such an officer if the decision is made against a person who wants to make a case &mdash; there is such a mechanism to the board; I stand corrected and I am glad it is there.  There must be some sort of an appeals procedure if it is either a meritorious case or if one does not fulfil the various financial criteria.  In both cases there must be a provision where either of those decisions can be appealed, either to the board or to some third party &mdash; perhaps the Ombudsman or the court itself.  The courts could not tolerate the Legal Aid Board making, in effect, a quality decision without an appeals mechanism being in place.  Perhaps the Minister will also be able to help me on that matter.</P>
    <P>This is not Committee Stage and I will not detain the Seanad much longer, but I wish to make one or two more points in relation to solicitors and barristers. I saw provision for a panel of barristers and solicitors in this Bill.  The work should be spread around; this is very important.  Of course officers of the Legal Aid Board should be able to engage whom they want in a generally unfettered way, but because public money is involved, it would not be acceptable if a small group of barristers or solicitors were to dominate the majority of the work.  There should perhaps be some policing mechanism in the legislation whereby a rota system of barristers and solicitors is included.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a point about the exclusion of election petitions.  Perhaps it is more a matter for Committee Stage, but I am very surprised at it.  An election <Col N="37" /> petition should be available to the poorest of the poor, who should be able to go to court and say that an election was unfairly held &mdash; that is what election petitions are all about.  There can be no more important function of free legal advice than to help a person who has taken the trouble to challenge a particular election and make sure that it was fairly held.  There are one or two more worrying aspects, a Leas Chathaoirligh, which perhaps I will return to on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I absolutely agree with the point made by Senator Enright that if you look very carefully at the provisions in relation to an unsuccessful litigant supported by the Legal Aid Board, there is a scenario where the Legal Aid Board is supporting a person suing another person, the Legal Aid Board is unsuccessful and yet the person the board sued only has a discretionary or <i>ex-gratia</i> right to their costs.  That is very dangerous.  It is probably an unjust attack on the property rights of the person being sued, because normally costs are a discretionary matter for the courts. If the courts award costs against the unsuccessful party and the Legal Aid Board has taken that case, and of course the Legal Aid Board would only have taken that case if it felt there was a good case and if the person they were representing did not have enough money to take the case on their own in the first place&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Legal Aid Board does not take the case, it funds the case. The case is taken by the person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It funds the case, but it is funding a person who in its view does not have enough money to take the case alone and it is funding a case which, having examined it, at least superficially, it believes to be a bona fide case.  All of a sudden we are left with the possibility that the successful party will not receive their costs.  There is no point in that person pursuing the person the Legal Aid Board was supporting because by definition that person is in <Col N="38" /> most cases a person of little or no means, so I say that this provision in the Act is probably an unjust attack on the property rights of the successful litigant in cases where the Legal Aid Board has intervened.</P>
      <P>To sum up, perhaps I have been a little long winded, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, but I hope my contribution has been useful.  It is very important legislation. The Minister is to be complimented, but I reiterate what I said to him at the beginning.  He should not be too concerned about employing many people.  We are trying to get the burden of taxation down.  The Minister should try to use private barristers and solicitors in so far as he can, or do an audit, maybe run this scheme for a year or two and get in some economists to see which is cheaper.</P>
      <P>I reckon that on a case by case basis, it could well be cheaper for the State to use the services of private barristers and private solicitors for a modest agreed fee.  The advantage is that in every case where a solicitor or counsel is specifically briefed, they will give that case their specific attention.  The fear might be that in some cases where solicitors of the Legal Aid Board are employed as such full time, they would have a very large workload and perhaps some administrative functions to undertake at the same time and so would not be in a position, through no fault of their own, to give each case their full attention. That is the first fundamental point.</P>
      <P>The second fundamental point is that the Minister must get a guarantee for the resources for this Bill.  This Bill is not worth a whit without money.  There must be money, not just for the legal system but also for legal aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to finish my remarks by repeating what I said at the beginning.  By and large we are very well served by the judicial system in this country.  We are well served by barristers, solicitors, by the clerks and all the court staff, by the Law Society, by the Bar Council and by the Judiciary.  If this Bill comes into force, perhaps slightly amended, in the context of an overall improved environment <Col N="39" /> of the legal system in this country, then it will have been an effort well worthwhile and I commend the Minister for his efforts in that regard.</P>

      <P>I speak here with some trepidation, particularly after the words of Senator Mulcahy.  He pointed out how many barristers and lawyers there were in the House today earlier and finished, if I might dare say it, by suggesting towards the end of his speech that an economist join us.  I compliment him on his speech: it is not his maiden speech but we are very proud to hear the words that he has used and to hear it done with such panache, if I may say so.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill as well as far as it goes.  It is like putting a Band-Aid on a tumour.  To address this issue properly we need much more than a Bill like this. We also need to make a frontal attack on the scandalous costs that are part of the legal system here in Ireland.  It is a fundamental tenet of our system, and one that we have always supported in a democracy, that justice should be available to all, not just to those who can afford it, so it makes perfect sense that the State should support the cost of litigation undertaken by people who cannot afford it themselves.  However, it makes no sense whatsoever, in fact it makes perfect nonsense, that the State should take virtually no interest at all in the task of reducing the cost of litigation in the first place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been very interested in listening to the cases made here today. <Col N="40" /> Senator Mulcahy has made some very worthy suggestions in regard to competitiveness and competition in order to tackle that area of costs.  I also heard Senator Enright earlier on speaking about the large number of costs not associated with the legal profession at all, the number of gardaí on overtime who must be paid.  What do ordinary people think of the legal system when they look at it from outside?  I think most of them see it as a gravy train for the relatively small number of people lucky enough to make a living out of it. Senator Gallagher last week talked about the image of the big bad wolf and called for sympathy, is that correct?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">

      <P>I was refuting that image.  Many of us do a lot of work for nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, I understand that.  I am not talking about that but about the overall cost of the system. Most people think the simplest case involves big legal fees even when it does not go to court but is settled on the steps outside the court.  They know that an investigation like the beef tribunal can cost taxpayers tens of millions of pounds, almost all of it in legal fees. They know that amounts awarded by way of damages or compensation are often dwarfed by the legal costs of cases themselves.  The cost of going to law in Ireland creates very wide ranging problems for society as a whole.  Most of them will not be addressed by this legislation. I know this is not the Minister's intention but I am calling for them to be addressed some other way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of going to law has a knock-on effect on the price of everything we buy.  It undermines the competitiveness of everything we attempt to sell abroad. The high cost of insurance is partially, even largely, due to the cost of litigation. This has a side effect which goes far beyond the issue of cost.  Many cases are not contested in court because insurance companies, on the balance of risks, decide not to defend but to settle even though they believe they are in the <Col N="41" /> right.  This also applies to business firms, other than insurance companies.  The cost of the legal process encourages people to concede cases they might otherwise win.  The cost of losing is so great that the risk involved becomes too high a price to pay for those involved, whether their businesses are small or large.  This not just adds to costs but does greater harm.</P>
    <P>The side effect of this is that it encourages the litigation mentality which is on the rampage in our society. People know that many doubtful or unjustified claims get settled and there is an encouragement for less scrupulous people to have a go and try it on, especially when they are also encouraged by legal representatives who are ready to work on a no foal no fee basis. This is what happens when people see the legal process as a gravy train.  Some of them look to see how they can get a ticket on to that train and perhaps arrive at the destination and get a refund on the ticket.</P>

      <P>I am concerned about the effect of this on the mentality of society as a whole.  We should welcome the Bill and do what we can on Committee Stage to improve it but we also must not forget that there is another job to be done and the passing of this legislation will not lessen the need to tackle that job.  Senator Mulcahy spoke about grasping the nettle.  This nettle has not yet been grasped.  It may not necessarily be this Minister's task to grasp it but I urge that we, as a Legislature, grasp it and face up to the dangers and huge effects of the costs on society.  I urge that in looking at this Bill we accept the responsibility on us to tackle the heavy cost of litigation on society so that we can look on this as a job well done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief partly because I have not had an opportunity of listening to most of the discussion so far and I hope I do not repeat <Col N="42" /> drearily points which have been made already.  I heard a little of Senator Quinn's contribution and I found myself in enthusiastic agreement with the general thrust of what he said about finding ways of controlling litigation costs.</P>
      <P>I wish to indicate an interest in the subject matter before we come to Committee Stage and to make some points on the Minister's comments at the beginning of the debate.  Essentially I want to associate myself with the tributes paid to the Minister for the interest he has taken in this issue, his commitment to it over the years and the manner in which the budget allocated to the legal aid programme has been increased from its derisory original basis to a much more substantial amount.</P>
      <P>I am in sympathy with some of the criticisms made by Deputy O'Dea in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> last Sunday about the balance between the individual and collective in the way one approaches these things.  It is because one is unlikely to find a Minister in the foreseeable future who is as sincerely committed to improving the legal aid scheme that we should take advantage of the legislation before us to optimise its potential.</P>
      <P>I am very sympathetic to the view that there is gross under-education of the public, particularly of the categories who would be most eligible for consideration, regarding their rights to this and many other aspects of civil life. Senator Gallagher spoke on the Order of Business about the innocence displayed by a large number of pupils in County Wicklow, which I assume is representative of Ireland in this respect, when asked about the identity of their TDs.  I do not think anybody thought about asking them about Senators, which is a sad reflection on the status of this House and the public perception of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Senator raised this matter I thought about how much more important it would be for them, even in our culture of personal clientage and brokerage, to be familiar with the type of legislation about which we are talking and with the rights and responsibilities <Col N="43" /> of their families under it.  This should be part of our education system at second level.  This would involve co-operation between a variety of Departments.  One of the greatest lacunae of our education system and of educating for citizenship is the neglect at second level education for subsequent civic existence.  I regard legislation of this type and its provisions as a major component of the type of education which ought to be available as a standard package at second level.</P>
    <P>This is not the only way in which one can disseminate and diffuse information on rights to potential applicants.  There is major work to be done at local level for those who never had an opportunity of taking advantage of second level education. I would like to see this extended in the legislation.  If there is a genuine commitment to and a case for local empowerment &mdash; I hate using the word &ldquo;empowerment&rdquo; because it can be so abused in conventional rhetoric &mdash; this is one of the mechanisms through which it can be made more effective.  I am not a Utopian in these matters and appreciate the problems which arise in trying to put into operation terms like &ldquo;empowerment&rdquo;, but I believe there is potential through this mechanism to do something concrete, particularly in communities most in need of it.  There is a great deal of potential in this legislation, if it is fully teased out and harnessed, for people to learn about organising themselves, presenting their case effectively, behaving in a way and taking the sort of steps which would be regarded as normal in less underprivileged communities.</P>
    <P>As good as the Minister's speech was, a little too much of it is concerned with the technicalities of the board as distinct from the longer term potential of the legislation but this is a balance which can be corrected, if indeed it is an imbalance, at a later stage.  But where he is, quite rightly, talking about gender balance on the board I would like to see the opportunity taken in legislation of this type to talk also about class balance because we are dealing with probably <Col N="44" /> the most substantial, underprivileged section of the community.  It is desirable that voices directly from that section should be included as a matter of course in the composition of the board.  Those who have had the opportunity to acquire higher incomes should not be, in however well intentioned a manner, entirely deciding these matters.  I do not say that in an adversarial way but there is a major problem in bringing the voices of many of the inarticulate in our society into positions of significant influence on legislation which affects them. Some thought should be given to the possibilities that might be available in this legislation to do something to correct that gross imbalance in the composition of boards of that sort.</P>
    <P>With those few general reflections I will be as good as my word and conclude. I look forward to a number of constructive exchanges and amendments on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister back to the House.  He seems to be spending quite a lot of time here, which is welcome indeed.  I congratulate him on this Bill.  I had a private word in his ear in the ante-Chamber and said that I would confine myself to five or ten minutes.  He expressed some scepticism, but I do have an appointment with another member of the Government which poses a certain degree of constraint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill as a forward step. I remember the days when this scheme was in such disarray that senior members of the legal profession actually resigned from it and held press conferences because they were worried precisely about the problem of underfunding. In this Bill the Minister seeks to make justice accessible to all.  The principal barriers for many have been those of finance and class, which I witnessed on the many occasions when I was called on to represent, give advice, comfort or provide a character reference for people appearing in the Dublin District Court.  It became quite clear to me that a kind of, perhaps unwitting class system <Col N="45" /> was in operation.  This was not only in terms of finance but also because people with certain social skills and dress sense had a far greater chance of obtaining bail or getting a probationary sentence than somebody who was scruffy, ill-advised, not advised at all and who did not have these social skills.</P>
    <P>I received a briefing document from the Free Legal Advice Centre group, FLAC, which also welcomes the Bill, but with certain qualifications, and I would like to place on the record some of the information the group provided me with.  I do not believe in simply listening to a group that seriously attempts to brief.  There has to be some degree of interaction so I immediately telephoned them to say that their argument pointed towards a couple of amendments.  Since they are in the law business and I am not, I suggested they might be kind enough to frame a couple of amendments.</P>
    <P>I would like to signal the Minister and his advisers that it is my intention &mdash; in fact I have already advised the Seanad office &mdash; that I will be placing these amendments on the Order Paper.  I am taking this opportunity to flag them in advance in the hope that the Minister may find it possible to accede to them. The amendments do not violate the spirit of the Bill, in fact they amplify it, and also deal with matters that were originally contemplated under the scheme of civil legal aid and advice.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Bill is being introduced, particularly by this Minister and in the Seanad.  I must also express my appreciation to the FLAC group for advising me and place on the record my admiration for the work they have done over many years.  The scheme of civil legal aid and advice was introduced by the Minister for Justice in 1980 providing for the establishment of the Legal Aid Board, which is charged with the provision of civil legal aid through full-time and part-time law centres around the country.  Since then, however, the scheme has developed almost exclusively as a family law reference point. The figures which have been provided <Col N="46" /> to me are quite stark and make the point dramatically.  Legal aid certificates awarded in family law cases in 1992 amounted to 1,791 while a mere 63 legal aid certificates awarded in other cases. That makes a substantial point about the direction in which this scheme is going and FLAC believes that it is a regrettable development due to a number of factors.</P>
    <P>Firstly, some areas of law are outside the remit of the scheme and the Minister is aware of this.  One of my amendments hopes to ameliorate this situation. Secondly, the board has no role in educating the public as to their rights and obligations at law, which is an important point.  I recall that a previous Government &mdash; in which I should discreetly say there was no Labour component &mdash; introduced a particularly mean piece of budget cutting which removed information and advice centres as well as people's capacity to discover their entitlements.  The thinking behind it was not that this particular body cost the State or the Exchequer a huge amount of money, it was far more subtle and machiavellian.  The intention was that by depriving people of information and understanding about their entitlements they would save the State a great deal more money.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about making the law and the courts accessible to people, one of the roles we ought to undertake is that of educating and informing the community generally about their entitlements.  I know there are budgetary constraints but I am sure that the Minister's heart would be in this area and so I hope it may be possible to move the Bill in this direction.</P>
    <P>The third point in the argument that has been made to me is that law centres operate independently of the community they serve.  The proposal in the Bill gives statutory effect to the current scheme with one or two minor changes. FLAC believes that a major opportunity to develop the service beyond a purely representational one could be missed if we do not make certain amendments. With regard to community consultation, <Col N="47" /> the model for this is a scheme with which I have had some marginal contact, of which I thoroughly approve and I expect that the Minister probably does too.  It is the Coolock Community Law Centre which has provided a valuable focus for a marginalised community in a deprived area.</P>
    <P>In the original scheme of civil legal aid there was provision to set up community consultative committees.  As far as I can see, this section does not feature in the Bill and, therefore, it could be said to represent a backward step. Although it was proposed initially it is a pity that it is not in the Bill now.  I hope that the Minister may consider introducing some scheme of community consultation and for that reason I have asked FLAC to supply me with an amendment enabling the Minister to establish such committees by regulation.  These committees could be empowered to consider conferring additional duties on individual law centres.</P>
    <P>For the record, and because the Minister is well supplied with advisers, I can give the substance of the amendment as follows:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, by regulation, establish committees representing local interests in a particular area to consult with the person responsible for the management of the local law centre and to consider conferring additional duties on individual law centres.  No member of such committee shall have access to any client's file or personal documents held in the law centre nor shall a member be entitled to any information provided to the staff of the law centre by any person who has availed of, or is about to avail of, the services of the law centre.</P>
    <P>Perhaps that could be positively considered for inclusion.  I do not imagine that it creates a charge on the Exchequer which is the usual method of kicking it into touch.  I cannot see how it does; perhaps it does, but it would be very marginal if it did.  The Minister <Col N="48" /> might perhaps consider the argument and, if he does not accept this amendment, frame an amendment of his own.</P>
    <P>The Legal Aid Board, as currently constituted, is not given a role in the education of the community it serves.  It is very important that education be made part of the overall legal services package.  Equal access to justice requires that all members of society are aware of their rights and obligations. There is little point in having rights if one does not have the capacity to exercise them.  Part of the capacity to exercise one's rights consists of being aware that one actually has entitlements.  That is an important point.</P>
    <P>I have an amendment dealing with education which I should read into the record.  It provides that:</P>
    <P>The principal function of the Board shall be to provide, within the Board's resources and subject to other provisions of this Act, legal aid and advice in civil cases to persons who satisfy the requirements of this Act. The Board shall also make such arrangements as in its opinion are necessary to ensure that information in relation to the law and legal services provided for in this Act, is adequately disseminated.</P>
    <P>That comes in at section&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I accept your point, particularly as I just concluded that element of what I wanted to say. However, I stand reproved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The final point I want to make on the substance of the Bill relates to the absence of funding for representation at tribunals.  It would be important to include some measure here to allow people to avail of legal aid when appearing before tribunals.  I beg your pardon. <Col N="49" /> It extends it to certain tribunals &mdash; I retract that statement.  Do you see what you did to me, Sir?  You threw me in the reading of my script.  I withdraw that comment and replace it with a compliment to the Minister.  Apparently the Bill empowers the Minister to extend legal aid to tribunals by order, which is to be welcomed.  The hope I express is that the Minister would make the appropriate order at the earliest possible date.  I regret that I was almost misleading the House on that final point.</P>
    <P>In final, absolute, total and utter conclusion &mdash; as opposed to confusion &mdash; I welcome the way in which the Bill is drafted.  It has been drafted very sensibly, particularly with regard to gender balance.  I notice right in the first page the statement that not less than five members of the board will be men and not less than five will be women.  That is precisely the way in which legislation should be framed.  There should be gender balance on all boards throughout society.</P>
    <P>I was particularly pleased to note on page two a little heading which says: &ldquo;Implications for Women&rdquo;.  It states: &ldquo;The Bill is drafted in gender neutral terms and its provisions apply equally to men and women.&rdquo;  Hear.  Hear.  Well done.  That is splendid.</P>
    <P>I remember introducing the Interpretation Bill, which was a short Bill to remove sexist language from legislation. In the beginning it was laughed out of the place, but eventually made its way on to the Order Paper and the Government introduced it.  It has been passed and is now in operation.  Some people were very dismissive of this, but I believe that the way in which we frame legislation creates a mental framework within which we operate and from which we can unconsciously absorb a degree of prejudice and discrimination. I am very pleased indeed, but not at all surprised, that this Bill is framed in such a civilised manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their constructive contributions.  I <Col N="50" /> greatly appreciate the general welcome for this Bill.  I have been in the House in the past two weeks with this Bill and also with the Family Law Bill.  I am heartened by the genuine support from Senators for both Bills and by the appreciation shown to the Government's efforts to put in place legislative and administrative structures for the care and protection of the family.</P>
      <P>With the introduction of the Civil Legal Aid Bill we are putting the Legal Aid Board on a statutory basis after 15 years of operation on a purely administrative basis.  In the context of the continued development of the legal aid service, this of itself is significant.  Of greater significance however is the fact that for the first time it underpins in law the State's commitment to access to justice for all of its people.</P>
      <P>A number of issues were raised by Senators in the course of the debate. While I will have further opportunity on Committee and later Stages to deal with these issues in greater detail, there are a number to which I propose to refer briefly in the course of my reply.</P>
      <P>A number of Senators, particularly Senators McGennis, Neville, Henry, Gallagher, Honan and Norris, referred to the recommendations of the Pringle committee on the establishment of community law centres and involvement by local communities in their development. In this context they also refer to the need for the Legal Aid Board to provide for the dissemination of information on aspects of the law which are likely to be of concern to those in need.</P>
      <P>I would like at the outset to put the Pringle committee's proposals in this regard in context.  In discussing these very important issues we should consider carefully what the Pringle committee in fact had to say.  In the first instance the committee, as Senators have said, recommended the establishment of what it termed community law centres.  However, this recommendation must be examined against the background of the committee's deliberations on the general question of the establishment of law centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="51" /> The committee considered several suggestions about the establishment of law centres, the number of centres which should be provided and their location.  In particular it considered whether such centres should be established directly by the Legal Aid Board, by local community groups or by local authorities.  In relation to the establishment of law centres by local community groups or by local authorities the committee recognised that such centres would be required to satisfy conditions laid down by the Legal Aid Board before they could be recognised and financed by the board.</P>
    <P>The committee had no advice to give on the number and location of such centres.  It stated that it was not in a position to say how many centres would be required or where they should be situated and simply confined itself to the recommendation that a total of six centres be established in the main urban centres of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway.  While the committee recognised the value of participation on the part of the local community in putting forward proposals for the establishment of law centres, it stated that:</P>
    <P>It is not an approach which can be relied on completely because the communities which suffer the most serious disadvantages are likely to be the very ones which will lack the organisation necessary to put forward realistic proposals for the establishment of centres.</P>
    <P>Consequently, it recommended that the Legal Aid Board should at the outset take the initiative in establishing law centres.  Government policy since the establishment of the scheme has been to operate it through law centres established directly by and under the control of the Legal Aid Board.</P>
    <P>In 1977 the Pringle committee suggested the establishment of a total of six law centres in the main urban centres. Since then, and particularly as a result of the expansion of the service I <Col N="52" /> initiated since coming into office, the service has been expanded dramatically, with the result that by the end of this year we will have a total of 47 law centres nationwide.  This development of the service, which could not have taken place if local community initiative alone had been relied on, ensures that the service is brought ever closer to the communities and the areas of greatest need.  I am convinced that the manner in which we are now proceeding is the correct one.  However, there is nothing which precludes the Legal Aid Board from consulting with local community groups, and they have done so in the past, nor is there anything in this Bill which precludes them from doing this.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the other question raised in relation to the role of the Legal Aid Board and the dissemination of information on aspects of the law likely to be of concern to those in need.  The Pringle committee envisaged such a role for the Legal Aid Board.  However, it should be noted that the committee envisaged that law centres would be principally concerned with the provision of legal advice rather than legal aid.  The practical experience of the operation of the scheme has shown the opposite to be the case.  In fact, the staff in the law centres spend by far the greater proportion of their time providing legal aid to the public before the courts.  Experience over the years of the board's operations differs greatly from what the Pringle committee envisaged in 1977 and the reality is that the scope for the board's involvement in the dissemination of information is quite limited.</P>
    <P>In this regard, I draw Senators' attention to the role of the National Social Service Board &mdash; the NSSB &mdash; which was set up in 1984 under the aegis of the Department of Health.  Responsibility for the board is being transferred to the Department of Social Welfare this year. The NSSB is a resource agency whose aim is to inform and empower individual citizens and communities by ensuring that they are aware of their civil and <Col N="53" /> social rights and entitlements and of the social services which exist to support them.  There are a total of 82 citizen information centres nationwide registered with the board which receive an annual grant from the Department of Health in excess of £1.2 million.  At the time the Pringle committee reported, the NSSB did not exist and, in many respects, the information-education role which the committee envisaged would be undertaken by the Legal Aid Board's law centres is today being provided through the citizen information centres.</P>
    <P>It might be of interest to Senators to know that in recent years a review was carried out by the legal aid efficiency scrutiny team in the United Kingdom into the role which the legal aid service should play in the provision of information. It recommended that the first port of call for citizens seeking information or advice in relation to their civil and social rights and entitlements should normally not be a solicitor employed by the Legal Aid Board but rather an advice agency, such as a citizens' advice information bureau.  I share this view.</P>
    <P>While I am conscious there may be a need in some instances for the Legal Aid Board to become involved in the dissemination of information, since the establishment of the NSSB the information role, as envisaged by the Pringle committee for the Legal Aid Board, is now, in many respects, being filled by the NSSB.  Nevertheless, where there is a role for the Legal Aid Board in the provision and dissemination of information, however limited, I would, in the context of the development of the service, encourage it to do so.  As I said, there is nothing in the Bill which precludes the board from providing information to individuals or organisations where appropriate.  However, I must emphasise that in the light of experience some 18 years on from the Pringle committee's deliberations, the Legal Aid Board can best ensure access to justice <Col N="54" /> by addressing the priority of providing legal aid and advice to those most in need in society.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in my introduction to the debate, over 90 per cent of legal aid cases relate to family law.  I am sure Senators will agree when I say that this is and should continue to be our number one priority.  Senator Norris commented on the fact that the bulk of the resources of the scheme were directed to fulfilling the needs in the family law area. However, the need is there.  Consequently, the bulk of the resources of the board are directed towards fulfilling that need and demand.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry and Senator Honan, among others, made reference to the provision of legal aid to persons before tribunals.  Section 27 (2) (b) of the Bill gives the Minister the power to make orders enabling the Legal Aid Board to provide legal aid to individuals in respect of proceedings in any court or tribunal which is not at present covered under the Bill.  The question of extending the scope of the board's activities to cover tribunals, such as the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the Social Welfare Tribunal, is being considered in the light of the impact of the additional resources being provided this year on reduced waiting lists.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry suggested that I name a date on which representation will be provided for cases before the Employment Appeals Tribunal, and I understand the point she is making.  However, my priority remains, as it has been since I took over responsibility for the scheme of civil legal aid and advice two years ago, the expansion of the network of law centres, the recruitment of additional staff to the board, the reduction of waiting lists of substance and the generation of a more broadly based service throughout the country, thereby giving an enhanced quality of service to those who rely on the Legal Aid Board's services.  When those targets have been met, I will consider the <Col N="55" /> matter of tribunals, having regard to the prevailing budgetary situation applicable from time to time.  I should, however, point out that legal advice on labour law matters is available under the scheme at present and legal aid, as such, is available where court proceedings are concerned on appeal from those tribunals.</P>
    <P>Senators also referred to the impact of judicial separation proceedings on the work of the board and further referred to the likely effect which divorce proceedings would have if divorce is introduced here.  Since 1990 a significant proportion of the backlog of cases being dealt with by the law centres has been generated as a result of the enactment of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989.  That legislation still has a major impact on the work of the board.  Applications for separations are more complex and time consuming to process than applications were under the old remedy before the 1989 Act.  In 1988-89, 133 people applied for legal aid for a divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> hearings, whereas there were 279 applications for legal aid for proceedings under the 1989 Act in 1990. The number of such applications has continued to rise since, with 416 applications being made in 1991, 503 in 1992 and 760 in 1993.  I have no doubt that the figure for 1994, when it becomes available, will show an increase on the 1993 figure.</P>
    <P>Compounding the difficulties this spiralling number of applications causes for the Legal Aid Board is the fact that judicial separation cases are taken, for the most part, in the Circuit Court.  For that reason, the proportion of legal aid cases being taken in the superior courts has increased significantly each year, from 28 per cent in 1988 to 38 per cent in 1990 to 55 per cent in 1993 and it continues to rise.  Obviously, a solicitor's preparation for Circuit, High and Supreme Court cases is both demanding <Col N="56" /> and time consuming to a degree not normally applicable to cases heard in the District Court.  The impact of this on case management by the board has been more than offset by the additional resources which I provided for the Legal Aid Board.  This is clearly evident from the size of the reductions in the law centres' waiting lists.</P>
    <P>The fruits of the increased allocations, which I have secured for the Legal Aid Board in recent years are already evident in the reduced waiting lists in the law centres.  Senator McGennis remains concerned about what will happen in the future given the existing pressure on the board's resources.  The position is that the full impact of the increased allocations has yet to be realised.  The opening of new law centres and the recruitment of staff had, of necessity, to be done on a phased basis and, as I said in my introductory speech, the remaining elements of phase II of the board's development plan are now approaching completion and phase III is about to commence.  I am satisfied that this continuing development of the Legal Aid Board will enable it to meet any foreseeable demand on its services.  If circumstances change, I will examine the situation afresh and take whatever action may be appropriate while always having regard to the budgetary position applicable from time to time.</P>
    <P>In the course of her comment on the pressure under which the law centres operate, Senator McGennis referred to a person in Malahide who will be waiting 12 months before a legal separation case will be taken.  This would arise from the scheduling of court hearings, which is a matter for the courts and comes within the ambit of my colleague, the Minister for Justice.  I will refer the matter to her.</P>
    <P>Senators mentioned the recommendation of the Pringle committee on the involvement of private solicitors in the legal aid scheme.  As I said in my opening <Col N="57" /> remarks, the Bill specifically provides for this.  On taking over responsibility for the Legal Aid Board I initiated a pilot project involving the employment of solicitors in private practice. The scheme operated relatively smoothly and has contributed to the reduction in waiting lists.  I am reserving judgment on the matter for the moment as a full review of its efficiency and effectiveness is ongoing.  I take note of Senator Enright's suggestion that fees being paid to solicitors in private practice are not sufficient.  That will form part of the overall review of the matter in the Department.  I expect a report shortly.</P>
    <P>When referring to the provision in section 26 (3), whereby free legal advice may be granted to victims in cases involving rape or serious sexual assault, Senator McGennis was concerned that free legal aid be also available to the victim.  In providing for legal advice the Bill is continuing what has always been permissible in law: that a woman who has been raped or seriously assaulted may bring a lawyer with her to the court in the capacity of friend during the hearing of the trial.  The Law Reform Commission report on rape and allied offences, published in 1988, expressed serious reservations about introducing any change in the law to permit the active involvement of a victim's legal representative at the trial of an offence and adverted to possible constitutional difficulties which might arise in that regard.  In the circumstances I am sure the Senator will agree the Bill goes as far as possible in providing legal assistance to the unfortunate victims of rape or serious sexual assault.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy expressed concern that the officers of the board could refuse to grant legal aid on the merits of the case.  He can hardly be suggesting it is unreasonable for Legal Aid board solicitors to refuse to grant legal aid where the solicitor considers there is no merit in the case: I hope he is not. However, I assure the Senator that where a solicitor refuses to grant legal aid, an appeal mechanism is provided <Col N="58" /> for, under which any person refused legal aid may appeal that decision.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn spoke about a number of matters much discussed recently, such as excessive legal costs and the compensation culture, which are not directly referable to this Bill.  I will not say much about those matters as they are not within the ambit of the Bill nor in my ambit as Minister for Equality and Law Reform.  The Senator commented on the compensation culture.  That may exist, but I think we should advocate a safety culture.  If many firms, factories, supermarkets and local authorities paid more attention to the question of safety on their premises, there would be much less compensation payable and a good deal less legal costs incurred.  Unfortunately we do not hear much about safety projects being undertaken and much remains to be done in that regard.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan referred to a proposal made by FLAC that the Legal Aid Board should have a role in law reform. The Law Reform Commission was set up specifically to examine our laws and bring forward proposals for reform and it does a wide ranging and excellent job. I do not think it appropriate for the Legal Aid Board to have such a role. However when preparing proposals for reform of the law my Department consults widely with many organisations on the issues under examination from time to time.  In many cases the Legal Aid Board has an appropriate input.</P>
    <P>To quote the general observation of the Pringle committee on the objectives of the civil legal aid scheme:</P>
    <P>The fact that views differ as to the objectives of a comprehensive legal aid and advice scheme emphasises the need for flexibility and pragmatism in developing it.  There is no such thing as a ready-made blueprint for the ideal service.  Consequently the basic structures of the legislation bringing it into being have to be such that they will allow for the speedy implementation of any changes which experience may show to be necessary.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="59" /> A number of Senators asked where the legal aid service goes from here.  In response I say we have experienced a huge expansion in the service in the last two years.  A large number of additional centres have been opened at various locations throughout the country.  The numbers of staff in the law centres have more than doubled.  The type of staff taken on has radically changed; I have arranged for law clerks and solicitor's apprentices to be employed in the centres, which did not happen before. Many of the law centres are well equipped and have the ideal module for a well run solicitor's office &mdash; two to three solicitors, a law clerk, a solicitor's apprentice and support clerical staff.  In my visits to law centres, both old and new, throughout the country I was impressed with the degree of professionalism exhibited by all the staff in those centres.</P>
    <P>Something I was most anxious to achieve in this development programme was that law centres would have the most modern technology.  In the early stages computers with precedent banks were not present.  These are necessary for a modern law office and I am happy to tell the House that all the law centres now have this facility, which has increased their efficiency.  The offices are comfortable and where possible accessible, although that has not happened yet in all cases.  I have asked the Legal Aid Board to give every possible attention to ensuring the centres are made accessible where that can be done.</P>
    <P>In framing this Bill I have drawn on our experience of the operation of the scheme over the years.  I have been acutely conscious of the need for a flexible approach to the development of the service. I think Senators will agree the Bill has the flexibility to allow for the speedy implementation of any changes which may be necessary to enable the service to develop and grow.  I thank Senators for their contributions to a valuable and informed debate.  I look forward to discussing the Bill further on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann welcomes the decision of the Government to provide representation in the Seanad for Irish emigrants in line with the commitment in <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, urges that the necessary referendum be held as soon as practicable and looks forward to welcoming emigrant representatives to this House after the next general election.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I am delighted to propose this motion. The debate on voting rights for Irish emigrants has gone on for many years. The prevailing feeling is that they should be given a say in the governing of their native country.  At long last words have given way to action.  I welcome the decision of the Government to provide representation in the Seanad for Irish emigrants in line with the commitment in <i>A Government of Renewal.</i> I sincerely hope that the referendum will be held as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We look forward to welcoming the emigrant representatives to this House after the next general election.  Three directly elected Senators will give our emigrants a stronger and more effective voice in the Oireachtas.  At present the only Irish emigrants with voting rights in Seanad elections are graduates of the National University of Ireland.  It is time to give the other 3.5 million Irish emigrants in Britain and the millions of other Irish emigrants throughout the world a chance to elect their representatives to this House.  Giving emigrants seats in Seanad Éireann will establish a concrete link with the Irish abroad and, <Col N="61" /> in so doing, will establish links with a dynamic group.  These people are skilled and talented and they will make a meaningful contribution to the Oireachtas.  Giving emigrants the vote in this instance could be a great asset to this country.</P>
    <P>We realise that anybody with an Irish passport &mdash; or indeed others who might not have Irish passports &mdash; has a great feeling of belonging to the homeland. Voting rights for the election of Senators will be of no real benefit to such people but could be of enormous benefit to this country.  We can see at first hand the great progress many Irish people have made overseas.  In England, seven of the last eight Lord Mayors of Manchester had Irish connections and that is also true of the current mayor of Coventry.  Many Irish people overseas have got involved in the political process and one can imagine the enormous expertise they have gained.  They can bring this expertise to bear in the land of their forefathers if given an opportunity. They will be given this opportunity as a result of the Government proposal to allocate seats for them in Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of us not to refer to the Irish international soccer team which is mainly composed of second generation Irish people.  We see their commitment, dedication and love for this country.  Their footballing skills have been harnessed to put Ireland on the world map in football.  The same can be achieved in harnessing the vitality and commitment of the Irish in industry, culture and education in England and other countries.  They can bring their expertise to bear on our country when given the opportunity through the forthcoming Bill.</P>
    <P>The great love of the Irish for their native land is also evident on great occasions such as St. Patrick's Day when the Irish colours are carried in big parades in New York's Fifth Avenue, other American cities, the cities of Great Britain and cities throughout the world. It is obvious that there is great commitment and love for their country in the <Col N="62" /> hearts of the people who left this country, many through no fault of their own. It is time we gave recognition to this great love of Ireland and thanked these people for the way in which they have promoted our country.  They have been fine and able ambassadors for the emerald isle.</P>
    <P>When discussing votes for emigrants it would be remiss of us not to recall the words of people like Patrick Sarsfield who, on the battlefield of Landon, spoke the immortal words: &ldquo;O, that this were for Ireland&rdquo; and John F. Kennedy who, on leaving this country, said: &ldquo;I hope to be back in the springtime&rdquo;.  We remember the songs of Ireland which portray the great desire of our emigrants to return to the emerald isle &mdash; for example, &ldquo;When there are brighter days in Ireland, I'll come home and marry thee&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>We can in a meaningful way thank those people by giving them the voting rights in the Seanad which they richly deserve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Long term emigration has effectively tailed off.  We should thank God for that.  We should endeavour now to harness the talents and skills of our second generation of Irish emigrants.  Although many people left Ireland without skills or trades, they certainly were not found wanting in ensuring that their children received a full and good education thus endowing them with good skills.  The second generation of Irish emigrants can make a huge contribution to this country.  Our emigrants are our flesh and blood and must never be forgotten. The Government's decision to introduce a Bill permitting emigrant representation in the Seanad is a stepping stone to greater participation at all levels in the future.  Emigrants, many of whom have been successful in a number of fields, can now play a pivotal role in <Col N="63" /> the emerging new Ireland.  They can now bring a new dynamism, a fresh approach and provide a vital link between those at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>Other European countries have various systems for allowing emigrants to vote.  To date, this country has trailed behind our European partners and has been found wanting in many instances in the provision of voting rights for emigrants. However, the Government is going down the right road and its proposals will ensure that the three representatives will come from the ranks of the emigrants themselves.</P>
    <P>These people can then represent the emigrants and articulate their needs and desires, and ensure that there is a platform in one of the Houses of Parliament to hear their views on the problems they may be experiencing.  They can also bring to bear the expertise they have acquired outside this country to benefit the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>As the Seanad is a vocational based second Chamber, it is important that one of its functions be to give a national platform to special interest groups, as the present panel indicates.  The feeling of organised groups outside this country, including the Irish World Heritage Centre in Manchester, is that the Government has so far failed to acknowledge the huge investments made in Ireland by the Irish in Britain and which could be greatly increased if the market was stimulated and co-ordinated. They feel that the Irish in Britain must be given a say in the affairs of the Republic if they are to make a worthwhile contribution in this current economic plight.</P>
    <P>The emigrant groups feel that the Republic of Ireland is out of line with the rest of Europe on the issue of representation as every other country is giving voting rights to their emigrants. It is, therefore, my pleasure to propose the Fine Gael motion and to compliment the Fine Gael Party and the Government for responding to something which has been talked about for a <Col N="64" /> long time but on which there has been no action.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of verbiage on this issue.  The great American writer, Walt Whitman, said words are like leaves, they can be tossed in many directions. However, the words have now been replaced by action.  It is a pleasure for me to compliment the Government for its proposal.  I therefore formally propose the motion.  We all look forward to welcoming our emigrant representatives in the House after the next general election.</P>
    <P>Tá súil agam go mbeidh fáilte roimh na daoine seo nuair a thagann siad go dtí an Teach seo.  Molaim an Rialtas as ucht an éifeacht atá déanta acu.  Molaim an rún don Teach.</P>

      <P>That is true, but there is always an exception to the rule.  We wish the Minister of State the very best of luck in his task ahead.  I welcome the decision made by the Government.  As Senator McDonagh has said, it is vitally important to allow emigrants be represented in the Seanad.  As a former emigrant, I have practical experience in this area.  Sometimes it was difficult to comprehend the views expressed by politicians about the way emigrants should be represented here and ignored abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the great desire of a large number of Irish emigrants.  Irish people and Irish passport holders, who wish to participate in the elective process of this country and who wish to have a voice. It is a small step in the right direction. therefore, that the Government has introduced a proposal to allow emigrants three representatives in this <Col N="65" /> House.  This illustrates the Government's commitment.</P>
    <P>As a former Member of the Lower House, I was involved, as spokesman on youth affairs, in the debate to allow emigrants participate in the elective process. It was Fine Gael policy at the outset to allow emigrants be represented in Seanad Éireann and I am delighted the Government has brought matters a step nearer to reality in that it has introduced a policy and has a Bill coming forward.  I have no doubt therefore that many of the emigrant representatives all over the world will be very pleased with the attitude of the Government in this respect.</P>
    <P>For many years great lip service was paid to the Irish people who had no choice but to go abroad.  They found themselves in different countries and politicians paid lip service to the idea that they should and would be given representation and that their fears and desires would be listened to.</P>
    <P>However, people became extremely cynical of all talk and no action; they were getting the same message day in day out from Government representatives that they were to be given strong representation and a strong voice to express their fears and to be genuinely represented in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This did not happen and the emigrant organisations grew very cynical.  It was not a healthy development because it led many worthwhile people to expend their energies on different causes for Ireland when it might have been better had they put their views and expertise into parliamentary representation.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the Government has introduced strong and definite proposals and that, after the next Seanad election, there will be three Members representing the entire emigrant population. This is a very positive development and a small step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>Many politicians are committed to allowing Irish emigrants have voting rights at general elections.  Some European countries, the USA and Australia <Col N="66" /> allow their emigrants to participate in general and presidential elections.  The most difficult aspect of this for any Irish Government would be the logistics because we have emigrants in every corner of the world.  With a view to allowing all emigrants to participate actively in general elections, a scheme would have to be introduced which would give everybody a fair chance to cast their vote.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision made by the Government to have representatives in the next Seanad who will be able to articulate the views of emigrants.  It will also enable us, as politicians, to listen first hand to the fears which emigrant organisations worldwide will raise.  It will also, perhaps, help us achieve the objective of eventually allowing all emigrants and Irish passport holders to participate in general elections.  I congratulate the Government on a very worthwhile proposal.  I hope that the referendum will be held in the short term and that emigrant organisations will be represented in the next Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion affords us the opportunity to discuss again an issue which has been the subject of much discussion over many years.  In 1991 the late Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan moved a Bill in the Dáil dealing with this issue and there was a full debate to which Senator Reynolds contributed.  It highlighted an issue which many people felt should be dealt with by way of legislation and, if necessary, amendment of the Constitution.  However there is, as was borne out in that debate, much discussion on the best method to meet the objective of most people, that is, that the Irish abroad should continue to have an influence on political affairs here for a period after they have left.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In speaking on behalf of Fianna Fáil, I suggest that the Government should extend this motion.  In order to have a full and thorough examination of all aspects of the issue, the motion should be amended to propose an Oireachtas Joint Committee which would lease out fully how the whole issue of emigrant <Col N="67" /> representation might be dealt with.  As many Members will be aware, even the welcome decision to have Seanad representation will not be favoured by all emigrants, many of whom see this as a mere token while they seek something more substantive.</P>
    <P>In the past we have had many indications from our emigrants of issues which need our attention here and where they felt we could have been more helpful. For a short time I had ministerial responsibility for emigration and I had the welcome opportunity to meet many people in emigrant organisations in the United Kingdom and the United States. I felt that opinion was divided as to whether they sought, needed or required representation here.  There was a very strong indication that they needed more financial support from the Government for the work which they were doing for emigrants.  I found, especially in the United Kingdom, strong criticism of the lack of adequate finances for emigrant organisations. Much of their work is of a humanitarian nature dealing with emigrants' problems with the law, social welfare and so on. There were very genuine complaints about the lack of financial resources for these organisations.</P>
    <P>In recognition of this, Governments have over the past number of years increased the contributions.  I compliment the Government on the increased contribution which it gave last year to organisations working with Irish emigrants in the United Kingdom and in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia and San Francisco. The Department of Foreign Affairs and FÁS, which is also working to help place personnel overseas, are improving our communication with emigrants.</P>
    <P>I am not certain that if emigrant organisations were asked for a list of priorities, they would place representation in the Seanad as the top priority. They would feel that there was a necessity to continue to support financially the work which they are doing, to give them the benefit of advice and to improve the <Col N="68" /> advice services for young people planning to emigrate.  Many emigrants, through lack of knowledge or detailed advice on what they would face in other countries, found themselves in very difficult and intolerable situations and came home very disappointed and disillusioned.</P>
    <P>However, it is also true to say that some did very well, particularly in the United Kingdom.  I have been a personal friend for a long time of Michael O'Halloran, who left west Clare, a few miles from where I live, and was elected to the Parliament of Westminster.  He represented the constituency of Islington for many years.  He was not involved in politics here but he became involved in politics in the United Kingdom soon after his arrival there.  He played a very important role in the development of Labour Party policies in Islington and was eventually elected to the Parliament, where he made an outstanding contribution for many years.</P>
    <P>Many of the emigrants to whom I spoke a few years ago were very anxious to get involved in the political process in the country to which they had emigrated. Many young people told me that they wished to be registered to vote in the United Kingdom because it entitled them to seek mortgages and other facilities to set up homes and businesses. Although many of them would always continue to have strong ties with their families and politicians at home, quite a substantial number felt that they had a contribution to make to the political process in the United Kingdom.  As I said, Michael O'Halloran was elected to the Parliament and I am sure that many others are involved in politics there.  As a result of being connected with the building industry many of them joined the Labour Party and they made a large contribution to its development. However, they were interested in what was happening in Ireland and expressed the wish that Ireland would not forget them and would support and financially back their organisations and representative bodies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="69" /> I do not need to detail the contribution which Irish people have made to political, social and economic life in the United States.  For many years there was a great deal of controversy here surrounding the issue of visas and how the Government here might be able to help. When people came here to make representations in this House they were not seeking voting rights for seats in the Seanad but were seeking support from the Irish Government for their long running campaign to improve the situation in relation to holiday and work visas for the United States.  A valuable contribution was made by successive Ministers making contact with powerful Irish American politicians to help to remedy the situation which had been allowed to deteriorate over the years where Irish emigrants in the United States, many of whom were illegal, were at a disadvantage. Quite an amount of work was undertaken to resolve this matter, and it has been resolved to some extent.  I would like the issue of the entry visa to the United States resolved.  This has been a bone of contention for many people who had such problems even on short visits to the United States.  These issues are important.</P>
    <P>I had a quick look at the reply of the previous Minister &mdash; former Deputy Pádraig Flynn, who is now a European Commissioner &mdash; on Second Stage to the late Deputy O'Sullivan's Bill in the Dáil.  The former Minister spelled out clearly the difficulties and complexities he saw in trying to arrive at the position proposed by the Labour Party, where people would have voting rights for 15 years after they emigrated.</P>
    <P>I worked for a local authority for a long time before I was elected to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I recall that when we prepared the electoral list there was always a marked reluctance to take off the list people who had emigrated for a period.  In compiling electoral lists it would be possible to keep people on them for a period after they emigrated so that they could have an opportunity to vote in elections here.  It would not be an enormous problem to <Col N="70" /> arrange a postal vote for them.  It would be possible to keep a list of people who had emigrated for a fixed period of perhaps three or four years so that they would be entitled to vote during that time.  Many people return during that period anyway.  They abandon their visits abroad and settle in local communities here.</P>
    <P>This issue is complex and it is further complicated with regard to Seanad representation. Members will be aware that a number of people, especially graduates, have an entitlement to vote in Seanad elections and continue to use that entitlement while they are abroad. Graduates from colleges receive their voting papers and they are entitled to cast their votes by virtue of their university entitlements.  Many graduates utilise that entitlement for quite a period after they emigrate.</P>
    <P>This is an opportune time to discuss this matter, although it has been discussed before.  An all party delegation should be established to find a solution to this issue which would be acceptable to the broad body of emigrants.  It should come up with a report which would indicate precisely what action should be taken.  I thank the proposer and seconder of the motion for providing the opportunity to discuss this matter. I am sure other opportunities will arise at later date to bring the issue to an acceptable and worthwhile conclusion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome Minister of Slate, Deputy Allen, to the House.  It is ironic and fitting that the constituency represented by the Minister, Cork North Central, was also the constituency of the late Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan, who moved that Bill in the Dáil.  The Minister, Deputy Allen, worked with Gerry for many years and it would also have given him pleasure to see the Minister in the House this evening.  The Minister has been an outstanding public representative and I wish him well in his responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Gerry was researching this issue he went to London and New York. <Col N="71" /> There were diverse views from emigrants as regards what they wanted. Most wanted money and support from the place in which they lived, while some wanted votes.  I remember that when Gerry was Lord Mayor &mdash; the Minister will be familiar with this &mdash; he went to San Francisco.  As he was being feted around, escorted by motorcycle police, there was a roar from a building site: &ldquo;Hey, Gerry, boy.&rdquo;  A fellow from Blackpool was up on the scaffold.  Gerry met emigrants all over the place in that type of situation.</P>
    <P>The principle of giving votes to emigrants is fairly well accepted, but the methodology and the mechanisms whereby this can be done fairly are not accepted as yet.  With reference to the point made by my colleague, Senator McDonagh, very strange people got Irish passports.  Colonel Ollie North comes to mind immediately.  I am sure there are people in some countries around the world who are in possession of Irish passports purchased in London, courtesy of an official in the Irish Embassy, if one remembers.  The American Government was probably manufacturing them also at the time, because everybody aboard a particular jet sent by the American Government to Iran was in possession of an Irish passport. We must be very careful in defining who will benefit from the extension of this franchise.</P>
    <P>The point made by Senator Daly is valid.  The issue deserves a debate and every attempt to try to secure cross party support for it.  It should not be a divisive measure and I would welcome the Government taking the Fianna Fáil suggestion on board.  It should at least be subject to scrutiny by an all party committee on the basis that it is not delayed.  We are almost agreed on this measure and I do not think it is the intention of Fianna Fáil to try to extend the time.  However, it deserves mature consideration in order to get it right.</P>
    <P>I see that the Minister, Deputy Howlin, has come into the House.  We ought to be amenable to having this matter <Col N="72" /> discussed across party bounds in whatever fora the Minister considers relevant, provided that the time element is not unduly delayed.  After all, it must the subject of a referendum and, as the House is aware, referenda on a number of issues are pending this year.  The principle is well established, but I derive some amusement from the vision of the Clerk of the Seanad, Ms Lane, waiting for the Australian, Brazilian or American votes before she puts people out of their misery in relation to the next Seanad election.  It will be interesting to see the reaction.</P>
    <P>My party has been committed to this move for a long time.  In many ways it is a salute to the late Gerry O'Sullivan that we have come this far.  The Fine Gael motion is welcome, but it is also fair to acknowledge that the last Government felt precisely the same in relation to the whole issue.  To some extent there is cross party agreement.  I hope that Minister Howlin will be in a position to ensure that the voices of those abroad, in countries such as those mentioned by Senator McDonagh, will be represented in the House.  This would be to our benefit and to their benefit.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Seanad for taking the time to debate the Government's proposal to provide three seats in the Seanad for representatives of our emigrants spread throughout the world. It is fitting that the first Oireachtas debate on the proposal should take place in the Upper House, where emigrants will, hopefully, in the next Oireachtas, be represented.  I hope that the first formal step in this matter, the introduction of a Bill to amend the Constitution, will not be long delayed.  It is a constitutional requirement that a Bill to amend the Constitution must be initiated in the Dáil, but the Seanad can still expect to have the opportunity of dealing with the Bill within a few months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Proposals to provide a voice for our emigrants in Irish public affairs have <Col N="73" /> been, as Senators said, in the public domain and discussed for many years. The momentum has built up in recent years, with commitments in the agreed programmes of the last two Governments to &ldquo;examine&rdquo; various aspects of this issue.</P>
    <P>When in Opposition, my own party and Fine Gael separately presented Bills to extend voting rights to emigrants and I know that other voices have also been raised in support of this issue.  The present Government have brought the matter to a head with a specific undertaking, negotiated in the Programme for Government, to provide for the election of three Members of Seanad Éireann by Irish emigrants.</P>
    <P>The case for giving Irish emigrants an effective voice in the running of our national affairs is, to my mind, irrefutable. Our history, the numbers of people who have left this country over the years to live abroad, the close links which we retain with our relations overseas, all these factors all emphasise the need for formal recognition of the interest of emigrants and the contribution they can make to the nation.  The Irish nation does not end on the shores of the island of Ireland and all of us who have had the privilege of meeting groups of Irishmen and women on every continent know that the pride they exude for this country makes them a full and wholesome part of the Irish nation. The question now is not whether emigrants should be given a voice in Irish affairs but rather how this can best be arranged and built into our constitutional and electoral systems.</P>
    <P>There is divided opinion in the Oireachtas and in the country generally on the most appropriate way of providing representation for emigrants.  Since this matter was formally raised some years ago, there has been much soul searching among all parties represented in the Oireachtas.  I think it is fair to say that views on every side have matured significantly.  The Government's proposal to provide representation in the Seanad may not be everybody's first choice but I believe most people will <Col N="74" /> find it acceptable.  That is the very essence of politics &mdash; developing solutions which are practical, realistic and acceptable, and in the context of the other affairs of this day I think that particular sentence is apt.</P>
    <P>The Seanad is a special place, designed to provide a forum for alternative viewpoints and vocational interests which might not win majority support at the polls in the hurly-burly of a Dáil general election campaign.  It is a place where debate can be more reflective and representative of a wider range of views than can sometimes be represented and evident in the Lower House.  I think the Seanad is the ideal forum for emigrant representatives to present their views, initially at any rate. Emigrants are not immediately affected by all of the decisions taken by the institutions of this State on the issues of the day.  Nonetheless, they have a broad knowledge of those issues, backed by experience in other countries which can give them a unique perspective on the problems that face us, the Irish people. The Seanad will be enriched by the three emigrant representatives and the advent of these elected Members will bring the House more in line with the representative role initially envisaged for this House under the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I hasten to add that the new Members will not be here solely to address emigrant issues or to articulate a purely emigrant viewpoint.  They will participate fully in the work of the Seanad, contributing to the consideration of all legislation and other business that comes routinely before this House. They will have the right to initiate legislation and, under the Constitution, would be eligible for appointment as Ministers of the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Some weeks ago, the undertaking in the Government's policy agreement on <Col N="75" /> emigrant representation was transformed into a formal Government decision to have the necessary Constitution amendment Bill drafted.  The Attorney General's Office is now drafting this Bill which will have to be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas before being put to the people by way of referendum. The emigrant seats will not be additional seats but will be taken from the 11 seats which it is the Taoiseach's prerogative to fill under existing constitutional provisions.</P>
    <P>The aim is to hold the referendum on this subject, together with the referendum on divorce and possibly other matters, on the same day later this year. This is clearly an ambitious target but I believe we must press ahead with speed and determination if we are to make real progress on this issue after so many years of talking.</P>
    <P>As well as drafting the necessary Constitution amendment Bill, work is proceeding on detailed proposals for legislation to govern voting by emigrants at Seanad elections.  I have given a commitment to publish these proposals well in advance of the referendum so that the people will know what precisely they are voting for.  The proposals in the implementing legislation will cover such matters as entitlement to vote, registration of electors and the conduct of the elections.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that drawing up a scheme for emigrant voting is throwing up many thorny issues.  For example, should voting rights be extended to all Irish citizens abroad or be confined to citizens abroad who lived in this country for a specified minimum period?  Should the extension of voting rights be open-ended?  Should there be a cut-off point related to duration of absence from Ireland?  If there is to be a cut-off point, at what level should it be set?  How should we deal with the position of graduate emigrants, who already have the right to vote at Seanad university elections?  I am, of course, well aware that there is a separate question outstanding in relation to university <Col N="76" /> elections and I am aware and conscious of the view expressed in this House last November that the Seanad vote should be extended to all third level graduates.</P>
    <P>Questions are asked: should an annual register of emigrant voters be prepared or should a special register be drawn up when an election is called? What qualifications should be required of candidates and what method of nomination should be provided for?  What type of voting arrangements should be put in place to meet the reasonable requirements of electors while, at the same time, providing the safeguards which are essential to the secrecy and integrity of the ballot?</P>
    <P>It is my intention to consult emigrant representative bodies before finalising my proposals on these issues, but I am also particularly anxious to have the recommendations of this House, and of individual Senators, heard on these difficult questions.  There is an onus on me to reach early conclusions in order to facilitate the drawing up of the necessary detailed scheme for emigrant voting and so that these details will be available in good time for the proposed referendum.  Hence, this debate is a timely one.</P>
    <P>Answering questions in the other House, I have said that I would be willing to go before a committee of the Oireachtas to hear views before finalising the specific proposals on the questions I have already enumerated and others which will no doubt arise and occur to Members here.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, there are differing views on how emigrants should be given representation in Irish public affairs. The late Gerry O'Sullivan, a member of my own party referred to by Senator Magner earlier, presented a Bill in 1991 proposing that emigrants of up to 15 years standing would have the right to vote at all elections, other than local elections.  Emigrant representative groups have been campaigning for voting rights at presidential, Dáil and European elections.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, it must be acknowledged that certain reservations <Col N="77" /> still persist in relation to the concept of Oireachtas representation for emigrants. We would be foolish to disregard these reservations.  We must move with care to seek to construct a broadly based consensus.</P>
    <P>I believe that this Governments' commitment to allocate Seanad seats to emigrants is a significant step forward.  It is a real breakthrough because, for the first time, a Government in office is firmly committed to a specific measure of emigrant representation.  I intend to deliver on this commitment during my term as Minister for the Environment.  It is my belief that experience of emigrant representation in the Seanad will allay whatever fears and reservations may exist, and could well pave the way for wider and more extensive representation in the future, and that I certainly will undertake as a tribute and in memory of our dear friend and colleague, the late Gerry O'Sullivan.</P>
    <P>For now let us do what is practicable and broadly acceptable.  As for the future, I think it was the late Mr. Samuel Goldwyn who declined to prophesy about anything, particularly the future.  In considering the shape of emigrant representation in perhaps say five or ten years' time I find myself in sympathy with Mr. Goldwyn's position. All I will do is echo the words of the Tánaiste in relation to ex-Deputy G. O'Sullivan's Bill in 1991: the question of votes for emigrants will not go away.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by saying that, as a former Member of this House, I am particularly pleased to have the task of giving emigrants, for the first time, a formal and influential say in Irish public affairs. This is being done in a way which will enhance the role of Seanad Éireann as a forum for ventilating alternative and individual viewpoints on the many problems that will face us as a nation in the years to come.</P>

      <P>Fearaim fáilte roimh an Aire agus tá súil agam go bhfeicfimid go minic é sa Teach seo sna blianta atá romhainn &mdash; mar Aire, ar ndóigh, agus ní mar Sheanadóir.  I welcome the Minister <Col N="78" /> and his speech, especially as I will be totally parasitic on it.  I will follow its structure in the hope of lending some coherence to my remarks.</P>
      <P>I welcome this proposal; it is long overdue.  Although there will inevitably be criticism or nitpicking with any details entered into, it is important that the first step be taken.  As the Minister rightly says, one can learn from experience. It will be a learning process, possibly a protracted one, but educative for all concerned.</P>
      <P>I also agree with the Minister referring to the Seanad as being initially the proper place for emigrant representation because of the uncertainties attaching to the implications of representation. Much though I value them, we need to move carefully in assessing their influence on our way of conducting business in this House.  Although emigrants are not immediately affected by all the decisions taken by the institutions of the State on the issues of the day, nevertheless they have a broad knowledge of those issues.  I suspect a fair number of emigrants &mdash; the question is, of course, which ones &mdash; do have a good knowledge of activities in this country and of the implications of a number of policies pursued.  Some of the emigrants I have met could often out talk and out think many of those in Ireland on issues currently under discussion in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also must keep in mind &mdash; it is a major reason for having emigrant representation &mdash; that very little permanent emigration from this country is voluntary. The bulk of our emigrants left historically, and still leave, because there are simply no jobs here for them.  They are to some extent a product of the failure of successive Governments in this State, in so far as Governments are responsible, to create sufficient job opportunities or foster sufficient openings to retain the majority of emigrants at home.  There will always be emigrants who will of course go for other purposes and that in itself is probably desirable. However, whether they are graduates or less fortunate people, I am convinced <Col N="79" /> that they are emigrating because they cannot find the jobs to keep them here.</P>
    <P>A number also emigrate, although I am not sure of the amount, with the intention of returning home in due course if jobs become available here.  It was offered a few years ago &mdash; I will not cite the prominent public figure &mdash; in a prominent public speech in New York which contained a classic <i>bon mot</i> or whatever the opposite of that is, on emigration. He said that the bulk of these emigrants were going abroad in order to return and that in due course they would immeasurably enrich the economy, as well as themselves, society, culture and heritage etc..  If in fact the majority of emigrants were able to return, that would be a cause for rejoicing for most of us; but the majority are not able to return.</P>
    <P>Since the late 18th century, only one decade in the history of this country was a net immigrant decade &mdash; that was the 1970s.  Since then we have been a net emigrant country.  One hopes that these emigrants will return.  One would like to encourage them to return, maintain contact with them and encourage them to maintain contact with Ireland for at least some time after they go abroad. Naturally, the time will come when many who hoped to return will find themselves so rooted in their new societies that they will not come back. That psychological rubicon will be crossed somewhere along the line when they are so successful abroad, that one hopes there will be no remaining inducement for them to return.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, many emigrants, for at least some time after emigrating, do try to retain some interest in Ireland.  They are now able to return much more frequently than was historically the case. There is a fairly regular periodic return which allows them to keep in touch to some extent with at least the gripes of their families and friends at home.  In relation to the emigrants who would be the most likely to be enfranchised &mdash; the Minister asks whether those abroad for up to five or ten years or longer should <Col N="80" /> be included &mdash; a case could be made for a shorter rather than longer period.  The emphasis would be put on those who are able to remain in regular contact with Ireland &mdash; many of whom would have done this.  However, I would not be dogmatic about whether the time period should be five or ten years; 20 years is a little on the long side.  I hope that we will not be appealing to an utterly ignorant electorate entirely out of touch with Irish affairs.  I am sure there are a fair number of voters who have not emigrated whose range of encyclopaedic knowledge on Irish affairs is finite.</P>
    <P>In many respects we are turning to emigrants, whether of shorter or longer standing, and expecting them to use their political influence abroad on our behalf.  We are engaged in education and fund raising activities which appeal directly to the susceptibilities and sensitivities of graduates, fortunate or unfortunate, as the case may be.  Many a university official is dining for Ireland on far flung dining tables in the interests of raising funds from successful graduates. I see no reason why our sole instinct in contacting these people should be for what we can get out of them without thinking of offering them at least some representation, even if initially it is only a relatively nominal representation, in our affairs.  The Minister mentioned the case of graduates among electors.  Some of them would be voting in the Seanad University elections.  In my admittedly limited and somewhat disorganised experience, at least the last time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;many emigrants would have liked to have been in closer contact but did not have, or were aware of, convenient mechanisms for remaining in regular contact.  More vote abroad than are registered as being abroad because many of the electorate registered at Irish addresses would have emigrated. I do not know the implications for dual mandates or double voting.  I <Col N="81" /> presume that graduates who are Members of the Oireachtas and members of local authorities will have dual mandates for elections to this House under various headings.  There is not necessarily an issue of principle involved, although there may be one of practice if one wishes to address it.  I have no personal views on the matter, but it would not be creating a precedent.</P>
      <P>It seems therefore there is a good case for seeking emigrant representation. If the right people were to be elected, I have no doubt they could enrich discussion in this House &mdash; we all agree that this is already of a high standard &mdash; and bring a wider range of perspectives to bear on our activities.  There is a good deal to be said, although it can be overdone, for all of us thinking more constructively about the emigrant community and the Irish community at home and abroad.  I do not want to go overboard on that because there can be a degree of rhetorical sentimentality attaching to it.  However, in the wider, more open world now emerging, where there is such an emphasis on openness and where international contacts are valued, we should be doing our best to establish, sustain and nurture contacts with the emigrant community, however that can be effectively organised in the short to medium term.  For those reasons and for moving our frequently expressed solicitude for our emigrants from the wholly rhetorical&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister made this announcement, with his excellent sense of timing &mdash; just as the President was about to discuss the issue of the Irish diaspora &mdash; I was struck by the novelty of the idea.  Seanad Éireann has been at the receiving end of people both going into the other House and coming out of it.  As far as I know, it has not yet received people who are either going in or coming out of the country.  It struck me as a novel idea which is certainly worth exploring.  I say that in no patronising way.  I say it because both the Minister and the last contributor are beginning to realise that there is a real practical problem in a small country with a relatively small electorate and a highly competitive electoral system in electing Members to the other House from the emigrant community.</P>
      <P>There is also a problem in electing people directly to this House in that Members are not directly elected to this House and we seem by this proposition to be effectively changing that.  There was a debate on the nature of the electoral system that should be used in this House.  We have what is reasonably regarded as one of the most complex, competitive, downright murderous electoral systems for those of us who do not have the joy of coming through the University panels, that is, those of us who come in through the real electorate as opposed to those who come in via the spoiled electorate; so there are practical considerations here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not at all opposed to the idea of emigrant votes.  It is a practical way of recognising beyond rhetoric our linkages with those people who have by and large been forced out of this country. However, I was struck, looking back over the last time this issue was debated, at the sheer scale of it.  A point was made by the former Deputy Flynn in the debates in the other House on 5 March 1991, column 2402, where he actually put a measure on the size of the issue.  I was doing some research to find out exactly how many people were involved here.  Deputy Flynn mentioned that the Central Statistics Office estimate <Col N="83" /> that net emigration between 1981 and 1991, which were not peak emigration years, was in excess of 166,000 people.  The population and labour force projections also published by the Central Statistics Office suggested that the net annual emigration up to 1996 would be somewhere between 15,000 and 30,000.  In fact, as we all know, tragically it is now heading towards the upper figure.  He went on and did some calculations on the basis of the 15 year cut off point, which was the point being discussed at that stage &mdash; as Senator Lee has mentioned, clearly there would have to be some cut off in time &mdash; suggesting that, on the basis of those statistics alone, over a 15 year period there would be of the order of a quarter of a million people out there to be enfranchised under whatever operation we brought in to resolve this issue of emigrant votes.</P>
    <P>He then raised an extraordinary statistic where, in addition to this quarter of a million, he went on to cite the fact that the British census of 1981 showed that persons born in this State and resident in Great Britain at the time totalled in excess of 600,000.  Therefore there are very real and practical problems and it would be sensible to tread very carefully if we are going down the avenue of emigrant votes.  It is not politically correct to suggest that this is the case, but it is the case.  The argument has always been that there should be no taxation without representation.  It is not unreasonable to suggest equally that there should be no representation without taxation.</P>
    <P>I accept the point that the great bulk of our emigrants are people who have been forced out of this country by circumstances; so one practical problem I see in going down this route at all is who we are going to register and how we are going to register them.  The second problem I see is that I am not sure where exactly the three Senators who are to be selected will come from.  I suggest to the Minister that he could have a look either among the Taoiseach's 11 or, alternatively, among the university <Col N="84" /> six.  We know that the representation from the universities was put into the Seanad electoral system for very specific reasons.  There was a particular need to give representation to Trinity College and there was a feeling that there should be a coequal representation from the National University of Ireland.  I am not sure whether that special vote makes any sense at all and I am not sure if out of that 17&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I can attest that certainly in parts of Greystones the Senator is very popular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I am making is that this proposal finally brings to our attention the fact that there are a whole series of practical problems that we have to resolve.  Senator Lee has said, and rightly so, that it is a time to stop the rhetoric, debate and discussion and make the decision.  The Minister's pronouncement has brought us even closer to the brink on this one.  That fact might settle minds and we might get away from rhetoric and into reality.  A proposition has been made from this side of the House that we hope the Minister will take up &mdash; in fact I know that the Minister is probably disposed to it &mdash; that there should be an all party committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas to look into this issue.  Obviously, the <Col N="85" /> Senators are paying rather more attention to this issue than Members of the other House at this moment.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that if we are going to go down the route of emigrant votes for either House of the Oireachtas, it would be a good idea to start in the Seanad and see what exactly the technical difficulties are in taking it up.  We on this side of the House are not interested in mere tokenism; we are interested in real representation for emigrants.</P>
    <P>I received a letter during the week which I meant to read into the record but which I forgot to bring into the House.  It was from an Irish person resident in Birmingham and, oddly enough, not living in my constituency but in the Minister's own.  This writer was very pleased with the announcement that there were going to be votes for the Seanad.  It flattered me no end that a person living in Birmingham should think that the Seanad somehow or other is the centre of political power in this country because the point they were making is that it would give emigrants a very real opportunity to participate in the evolution of policies.  I do not think that that is what it will do.  It is not a mere token either, however.  It will help to bring us closer to the emigrant communities and from that point of view it is an experiment worth undertaking.</P>
    <P>Before we finally commit ourselves to it I ask the Minister to take on board the proposition which has been made from this side of the House that there should be an all party committee to sit, not interminably on the issue, but for a very short time and to advise on the technical issues and the practicalities of what the Minister is proposing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister here this evening.  I do not see anything of particular value in the motion.  It is aspirational.  There is not a lot in it that one could object to, or maybe there is, but it is probably a measure of the Government's reluctance to get into areas where it might find itself in direct confrontation and have to test its minority <Col N="86" /> on the floor of the House.  I do not have any objections to emigrants being represented in this House, but I believe that the proposal is really nothing more than a sop to them and that it does not really go far enough.  If somebody is a citizen of the country, even should they reside in Australia or Hong Kong, they have a right to vote in the universal franchise when we all go to the polling stations in a general election.</P>
      <P>I do not see what the difficulty about this is in a modern society with modern telecommunications.  We were all very taken by the fact that when South Africa went to the polls, people from South Africa could go to the poll in Dublin to register their vote.  That is how I believe we should proceed.  This measure is a halfway house; it may be acceptable as a halfway house, but I do not think it goes far enough.</P>
      <P>I am prepared to concede that the Minister has discussed some of those issues in his address and has asked us for our views on them.  The Government should go the whole hog.  Irish citizens living overseas should have the right to vote in Dáil elections.  The reluctance to take that on board has been partially due to political fear of the influence those people might have in particular constituencies or over a range of constituencies. If it is possible for people to vote in Seanad elections &mdash; the Minister referred to how this might be undertaken &mdash; it is possible for them to vote in Dáil elections.  There are plenty of precedents.  Americans, South Africans and others living here have been able to vote in their own elections in our country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe the proposal has been well thought out, and that has been confirmed in the course of the debate.  I did not hear anything specific from the proposer and seconder of the motion about what exactly is proposed, how the system will operate and its potential difficulties. I have the feeling that we are seeing nothing more than an effort to get the so called monkey of the emigrant vote off the back of the Government. Nothing more or less than this is <Col N="87" /> being presented to us.  The Minister has posed questions but we are short on specifics.</P>
    <P>We are told that a Bill will be introduced. Given the lifetime of the Government, even if it is to run its full term, one would have to question whether we can look forward to welcoming emigrant representatives to this House after the next general election given the speed with which legislation comes to and is disposed of in the House.  Platitudes about looking forward to welcoming emigrants after the next general election are not good enough.  We must ask how they will vote and how they will attend Seanad Éireann.  There is the very practical difficulty of how people who might be elected from the emigrant community rather than just by it would sit in the House and how arrangements would be made to ensure they could participate on a regular basis in the debates of the House.</P>
    <P>We can all go through the ritual of cherishing Irish emigrants and saying what wonderful people they are, which is true, but it does not do anything to address their problems.  We have a responsibility as a country which has exported so many people to ensure that they have a right to participate in the life of this country and to identify with it.  This can most effectively be done, not through the allocation of a mere three seats in Seanad Éireann, laudable as that might be, but through the operation of the ultimate right which every citizen has, which is to vote in a Dáil election.</P>
    <P>How might absentees participate fully?  Perhaps we might have Dr. Tony O'Reilly here as a Senator representing the emigrant vote, or perhaps he is a resident, I do not know.  The Minister for Finance can probably tell us more accurately what is his status, whether he is an emigrant or an Irish tax resident.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>This brings us to the point of representation without taxation which was the origin of the American War of Independence.  I do not see it as being relevant that an emigrant should have to pay tax to his or her country of origin to be represented in its parliament. This is a spurious argument to which I do not subscribe.</P>
      <P>The question arises as to who should vote.  Obviously it should be Irish citizens. I would be liberal on the time scale I would impose on them in terms of their absence from the country.  I would take the view that if they are Irish citizens and are resident abroad, it does not matter how long they are out of the country.  Their citizenship should confer on them the right to vote.</P>
      <P>What we have this evening is extremely short on specifics.  We await the Bill with interest to see what is in it. Anything we can do to avoid platitudes and get down to specifics would be merited. Possibly the idea is to placate an electorate by putting them in a situation in which it can have very little effect. The maximum effect could be a direct vote in general elections.  I accept there are difficulties about what constituencies to which emigrants might be allocated or from which they might originate but this can be overcome.  The primary principle involved is that citizenship confers on citizens the right to vote for the Lower House of Parliament.</P>
      <P>The question arises as to whether we can have legislation within the available time scale.  I do not accuse the Government of being cynical in its intent but I wonder whether the necessary legislation will be in force in time to allow emigrants to be represented in this House after the next general election. Perhaps some of them prefer to forget Irish politics because they were forced to leave the country rather than wish to participate but at least let us try it out and if they wish to participate they will be very welcome in this House, as they would be in the other.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister and the debate on this motion.  It is a sad day that we have to discuss a motion on emigrants.  I wonder how many other countries had to sit in their Houses of Parliament discussing the rights of their emigrants to vote.  It is a sad reflection on our country that we have to do so.</P>
      <P>I was an emigrant in the United States for over ten years.  There are active groups involved there who are very interested in the future development of this country and have been involved in programmes of development here.  Most emigrants I have met from different sections of the community in the many parts of the world have the good of this country at heart.</P>
      <P>The proposed Bill will be very difficult to implement.  It will be interesting to see how the Government will attempt to do this.  I welcome the fact that the three Seanad seats for emigrants will be taken from the Taoiseach's 11 nominees. This point has been clarified.  How we put such a voting apparatus into place is a different kettle of fish.</P>
      <P>I come from a family of 14 and 12 of us were forced to emigrate.  The Minister asks whether there should be a cut-off point related to the length of time people have left the country whether this should be ten, 15 or 20 years.  I left when I was 16 years old and if the cut-off period was 15 years and I was still an emigrant I would be entitled to vote.</P>
      <P>Most of the people who emigrated to the United States when I did took out American citizenship but they are also citizens of Ireland.  They hold Irish passports for which they pay £45.  I know others who have Irish passports and paid enormous sums for them.  They do not have seed or breed of anyone belonging to them in this country and they live abroad.  The grandson of an Irish citizen is legally entitled to apply for an Irish passport provided he can prove his grandfather or grandmother was born here.  He can go to the Passport Office in Molesworth Street with the proper documentation and obtain a passport for £45.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="90" /> Who will be entitled to vote in Seanad elections?  As chairman of my party's emigration reform movement I was involved in setting up the emigration reform movement in the United States and getting various people involved, including the Catholic charities, the Irish consuls and the Taoiseach of the day, Charles Haughey.  A contribution of £250,000 was even made available in one budget to set up a Washington lobby group to help illegal Irish emigrants to obtain legal status.</P>
    <P>I have worked with those people in the United States but that is only one section of the Irish community.  Another large section of our people lives in the United Kingdom but where does that begin, with their children or grandchildren? This is not an easy issue but I look forward to this legislation being introduced to the House.</P>

    <P>The Minister said he would like to get opinions from both sides of the House and I appreciate that because guidelines will have to be drawn up.  This is a move in the right direction because emigrant representatives would have a lot to offer this country.  I complimented the late Gerry O'Sullivan for introducing his Bill in 1991 but if he was sitting here now I might not be in agreement with the Bill <Col N="91" /> he proposed to introduce at that time. However, once the framework is there we can work on it and table amendments.</P>
    <P>It is high time emigrants had a voice in this House and it would be nice to think that whoever is elected to represent the emigrants would have to reside here.  With regard to the United States, I speak from experience.  The Irish who went there as young people attained high positions all over the US. They made their mark and influenced many people, through the Irish-American partnership fund and other ventures, to invest money here.  The representation should come from that area and could work through the Irish groups and associations already in place.</P>
    <P>The Irish consulates must be complimented because their doors are always open to any emigrants with problems.  It would be great to have a public representative for these people as well.  I look forward to the Bill being introduced to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I support the Government's position on this proposal even though it is a difficult one.  The easy decision to have three Senators representing Irish communities abroad has been taken. They will not be additional seats but will come from the Taoiseach's 11 nominees. I notice from the Minister's speech that he has not yet come to a conclusion on the mechanics of holding an election. While everybody's view will be important the easy decision would be for the Taoiseach to nominate three people and if I were taking the decision I might come to that conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, at this early stage I cannot conceive how it will be possible to have a fair system of election when you are trying to take in all the Irish people abroad.  There will be huge communication problems as Senator Kiely mentioned. You find Irish people in the <Col N="92" /> strangest locations.  How do you reach the one Irish person in a population of ten million?  Huge problems will be involved in devising a system which is both fair and free, and the Minister will have to deliberate on these.</P>
    <P>There is broad agreement that we should have representation for all sorts of good reasons but we can also point to the pitfalls.  Some people say that those who do not have a stake in the country &mdash; and who would be able to change decisions in a tight situation affecting the lives of everybody, but not their own &mdash; should not be allowed to vote.  I suppose there are arguments for and against that viewpoint.</P>
    <P>It is compassionate to allow Irish communities abroad to have representation here, and those who have emigrated would tell you about their feeling of loss.  The support that we have, like an aunt and uncle down the road, the extended family, does not exist for emigrants and they are very isolated.  If one of our children gets sick we can call on relatives for support but the emigrant cannot do that.</P>
    <P>We have a sense of compassion for our people who live abroad and if we give them representation here, it would give them a feeling of belonging.  Our future discussions would be enriched by their views and there would be a cross-fertilisation of ideas.  From my own contacts with Irish people abroad I know that many are actively involved and totally assimilated in their communities where they are highly respected.  Their views would enrich the proceedings of the House and would introduce new ideas from which we would benefit.  I support the legislation to give emigrants a feeling of belonging as well as giving us the benefit of their differing views.</P>
    <P>The difficulty arises in forming their constituency.  Are we going to divide the world into three constituencies with some system of nomination within each?  The unwieldly nature of that is beyond my power of understanding. <Col N="93" /> How can you organise it so that everybody in such a constituency who wants to vote can do so?  How do you supply everybody with the information and knowledge they require?  We do not have a register at this time.  Is it possible to create such a register?  Would the cost be enormous?  When one is dealing with such matters it might be wise to steer clear of mundane issues such as the cost, but it is a factor.  It might be better to leave that aside and say this should be done because it is a good thing and fire ahead on that basis.</P>
    <P>In many parts of the world the Irish people are organised in associations by county or country.  Such associations are called the Irish Association, the Cavan Association, the Monaghan Association and so on and I visited many of them. However, in other parts of the world they are not organised in that way. What one might consider to be a good way of handling this situation in Great Britain and parts of America would not suit other parts of the world.  We therefore have an amount of thinking to do on the difficulties involved in putting this into operation.  The decision we make or consensus we reach after much deliberation and discussion of the pros and cons will be worthwhile.  I look forward to further ideas from the Minister's office.  No doubt they are continuing to look at the difficulties involved.  I also look forward to further discussions here.  Many of us have not given much thought to this yet and would welcome the opportunity of further discussion. This proposal will be good for us and for the identity of Irish people across the world and we will benefit from it. For those reasons I support the Government's position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  Like most of the Senators who have spoken, I broadly welcome the Bill.  I definitely welcome the idea of giving emigrants a voice in how this country is run.  However, like Senator <Col N="94" /> Cotter, I believe the logistics of this will be extraordinarily difficult.</P>
      <P>People mention that citizens of other countries who live abroad have voting rights.  It is important to remember that the proportion of Americans living abroad is tiny when compared with the whole American population.  In our case there are five million people on this island while there are 72 million people with Irish passports living abroad.  Some of these people may never have lived in Ireland and may only have taken up citizenship through the right of ancestry. Others of course may have acquired passports through business investments here.  The huge number of citizens abroad who will be entitled to vote as compared with those at home is an enormous consideration.  The Minister is therefore wise not to give the voting rights in Dáil elections.  A concerted group of emigrants in a large city abroad could have a huge influence on one constituency.  It was wiser to select the Seanad.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, I already gave away three of the Taoiseach's 11 seats to the other University graduates and am about to give away another three.  Considering the stability of the Government and the great assistance they are being given by the Independent Senators.  I have no doubt that in the next two and a half years they will have no trouble and we will have thought of a means of dealing with this in the meantime. However, the Minister has asked for some comments to facilitate drawing up the necessary detailed scheme for emigrant voting in good time for the referendum which, after all, is to take place in the summer and I will try to put forward a few comments which I think would be useful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we are holding the referendum to cover Seanad seats, which will be difficult to organise, would the Minister consider extending the right to vote to presidential elections and referenda? Concerted groups of voters in one area <Col N="95" /> could not have a great influence on the whole but it would at least give people an emotional tie to the country which I agree, in general they have had to leave against their volition.  When I talk to emigrants about votes it often seems that they want to improve us rather than have us do anything for them.  They might believe they have a chance to improve us by participating in referenda.</P>
    <P>I am anxious about the organisation of where the voting will take place, not to mind registers.  The Minister can get advice on the registers from the universities. Compiling and updating these registers is a nightmare.  The University of Dublin register is more up to date because it involves a smaller number.  It is about 80 per cent correct and a tremendous amount of work has been put into it.  However, the National University of Ireland register is only 50 to 60 per cent correct.  This is not because people are unwilling to register to vote but rather because they forget to give notification of a change of address or leave forwarding addresses with people who fail to send on post.</P>
    <P>I realise that the constituencies have not been delineated.  If there is one constituency for America, one for Great Britain and one for the rest of the world, it will be extremely difficult for any candidate to cover these constituencies.  For a start, who will pay for their campaign? I say that with some feeling, having had to pay for a campaign myself.  I assure Senator Roche that the university seat campaigns are not to be underestimated, especially when there are 16 in the field.  I am glad to say that Senator Norris and I came through very satisfactorily on the last occasion and I am sure we will also do so the next time.</P>
    <P>Those are enormous difficulties for candidates.  Some of the most worthwhile candidates will be unable to put up the money to run a decent campaign. These seats could then be taken over by <Col N="96" /> the political parties as they are best able to organise a campaign to win the seat. If these Senators are party political, their value will be lost.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that those elected will represent the best organised emigrants.  We talk about the plight of our emigrants and how we want to help them, but those elected will not be in a position to help the homeless. The Irish figure for homelessness in, for example, the major cities in England is higher than most other nationalities.  They will not be able to help those who have a sense of failure and believe they cannot come back to Ireland, because unless one is a success as an emigrant it is impossible to come back.</P>
    <P>As Senator Cotter pointed out, they will have the additional problem of attendance.  If they live here they will not really be representing their constituency. It is possible to commute from England or the Continent and it is just about possible to consider commuting from New York.</P>
    <P>A colleague of mine who was in the Royal College of Surgeons represents Vancouver Central in the Ottawa Parliament and is second in command in the Department of Health.  She spends a considerable amount of time on planes between Vancouver and Ottawa as well as having to go out on ministerial duty. She has spoken to me about how little time she gets to spend with her constituents. This could be a problem for anyone attending from further abroad than New York.</P>
    <P>It would be worthwhile to have our emigrants' views, but I wonder if the logistics of this can be organised fairly before the next general election even allowing for the stability of the Government. I am aware of the work that goes into the compilation of the registers for the two university constituencies and I suggest that the Department talks to them to get advice on this.  It is not like the American elections where a smaller <Col N="97" /> number of people are abroad than are voting in America.  We could have more people voting abroad than in Ireland, so this is a serious situation.  It would be foolish to rush into a decision about how to elect these people.  I would prefer if permission was given to hold a referendum and if further thought and effort was given to how the election will take place.  Perhaps we should consider delaying it until a future election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to take part in this debate, which I welcome.  Some of my colleagues, particularly Senator O'Toole, claimed to be the first person to suggest this.  I thought I was the first person to suggest this during a debate which took place in the Seanad about six or seven years ago in Private Members' Time.  Senator Ross tabled a motion on the reform of the Seanad and that was one of the ideas mentioned, although I do not think it was original at that time.  As the Minister said in his speech, this idea has been around for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was in Australia approximately two years ago and I was canvassed quite actively by people from Glór na nDeoraí.  I trotted out this idea of representation in the Seanad and pointed out that I had recommended it during this debate.  I thought they would be foaming at the mouth with gratitude, but they disdained it; they thought it was an inadequate response.  It is worthwhile to place on the record of the House the fact that not all emigrant groups would regard this as a completely satisfactory answer; they would probably regard it as a first stage.  They would be looking for something more vigorous and in the Lower House, which they regard as the focus of real political action.  They see us as a more reflective and considered House of amendment and encouragement to the Government in its policy rather than as the initiators <Col N="98" /> of policy.  The emigrants will look for something in what they perceive, rightly or wrongly, as a more key area.</P>
    <P>Analogies have been drawn with the university seats and, as the Minister knows, I am an advocate of this and I regard it as the most democratic element in this House.  Estimates of the numbers of graduates from the University of Dublin living abroad have been greatly exaggerated.  The House should be aware of the fact that &mdash; my colleague, Senator Henry, will probably back me up on this &mdash; approximately 50 or 60 per cent now live in the greater Dublin area, mostly on the north side.</P>
    <P>I was challenged earlier by Senator Roche, who said he would love to see me pounding the beat.  I did pound the beat because a couple of elections ago I worked out the demography of the University of Dublin constituency and I discovered there was such a heavy concentration of voters in Dublin 2 and Dublin 4 that it was worth my while to get a street map and a register and to knock on doors.  This revealed to me the extent of middle class loneliness in the suburbs of Dublin.  I hope they do not read this debate and feel insulted and refuse to vote for me in future.  I was told their husbands were playing golf or their children had grown up and had gone abroad and were looking for votes.  It was a time consuming exercise, but I know what it is like to pound the beat.</P>
    <P>As regards county councils, I was invited by my illustrious colleague, Senator and Councillor D. Kiely, to visit the General Council of County Councils in&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;Ballybunion.  Perhaps you, a Chathaoirligh, were there.  We had a wonderful ding-dong because I said a few things about section 4 planning approvals, which rose the councillors, and we had a terrific time in Ballybunion.  They had already bought <Col N="99" /> the Waterford Crystal vase, so they had to present it to me.  I found it invigorating because it was a frank and free exchange of views.  I am not so brittle and delicate that I could not withstand a local council election, but I do not want to exercise the dual mandate.  I could be indiscreet and say there are those in this House who signed a motion some years ago complaining about the dual mandate who now exercise it.</P>
      <P>It is important to give a voice to emigrants. The President spoke movingly in the past couple of weeks in the other House and addressed the nation through the public representatives on the subject of the diaspora.  Senator Dardis mentioned the old catch phrase from the American War of Independence about no taxation without representation. Some people would turn this on its head and say there should be no representation if there is no taxation. That is a mean minded, begrudging idea because many people who have to live abroad are constrained by circumstances to do so and they would be only too happy to live in Ireland and to pay taxation if they had the opportunity, which they are, unfortunately, denied.</P>
      <P>I echo Senator Henry's point about campaign expenses.  It costs a lot of money, particularly before one gets elected, but once one is elected one is in the enviable position of having Oireachtas postage and that covers a certain amount of the expenses.  Perhaps the Minister will communicate back to his colleagues the fact that there is considerable ire and scepticism about the constitutionality of provisions to provide expenses to the political parties, to the Green Party and others, but to exclude an important group, the Independents, who now hold the balance of power in the Seanad.  If there was ever a crunch vote, it was a vote on that nasty little piece of thimble riggery.  I am delighted to see the Minister making a note on this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="100" /> Many of our people are in England and I believe there would be a heavy participation and that people of conscience would represent the homeless.  If one is in London or New York one frequently hears an Irish accent among the homeless and down and outs.  This is a reproach to us and we should consider this matter.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Government has decided to extract these three seats from the Taoiseach's eleven nominees and not to monkey around with some of the other constituencies, which may have been a temptation.</P>
    <P>The Minister asked a number of questions which I would like to answer.  He wanted to know if voting rights should be &ldquo;extended to all Irish citizens abroad, or be confined to citizens abroad who lived in this country for a specified minimum period&rdquo;.  I have no difficulty in answering in an unqualified manner that voting rights should be extended to all Irish citizens.  If one holds citizenship, why should one have demarcation, discrimination and a second level of citizenship?  There should not be degrees of citizenship: either one is a citizen or one is not.  My answer is clear and unequivocal.  The second question he asked was: &ldquo;Should the extension of voting rights be open-ended, or should there be a cut-off point...?&rdquo;  He then mentioned five, ten or 20 years.  There should not be a cut-off point; it should be for all Irish citizens.</P>
    <P>The Minister also wanted to know how we could deal with the &ldquo;position of graduate emigrants, who already have the right to vote at Seanad university elections&rdquo;.  They should be left alone. Why should they not vote twice?  Many people vote three or four times, particularly those who are Members of this House.  If they are graduates, they vote in the general election for the Dáil, they vote in the election for university representation and they vote on four or five panels.  So let us not be po-faced about <Col N="101" /> it.  We already have multiple voting and I do not see why people should be excluded from voting on a university panel because they are Irish citizens living abroad.  They should have both.</P>
    <P>The next question was: &ldquo;Should an annual register of emigrant voters be prepared, or should a special register be drawn up when an election is called?&rdquo; Of course it should be an annual register. Drawing up a register in the heat of a suddenly called election would mean chaos.  I suggest they talk to the people. I cannot speak for the National University of Ireland, although I am sure it does a good job, but they do a good job in the Seanad electoral office in Trinity College Dublin.  They meticulously keep records, which is why we have a record of approximately 60 per cent participation, highly unusual in a postal ballot. They do that because they keep the register up to date all the time.</P>
    <P>Another question the Minister asked was what &ldquo;qualifications should be required of candidates and what method of nomination should be provided for&rdquo;. One would get the impression that I think university constituencies are wonderful, and I do.  I suggest that the Minister should look at the method of nomination and balloting of university seats because that covers the way in which one must be nominated.  There must be a proposer, a seconder and eight assenters.  One must have a witness, sign the document to show one is a citizen and swear a declaration.  There are three envelopes.  This works efficiently in a postal sense.</P>
    <P>The qualification should be that the people should be Irish citizens, they should attest to that fact, and they should have a minimum of three months permanent residence at a postal address to facilitate the keeping of the register. This suggestion covers the voting arrangements to be put in place to meet the reasonable requirements of an election while providing safeguards essential <Col N="102" /> to the secrecy and integrity of the ballot.</P>
    <P>Finally the Minister was forced to turn to the late and greatly lamented Sam Goldwyn for a quote; he declined to prophesise about anything, particularly the future.  Why did he not quote the much lamented late Member of the Lower House of the Ascendancy Parliament, Sir Boyle Roche?  He said: &ldquo;Posterity be damned!  Why should we do anything for it; what did it ever do for us?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>We had a meaningful debate this evening.  At times it was exhilerating, at times loquacious in the extreme, verbiage being the keynote. The great American writer Walt Whitman said: &ldquo;Words are like leaves, they can be tossed in various directions.&rdquo; This is an historic motion and a momentous occasion in the Seanad.  One hopes we get more than words, we will get action.</P>
      <P>There is a general commitment to offer recognition to our emigrants who have traversed the world and probably been our most able ambassadors at no cost to the nation.  The Irish never lost sight of their roots: they have established Gaelic Park in New York, GAA clubs like Seán Treacy's in London and the various agencies which have given aid to emigrants through the years.</P>
      <P>It is obvious to everyone here that further deliberation and discussion is necessary.  Neither I nor my party have a problem with that, being the open transparent party that we are.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. Like myself she has an interest in this area.  I had intended to share my time with Senator Ross but, unfortunately, he had to be elsewhere.  I know he agrees with my comments and given that perhaps the Minister will take my remarks doubly on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could say many things about the budget, not all of them positive.  I am critical of many schemes in it but one good one is the pilot renewal scheme for traditional seaside resorts.  This offers a variety of tax breaks which could help rejuvenate many of our traditional seaside resorts which, because of sun <Col N="104" /> holidays in the 1960s and 1970s, have become badly run down.</P>
    <P>There are three such resorts in my constituency &mdash; Bray, Arklow and Greystones.  I am amazed than none of them has been brought into the pilot scheme.  There are a series of cogent reasons they should be included, to which I shall return.</P>
    <P>The scheme offers a capital allowance of up to 100 per cent.  This will be vital to resorts wanting to undertake costly tourism structures which are not necessarily traditional projects, such as building hotel accommodation.  The major problem with the scheme is its focus on eight seaside resorts &mdash; Achill, Ballybunion, Bundoran, Kilkee, Lahinch, Tramore, Westport and Youghal &mdash; which are on the south, south-west, west and north-west coasts.  I cannot understand why the east coast has been discriminated against.  I wish all eight towns well.  Each has its problems and a fine history of tourism.  I am, however, astonished and annoyed that the three seaside resorts in County Wicklow have been omitted.  I cannot understand why the Government deliberately discriminated against them.</P>
    <P>I make a special plea to the Minister on behalf of Arklow.  As she knows, successive Governments since the early 1980s have recognised Arklow as an unemployment blackspot.  It has suffered the most major haemorrhage of traditional industries of any town.  The IFI/NET nitrate plant has been wound down to low levels of operation, the porcelain industry closed, the tableware industry has declined; and so has the tourism industry.</P>
    <P>All parties in Government over the last 12 years recognised the special position of Arklow.  The town will shortly be by-passed.  We are looking forward to it because it should bring the town closer to major centres but tourism in the town needs special attention.  I ask the Minister to look at the position of Arklow before the Finance Bill and the necessary legislation go through.  It could gain immeasurably from this scheme.  Arklow's tourism base is well recognised. <Col N="105" /> The town has been adventurous and entrepreneurs have invested a great deal of money there but the tax incentive afforded by this scheme could bring hundreds if not thousands of jobs to the town.</P>
    <P>I also wish to put the special case of Bray before the House.  Bray is the biggest tourist resort on the east coast and, in terms of volume during the 1950s and 1960s, it was probably the biggest tourist resort in the country.  It went through a period of rapid decline, particularly when tourism traffic from the north of England declined because of the troubles in the North and as a result of the availability of sunshine holidays.  An effort has been made in Bray in recent times to revitalise tourism. One of the major hotels has made a substantial investment in the area.  We have seen the success of the seaside train and the tram on the seafront and there is a proposal to reactivate the cable car.  There is an aquarium on the seafront which requires the best part of £300,000 to really get up and running. There is a series of run down lower grade hotels in Bray which would certainly benefit from the type of investment this scheme would generate.</P>
    <P>When this scheme was first mooted Bray was one of the towns considered for its application.  I lobbied previous Ministers for its inclusion and I make no apology for such lobbying.  I am sure the Minister would lobby on behalf of her own constituency too.  Bray is a town that really needs a specific input to reactivate its tourism infrastructure.  The infrastructure and expenditure required in Bray &mdash; for example, the structure of the aquarium, the provision of structural facilities on the seafront &mdash; can only be secured through a specific scheme.</P>
    <P>Bray, unlike Arklow, has gained twice in that the last two Governments gave Bray urban designation.  Arklow, unfortunately, has been left out of not just this scheme but also urban designation. In Greystones there is a significant proposal to build a major marina on the <Col N="106" /> seafront.  However, one of the problems is that the Department of the Marine is demanding outrageous levels of fees for the project to proceed.</P>
    <P>The resorts that are included in this scheme are already quite well provided for in a number of ways.  The resort with which I am most familiar is Bundoran.  It is a fine resort and has an extraordinary entrepreneurial spirit.  However, it also receives extraordinary levels of support. It receives support from the International Fund for Ireland and from the various western schemes that are available in that area.  However, there are no such supports in my constituency.  Every pound invested by an entrepreneur in the tourism industry in County Wicklow and.  indeed, in County Wexford is £1 net; it is not supported by special schemes.  A real and cogent argument can be made in favour of all the east coast resorts &mdash; I have focused on three in County Wicklow &mdash; and I ask the Minister to communicate my urgent call on their behalf.</P>
    <P>In Bray and Arklow major renewal and regeneration of the tourism infrastructure is under way.  None of that regeneration has received what could reasonably be called support &mdash; although there has been much verbal support &mdash; from Governments over the last ten or 15 years.  There is a great deal of anger in the area.  We are trying to revive an industry and we once again find ourselves seriously disadvantaged. Capital in tourism, as in any other enterprise, is mobile.  People with venture capital will, if they can benefit from tax breaks, invest in Bundoran, Achill, Tramore or Lahinch.  They will not invest in places like Bray, Arklow, Greystones, Rosslare or other east coast resorts.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to relay the message that east coast resorts and particularly those in Wicklow are bitterly disappointed at being excluded from this scheme.  Previously, I lobbied Ministers strongly with regard to this scheme on behalf of my constituency.  The Minister for Finance has introduced an adventurous and good scheme.  It should not be <Col N="107" /> focused on a few places that have already experienced a good deal of investment.  If the Minister wishes to test the scheme, he could consider a town like Bray or Arklow and extend the number of resorts included in the scheme.</P>

I am sure the Minister can make a case for Courtown.  She knows that my affinities with Rosslare and the Wexford resorts are such that I would not mind if they were included after the Wicklow resorts.  I ask the Minister to convey my message to the her senior Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mrs. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>I note Senator Roche's pleadings for the east coast resorts of Bray, Greystones and Arklow. I, too, have received representations on behalf of the resorts of Courtown and Rosslare.  The Minister for Finance announced in the budget speech last week a new renewal scheme for traditional seaside resorts on a pilot basis with effect from 1 July 1995 for a three year period.  The purpose of the scheme is to renew and update the tourist amenities and facilities in certain seaside resorts.  I stress that this new initiative is a pilot scheme.  The scheme is thus of a trial or experimental nature and, consequently, it has been limited to a small number of seaside resorts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This procedure of introducing a scheme on a limited basis is well established in the area of urban renewal.  The original urban renewal scheme which was announced in October 1985 by the then Minister for the Environment, John Boland, accorded designated status and the accompanying tax incentives to only the five main cities &mdash; Dublin, <Col N="108" /> Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford. In subsequent years, the scheme was extended to include designated areas in other towns.</P>
    <P>The new urban renewal scheme, which was introduced in the 1994 Finance Act, includes a pilot scheme for designated streets which has been applied on a limited basis.  This scheme which is aimed at encouraging residential development of the upper floors of business premises where these floors are currently vacant, is available only in a restricted number of designated streets in the cities of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford.</P>
    <P>A pilot scheme, by its very nature, must be applied on a limited basis in order to evaluate its efficacy.  This allows for the scheme to be monitored and reviewed and, if necessary, adapted in order that it may bring about the desired goal.  The new pilot scheme for traditional seaside resorts falls into this category.  It would not be appropriate to apply the scheme to every seaside resort in the country.  Therefore, there will always be resorts who will complain about being excluded from a scheme such as this.</P>
    <P>As regards Bray in particular I would point out to the Senator that in 1990 certain areas in Bray were designated under the Urban Renewal Act, 1986. These areas have been totally redeveloped at an estimated cost of £10 million according to the Department of the Environment.  Furthermore, two new substantial areas of Bray have been designated under the new urban renewal scheme which commenced on 1 August last.  Bray is therefore not in need of any further incentives for development purposes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her response.  It has little to do with the pleas I made but I am sufficiently familiar with the realities to know that that would be the case.  The Minister said: &ldquo;A pilot scheme by its very nature must be applied on a limited basis in order to evaluate its efficacy.&rdquo;  The case can be made that one or two east coast resorts <Col N="109" /> should be included in order to make a full evaluation.</P>
      <P>I am furious with the Minister's response regarding Bray.  Bray needs incentives.  Other towns, in particular Bundoran, have a series of incentives and the fact that Bray, after a long period of neglect by successive Governments, was designated for urban renewal by the last two Governments is not a cogent argument for excluding it from this scheme.  I do not wish to shoot the messenger because I do not like the message but the people of Bray will not be happy with the response.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I thank you, Sir, for allowing me to raise this important matter on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>This problem relates to the delay from the time the case is set down, particularly in relation to the Circuit Court, to the time the case is actually heard, thus causing injustice to those seeking legal redress.  While they may not always win the case, at least they deserve that it be heard at an earlier stage.</P>
      <P>There have been delays in various ends of the legal system.  Previously, they occurred regularly in the High Court, but the jurisdiction has changed with regard to the Circuit Court.  There are lengthy delays in dealing with cases, particularly personal injury cases &mdash; involving claims between £5,000 and £30,000.  In 1991 if one set down a case it took four to five months to be heard in the Circuit Court; now the delay is upward to 20 months, and growing.  This must be looked at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not a problem of the Minister's making, it has been caused by circumstance, but steps must be taken to address it.  Some of the points regarding the courts system and the huge upsurge <Col N="110" /> in litigation causing long court delays were addressed by Mr. Justice O'Flaherty of the Supreme Court.  He raised some relevant points in an interesting address to a conference of the National Union of Journalists in Dingle some weeks ago.  In an article which appeared in <i>The Sunday Press</i> of 12 February 1995 he stated:</P>
    <P>It seems to me that trials are taking too long.  When I was first called to the Bar the idea of a case going on for two or three weeks was a rare occurrence, now cases lasting that length of time seem to be very regular.</P>
    <P>I agree with Mr. Justice O'Flaherty in that we have become more litigatious and we are going to court more quickly than was the case in the past.  That said, the problems must be addressed.</P>
    <P>We must also address the situation regarding the Circuit Courts which hear various types of cases.  Leaving aside personal injury cases, and where people suffering loss and damage deserve to be compensated, I ask the Minister to give special attention to family law cases and the delays involving these cases.  Where there are difficulties there should be an interim hearing before the case is finally dealt with.</P>
    <P>Many problems have arisen because of the change in jurisdiction.  This has meant that many cases which hitherto would have been heard in the High Court are now heard in the Circuit Court.  There has not been an appropriate response to this.  The problem is especially difficult in Dublin, although my colleagues in the country tell me the situation is the same there.</P>
    <P>There are problems in some of the other courts too.  There are probably fewer delays in the District Court, although some of the facilities and overcrowding in these courts should be looked at.  For example, from my knowledge of some of the District Courts in the Dublin area, if the fire officer was vigilant on certain days, no court would sit.  On one occasion a certain District Justice was competing with a rodent <Col N="111" /> species with regard to who was occupying the court.</P>
    <P>Many matters must be addressed, and I am sure that the Minister is well aware of the various problems which must be looked at.  In this respect, the legal profession must also respond and various matters must be considered with regard to the timing of cases and procedures. For example, we are all aware of the difficulties in having surgeons, engineers or other expert witnesses appear in court, especially as much of their evidence could be agreed before a court case proceeds. In some cases certain matters could be sorted out and reports agreed much more quickly.</P>
    <P>However, there is no doubt that, at present, there are insufficient judges to deal with some of these cases and we must do something to reduce the backlog. It had improved when these problems were addressed earlier, but unfortunately, since 1991, the matter has become four to five times worse.  I hope the Minister will respond positively, will take these concerns on board, and with her colleagues, will recognise the present difficulties.</P>
    <P>In the same newspaper article, Mr. Justice O'Flaherty stated with regard to family law cases:</P>
    <P>The trouble about long litigation is that others are being deprived of access to the courts.  And the areas of neglect tend to be those of the needy and the oppressed: family law, problems of housing, questions concerning children and the elderly, who are often the victims of neglect and abuse.</P>
    <P>....</P>
    <P>We can develop the most high sounding principles in the world but if the courts are not readily available &mdash; both in time and cost &mdash; to the ordinary man and woman, we are failing in one of our basic duties.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister would not dispute or disagree with anything I have said this evening.  It is a case of considering <Col N="112" /> the situation and discussing it with the people involved &mdash; barristers, solicitors, members of the Judiciary, court registrars, clerks, etc.  An attempt should be made to bring forward better proposals.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to respond positively to my remarks.  There is great concern about the build up of cases.  It can give rise to people in the legal profession, and elsewhere, attempting to settle cases out of court, a course of action which is recognised by insurance companies from a cost view point.  I am not speaking of people who bring fraudulent claims.  People who have suffered genuine injury or loss and have endured hardship deserve to be compensated.</P>
    <P>There must be a response from the legal authorities with regard to sorting out the difficulties which have evolved. The report on the Attorney General's office indicated that that office, and many others, operated in a Dickensian manner.  There must be a response to this situation and change must take place.  I ask the Minister to recognise the need for reform and to endeavour to eliminate the backlog.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for raising what is an important and practical matter.  I am very aware and concerned at the substantial delays in the hearing of cases in the courts at present.  I am also very aware of the serious hardship, both financial and emotional, which such delays can cause to those people coming before the courts.</P>
      <P>At present, there are delays of up to six months in the hearing of cases coming before the Central Criminal Court and up to two months in the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court.  Delays in the hearing of criminal cases give rise to a great deal of anxiety on the part of victims of crime, especially where the defendant is remanded on bail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Defendants who are remanded on bail and whose cases cannot be heard for lack of a judge, are obviously free to <Col N="113" /> commit further crimes, because of the excessive delay in the disposal of their cases.  This is a matter of concern, not only to the victim of the initial crime, but also to society in general and to those involved in maintaining law and order.</P>
    <P>With regard to family law, to which the Senator referred, the delays in the hearing of these cases are confined mainly to the Circuit Court.  The number of cases coming before this court increased dramatically following the implementation of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, which transferred the majority of family law cases to the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>Social attitudes to marital breakdown have also changed in recent years with more and more persons having recourse to the courts in regard to family law matters.  Delays in the hearing of family law cases, which can extend to 12 months in the larger urban centres, are a matter of particular concern because of the sensitive nature of family law business.  Such delays not only cause additional suffering to the parties concerned but also to their families.</P>
    <P>The programme for Government, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> has given a firm commitment to complete the steps necessary to ensure that the family courts are strengthened.  In this regard we are awaiting with interest the final report of the Law Reform Commission on family courts which will be given immediate consideration on publication.</P>
    <P>Delays in the hearing of civil cases are substantial in both the High and Circuit Courts.  In the High Court it is mainly personal injury actions which are affected and which can take up to 34 months to be heard.  Delays in the Circuit Court vary from venue to venue and range from little or no delay at some venues to substantial delays in the larger urban centres ranging from six months to three years.</P>
    <P>The delay in both these courts can be attributed in great part to the Courts <Col N="114" /> Act, 1991.  The Act itself increased the civil jurisdiction of the Circuit Court with the result that the number of civil cases for hearing in that court has approximately doubled since the 1991 Act was enacted.  Immediately prior to this Act coming into force the number of actions put down for hearing in the High Court increased substantially but have continued to decrease since then. Without any corresponding increase in judicial resources, this has naturally led to serious delays in the hearing of cases.</P>
    <P>It must be mentioned at this point that the hearing and disposal of cases in the both the Circuit and High Courts is subject to a variety of factors, many of which are outside the control of the courts.  Cases which are listed for trial are subject to application for adjournment from either party and, indeed, are often adjourned at the request of legal representatives in the interests of their clients.</P>
    <P>The problems of delays and backlog of cases for hearing in the courts is currently under examination in the Department of Justice.  The previous Government, in an attempt to address these issues, gave approval to increase the number of judges of the High, Circuit and District Courts by two, seven and five respectively.  The legislative provisions to enable these appointments to be made were to have been contained in the Courts and Court Officers Bill, 1994.</P>
    <P>However, under our programme for Government &mdash;<i>A Government of Renewal</i>&mdash; we are committed to reviewing the provisions of this Bill to ensure that the measures it contains will adequately address the need to tackle the backlog of cases to be heard in all the courts.  This review is receiving urgent attention at present in the Department of Justice and I hope to be in a position to give a firm indication of the plans in this regard in the near future.</P>
    <P>The old saying that justice delayed is justice denied speaks for itself.  I read the comments of Mr. Justice O'Flaherty <Col N="115" /> of the Supreme Court, who put the problem very well.  It is a matter of concern for all Members and the Minister and I will be addressing this as a matter of urgency.</P>
