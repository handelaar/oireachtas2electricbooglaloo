      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann extends its deepest sympathy to the Government and people of Israel on the tragic death of their Prime Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The world heard with shock and dismay of the tragic death of the Prime Minister of Israel last weekend.  We can only <Col N="183" /> hope that the peace process to which Mr. Rabin dedicated his life will be strengthened and that his life and his sacrifice will not have been in vain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Senators, I second this motion expressed so eloquently by the Leader of the House.  The assassination of Prime Minister Rabin sent shock waves reverberating throughout the world. Those shock waves were felt by his family, the State of Israel and by all those interested in a peaceful resolution of the Middle East conflict.  Mr. Rabin played a major part in establishing the movement towards peace and it was ironic that he was killed at a peace rally.  We join with the Leader of the House in expressing our deepest sympathy to the family of Yitshak Rabin, to the people of Israel and to all peace loving people throughout the world.  We sincerely hope, as Mr. Rabin did, that the enterprise he embarked upon with the Palestinians will herald peace in the region as well as helping towards the peaceful resolution of other conflicts in the world.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Independent Senators I want to express my abhorrence of this foul deed.  We salute the memory of Yitshak Rabin who demonstrated his courage in war and then realised that the victories of peace were even greater.  We hope that the lesson of this deed, which has filled us with so much revulsion, will be learned.  It demonstrates emphatically the need for a peaceful resolution of the Middle East conflict.  I extend our sympathy to the people of Israel.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I join in this vote of sympathy to the Israeli Government and people.  They have taken a heavy blow, one from which I am sure they will recover.  Mr. Rabin was a very unusual person and he paid the ultimate price for his courage and his attempts to bring peace to the Middle East.  A <Col N="184" /> source of encouragement from the events of recent days was seeing King Hussein and President Mubarak in Jerusalem. We hope there will be a resolution to continue on the path of peace which Mr. Rabin so courageously charted.  For all those reasons, we extend our sympathy.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I extend our sympathy to the people of Israel and the family of the late Yitzhak Rabin.  His progression from soldier to statesman to peacemaker has been a tremendous example, particularly to those of us who live in troubled parts of the world.  I sincerely hope his example will be followed and that his work will be continued by others in the Middle East.</P>

      <P>I join with others in the vote of sympathy on the death of Yitzhak Rabin.  I visited the West Bank and the Gaza Strip with a parliamentary delegation in 1987 or 1988 and one would have to experience the situation and see the great gulf to appreciate the work being done to bring peace to these communities, although I know the world appreciates it.  It is tragic that this man who played such a major role in that was shot in cold blood.</P>

    <Title>Death of Deputy Neil Blaney:    Expression of Sympathy.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with a sense of loss and sadness that we pay tribute to the late Deputy Neil T. Blaney.  Representing Donegal North-East since 1948 when he won the by-election caused by the death of his father, Neil was affectionately known as the father of Leinster House.  In his political career Neil's organisational ability was quickly recognised.  We are all familiar with his ministerial achievements and his success on the European front.  I will not expand <Col N="185" /> on his political achievements as I am sure other speakers with elaborate on the many successes in his long political career.</P>
      <P>Neil Blaney had a deep commitment to a united Ireland and it is fitting that one of his last political appearances was at the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation. Noted for his freedom of spirit and independence of thought and belief, his adherence to those principles saw him grace the Independent benches from November 1971.  His in-depth knowledge of the procedures of the House and his wry sense of humour meant he was always a force with which to be reckoned.  When I was a Member of the Dáil I, with many others, on numerous occasions enjoyed his exchanges with the Chair.  I will end my tribute by saying there will never be another Neil Blaney.  He has gone to join his former colleagues in a different house of representatives.  I extend my sincere sympathy to his wife, Eva, and his family.  May he rest in peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Never in my 14 years in either House have we had such a long procession of desolate days when we have been obliged to mark the deaths of colleagues and former colleagues. Today we mourn the passing of Neil Blaney.</P>
      <P>Neil Blaney was never a member of this House but he was, as the Cathaoirleach said, the father of Dáil Éireann, where he had 47 years of unbroken service. He was returned successively in the general elections of 1948, 1951, 1954, 1957, 1961, 1965, 1969, 1973, 1977, 1981, two elections in 1982, 1987, 1989 and 1992, fifteen elections in all; well over half the lifetime of our national Parliament.  It was a formidable record and one which will not be equalled.  Add to that two stints in the European Parliament, 16 years of unbroken service as a Minister and we see what a formidable politician Neil Blaney was.  Never again in our lifetime will there be a record of service such as his, but there is more than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="186" /> The Blaney family have had continuous representation in these Houses since 1927; another record which cannot be equalled.  In 1927, Neil Blaney senior was elected.  He spent five years in this House, from 1938-43, when, in the 1938 election, the only political trick that ever fooled the Blaney family was perpetrated and it was a story which Neil loved to tell.  It was never repeated.</P>
    <P>These facts only give the outline of the story of Neil Blaney.  He was probably the best political organiser the country has ever known.  He was tough. He could be ruthless and well we knew it on this side of the House.  His views left little room for compromise.  He was as hard an opponent as any party could wish, or not wish, to have.  He was also an extremely able person.</P>
    <P>As a Minister he was energetic, almost driven, in his desire to achieve results.  Neil Blaney got things done.  He had a bulldozer quality which swept aside any opposition or anything in the way of what he wanted to achieve.  He was not a man to brook excuses, not from himself or others.  It was probably part of the tragedy of Neil Blaney that so much of his life was spent out of power in the wilderness of Opposition where his talents could not be used to the full.</P>
    <P>Like the late Brian Lenihan, Neil Blaney loved the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In full flight, he was an extraordinary speaker &mdash; powerful, passionate, the words flowing from him in unstoppable torrents.  He was a master of procedures and he took great delight in showing the newer Members, and the Independent Members in particular, how to use the procedures of the House and how to use the House to achieve their ends to maximum effect.</P>
    <P>As a man, Neil Blaney was thoughtful, generous and humorous.  He was the most convivial of men.  His friendships spanned all parties.  Indeed, there is a chemistry in these Houses which breaks down party barriers and enables strong and deep friendships to be forged across all party divides.  Neil Blaney had friends in all parties.  Indeed &mdash; and this <Col N="187" /> is a memory which I will always cherish &mdash; just eight days ago Neil Blaney paid his last visit to Leinster House.  Neither House was sitting but there was a small group of us here &mdash; Senator Wright, Senator Liam Cosgrave, a couple of Ministers and a few backbenchers from the other House.  We got together with him.  Most of us knew he had come in to say goodbye.  Time was running out for him.  He was frail, the voice was hoarse but the spirit was as strong as ever.  Stories were told, old friendships were recalled and, I have to say, old enemies were not forgiven.  It was a magic hour. I am certainly proud to have been part of that hour and I am proud to have these strong memories of Neil Blaney.</P>
    <P>To his wife and family, our profound and deepest sympathy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak of the death of Neil Blaney with a lot of sadness and shock; the House and I have not recovered from the loss of Brian Lenihan last week.</P>
      <P>I knew Neil Blaney nearly as well as anybody in public life.  I started my political career because of my immense admiration for Neil Blaney.  I understood his strong republican stance, coming from a county that has suffered much and was peripheralised by the man-made division of Ireland.  Neil Blaney always recognised the injustice that was done to the Border counties, including Donegal, and that was the basis for his strong republican stance. He never accepted that it was natural and normal to divide the country. Nobody on this island welcomed the peace initiative more than Neil Blaney.</P>
      <P>Those of us who were close to him admired his courage.  The Leader described him as a bulldozer but one must understand where he came from. He could open a door where some of us did not see there was a door to open.  In public life an ounce of sincerity is worth a ton of performance and Neil Blaney had that quality.  He is an enormous loss to County Donegal and to the country; he is irreplaceable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="188" /> My party, Fianna Fáil, could have done more to reconcile the differences between it and Neil Blaney.  I worked on many occasions to reconcile those differences.  I believe Neil Blaney wished to be part of Fianna Fáil because his father and he put so much into building the party.  I regret that he did not finish as a part of Fianna Fáil.  I was with him in at least 20 by-elections from Wicklow to Kerry.  His dynamism drove the people who were working with him and his sincerity and approach were unequalled by most active party members.  Neil Blaney will be a tremendous loss to County Donegal.  I cannot see anybody on the horizon who can fill his shoes.</P>
    <P>I extend my sympathy to his wife, Eva, his family, brothers and sisters and to all involved in Independent Fianna Fáil.  Independent Fianna Fáil was a branch of Fianna Fáil because there was no division on the ground in County Donegal.  I served on the local authority with Harry Blaney for 30 years.  Neil Blaney never failed to make a major contribution to County Donegal.  When he was Minister for Local Government he sanctioned the building of a new bridge between Lifford and Strabane.  I regret that some short-sighted person did not even invite him to its opening and his name is not on that bridge which has made a major contribution to the commercial life of the region.</P>
    <P>God be good to him; my condolences to his family.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I extend the condolences of the Independent Group to the wife and family of Neil Blaney.  Since the foundation of the State there has been a tradition in these Houses that the national flag flies at half mast from the time a Member dies until his or her burial.  Over the last 12 to 13 months we have seen that flag at half mast on six occasions.  That is extraordinary and it is an intimation of mortality.  What is more worrying for Members on the Independent benches that of the six, three were Independents.  I hope that is not a portent of the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="189" /> As I said, this is the sixth occasion on which we have remembered absent colleagues. Neil Blaney was the father of the Dáil.  It is a tribute to the man that less than 24 hours ago he telephoned his office to check in with his secretary to see how things were.  Doubtless it was also time for him to say goodbye; that was probably the real reason for the call.  He had that kind of extraordinary energy right through his career.  He was a professional politician, and a professional and committed public representative who was involved to the last.</P>
    <P>I will not attempt a revisionist approach to history, such as my colleague has just engaged in.  I differed fundamentally with Neil Blaney; many of us on the Independent benches would have differed with him fundamentally on many of the things he did.</P>
    <P>He sanctioned the bridge to Valencia Island, for which we in County Kerry will always be thankful.  When he built the Ballymun complex it was accepted at the time as being an extraordinary achievement.  Nowadays people can look back with the benefit of hindsight and see things differently.  However, he was somebody who got things done. This will be a tribute to him.  He was dogged and resolute, but also committed, and that commitment always shone through.  It is right that this should be recorded.</P>
    <P>He loved County Donegal but he also loved Europe.  He never tired of telling us of his experiences in the European Parliament and talking about the Members he met, including Signor Paninni, in the technical rainbow group, of which he was part.  It showed that he had the potential to have a much broader impact than in County Donegal alone.  Indeed, he often made the point that people were different in County Donegal in that they had only four miles of a border with the rest of the country, whereas they had a border of 100 miles or more with the North.  His sense of perspective never left him, but it was very subjective, reflected in his comment on an episode in history that he <Col N="190" /> never left Fianna Fáil &mdash; but that Fianna Fáil left him.</P>
    <P>We had many dealings with him in the Independent Group for technical reasons, as with the Independent Deputies in Dáil Éireann.  This was always a challenge as he was always one step ahead.  He had us allocated somewhere, whether it was in respect of representation here, there or the other place.  He had always made the extra telephone call before he came to talk to us and had some contact with a Minister before we came to decision making.</P>
    <P>This was never so more true than with regard to the recent decisions on representation on the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.  The late Gordon Wilson played a major role &mdash; poor Gordon did not know about it &mdash; in terms of deciding the representation of the Independent Senators.  It is a tribute to Neil Blaney that, ultimately, the Government, which intended to have one representative of all Independents in the name of the late Senator Gordon Wilson, appointed Senator Wilson, a Member from the Independent Senators group and a Member from the Independent Deputies group.  We continue to benefit from this.</P>
    <P>In the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation it would be fair to say that Neil Blaney was not conciliatory.  He was direct and hard hitting and had a point of view which was always challenging and assertive, and sometimes predictable.</P>
    <P>He was an indomitable spirit and had an extraordinary energy.  He was a man who contributed to public life in a way with which many of us are not perfectly attuned.  However, we recognise, congratulate and celebrate his contribution to Irish public life, and extend our condolences to his wife and family.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, it has become far too frequent to mourn the passing of a Member of one of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  On this occasion we mourn the passing of a very able, strong and enduring politician.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="191" /> Neil Blaney stood by his convictions through thick and thin.  This probably cost him even higher office than the ministerial offices he graced before the schism &mdash; if I might use that term. However, he stood by those convictions and saw them through.  These convictions stayed firm in a world that was changing rapidly, and he might have reflected on that.  Nevertheless, he held those convictions strongly.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole spoke about how he behaved at the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.  At the meetings I attended he argued his case forcibly, capably and always leavened it with a sense of humour.  There was always a cut of humour behind nearly everything he said.  He was an able Member of the European Parliament and an able TD. The Leader spoke about his ability to win so many elections since 1948.  That is a remarkable achievement even if he was never to achieve anything else.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I extend our sympathy to his wife, his family, his supporters in Donegal and his constituents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saddened that today we are sympathising with the family of Neil Blaney.  I was not shocked by his death because I had spent some time with him over recent weeks.  I was delighted to call him a friend, to work with him in this House and to accept his advice on numerous occasions since I became a Member of this House about three years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Neil Blaney was the longest serving Member of the Dáil with 47 years' service. His service to this country and to his native Donegal &mdash; which he loved dearly &mdash; is to be commended.  When I visited him about three weeks ago he was approaching his 73rd birthday and we spoke about politics when he won a by-election in Donegal in 1948.  My father told me last Sunday night that he and my mother worked for Neil Blaney during that election and some of the stories that were told would make one ask <Col N="192" /> why one stays in politics.  Neil operated in an exceptional way.  People talked about the Blaney dynasty but he had a way with people &mdash; they loved him for what he was.  He was exceptionally tough.</P>
    <P>We came from two completely different political parties but it made no difference to Neil Blaney.  He often wondered what happened to my mother and father that they left Fianna Fáil for Labour. They remained friends, however, and every time I met him the first two people about whom he asked were my parents.  It was a sign of the man's character.</P>
    <P>My memories of Neil Blaney include listening to him in the Market Square in Letterkenny when I was about 15 years old.  He gave a fantastic speech that lasted for about an hour and fifteen minutes.  Throughout the speech he was glancing at notes.  Afterwards I approached him and asked him for a copy of the speech.  He handed it to me; it was a greyhound card from the Lifford racetrack.  There was not a word written on it, yet he spoke for an hour and fifteen minutes.  That demonstrates the capability of this man.  He was one of the finest orators I ever heard.</P>
    <P>He had sincerely held views on Northern Ireland and on the attitude of the British and when I saw him recently he had not changed his views.  He believed strongly in a united Ireland and never deviated from that.  He had a long and distinguished career and there are many monuments to him in Donegal. He will not be easily forgotten.  His advice was valuable and I appreciated it.  I was privileged to call him a friend and to have worked with him.</P>
    <P>I extend my heartfelt sympathy to his wife, Eva, his five sons and two daughters, his brother, Harry, with whom I worked on Donegal County Council and another brother, Teddy, a former member of Letterkenny UDC.  Neil Blaney will be sadly missed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Leader and Members in paying tribute to the late Neil Blaney.  I was elected to the Dáil in <Col N="193" /> June 1981 and I shared an office with him.  At that time he was also a Member of the European Parliament and I got an insight into the volume of work he undertook at both European and national level.  The people of Donegal were never forgotten.</P>
      <P>Later, because there was a hung Dáil, we had an Independent group of which he was the Leader.  The intensity with which every issue, every item that came up was dealt was very impressive and showed his great interest in his work. One would have expected that, after a long life in politics and having left his footprints in the sands of time, he would be taking it easy but that was not Neil Blaney.  Neil Blaney approached every issue in which he had an interest with the resolute and fearless spirit of an ancient warrior.</P>

      <P>Senator Ormonde's appointment today is appropriate.  The Order of Business as outlined by the Leader is agreed.  The Leader will be aware that for the last number of months we have been asking for a debate on the policy on nuclear waste and dumping.  I welcome the fact that the Government has initiated a Bill today &mdash; the Dumping at Sea (Amendment) Bill, 1995.  However, it is difficult for constituents to understand why the EU and the European Commission should have a say in the ingredients of a sausage or a black pudding but not in relation to a nuclear waste policy. We should be afforded the time to reiterate the unanimous message from this House, to tell those involved in that policy that we do not welcome it and we want it stopped immediately.</P>

We should have a clear understanding about that.  As the delegation from the Isle of Man is here it is appropriate that the Leader of Fianna Fáil should raise the issue of nuclear energy. Our guests are more at risk from this than us.</P>

    <P>Senator Wright referred to the Defence Forces.  There has been an ongoing call over an extended period for this matter to be dealt with in the House.  We should deal not only with the Price Waterhouse recommendations but also with the implementation plan of the efficiency audit group.  Many members of the Defence Forces are worried because there are reports that <Col N="196" /> as many as eight barracks might be closed.  The Minister has spawned a new acronym, NIMTO &mdash;&ldquo;not in my term of office&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The Minister obviously expects it to be a long time.  These fears exist and the Defence Forces want at least some of them cleared up and this can be done in this House.  One fear relates to the Army apprenticeship school in Naas, which has a long and distinguished history where many young people have received a good education.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Rory Kiely's calls for statements on agriculture, particularly in view of the income crisis in the sheep sector.  I realise the other House is debating this sector and that Fianna Fáil has tabled a motion to be dealt with in Private Members' Business.  I ask the Leader to make time available at the earliest opportunity for statements on agriculture to be taken in this House.</P>

There is concern throughout the country about the effects this may have.  It may be said that nothing will happen for three years but the process of change will take place.  It is important that we have an urgent debate on the issue next week and that ample time is provided in the interests of all the families concerned.</P>

      <P>The issue of the Army is one which this and previous Governments have been forced to address.  It would be a great pity if, in a political point scoring exercise, unnecessary fears were generated because of a lack of knowledge and information.  There is a need for a serious debate on the role of the Defence Forces.  There is also a need &mdash; I raised this before &mdash; to redeploy them in a different way.  There is no reason we could not use the Army and <Col N="197" /> the Garda Síochána as a UN peacekeeping corps which would be available as a rapid response force to go anywhere in the world.  It is recognised in the UN, throughout Europe and elsewhere that the Irish are good at this job because they quickly establish good relationships. I ask the Leader to include that aspect of the Army's work in any debate on the issue.</P>
      <P>Last week I asked for a debate on the self-regulating professions, such as the legal and medical professions.  I have doubts about this procedure because we have seen fraud in the legal profession in recent years and we are now faced with the case in Cork which I mentioned last week.  I welcome the fact that the Irish Medical Council asked the High Court to strike the doctor off the medical register.  However, the public is entitled to know how the system works because, contrary to popular belief, people are judges in their own courts.  I reiterate the point I made last week that there is public disquiet about self-regulation and debate should be held in this House on that matter.</P>

      <P>I repeat a request made to the Leader last week.  Will he arrange a debate as soon as possible on the current situation in the North of Ireland?  We are receiving conflicting reports; one day there is a stalemate but the next day we hear progress has been made, it is a merry-go-round. A debate on this matter has not been held in the House for a long time.  I strongly urge the Leader to arrange a full day's debate on the North. Our views should be made known.

It has been debated in public in many other arenas &mdash; the dogs in the street are debating it &mdash; but the House has not even had an opportunity to read the report.

They cannot get a response from the DPP as to why it was decided cases would not stand up in court.  It is time the role of the DPP and the office were debated fully in the Houses of the Oireachtas.

Thousands of sheep farmers and members of the IFA demonstrated outside this House today and in recent weeks calling for an indepth consideration of the pricing of sheep and the reduction of wages which sheep farmers have experienced in recent years.

I requested that the Minister for Health should issue a statement, in this House or elsewhere, to allay people's fears and reassure women in particular. The Leader replied that there was an ongoing investigation by the Garda Síochána and left it at that, but last week a Government Senator raised the same matter and he received a positive response from the Leader of the House. Will the Leader reassure the House that there is impartiality and that responses are made on the merits of the issues raised?

This is of grave concern to more than 300 people and the Cobh hinterland generally.  Unfortunately, an attempt to raise the matter earlier in the Dáil was unsuccessful.  This is of enormous importance and every opportunity should be taken to inform the workers and the people of Cobh and Ringas-kiddy about the negotiations, what production limits are being placed on Irish Steel and the cost factors involved.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that there is a phenomenal increase in unemployment, would it not be appropriate for a Minister to explain to this House why there is no activity to curb unemployment?

A number of requests were made about the Price Waterhouse report.  I could say to the Leader of the Opposition that I would be happy to give him the same opportunity he afforded me to debate that document.  However, I will convey to the Minister for Defence the concern that has been expressed on all sides of the House for a debate on the reorganisation of the Defence Forces.  As regards Senator O'Toole's point about the Supplementary Order Paper and the order in which items are taken, this is entirely a matter for the Cathaoirleach.</P>
      <P>I have spoken with the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Gay Mitchell, and we will shortly have the debate that was requested on the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
      <P>The profusion of amendments that have been arriving late in the day in recent times is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I intend to raise the matter there today to have it resolved once and for all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Senators jumped on Senator Rory Kiely's bandwagon calling <Col N="205" /> for a debate on agriculture.  I will try to have a debate on the major agricultural issues as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Last week Senator Dardis raised the question of a debate on restructuring the universities.  I will try to convene a meeting with Senator Dardis, Senator Ormonde and some of the Independent Senators, as well as the Labour and Fine Gael spokespersons on Education, to see how best we can structure that debate.  It will happen within the time span I indicated.</P>
    <P>In reply to Senator Finneran, I did not intend to &mdash; and I do not believe that I did &mdash; discriminate in my replies to different sides of the House on the same question.  The point raised by Senator Magner last week concerned the self-regulating professions &mdash; an issue he raised again today.  I suppose the answer is that the professions might go a lot of the way by being more transparent in conveying to the public how their procedures work.  We would discuss the matter in this House if the appropriate motion was tabled.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran and others will appreciate that on matters like this &mdash; where ongoing investigations are taking place and where I do not have right of access to the up-to-date situation &mdash; it could be extremely dangerous and indeed wrong of me to make any remark which might prejudice things that may happen later.  I accept that this is a serious matter which caused widespread concern.  If there was an appropriate way it could be debated in this House I would be happy to facilitate it but I suspect it would be wiser to let the investigations take their course.  There are questions for the profession itself to answer.</P>
    <P>As regards Senator Fitzgerald's question, the Harbour Bill is finishing today in the Dáil and it should be before the Seanad within two weeks.  Senator Enright raised a number of issues which, strictly speaking, were not appropriate to the Order of Business.  However, I share with him a sense of shock when I see people, and especially priests, named before any charges have been <Col N="206" /> brought, on foot of allegations which have not been substantiated and where a person's character could be ruined. Watching television coverage of recent sex abuse cases where priests were charged in Northern Ireland, I found it appalling that these people were filmed on their way to court.  In those cases charges had been preferred, but in the case mentioned by Senator Enright I think it is an appalling practice.  I would like clarification from the newspapers as to why people are named and their photographs are published.  There may be an explanation and I would like to hear it.</P>
    <P>Senator Enright and others spoke about television programmes of recent murders.  If there is to be such a programme, I would expect that, at the very least, the television authorities would have cleared it with the families concerned and that further undue distress and suffering would not be caused needlessly in the interests of exploitation for television.</P>
    <P>As regards Senator Mooney's question on the arts plan, I will see what I can do to have a debate on it between now and the end of session.  Senator Lanigan raised the question of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I am not sure what our rights are in having such a debate so I will inquire and come back to the Senator.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(12) The Board shall ensure that all applications are processed as speedily as possible and shall put in place an independent appeals procedure where applicants can raise matters relating to delays and any refusals of applications.&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week we adjourned the debate on this Bill following the tragic news of the death of our colleague, the former Tánaiste, Brian Lenihan.</P>
      <P>These amendments relate to applications, an appeals procedure and delays and refusals of applications.  I would like to reiterate what I said last week.  It is natural justice that there should be an appeals procedure.  We are talking about licences for medical products and it would inappropriate if there was no appeals procedure.  I believe a case is being dealt with in the courts where the right to appeal is being sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My party and I believe the right of appeal should be included in this Bill. I understand the Minister gave certain assurances in the other House.  He has spoken about regulations and the commitments he will give.  This is fine in theory but in practice it does not always work.  We have a responsibility to tease out legislation to ensure all aspects are <Col N="208" /> looked at and that the Minister does not need to return to the Houses of the Oireachtas to amend a Bill.</P>
    <P>My party has carefully considered the situation.  The Minister should accede to the request for an appeals procedure. Good reasons have been put forward for this.  A board appointed by the Minister, which may or may not have a committee to look at this, is not a proper appeals procedure.  From my reading of the Bill, an appeal would be dealt with by an advisory committee.  It would be in-house and the right hand would ask the left hand what the opinion should be.  I do not believe that is appropriate. An independent appeals system should be available to deal with the delay or refusal of an application.  It should be part and parcel of the legislation and would protect people in that situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister has spoken at length about this in the other House and many contributions have been made in this regard.  My party believes there is a need for a safeguard for people who have been refused licences.  Delays can also be disastrous for pharmaceutical companies.  I believe the Minister said &mdash; I do not want to misquote him &mdash; that refusals are not usual.  However, delays can be as detrimental as refusals.  We would be better off if we included a proper appeals procedure for delays and refusals as regards licences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Finneran that there should be an appeals procedure; I have no difficulty with that.  The difference between us is how that should be done.  Senator Finneran seeks acceptance of his amendment.  This is an enabling Bill and the type of procedure which is appropriate here should be put in place by way of regulation.  I already gave an undertaking in this House to do so.  I ask him to bear in mind that the regulations must be placed before the Houses of the Oireachtas, so it comes back to the democratic process at that stage.  The board will not be in a position to refuse a licence until it has first sought and <Col N="209" /> considered the advice of the appropriate advisory committee, which is part of the structure of the board.</P>
      <P>The appeals committee or the appeals procedure put in place must be independent. The advisory committee of the board will not adjudicate on appeals. This issue which has arisen in the course of debate requires more thought and consultation.  We need to put in place a proper appeals procedure which is fair and impartial.  I reiterate my commitment to do this.</P>
      <P>Senator Finneran referred to speed. The thrust behind this legislation is to speed things up.  I explained that the period within which an application for product approval must be processed is 210 days on a stop the clock basis, in other words, if further information is required, the clock is stopped at that stage and it resumes when the information is provided.  Throughout the history of the National Drugs Advisory Board there was only one occasion when there was a refusal.  That is the case to which the Senator has alluded and which is before the High Court at present.</P>
      <P>On a practical level, it is prudent in my view to await the decision of the High Court before finally framing the relevant appeals procedure because I am not presenting this Bill in a confrontational way.  I believe that is the way in which the Bill has been accepted in the House.  The important issue is to get it right.  I put it to the Senator that this type of detail is appropriate to regulation rather than to the legislation itself.</P>
      <P>The other issue which Senators raised regards fees charged.  I have also given an undertaking here that the size and workforce of particular companies will be taken into consideration when the fees are being put in place.  The fees will be put in place by the Minister following consultation with the board and any other relevant necessary consultation.  I wish to assure the Senator again: I undertake here to deal with the issues which he raised by way of regulation. Those regulations will come before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says the clock stops.  We had the same situation in local authorities to some extent with regard to seeking further information. This is something which is abused by planning officials in county councils; in fact, I have raised the matter in public on numerous occassions.  We have had the unacceptable practice in the last week of the statutory period being almost up.  We have had an official write for further information, thereby covering himself and the local authority legally. It is a practice which needs amending but that is for another day and another Minister.  I wish to see it amended as soon as possible because, as far as I am concerned, it is malpractice by officials of county councils and local authorities.  The sooner it is stamped out the better.  It is not applicable in every county but I assure the Minister that it applies to a good extent in my county.  I know, being a member of the General Council of County Councils, that it applies in other councils too.</P>
      <P>A great deal of regulation is needed on the appeals procedures; in fact regulation will be needed if this amendment is accepted.  All this amendment states is that an appeals procedure will be put in place.  It does not say anything more than that.  The actual mechanics of it will be for regulation and I have no doubt about that.  I would leave that totally to the Minister and the Department.  I would not interfere with the appeals procedure; those regulations would then be laid before the House.</P>
      <P>The principle of appeal should be part of the law.  I leave the implementation of the appeals procedure to the regulation of the Minister and his officials.  The point of principle is that the Irish Medicines Board Bill should include a proper appeals procedure.  All the Minister must do is bring forward the regulations to implement that appeals procedure but the right of appeals should be part of the legislation.</P>

      <P>The first point raised by Senator Finneran &mdash; the abuse, possible <Col N="211" /> abuse or potential abuse of the stop the clock mechanism &mdash; would obviously have to be catered for as part of the appeals regulations.  I fully accept that if a person feels his application has been unfairly treated, it would be one ground for appeal.  Obviously, it would be a negative decision which would be at issue here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point the Senator made, <Col N="212" /> and I am aware of the context in which it is made, is something which will be catered for by regulation.  The regulations will also be law.  As this is enabling legislation, regulations which follow from it will, in fact, be law.  I am giving a categorical assurance here that the areas which are mentioned in these amendments will be catered for by way of regulation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the appointment of the advisory committee, does the Minister envisage a role for the medical associations, the Irish Veterinary Union or other representative organisations or unions of the various professions?  Would people from the pharmaceutical companies be on advisory committees?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an inherent danger in representation from pharmaceutical companies.  Not only must these committees be above board but they must be seen to be so.  If there were concerns about conflict of interest or about confidentiality in a particular situation it could take from the perception of these advisory committees as being absolutely above board in all their dealings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the composition of the committees, we are talking about experts as distinct from representatives. <Col N="215" /> I dealt with this matter on Second Stage to some extent in the context of the board.  Obviously we would better serve the Irish public by getting the best experts we can identify to serve on the committees rather than opting for representation from various bodies.  One does not always get the best people through the latter route.  The advisory committees will be composed of experts. We would not seek representatives from industry.  If the Senator reflects on that he will see the difficulties that could arise from such appointments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>Who will appoint the members of the advisory committee? Will it be the function of the Minister or the board itself?  If it is the function of the board, which is appointed by the Minister, would that not be very one sided to some extent?  Representative groups nominate members of health boards and so on.  Expertise is sometimes a matter of opinion and somebody could be appointed on the basis of their political allegiance.  Will the board or the Minister make the appointments to the advisory committee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will appoint the advisory committees.  We need to take this out of the context of the Minister of the day.  I made the point last week that whoever the Minister may be, he or she has the final responsibility for the public health services.  In the exercise of that responsibility, politicians should give credit to their colleagues and, in the appointment of a board such as this and advisory committees which play a critical role, the Minister should be able to select whoever he or she believes to be the best people to serve at the various levels.  We can put this committee into a political context if we wish but it is a very important committee in terms of public health and safety.  I find it difficult to conceive of a Minister who would not make proper and prudent appointments to the Irish Medicines Board and the two advisory committees.</P>

      <P>I am not taking from the integrity of any Minister.  However, if there was to be a general practitioner representative on the board &mdash; although that may not necessarily be the case &mdash; would it not be appropriate for the Irish Medical Organisation to nominate that person?  Would that body not know best?  Would the same not apply to the veterinary organisation and university faculties?  Why should the Minister pick and choose?</P>
      <P>The Minister, regardless of who he is, is not qualified because he is not directly involved.  A Minister may, now and again, come from one of those faculties but that would not often be the case.  I know that it will not apply in all circumstances but should it not apply where there are relevant umbrella or representative professional bodies? Does that not seem fairer?  The finger could be pointed at the Minister that he made appointments to that committee on the basis of political allegiance or friendship because he has the power to do so, although I am not saying that he will.</P>

      <P>It would not be incorrect to compare the advisory committees to a policy making committee as they are committees which will provide technical advice in relation to medicines.  There is no reason to have representatives of any particular group.  The Senator said the Minister may not have the personal expertise but that expertise is available to the Minister in the Department. These are technical committees which will apply themselves to their task in a scientific way, which is their value.  It is prudent and proper for the Minister of the day to have the powers to select the people he or she feels are best, based on the advice available to him or her within the Department.  I do not see the difficulty to which the Senator alluded as these are technical, advisory committees.</P>

      <P>Section 13 deals with fees.  I proposed an amendment to it.  I know the Minister has spoken and to some extent I have accepted what he said on this matter earlier on, but there is a worry on which Senator Henry and myself elaborated during the debate.  I <Col N="219" /> speak of it now when we are speaking on the section.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister has taken on board the fears expressed because this matter has not come out of the blue, it was brought to our attention.  We do not want a situation where there is no opportunity for arbitration.  I hope the Minister will be able to provide safeguards in the regulations.  Nobody wants to have legislation that can be used in a heavy handed way where some companies who might not be financially very strong could be the victims.  This provision is acceptable when there is plenty of money about and there is provision for the Minister to make a grant towards the board, but if money is scarce &mdash; this happens regularly in this country &mdash; the only form of income available to this board is that of fees. The Minister can make grants but in times of fiscal rectitude the board might not be top of the priority list.  The board may be forced to raise fees to maintain itself and carry out its functions.  Therein lies the danger.  That is why I put down the amendment here.  I hope it will not happen but I see that danger and I would like the Minister to respond.</P>

      <P>The fees will be set by the Minister in consultation with the board and whatever other consultation the Minister may feel proper and also in consultation with the Minister for Finance. These regulations have to be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas, so I stress again that they do come back into the parliamentary democratic process and can be dealt with within that process if people have serious reservations about them.  However, I take a more hopeful attitude and that is that the new Irish Medicines Board will get a sufficiency of contracts from the European agency to substantially augment its income.  The Government decision going back to 1991 is that the board should be self-financing.  In the matter of the Senator's amendment in relation to the level of fee, taking one company <Col N="220" /> as against another and going on its size, workforce, turnover and so on, I gave the undertaking in both Houses that this will be catered for in the regulations and that undertaking will be honoured.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 5 was proposed by Senator Henry and myself. It is a follow on from amendment No. 1. In putting down this amendment we were conscious of a developing situation in this country in regard to litigation which has now become part and parcel of day-to-day living in this country, not just under this legislation.  We are in a situation now where people are practically waiting to run against a door that is ajar so they can bring a case against the owner or occupier of the building involved.  I see a major difficulty in this situation, whether the Minister does or not, regarding litigation that may take place as a result of somebody feeling that some drug or product damaged either themselves or their property.  I instanced that, in the case of a farmer, the property could be his stock.</P>
      <P>This board will have to rely a lot on secondment and contract work from experts.  I cannot see the board working without the involvement and the introduction at different times of experts on a contract basis.  I believe the Minister does not have proper indemnity for that type of situation in this Bill.  The board may be at a loss if people are fearful of taking a contract or of being seconded to the board for a certain period because they feel they are not fully indemnified in a situation of litigation. That would be a pity.  There should be an inclusion in the Bill to allow for such a situation.  Senator Henry and I spoke about this on Second Stage and when we were dealing with section 3.  There is a gap in the law there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People nowadays are far more aware, conscious and worried that anything they do may result in them having to <Col N="222" /> appear in court and having to pay if they do not have full cover.  Such cover is on the minds of and weighs heavily on the pockets of the medical profession.  I have listened to representatives of the different medical umbrella organisations. The amount of insurance they must have to cover their ordinary everyday activities has gone through the roof. Will the board have protection for its staff, its members and, in particular, for people who will do contract work for it? I see problems arising with regard to the latter.  If these people do not have protection I can see a situation where good valuable expertise will be lost to the board because people will be afraid to take up contracts and work on behalf of it.  They will feel they do not have proper cover and indemnity against litigation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only reiterate what I stated earlier, which is that the legal advice available to me is that the inclusion of a general statutory indemnity provision is not appropriate and that an administrative solution is the better option.  The position until now has been that cases taken against the National Drugs Advisory Board were taken against it as a corporate entity.</P>
      <P>I take on board the points made by Senator Finneran and Senator Henry about the hypothetical situation where an individual could be pursued in a particular instance.  The National Drugs Advisory Board has looked at this possibility and I will make sure that the Irish Medicines Board will also consider it.  I must be guided by the legal advice available to me, which is that an administrative solution appears to be the better road to follow.</P>

      <P>Under this section the Minister or the Government will make funds available to the Irish Medicines Board.  The intention is possibly good but I see a situation &mdash; this arises with every board &mdash; where moneys will be scarce and what should be available may not be so.  In such situations boards sink or swim and they raise money the only <Col N="223" /> way they can.  The only way this board will be able to raise money is to look for new business or charge fees.  It will not have any other opportunity to raise funds to maintain itself.</P>
      <P>I am told that the National Drugs Advisory Board headquarters is in a poor state of repair and needs massive refurbishment.  What type of grant does the Minister envisage being made available to this board on an annual basis? Are we talking about a once off grant to get the building up and running and refurbished or about a set amount?  Has the Minister decided the amount of the grant which may be made available on an annual basis?</P>

The Senator's question may be slightly previous in the sense that until those recommendations have been fully assessed the financial implication is not fully clear but the commitment is to provide the resources necessary so that the board can operate to its fullest in the interests of public safety and health.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that.  I expect that the board will be able to raise plenty of money other than by charging fees by tapping into the great deal of expertise which is available. However, I do not think it will be able to do so unless there is a proper infrastructure of buildings and equipment. This is why I ask the Minister not to let the board off on half a leg.  It needs a good start up and it is important that it is put on a good solid footing with regard to finance, equipment and its building.  It must be allowed develop an understanding and status among our partners in Europe so that it will obtain the work which will provide it with finance. <Col N="224" /> I hope the consultants are looking at the issue on this basis and that the board will not be strapped for cash and that it will be in a position to avail of the great opportunities which exist.</P>

The section permits the board to borrow money for current or capital purposes, but only with the consent of the Minister for Health and the Minister for Finance. It is an enabling section which is prudent and necessary so that the board can operate to its full potential.

      <P>That is not a good practice.  Limits were placed on borrowing in other legislation, including the legislation for the National Roads Authority. It is wrong that a board should be allowed to make proposals to a Minister as regards borrowing.  The taxpayer is continuosly bailing out companies, including semi-State companies, such as Irish Steel and Bord na Móna.  It is crazy to introduce legislation which does not tie down borrowing.</P>
      <P>There should not be a situation where a board can come to a Minister with a good CV, state it needs a certain amount of money and the Minister must decide whether to provide it.  If he does not, he must give a grant but because the Department has insufficient funds he allows it to borrow money.  This is crazy and this type of legislation, which is bad, will ensure that future generations must pick up the tab.  It provides an open cheque book.  When the board comes to the Minister looking for funds, at the same time ten Deputies and five Senators will be putting pressure on the Minister to secure particular projects for their county or constituency.  The Minister will tell the board to borrow money because he must look after X, Y or Z. This is what will happen.  This section is bad.</P>
      <P>The Minister should address this aspect, if possible, by regulation.  The section is contrary to much of the debate in recent times about accountability. It means no limit must be maintained. No person could meet that requirement so why should public boards, appointed by the Minister, be faced with the position where they can come forward with any type of scheme they wish?  I am not suggesting the board will do this but it is bad legislation if it provides such an opportunity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>We must consider this matter in context.  The Government decision is that the board should be self-financing. I disagree this section is imprudent.  The board must have the wherewithal to seek money from the Ministers for Finance and Health in the first instance if the contingency arises. For example, it could have a short-term shortfall in its cash flow and it might be necessary to negotiate some bridging arrangement with a bank.  Another example is that new property or equipment is required and the board deems it prudent that payment should be deferred over a number of years.</P>
      <P>I do not envisage that exorbitant or unjustified requests for borrowings will emanate from the board with regard to the section.  The taxpayer has the double protection of the Minister for Health, who will be in close contact with the board given the issue of fees, and the Minister for Finance, who is ultimately responsible for the public purse.  The section is both prudent and practical.  It is required in an operational sense by the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not doubt the Minister is sincere but we must consider the record of the last number of years. Just a few years ago, eight health boards borrowed £50 million above and beyond the amounts allocated to them by the Department of Health with the sanction of the Minister for Health, although it involved different Ministers.  Another example is Bord na Móna, which had debts of over £200 million.  Although this has been pulled back to approximately £170 million or £180 million the taxpayer will pick up the tab for £120 million.  In the case of Irish Steel, I <Col N="229" /> understand £21 million of taxpayers' money must be spent just to get somebody to buy it.</P>
      <P>This situation is open to abuse.  The Bill does not contain any provision to ensure that applications for borrowing must come before the House.  There will be cases of the board applying to the Minister and the Minister either coming up with a grant or giving the board an opportunity to borrow.  This appears to be the bottom line with regard to this section.  When money is scarce the Minister will tell the board to borrow because he needs the funds for something else.  This is what, unfortunately, will happen.  If the Bill contained a provision or there was a regulation that applications for borrowing must come before the House, people would have an opportunity to express their views on whether that is advisable.  The matter would be in the public domain and would not be debated after the fact, as happened in many other cases up to now.</P>

However, if an undue delay takes place there are parliamentary methods by which that matter may be pursued.

      <P>The legislation provides that the report be supplied to the Minister within six months.  However, there is no provision regarding when the Minister should lay that report before the Houses.  Therein lies the difficulty.  That is the reason I tabled this amendment.  I believe a gap exists in the legislation.  It is unbelievable that this Bill has come before the House without a provision that the Minister should place the audited accounts and the report of the board before this House within a particular period.  The only provision included is that the Minister must receive the audited accounts from the board within three months and the annual report within six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill contains no provision that the Minister must place the audited accounts or annual report before both Houses within a specified period.  It is completely incorrect that this legislation should be introduced in this manner when past events are taken into consideration. I repeat that the National Drugs Advisory Board has not issued a report for the past four years.  The legislation before the House provides for the establishment of the Irish Medicines Board.  However, the legislation contains no provision to oblige the Minister to place that annual report before either <Col N="233" /> House within a specific period.  That is a major gap in the legislation.</P>

      <P>I have examined the proposed amendment and sought the advice of the parliamentary draftsman in relation to it.  I am advised that the section, as proposed in the Bill, is the standard form in relation to State bodies and that the proposed amendment is without precedent.  The Bill provides that the board shall furnish the Minister with a report no later than six months after the end of each financial year. There is no reason why the Minister would not lay such reports before the Houses as soon as may be after that. However, as the proposal is without precedent, I am unable to accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps we should create a precedent.  We would receive more respect from the public if we did decide to create some precedents.  Dealing with matters in the public domain is an issue of great interest to the public in general at present.  In many cases members of the public are not satisfied with the current process in this regard. The public could not be satisfied with the situation where the National Drugs Advisory Board has not brought forward a report during the past four years.</P>
      <P>Under this legislation the Irish Medicines Board is obliged to place its report before the Minister, but the Minister is not obliged to lay it before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is time that we set a precedent.  A strict rule should be put in place that the board must produce its accounts and report within a certain period and that the Minister in turn must lay these before the Houses within a specific period of time.  I do not care if this creates a precedent.  It is about time we created a precedent.  That is what should happen.  The fact that this may not have been normal procedure in the past is no good reason not to do it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to allay public scepticism regarding issues which are supposed to be dealt with in the public domain, the <Col N="234" /> legislation we are enacting should include provisions which lay down strict guidelines.  The proper guideline is not laid down in this situation.  This legislation places no onus on the Minister to lay the annual report before the Houses of the Oireachtas within a particular period.  I believe that is wrong.  I intend no disrespect to the Minister, but it would be better if he were obliged under law to bring forward that report. We would be better off with such legislation. The public could then read the annual report and Members analyse and debate its contents.  Otherwise things can slip and that should not be the case.</P>
    <P>It is an unfortunate omission from the Bill that the Minister is not required to lay the audited accounts and annual report of the Irish Medicines Board before this House within a specific period. The amendment recommends that he should do so within six months of the end of the board's financial year.  I believe that this is a reasonable amendment. The Minister should reconsider the situation regardless of precedent. He should set a precedent if necessary. Maybe other situations will follow and it will be all for the better as regards the public perception of what is happening.</P>
    <P>The Houses of the Oireachtas, not just the Minister, are entitled to know within a specific period.  While the Minister has a job to do, Members of both Houses are entitled to have reports such as the annual report of the Irish Medicines Board presented to them by the Minister within a specified period.  My amendment seeks to make that happen &ldquo;within six months of the Board's financial year-end&rdquo;.  It is a reasonable request and one the public expects us to make as public representatives.  The Minister should reconsider the situation even though the advice he has received is that there is no precedent for it.  That reason is not good enough.</P>
    <P>There is an opportunity here to set down a guideline or marker as regards what should happen with annual reports.  Too often we are reading history in annual reports and that is not good enough.  We have a responsibility <Col N="235" /> to make sure the public gets an opportunity of evaluating and analysing what has happened recently in State boards, not something that happened four or five years later when it is confined to the history books.  Debts, for example, usually have to be picked up by the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>A lack of public confidence has developed as regards the National Drugs Advisory Board concerning the anti-D and hepatitis C issues.  It is a national scandal that a State agency was responsible for that and the same State agency has not produced an annual report for four years.  This matter is fundamental to developing genuine openness and accountability by Government and State boards to the public.  The Minister should reconsider the situation because the public is demanding that type of approach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>To create precedent just for the sake of it is not good legislation. As I stated earlier in the debate, in any given situation legal reasons may prevent immediate publication of the annual report, or the Minister may require further information or clarification. If you tie the Minister's hands in saying that the report must be published by a certain date, that does not mean that the public at large or the parliamentarians are going to get the best report in the shortest time.</P>
      <P>The amendment would place a statutory obligation in this legislation for the production of the annual report within six months.  That would make it a legal requirement for the board to provide it. Obviously we cannot pre-empt in legislation the role of any Minister who, for whatever reason, may need further clarification or may have to examine the legal implications of publishing certain information.  Those are just some of the difficulties that could arise.  If we specify a time we may not be giving the Minister an opportunity to provide the best report.</P>

      <P>The Minister said there may be legal constraints, further information may be needed and, although he did not say it, there may be litigation in some situations.  I am sure the public and Members of the Oireachtas would fully understand if there were problems, provided the Minister explained to the House the reasons why the report could not be published.  Perhaps an interim report could be published inside six months.  Regulations could be put in place by the Minister for such an eventuality.</P>
      <P>However, the principle of my amendment is that the Minister should bring the report before the Oireachtas within six months from the time he receives it. That does not impinge too much on the Minister's position in evaluating situations or taking further advice.</P>
      <P>The general public is sceptical of the attitude of public officials and representatives about reports.  One only has to look at certain tribunals and investigations that have taken place.  By the time these reports become public they are no longer relevant, they are history books.  We must get away from that and into a situation where our public business is relevant and up-to-date.  It is an ideal opportunity for the Minister to deal with this, whether it creates precedent or not.  The Minister will not create bad law and, in my view, it would be a good precedent.</P>

It is something <Col N="237" /> that has developed in recent times and I wonder if it is the best situation. What is the conflict in a Member of Seanad Éireann being a member of this or any other board?  I do not see that there would be any great conflict.

Senator Finneran made a point about an amendment which he wished to make to the Bill, but he was told it was not acceptable because there was no precedent.

      <P>The Minister said that in the event of legal proceedings being taken &mdash; and this, to some extent, comes back to what Senator Henry and I queried on Second Stage and, again, on Committee Stage where our amendment was ruled out of order &mdash; it would be against the body corporate of the board.

      <P>This section relates to the manufacture, production, preparation, sale, supply and placing on the market of medicinal products.  In recent times we had a situation where contraceptives were debated in the public domain as a result of a particular study which was carried out, not in this country but in Canada.  I understand those products have not been taken off the market here.</P>
      <P>What role has the Irish Medicines Board in that type of scenario?  Notice was given in England that there could be problems but we had no such notice here as far as I know.  Would we be governed by European clearance on it, or would there be Irish clearance?  Does the Minister see the Irish Medicines Board commenting on such a situation as developed with these contraceptives?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Essentially, this board deals with regulations for the Irish market. When the particular information became available in Britain, the National Drugs Advisory Board immediately applied itself to that situation. Indeed, it was referred to the European agency.  Subsequently, a statement was issued by the National Drugs Advisory Board.  The bottom line was that anyone who had concerns should consult with their medical advisers.</P>
      <P>This is the enabling general section for regulations as they apply to the Irish situation.  There is the other situation where we can get contracts from the European agency for European licensing.</P>

      <P>I accept what the Minister says.  I am a little concerned that we may end up with another crisis. It is unfair to place the onus on GPs until a decision is made, the research is validated or the European agency decides.  GPs are being placed in a very dangerous position.  It is a kind of &ldquo;suck it and see&rdquo; attitude and that sort of responsibility should not be placed on GPs.  If it transpires there are side effects from these contraceptives, we could see GPs faced with litigation because the statutory agency has not taken a line on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="243" /> We discussed the liability of members of the board in another section to which Senator Finneran had proposed an amendment.  A decision at a governmental level by the drugs advisory agency or any agency to the effect that one should seek advice from one's GP &mdash; and I know of women who have gone to their GPs and have been reassured that the product may be safe &mdash; is not a responsible enough approach to take to a medication about which there has been some suggestion of side effects.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. We seem to be crossing each other a lot lately and I hope that we will be able to work together to get things right.  We propose this motion because we regret the failure of the Minister to abolish fees for evening and part-time third level students.</P>
      <P>While preparing for this debate, I asked when is free education not free, even in the White Paper scheme of things.  The answer is that it is not free for students attending part-time or evening courses.  The fundamental philosophy driving this motion is the pursuit of equality for all students attending third level education courses in respect of fees, grants and access to facilities.  It is a philosophy which aims to increase participation rates in third level education among those groups in our society who up to now have not been participants, that is, those people who have effectively been excluded from our system of education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the White Paper, a major policy objective of the Government is to promote equality and access to higher education irrespective of social class, age or disability for all who have the capacity to benefit from it. Where participation and achievement in the education system are impeded by physical, mental, economic or social factors, the State should seek to eliminate or compensate for the sources and consequences of the social disadvantage. These aims form part of the Government's commitment to equality through education.  I understand that part of the process is the abolishment of third level fees.  However, the Government's <Col N="246" /> decision to exclude evening undergraduates doing the same degree as day students is a glaring inequality.</P>
    <P>There was considerable anger and disbelief among mature students at the decision to exclude them from the Minister's budgetary package.  They believe it is unfair that Labour Party Ministers, who should be the first to redress social inequality, have introduced this arbitrary action.  All the reports commissioned over the last few years clearly highlighted the plight of students doing evening or distance learning.  The de Buitléir report argues essentially for free fees for all.  It argued that those who cannot afford to pay for third level education should be supported by grants while those who are better off, and therefore able to pay, should receive a less or zero grant.</P>
    <P>It is widely accepted that the present third level grants system is totally inequitable and discriminates in an appalling manner against the PAYE sector.  The de Buitléir report argues that the major beneficiaries of the student support system are not those families in the lowest income groups. The Minister has ignored the recommendation of the de Buitléir report relating to mature students.  Mature students or part-time evening students are not entitled to any maintenance grants.  Those studying in full-time day courses are eligible for higher education grants.  The problem is that, regardless of the age of mature students, they are means tested based on their parents income if they are living at home.  The de Buitléir report recommends that mature applicants over the age of 25 years should be means tested on their income, regardless of residence.  It is very disappointing that this has not happened. In Northern Ireland students can get additional grants, not only for themselves but for their spouses, and child support.</P>
    <P>The only reason offered for excluding evening undergraduates from the decision to abolish fees has been a lack of financial resources.  Some have said it is because of the part-time nature of the <Col N="247" /> courses.  A student doing a modular arts degree over four years, with two modules each year, must attend ten hours of lectures per week, submit essays and also have continuous assessment.  As well as holding down a job or rearing a family, the modular arts students would attend two or three hours four nights a week and submit essays.  This could hardly be called a part-time course.  A family with a fairly large income does not have to pay any fees for a son or daughter who is attending about ten hours of lectures a week at our expense. What is equal about that?  It is hard to sustain that kind of thinking.</P>
    <P>Much lip service has been paid to second chance education, but there has been little action.  We are told that everyone needs to upgrade their qualifications and skills and it is time that more practical supports were put in place to facilitate this.  Abolishing fees for night students would be a good start. Part-time courses entail full-time fees. This is evident when one compares the cost of night courses with day courses. For a day time arts students in UCD the cost is £1,600; a night time modular arts student will cost, per module, £644.  A day time student over three years will cost £4,800; night time modular arts students over four years &mdash; it takes an extra year to undertake the night course &mdash; will cost £5,152, a difference of £352. Now that fees have been abolished for the day student, this discrimination against the night student is even more obvious.  The night student still has to pay.  Is this fair?</P>
    <P>Night students also have to pay double taxation in that they are contributing from their taxes while a young day student, whose family is wealthy, can attend university for free.  Ordinary taxpayers, who fund the abolition of fees and the education of such students, cannot avail of this.  The Government, which contains the Labour Party and Democratic Left, who claim to represent the workers and ordinary people, is responsible for the present situation. Were these parties not aware of the <Col N="248" /> anger of the PAYE sector when the Government did not address this matter?</P>
    <P>A two tier university system has evolved from the present situation. There are people who wish to undertake a night course; for example, they may have to upgrade their educational qualifications for their present job or they may not be able to attend the day time course because of other commitments. However, while the day courses are free, those who must avail of night courses will have to pay.  This does not encourage second chance education.</P>
    <P>All reports from the universities indicate that those who are committed to a night course have, more often than not, obtained better results than day time students.  By contrast, night time students must work to a time table and every hour is precious.  Such students obtain better results, but they must pay while the day student does not &mdash; they are students at our expense.  There is something radically wrong when we find ourselves in this situation.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why we did not take this further step which would have meant so much for those students who are dying for the opportunity to get back into the education system.  Many women whose children are at school need to get back out into the working environment.  They find themselves deprived because they must pay to do so.  Very often they start courses but, within six months or so, they must give them up for financial reasons.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider the motion and make a commitment to ensure that night students, and those discriminated against, will be brought into the fold so that this time next year we do not have to make a case for them in the House.  In addition, there are many VTOS students in a similar situation; they have the ability to pursue a third level course but cannot because of the fees, the cost of books, the time allocation and lack of grants.  This motion presents the Minister with a golden opportunity to get this matter right.</P>
    <Col N="249" />
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. At the outset, I compliment the Minister on the positive things she has achieved in the Department of Education since her appointment as Minister. The various initiatives in the area of third level education, which are outlined in the Government amendment to the motion, are all welcome, and the Minister is to be commended for their introduction.</P>
      <P>However, I strongly support the case which the proposer of the motion, Senator Ormonde, has made to the Minister to abolish third level tuition fees for evening and part-time students. I do so for two reasons.  First, in the interest of promoting equality of access to third level education and, second, to ensure that evening and part-time students in third level institutions will not see themselves and will not feel discriminated against <i>vis-á-vis</i> their full-time counterparts.</P>
      <P>It is a fact that numbers in third level education in Ireland have grown almost five fold in the past 30 years, which is to be welcomed.  It is also true that the percentage of second level school leavers who proceed directly to third level education is increasing all the time. However, the real facts are that this percentage increase, and the bulk of the increase in overall numbers, are mainly accounted for by the very high participation rate of students from better off backgrounds.</P>
      <P>In addition, by comparison with other EU countries, the overall participation rate in third level education in Ireland has some catching up to do.  The reason for this is that in Ireland, the participation of students from the lower socioeconomic groups in third level education has not increased at anything like the same rate as that of their better off counterparts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since it is, therefore, mainly students from less well off backgrounds who do not proceed directly to third level education, the likelihood is that it is from the ranks of such school leavers that the majority of evening and part-time students will later come.  Many of these <Col N="250" /> will be individuals who would have wished to go directly into third level but, for social or economic reasons, were unable to do so at the time.  In view of their lack of qualifications, the likelihood is that, as a general rule, the employment which would be available to such persons would mainly be low paid.</P>
    <P>The challenge, therefore, to people who champion equality of access to third level education is to devise strategies and provide incentives which will encourage as many as possible of these individuals to avail of third level as mature or part-time students.  At present, the position is that participation at third level, either as a mature or part-time student, is seen as the exception rather than the rule.  This is a perception we should be seeking to change, but it will never change if we put barriers or disincentives in the way of those whom we should be targeting as potential participants.</P>
    <P>One of the most effective incentives that could be provided to encourage people who had dropped out at second level or after leaving certificate to return to education would be the abolition of fees for evening and part-time students.  Those members of the work-force who are sufficiently committed to become participants in third level courses should be encouraged, and their commitment should be recognised and acknowledged in a concrete and tangible manner.  The best way of doing this would be by abolishing the tuition fees for such students.</P>
    <P>If we are genuine in our desire to promote equality of access to third level education the State must facilitate access for mature and part-time students.  These will mainly be people who wish to improve their skills or study for enhanced job qualifications while remaining in full-time employment.  The objective should be to encourage more and more such students to avail of the opportunities which are offered by evening and part-time courses.</P>
    <P>For the majority of such students, participation in third level education <Col N="251" /> involves many sacrifices; some are married, rearing families, meeting mortgage commitments and so on and some are possibly working long hours in low paid employment.  Not alone are there sacrifices for the participants themselves, there are also sacrifices for their spouses and families.  Such students forfeit their free time and their weekends in order to study.  For some, the distances they have to travel to courses involves considerable additional expense on top of the fees they have to pay.  Many such students are taxpayers, and in most cases PAYE taxpayers.  As such, in addition to paying their own fees, they will now be contributing, through their taxation, to pay for the abolition of fees for the undergraduates, many of whom would not be under anything like the same financial pressure as many of the part time or evening students.</P>
    <P>In the context of equality of access to third level education, the abolition of fees in the case of part-time and evening students would have a far greater positive impact than the abolition of fees for full-time day students.  Such a move would, in the long term, become self-financing to a great extent.  After graduating with improved skills and enhanced qualifications such students would contribute far more than previously to the economy, both in terms of productivity and the taxes they would pay as a result of their improved earning potential.</P>
    <P>There is another reason it would be desirable to have a substantial increase in the number of part-time and evening students in our third level institutions. Such a development would help to maximise the use of existing facilities. Surely that is something for which we should strive and which a Government should have as its objective.  Our third level facilities and resources were provided at considerable cost and it is important that the maximum benefit to the public should be derived from them.</P>
    <P>I am the first to admit that the blanket abolition of fees for part-time and evening students would benefit a small minority for whom the payment of fees <Col N="252" /> would impose no hardship.  However, in terms of percentages, that minority would be far less than the number of full-time students from extremely wealthy backgrounds who will benefit from the abolition of tuition fees. Accordingly, I appeal to the Minister to accede to the reasonable request being made of her this evening on behalf of third level evening and part-time students.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;commends the Minister for Education for her various initiatives in the area of third level education including in particular, the abolition of a separate attainments requirement for eligibility for student support, the introduction of new rules for grant eligibility for second chance students, the provision of a discretionary budget to set up a hardship fund with the third level institutions, and the abolition of fees for full-time undergraduate students; and welcomes her support in principle for the provision of more Exchequer funding for evening and part-time students at third level as soon as the availability of resources will allow.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am happy to move this amendment. The Minister is becoming a regular visitor and I hope that will continue. Members have an abiding interest in education and we want every opportunity to discuss it.  I welcome the motion proposed by Fianna Fáil because it offers us an opportunity to discuss an important topic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most Members will accept the validity of the amendment and particularly the last part in which the Minister makes a definite commitment to what is sought by the Opposition.  I doubt that anybody could disagree with the last clause of the amendment.  She is making a full and <Col N="253" /> absolute commitment within the constraints under which she must operate.</P>
    <P>The case has been well made by Senator Ormonde and Senator Mullooly. However, there are gaps in the information being presented to the House.  The number of evening and part-time students attending third level colleges is substantial.  A few years ago a survey was carried out on behalf of the Minister and at that time the number was 24,000 students.  That is a large number.  A further analysis of those students provides additional information which is necessary to fully understand the wide difference between the difficulties faced by full-time students and by the cohort of evening students.  Many evening students have full-time jobs, for example, so their financial difficulties would be minimal. Many of them would also have support from their employers.  When those factors and the fact that most people on evening courses would be available for daytime or part-time employment are taken into account, the necessity to abolish such fees is not the same as it is for day students.  That puts the issue into perspective.</P>
    <P>I agree with many of the points made by the previous speakers.  Many people finish their education with the leaving certificate and for various reasons they decide not to continue to third level. Later &mdash; and this is particularly noticeable when speaking to past pupils &mdash; one discovers a motivation for such people to get back into the system.  It is impossible for some of them because of where they live &mdash; whether they live near or far from a college &mdash; and their commitments.  Given that we are interested in expanding third level education to the maximum limit possible, this issue deserves serious examination and the Minister is prepared to give it such a commitment.</P>
    <P>Many people contact us at regular intervals when they apply for a third level grant and, because of their circumstances, they end up applying for an evening course but they cannot get it because of the regulations.  I have been <Col N="254" /> approached by a number of women who have young children and are trying to rear them alone.  They are anxious to get into the education system by going down that route.  However, it is blocked to them because usually they have little means and find it impossible to take on such a commitment on their own.  If such people &mdash; and we can think of many others who are in different situations &mdash; were given some support they would be able to get back into the system and get great value from it.  They would also add value to the communities and the economies in which they live and work.</P>
    <P>There are compelling reasons we should ask the Minister to look at this. I have always held the view that we should try to expand third level education in a different way from the traditional way.  It might be possible, for example, for the Minister to discuss with the universities the possibility of putting some day courses on in the evening.  The cost of expanding the system might then be less.  The buildings would be available because the day students would have left.  That might be a cost effective way of achieving the objective.  I am sure the Minister will look at that possibility.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty with the motion. The Opposition need not press it to a vote because the Minister accepts, given the constraints under which a Minister must operate, what is sought by the main Opposition party.  I have difficulty with the amendment proposed by the Progressive Democrats.  It is almost a negative of the original motion and appears to move away from the move the Minister has made to introduce free third level education this year.  That was an important decision.  It will make third level education more popular and enable more people to remain in education for a longer period and to secure better qualifications.  I support that policy. The old system where non-grant aided people could use various mechanisms to educate their children was inequitable.  The rich were the main beneficiaries.  The new system is equitable <Col N="255" /> and achieves an important objective &mdash; to make third level education more accessible.  Eventually there will be a greater number of people in third level education.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with the attitude of the Progressive Democrats.  However, there is no reason there should be a vote on this matter.  Perhaps the main Opposition party will see that there is no point in being divisive.  We are all agreed on the basic point.</P>

      <P>It is important to congratulate the Minister on the initiative she has taken in third level education. She is aware of my view that I would prefer if it was taken in a different way &mdash; if the threshold had been raised and a tax rebate had been given instead. However, this is second chance education for an important group of people. It is important to recognise what night students can and have contributed to Irish life.</P>
      <P>The decision not to extend free fees to night students is a disincentive to study.  This is particularly painful for the disadvantaged who would normally be entitled to free fees but who cannot afford to maintain themselves in college and, therefore, have to work during the day in order to get to college at night. They are being hit on the double as they cannot avail of free fees as day students and have to pay fees to attend as night students.  I ask the Minister to put it to the Government that this is in direct contravention of the spirit and intention of a number of international conventions under the ILO on paid educational leave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Next year, when the Irish Government shares the European Presidency, is the European year of life long education and learning.  It would be extraordinarily embarassing for us, in a year <Col N="256" /> when we are encouraging people to participate in life long learning, if they could not avail of free fees.  In terms of Government policy and the policies of the trade union movement and employers' groups, which recognise the direct relationship between educational qualifications and employment, it is crucially important to establish that those who seek further qualifications in order to develop in employment are those who will create and gain employment. It is also crucial on this day, when the Government issued a statement about the low level of investment in research and development in this country, that we be seen to encourage people to continue to study and develop themselves.</P>
    <P>There is a global understanding that the idea of a job for life no longer exists. There will be an increasing need for people to change and be flexible in their approach to their working lives.  Many people will have to change jobs between four and seven times in the course of their career.  The habit of studying to increase qualifications is very important and should be helped in every way possible. We have a duty to encourage people to take advantage of educational opportunities and reducing those opportunities is a move in the wrong direction. It is particularly difficult to accept when the Minister, as part of her project &mdash; for which she is to be complimented &mdash; in extending third level places, last year also made a point about increased places for evening and night students. That was a progressive move, but it is negated by the fact that those participating in it are treated as second class citizens in comparison with their day time colleagues.</P>
    <P>Time and again the Minister has referred to second chance education, which normally refers to people who have not been able to get the most out of first chance education.  She has made a very strong appeal and case for support for those people.  However, there is another kind of second chance education which is for those people who do not have literacy or numeracy problems but who feel that they have a second <Col N="257" /> chance to develop themselves, which should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>I encourage the Minister to take the view of the House tonight and to take the Government spokesperson's advice and not push a vote but simply withdraw the amendment and accept the motion.  That is the best advice which will be given here tonight.  I thank the Minister and I want her to support the very valid points which we made here tonight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mind admitting that, while I admire a great deal of what the Minister has done in higher education, I am somewhat emotionally engaged in this issue because I teach extensive numbers of night students and, therefore, I see individual faces in front of me when I think of the sacrifices made by quite a number of them in terms of money, time and commitment. Any night lecturer will say that the motivation of evening students tends to be higher than day students.  They are self starters and self selected and many of them put themselves at very inconsiderable physical, familial and other inconveniences in order to take up chances which were not available to them before.  They could not avail of opportunities which a somewhat younger generation &mdash; perhaps only five or ten years younger &mdash; have now.</P>
      <P>What I loosely refer to as &ldquo;ageism&rdquo; is one of the most important and underrated inequities in our society.  We have an attitude towards education that it is somehow parcelled off from life and ends at a particular age &mdash; 14, 16, 18, 21 or 22 years.  Once one obtains one's degree one has a further 60 years of post education life expectancy.  We have to change our whole concept of the place of education in individual lives and society as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I freely admit to becoming agitated about the night degree issue because it is sending all the wrong signals to the whole adult education area.  The sentiments of the White Paper are admirable. A major policy objective of the <Col N="258" /> Government is &ldquo;to promote equality of access to higher education, irrespective of social class, age or disability, for all who have the capacity to benefit from it&rdquo;.  The capacity of the age category to benefit is demonstrated by those who sign up for evening degrees.  One is talking about people who deserve that investment in individual terms and are worth it in societal terms.  I will not linger over that and go into detail as that has already been done very effectively.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole made the point about the necessity to adapt to change throughout life, which we must build into our whole way of looking at matters. Adult education is not simply a topping up luxury and must be regarded as integral to the whole education system. We have to change the mind cast we all inherited in terms of education being sectioned off from life.</P>
    <P>The distinction between full-time and part-time occurs all the time in the departmental literature.  The steering committee on higher education, which reported to the HEA, said that this is a very unhelpful distinction and does not exist in most European countries.  It makes no sense pedagogically.  If Senator Cotter's proposal to move some of the day students to the evening was taken on board, they would be redefined as part-time students, although they were doing the same intensity of work.  For the money they pay, night students effectively gain no access to the whole range of university life experienced by day students.  Introducing this discrimination creates a grievance where none existed and is charging for a lesser service than that received by the day students.</P>
    <P>On a variety of grounds, I urge the Minister to give this the highest possible priority.  As our amendment suggests, the timing is very apposite to try to get it through Cabinet this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach) Niamh Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to confirm for the Senators my strong personal commitment to following the major policy objective of the Government, which <Col N="259" /> Senator Lee has just quoted, to &ldquo;promote equality of access to higher education, irrespective of social class, age or disability, for all who have the capacity to benefit from it&rdquo;.  Much progress has been made over the last 20 years in opening up access to third level education to students from a wider range of socio-economic backgrounds.  I have, in turn, taken a range of measures to advance this policy objective.</P>
      <P>Since I became Minister for Education, I have continued and intensified the process of increasing participation in third level.  I have continued the process of improving and reforming the third level student support system.  I introduced improvements in relation to academic attainments requirements.  Up to 1994, students were required to have obtained a minimum of two grade Cs in higher level papers in the leaving certificate in order to satisfy the academic requirements for eligibility for higher education grants.  With effect from 1994 the academic requirements of the scheme were deemed to be met by students who secured a college place.</P>
      <P>I introduced new rules for second chance cases.  This is to ensure that students who did not complete studies at a particular level will be eligible to apply for grants to study again at the same level after an interval of five years.</P>
      <P>I provided a discretionary budget in 1994 so as to set up a hardship fund with the third level institutions to support students with disabilities.  In 1995 an allocation of £100,000 is available to the colleges to assist students experiencing short term financial difficulties.  The provision is intended to complement the existing student support arrangements. A further allocation of £105,000 is being allocated to assist students suffering from disabilities.</P>
      <P>I have also ensured that the value of maintenance allowances for third level students are preserved by increasing the maintenance grants in line with inflation and the income limits for the means test in line with movements in the average industrial wage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="260" /> The awarding bodies were given discretion, for the first time in 1993, to renew grants and scholarships for repeat years, in exceptional circumstances, in cases of certified serious illness.  This was in direct response to a need which was identified by me as causing serious distress and financial difficulties for such students.</P>
    <P>I took steps to have the student support schemes issued to the local authorities and vocational education committees at end April-early May in 1994 and 1995.  This contrasts with the position in 1993 when those schemes were not ready until mid-August.  Further improvements are also planned to assist students to pursue third level studies. The Minister for Finance announced in his Financial Statement that provision will be made for tax relief on fees paid to private colleges in respect of approved courses.  This relief will be introduced for the academic year 1996-97. It is also intended that maintenance grants under the higher education grants scheme will be extended to approved courses being followed by Irish students abroad with effect from the 1996-97 academic year.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Education highlights that during the period 1980 to 1992 rates of admission to higher education increased from 20 per cent to 36 per cent of the relevant age groups.  The participation rates increased for all socio-economic groups except the salaried employees group.  It was against this background and in accordance with the Government of Renewal policy agreement that I commenced the process of abolishing tuition fees for third level full time undergraduate courses this year.  I was prompted to pursue this initiative by the widespread concern about the equity of the student grants scheme and by the regressive impact of the income tax relief for covenants.</P>
    <P>This initiative marks a watershed in the development of higher education in Ireland.  For the first time this year, we join the mainstream of European education in having higher education available to full-time undergraduates without <Col N="261" /> payment of tuition fees.  This is an achievement of extraordinary significance. It brings higher education centre stage.  It demonstrates in the clearest way possible that higher education is for all, without barriers of income, social status or family background.  Moreover, the abolition of full-time undergraduate tuition fees has been achieved at minimal cost to the State by linking it with abolition of covenant tax relief.  Thus the highly regressive covenant tax relief which meant that high earners gained more has been replaced by the abolition of tuition fees which is of equal benefit to all.</P>
    <P>I have also placed on the public record my commitment to improving the participation at third level of students from disadvantaged socio-economic groups.  It is important to emphasise that ensuring greater participation by these students is not solely related to financial considerations.  An essential prerequisite to fuller participation in third level is ensuring that these students stay in full-time education until they are 18 years of age.  To achieve this a wide range of initiatives have been introduced and taken by me. These include targeting of resources on disadvantaged areas, the provision of educational support services for students, including psychological and guidance services, career guidance and remedial teachers, the continuing development of the home school-links service, a major restructuring of the senior cycle curricula to adapt it to the needs of a wider spread of ability levels and backgrounds proceeding to senior cycle and the introduction of alternative pathways for students to progress to post second level education and training.</P>
    <P>The importance for students of completion of second level education is emphasised in the finding of the ESRI report <i>Poverty and Time: Perspectives on the Dynamics of Poverty</i> in its finding that:</P>
    <P>the risk of poverty... is about five times as high for someone with no <Col N="262" /> qualifications as it is for someone with the leaving certificate.</P>
    <P>The operational programmes for the use of Structural Funds contains resource provision for a range of initiatives, ranging from early childhood intervention programmes, up to the restructuring of the senior cycle with the objective of having a 90 per cent completion rate of senior cycle education by the end of the decade.  As the objective is attained the participation rates of students from lower socio-economic backgrounds in third level will inevitably increase.</P>
    <P>I have also supported the development of links between disadvantaged schools and third level institutions. Initiatives in this area include arrangements between Ballymun Comprehensive School and Dublin City University, between Southhill area in Limerick and the University of Limerick, between schools in Tallaght and the regional technical college, between Trinity College and Dublin inner city schools. These links are in line with the commitment in the White Paper which indicates that</P>
    <P>Each third level institution will be encouraged to develop links with designated second level schools, building on existing good practice.</P>
    <P>I have also taken a number of steps since coming into office to provide more places, more buildings and more facilities in all third level institutions.  Funding of the universities since I became Minister for Education has increased from £137 million to £179 million &mdash; an increase of more than one third in three years.  Even more dramatic has been the increase in grants for the running costs of the regional technical colleges &mdash; up from £86 million to £132 million since I came in to office &mdash; an increase of more than half.</P>
    <P>This increased funding has facilitated a major expansion in the number of third level places.  In the universities, since I came into office the numbers have risen by almost one sixth.  In the regional technical colleges, the numbers <Col N="263" /> have increased by more than one sixth. Thus in the last three years alone, some 14,200 additional third level places have become available to our young people.</P>
    <P>In addition to these places, I announced in mid-September the provision of a further 6,200 places in the university sector over the next five years.  These places will be allocated among the seven universities and will be funded by a combination of public and private sector finance.  This is the first time that public and private funding has been used in this way and it marks a new departure in the development of third level education.</P>
    <P>Increases in recurrent grants have been matched by increases in capital funding.  Under the 1994-99 National Plan, more than £120 million, at 1994 prices, will be spent on improved facilities in third level institutions.  The programme is targeted at 23 separate third level institutions.  I am pleased to say that a number of the new projects, involving an expenditure of around £36 million in 1995, has already been commenced and that others are at an advanced stage of planning.  On completion, these important new facilities will ensure the continuing relevance of programmes to the needs of the individual, society and the economy and bring about improved economic growth and job creation.</P>
    <P>In 1992-93 almost 24,000 students were registered for part-time programmes in higher education.  About 60 per cent of the total were in the non-university sector.  About 58 per cent were attending certificate or diploma programmes, 25 per cent undergraduate degree programmes and 12 per cent post graduate programmes.  Almost 90 per cent of part-time students were in employment.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that I recognise that part-time courses constitute a significant and important part of our higher education system.  The importance of the role of part-time third level education has not been fully appreciated in the past.  One has only to consider how the concept of <Col N="264" /> life long learning is now firmly established as an imperative for any society which wants to adapt to social, economic and cultural change.  Part-time courses fulfil many important roles, including providing educational opportunities for those who missed the opportunity of benefiting from further or higher education before entering the labour market; enabling people to enhance or update their existing expertise or qualification levels; enabling them to qualify in a new field as part of career advancement; and enabling them to broaden their own expertise by adding another qualification or enhance their general education.</P>
    <P>For a great many part-time undergraduate students, the great majority of whom as already mentioned are employed, the tuition fees are met by their employers.  The extra cost of extending free tuition to all part-time undergraduates could be up to £13 million per annum.</P>
    <P>There is a limit, dictated by the availability of resources, to the number of progressive initiatives which may be introduced at any one time by a Minister for Education.  Choices have to be made.  Resource constraints required me to confine the abolition of fees initiative to full-time undergraduate students attending publicly funded and certain other designated third level institutions.</P>
    <P>I hope, however, that as resources become available it will be possible in my time as Minister to provide more Exchequer support for third level undergraduate students attending courses at night or on a part-time basis. I am aware of the importance of part-time courses.  Through providing more funding, more places and more facilities, I have supported these courses in the past.  I will continue to support them in future and I will need the support of Senators in that initiative.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened carefully to the Minister's speech.  She is trying to achieve things in education and we all have to listen when she speaks.  I share Senator Lee's passion for night-time <Col N="265" /> students.  Due to economic circumstances I was unable to study for my leaving certificate as a day student.  I studied as a night student for my A levels, B.Comm. and other post-graduate qualifications.  I lecture to night-time students.  I am biased in this regard but I believe night students are a special breed.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that throughout the Minister's speech the discriminatory attitude with regard to full-time and night-time students, which has always been observed by the Department, is reflected again.  This is reprehensible. The promotion of equality of access to higher education, irrespective of social class, age and desirability, for all who have the capacity to benefit from such education, is a noble aspiration and it should be politically supported by all. Students who attend colleges and universities at night are also entitled to sign up for this aspiration.  The Minister's conscious decision to exclude part-time and night-time students from the decisions on third level fees is particularly mean spirited and illogical.</P>
      <P>Other speakers have already highlighted the sacrifices night students make.  Their cause has been eloquently espoused, particularly by Senator Lee, Senator O'Toole and Senator Mullooly. Their cause was articulately put outside Leinster House last night by representatives of the faculties of different universities. In third level education there is a real commitment to supporting students who cannot attend during the day.</P>
      <P>Senator Lee is correct when he points out that night-time students are particularly discriminated against.  They cannot participate in the life of universities, they cannot use the libraries in most universities, their access to support systems is limited and through their taxes &mdash; the Minister correctly pointed out that the bulk of night-time students are in employment &mdash; they contribute not just to education in general but to the third level education of those who, for whatever reason, are more privileged than they and can afford day rather than night education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="266" /> The decision is illogical.  As the dean from the arts faculty in UCD pointed out at a public meeting outside Leinster House last night, the capital investment has been made by the State &mdash; this was implicit in Senator Cotter's contribution &mdash; in the machinery and physical features of our universities and third level colleges.  The intellectual capital is already in place.  One of the huge assets we have in third level education is an extraordinary amount of spare capacity after conventional hours.  This unfortunate and reprehensible decision is a step backwards because it does not encourage universities, third level colleges and other institutions to think creatively about how we can provide places for a wider range of people.</P>
    <P>As Senator O'Toole correctly pointed out, if Senator Cotter's sane suggestion was implemented, the people who would attend third level during less conventional hours would be classified by the Department as part-time students and the decision with regard to fees would not apply to them.</P>
    <P>People who have been hit by this decision cannot afford to be so affected. By their feet and actions they have indicated their personal interest in education. It is particularly cruel that the Department should deny them access to all the supports the State provides to people more privileged than they. Second chance education is important and I compliment, support and acknowledge the Minister's efforts in this regard.</P>
    <P>A high proportion of people who go to university by night are women; they cannot afford to attend during conventional hours.  This decision discriminates against not only people who already pay taxes but also against many women who are not allowed the opportunity to go back to college.  I have spoken to many women who participate in part-time courses provided by colleges.  They yearn to attend third level education and would delight in the intellectual challenge of taking a degree course but they cannot afford it.  Even though the Department &mdash; I compliment the Minister <Col N="267" /> on this &mdash; has made specific efforts to give a small proportion of women the supports provided by special schemes, it is denying many women the opportunity to participate in third level education.</P>
    <P>I would also argue, without in any way wishing to be personal, that certain of the arguments put forward by the Minister are not logical.  As was eloquently argued last night by a number of academic contributors, the physical and intellectual capital has already been invested.  The Minister pointed out that some 90 per cent of part-time students are in employment.  My response to this is, so what?  A high proportion of them are public servants whose fees are paid. The net additional imposition on the State's coffers of moving in the direction we are urging the Minister to go would not be that great because a high proportion of these students are already being paid by the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The Minister is doing her best within the constraints of budgets.  Every Minister for Education would wish to do more than the constraints imposed by the Department of Finance permit.  I strongly suggest to the Minister that it should not be necessary to press this issue to a vote because we are asking for logic, justice and a fair break for people who have made great sacrifices.  The Minister, the Government and the Department should recognise this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to clarify that point because I look askance at this issue.</P>
      <P>I support the call to abolish fees for third level students who study at night or on a part-time basis.  I realise the imposition they place on people who are working and struggling to pay fees.  The Minister can only take one step at a time and she is taking enormous steps in pre-school, primary and secondary education.  The abolition of fees was a major step in third level education.  The Minister's decision to abolish fees for third level undergraduates was not intended to discriminate against anyone; it should be seen as a first step towards improving this area.</P>
      <P>Senator Ormonde outlined the fees being paid by night students.  She proved that night students pay more for the same degree than day students.  Universities should consider this point.  Senator O'Toole mentioned that night students cannot avail of the facilities offered by universities, including libraries.  It seems that the universities are charging more for a product which is less than what they are offering to day students.  The Director of Consumer Affairs should examine this issue.  Universities should also examine the impact of the abolition of fees for night students.  Will they be able to cope with the increased demand for evening courses?  Will they be able to cope with the influx of students if fees are abolished?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point has been made that these students would be better educated and would, therefore, be able to contribute more to the economy.  Businesses should have an input into the courses available for night students.  If courses were tailor made to suit particular <Col N="269" /> industries and they benefited from them, they should contribute to the costs.  The State should not have to support everything.  Industries should underline the achievements made at third level.</P>
    <P>This debate has focused on third level education, but little attention has been given to adult education.  We take it for granted that people who study at night have passed second level education, but many people only have primary education. If I was the Minister and had £13 million to spend, I would try to help those who only have primary education, the intermediate certificate or a pass leaving certificate so that they could improve their skills at second level before concentrating on third level education. We are putting the cart before the horse by placing so much emphasis on third level education, although it is essential in any society which wants to move into the 21st century.  We need to keep up with our counterparts in Europe.  I do not want to underestimate the value of third level education, but the debate should also include other aspects of education.  We should examine where the money can be used and we should not expect it to come from the State.  We need a more focused approach to the issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>She said that choices must be made, therefore she had to discriminate. However, is it right to discriminate against night and part-time students? Part-time students are not the only <Col N="270" /> issue.  Another issue is whether the money should be spent on maintenance support.  The students whose fees are paid for them still cannot afford to go to university because they do not have maintenance.  There is a maintenance grant system, but even that puts a burden on the students and their family. Should the money be better spent in this way?</P>
      <P>Post-graduate students are often research students.  We are in danger of investing heavily in education while the brightest students go abroad.  Yet these are the people we need if we want to create high technology jobs and entrepreneurs in this area.  We will invest money to educate these students to a certain level, but we will not allocate money to them to continue their research.  As a result, they will leave this country.</P>
      <P>The problem has many facets.  The first is free fees at university level, and I welcome the Minister's decision in this regard.  The second is maintenance support for disadvantaged students, but we have not moved far on that point.  The third is free fees for postgraduate students and the fourth is free fees for part-time and evening students.  We could also add those who participate in distance education.  These four areas have worthy claims on whatever resources are available.</P>
      <P>How will we pay for this proposal? Since I came into this House almost three years ago I am reluctant to propose or support anything without clearly stating where we will get the money to pay for it.  Will we raise taxes to pay for it, cut back in another area or remove a tax concession, which the Minister said she would do to pay for undergraduate fees?  How much money will be saved by removing the tax concessions on covenants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to this debate with two issues in mind.  First, on the assumption that we cannot do everything, should this issue take priority?  I suggest there are at least two or three other issues. Second, if this is the issue to which we should attach priority, how will we finance <Col N="271" /> it?  I would be happy with this proposal if we stated how to finance it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Quinn for sharing his time with me.  Nobody underestimates the Minister's commitment to improving the participation of students from disadvantaged socio-economic groups at third level.  I have experience &mdash; if in a small way &mdash; of how the Minister provided help to the College of Marketing and Design in the Summerhill area to encourage women to participate.  The Minister has done much to encourage the participation in part-time third level education of women from that area, which is one of the most deprived areas in the city.</P>
      <P>It is important to point out that it is often people from disadvantaged areas who are in part-time or night time education. The Dublin Institute of Technology has more part-time students than full-time students, although admittedly a large number are apprentices.  They are genuine students and some are funded by Departments or the industries for which they work.  However, for many it is a serious strain on their pockets. It is a ladder of opportunity and means that people from these areas who could not have become involved in third level education previously have been able to go to the various colleges of the institute and take part in all types of courses from professional degrees in science, law, engineering and business to music, the arts and arts subjects in general.</P>
      <P>We must not under-estimate the trickle down effect of people participating in third level education.  It is beneficial if children at school see their parents and older brothers and sisters becoming involved in education.  They may not have been in a position to go to college the first time around, but they are able to return to get further qualifications. The Minister is aware this aspect is important in terms of employment nowadays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Quinn's point about post-graduate fees.  This is a <Col N="272" /> serious problem and I wrote to the Ministers for Finance and Education about it.  We are losing a considerable number of post-graduate students because they can no longer receive the benefit of covenants from the point of view of tax.  I realise covenants were being abused in other areas, but I am sorry they were not retained for post-graduate students.  As Senator Quinn said, we lose some of our brightest and best students.  Although we do not want the universities to be the same as science parks, they are setting up an enormous number of projects which are of benefit within a short time to industries in this country.  As the Minister is aware, I am of the view that they should be involved in long-term basic research also because Ireland cannot just look at short term prospects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on her work in the entire area of education.  I agree with previous speakers that the more one does, the more one is asked to do.  This is the nature of our business.  We should not under-estimate the importance of part-time third level education and I wish to inform Senator Roche that he is not the only person who studied in such a fashion.  I was in my mid-20s before I had the opportunity to go to third level. I enjoyed the opportunity to spend six years studying and I was glad to do so at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot under-estimate the value of part-time third level education in the present day.  It is accepted by those who understand developments, particularly in industry from where I came, that careers, industry and commerce are changing so fast.  If people's qualifications are not updated or they do not obtain other qualifications, their information, qualification and training can become redundant in anything from ten <Col N="273" /> to 20 years.  In the future people will retrain on an ongoing basis.  They will have several career changes throughout their working lives.  The day when people opted for secure, pensionable jobs after they did their degrees is gone. People will now have to take several degrees, continue in education and continually update their qualifications.  This will be the norm if one is to survive in the employment area in the future.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelly made a good point about the contribution of industry. However, industry is contributing and always did so in this area.  Many good firms, especially in the private sector, supported their employees in taking degrees at night and paid their fees.  This should be encouraged, but we should also recognise that it has been happening for many years.  Companies have policies in this area and they should be encouraged to do so.  Progressive companies view it as an investment from which they will profit and there is a plus to the organisation from doing so.</P>
    <P>The abolition of third level fees was a most important move for many people on the margins of qualification.  People within the income levels obtained grants and those who were rich had covenants. The fees were paid for both groups. However, those in the middle pay for everything.  They do not have medical cards and they pay their income tax. They are trying to survive on moderate incomes and these people will benefit from the measure.  They benefited from very little in the past and this is the first substantial concession for people in that bracket in many years.  I assure the Minister that people in that situation to whom I spoke appreciate that their position and difficulties have been recognised. One of my family is attending third level and I speak to parents in a similar situation.  They recognise that some of the burden has been removed from them.  There are still many expenses, especially if there are three or four children at third level, a position experienced by many families.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelly commented on the development of second level education. <Col N="274" /> but I would move it back to primary education for many people.  In our work we encounter people who are illiterate. I come across many such people in my area because there are many travellers there.  Many people come to me and say they cannot fill out forms because they are not scholars.  I encounter this all the time and many people at primary level need encouragement and investment in their education, as Senator Kelly said.  It is a question of the allocation of resources.  The aim should be that all third level education should be funded, but when we can afford it and we can ensure that our priorities are right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposers of the motion have astutely spotted and put their fingers on a glaring anomaly in the Minister's education policy.  This was not properly thought out when, in a grand gesture, the Minister decided to announce free third level education for all.  Suddenly, there is now a case of discrimination, which was not thought out either.  I do not approve of the grand gesture in itself because it is not enough. It defies and contradicts the principle contained in the Programme for Government which states:</P>
      <P>A major policy objective of the Government is to promote equality of access to higher education, irrespective of social class, age or disability, for all who have the capacity to benefit from it.</P>
      <P>However, those who possess more money and higher incomes can benefit more easily; those who possess smaller incomes and less money cannot benefit. People who have made a dedication in terms of evening and part-time education are being discriminated against because the Minister has stated that the resources are not available.  Of course the resources are unavailable. Resources are not available to pay for free education as announced.  Free education as announced by the Minister discriminates in favour of the rich.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By not conceding to this motion the Minister simply underlines that particular <Col N="275" /> problem which she created when she announced free education.  We should return to the drawing board and reconsider education policy for third level specifically.  We should consider those people whose situation has been made worse by the Minister's education policy and begin again.  This motion is laudable. It identifies one of the real anomalies and problems that are the result of a policy which was not properly thought out in the first place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion.  The Minister recently stated that there were 88,000 full-time enrolments in third level colleges in the year 1993-94.  This means that the figure has quadrupled since I entered university in 1969.  As one who availed of the third level grants scheme, I must acknowledge the benefit it represents for many people.  However, the Minister has been discriminatory towards a certain section of the population in the proposals she has introduced.</P>
      <P>When she became Minister, Deputy Bhreathnach established a committee to consider the question of third level student support in April 1993.  As part of its terms of reference that committee was required, among other things, to consider third level support schemes with reference to equity and financial capacity of parents of applicants to pay. The committee promptly completed its work and published its report later that year.  The report, known as the de Buitléir report, is an excellent document.  It points out that the existing system was unfair and sets out a clear list of practical proposals to make access to higher education more equitable.  This is something all Members would desire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report proposed radical improvements to the administration of the present grants system and a significant extension of that system.  It recommended that eligibility for grants should be extended to students attending courses at private colleges and those involved in distance learning courses <Col N="276" /> and certain courses outside Ireland which are not available here.  The Minister appears to have largely ignored the advice of the committee which she established.  Since the publication of the report the Minister has embarked on an entirely different course of action to that recommended by the expert committee. She abolished third level fees, an action which will be of benefit to those who already have access to third level education.  However, this measure does nothing to promote equity.</P>
    <P>The de Buitléir report, which focused much of its attention on the subject of equity in educational funding, made no such recommendation.  People believed, and the report recommended, that a reform of the grant system was required to make it fair and transparent.  As public representatives we are aware of cases where people with considerable wealth appear to qualify for grants while many with modest means are unable to satisfy criteria for qualification.  While serving as a member of Laois County Council I was provided with a list of those receiving grants from the Department of Education through the county council.  I was shocked by what I found.  The de Buitléir report highlighted the inadequacies of the present system in this regard because it pointed out that the current means test took no account of accumulated wealth in assessing ability to pay. Consequently, the means test was defective.</P>
    <P>Rather than changing a defective system, the Minister introduced a free fees system and people who are extremely well off can avail of it.  Anyone with children who will hopefully attend third level will not look a gift horse in the mouth.  However, there are many students who receive a full grant and still find it extremely difficult to attend college.  People whose parents claim social welfare and who do not live in a town or city where there is a third level institution have no hope of attending college.  If we are seeking equity in education, the issue should have been addressed in the way recommended by the de Buitléir committee.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="277" /> It seems unjust in the extreme to exclude evening and part-time students in third level institutions from the free fees scheme.  If the Minister is providing a free fees scheme, it is a total anomaly, as Senator Ross stated, to exclude one sector of the community from it.  The free fees scheme is being used as a vehicle to introduce further inequities into the education system.  Evening students in particular are among the most highly motivated people in the third level education system.  It takes much commitment to hold down a day job and face into a full schedule of lectures and tutorials following work.  The situation is even more difficult for those living some distance from a town with third level institution.  They often face long journeys by car or public transport to travel to and from college.  Those attending evening courses make substantial personal sacrifices and many of them pay income tax.  Surely it is incorrect that they be placed at a disadvantage, relative to day students, by being excluded from the fees scheme.</P>
    <P>An anomalous position also exists in relation to some private colleges.  The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland is one of our foremost education establishments. It has an international reputation for academic excellence and its students are drawn from a variety of social and economic backgrounds.  This college is excluded from the new scheme on the grounds that it is not State funded, is not part of the CAO and is a private college. None of these criteria take account of the social and financial circumstances of the students attending that college.  If certain students attending the college qualify for maintenance grants there must be a case to extend eligibility for the free fees scheme to the Royal College of Surgeons.  Otherwise, we are building an unnecessary element of discrimination into the workings of the system.</P>
    <P>What is the current status of the de Buitléir report?  Does the Minister intend to implement the recommendations of the committee in relation to the administration of the grants system? <Col N="278" /> Does she intend to act on its advice with regard to revising the means test for third level grants and introduce capital test in addition to the existing test?  The committee received submissions from virtually every important body involved in third level education.  Its report contains practical and sensible proposals for introducing greater equity into the system.

      <P>I welcome the Minister. Senator Quinn was the only Member to face up to the real question of where the money for this will be obtained.  You cannot sign the Maastricht agreement and then come to this House at 6 p.m. and obtain £13 million by 8 p.m.  That cannot be done, it is not political reality. If that is the cost then we, as practitioners of the political art of the possible, know full well that the only way this Minister can win this vote is to tell a lie.  She could give Members a date but that would be meaningless because she is in no position to do so.</P>
      <P>What do we in this House have in common?  What we have in common is that every Member subscribes to the belief that all part-time students should have free access to third level education. There is no disagreement on that whatever. If I remember rightly it was not Fianna Fáil but Senator Lee who proposed this motion initially.  If Fianna Fáil had proposed it, then what the party has been doing since the foundation of the State, when this was obviously still a problem, amazes me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with Senator O'Toole in a moment.  The proposer of this resolution was Senator Lee but it was stolen by Fianna Fáil on the basis that this confluence of interest would result in a defeat for the Government, and it probably will.  However, it does not change the reality that it is impossible <Col N="279" /> to get a commitment to drop third level fees for part-time students on a specific date.</P>
      <P>The Minister's speech is littered with many millions of pounds, the same millions that were claimed by the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy de Rossa, and every other Minister sitting around the Cabinet table.  The astounding increase in money going to third level education is an indication of the Minister's success in bargaining that would do credit to Senator O'Toole, if I may say so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure who the Senator is complimenting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am complimenting Senator O'Toole because he has an ability to secure money when it is scarce.  The Minister has demonstrated the same ability.  I quote from her speech: &ldquo;Thus funding of the universities since I became Minister for Education has increased from £137 million to £179 million&rdquo;.  I did not go to third level; to be honest, I hardly got out of second level.  The fact that I was not able to participate at third level, even though I paid for it all my life, did not make me bitter but it made me realise all the more that third level education is a precious gift.  It is the only way people can be really free.  I fully support the sentiments expressed by Senator Lee, so much so that I sent one of my children to his tender mercies at UCC where he got a good degree in History and English.</P>
      <P>I subscribe to the objectives of the motion.  When I put my son through university I did not get a penny from anyone and things were not easy.  Anybody who says that the abolition of third level grants for full-time students is not important, as Senator Honan implied, must be living on a different planet, but then, being a Progressive Democrat, she probably does not occupy the same space as I.  To make a nonsense of it is a non argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="280" /> I am old enough to remember when Donough O'Malley introduced free secondary education.  That was wholesomely welcomed by members of the Labour Party who saw it as the emancipation of working class people. However, for the majority of the history of this State, Fianna Fáil has presided over a situation where fewer than 2 per cent of working class children got through the doors of these expensive institutions.  Fianna Fáil did not contemplate removing fees for anybody, full-time or part time.  Successive Fianna Fáil Ministers for Education never attempted it.</P>
    <P>Senator Ormonde knows, as I do, that if we switched seats she would probably make a better argument against this Fianna Fáil motion than I would.  She would say exactly the same thing. Members of the Opposition cannot come in here day after day demanding money over a range of areas all of which deserve priority without addressing the fundamental question posed by Senator Quinn: where do we get the cash?</P>
    <P>I am satisfied, the Seanad should be satisfied, and even Senator O'Toole &mdash; who is never satisfied &mdash; should be satisfied. I am not confusing him with Senator Ross whom we dispatched.</P>

      <P>You will note that he got two minutes.  If a Minister of any hue came in here and said: I wish to confirm to the Seanad my strong personal commitment to the following major policy objective of the Government, cited in the White Paper, i.e. to promote economy of access to higher education irrespective of social class, age or disability for all who have the capacity to benefit from it.  I would accept that.  The Opposition is tactically wrong because if the <Col N="281" /> motion is withdrawn it will keep on coming back.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education will have to remind her Cabinet colleagues that the Opposition took a view that the Minister obviously could not give a commitment because she did not have the sanction of the Cabinet.  The Minister can fight that cause better without a defeat however.</P>
      <P>Senator Lee thought up this motion after looking at the issue and deciding he wanted to do something about it. Fianna Fáil then said: Thank God for that because we will get these university guys with us and defeat the Government, but to what effect?  Tactically you are better off ignoring the PD motion because I do not think they envisage the abolition of fees for full-time students.</P>
      <P>Nobody who is fair minded and impartial could do other than concede that the Minister, Deputy Bhreathnach, has done an excellent job in persuading the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, and others to come up with the cash to fund many of the things she has done.  I ask Senator Ormonde, as the newly appointed assistant Whip in Fianna Fáil, to score a victory and withdraw the motion.</P>

Senator Magner asked why Fianna Fáil has not done this and that.

      <P>A bit of common sense prevailed for a few years and, as a result, the international standing of our economy improved and the World Bank did not have to keep a sharp eye on us.  It is very easy to ask why Fianna Fáil did not do this or that.  We had to clear up the mess and I hope there will not be another mess for us to clear up when this Administration retires or is run out of office.  Which part will cause the election?

      <P>He has a gold mine, or perhaps it is old money he has buried.  I wish him well.  I did not get the opportunity to receive second or third level education; I do not apologise for that.  It is far more important to provide these funds for our young people, the lifeblood of this nation, than to pour millions of pounds into the arts.  That is no reflection on the Minister for the Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy M. Higgins.  The arts are important as they create jobs, but we should divert some of this money so that our young have the opportunity to study art.  Is this wagon only going down one boreen?  In recent months the Minister for Finance told Ministers to tighten their belts, and some have done so better than others. It looks as if this Minister's allocation of funds was chopped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should thank God that the parents of those who received third level education were in a position to pay. <Col N="284" /> Many thousands did not have that opportunity and travel long distances to vocational education committees to improve their education and to qualify for jobs in industry.  People need this opportunity, given the importance of technology, particularly in the computer area.  It is sad that we are not giving these young people a chance.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to abandon the proposal to regionalise vocational education committees.  This has happened in many other fields &mdash; for example, in regard to the health boards &mdash; and it leaves a lot to be desired.  It will create another layer of bureaucracy where nobody is answerable and matters are passed from one person to another.  There will be a need for a whole lot of managers, including regional managers.  The poor student will be worse off by the time these people are paid.  The vocational education committees have proved themselves since the early 1930s.  The chief executive officers and teachers are a credit and have given a great opportunity to families those who have not had the opportunity to get on due to family circumstances.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to steer clear of this idea of creating regional authorities, which will take the power from people in the vocational education committees and give it to bureaucrats in the Department of Education.  This happened in the agricultural area.  The agricultural committees were abolished because they asked relevant questions about agriculture.  I appeal to the Minister, as a teacher and a mother, to forget about the bureaucrats in her Department, to look at the record of the vocational education committees and not to regionalise them.  I appeal to her to get some of the millions of pounds from her colleague, Deputy M. Higgins, to give young people the opportunity to go to night classes and to improve their lot in this tough world.  It would be better than allocating it all to the arts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Magner has a short memory.  Fianna Fáil has done everything in terms of education in this country from secondary education onwards.  It built the regional colleges and gave the sons and daughters of people in rural Ireland the opportunity to get into third level education.  Fianna Fáil built Dublin City University and it has a good record on education of which it can be very proud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should we?  We were in power when this was done; it was no trouble to us.  If Senator Magner was in Opposition he would be talking differently. Like Senator Magner, I did not get further than second year in the technical college, but we were brought up in a different age.  I trained a young man as a fitter.  He had 30 years' experience but he had to go to Moorepark to train for six months at his expense.  If he did not pass an examination he would have had to pack in his job and go on the dole.  He is in his forties and fits milking machines, which is how I made a living for years.  He told me he would not be given a chance today because he would not have the qualifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People must be educated, whether we like it or not.  It is sad because many of us who left school with a basic education had enough to build on and we did well for ourselves and others and never had to go on the dole.  However, things have changed.  Those who attend night classes to get a degree are dedicated. I knew people who worked in Sligo County Council who drove to Galway three or four nights each week and they were back at work at 9 a.m. the next morning.  It costs these people a lot of money to do those courses.  They want to improve themselves and we <Col N="286" /> should do everything we can for them. These people did not have the wherewithal to go on to third level and they were glad to get a job with their leaving certificate.  However, they had potential. We talk about the long-term unemployed and mature students grants. However, these people have jobs, pay taxes and want to improve themselves. They have a goal and determination and will.  The problem is that we are not helping those with get-up-and-go.  Yet we give those who do nothing another cushion for their armchair.  That is a mistake.</P>
    <P>This report stated that a UCD night student could not afford next year's fees.  Although she was confident she would pass, her financial situation had radically changed.  This woman is in her thirties and earns £10,000 per year. Obviously, she is brilliant because she has gone so far.  Whether we like it or not, things are getting more expensive each day.  We cannot deny people who are willing the right to further their education.</P>
    <P>This Minister is considerate and caring. When she became Minister I said that the one great advantage she had was that, unlike those who were in the system before her, she was not contaminated by bureaucrats.  The Minister should think of those people who are trying to further themselves.  They pay taxes, PAYE and PRSI while they are still students.  Some of them cannot even take a holiday.  They cannot stay at home with their wives and families. They cannot go out socialising because they are dedicated to achieving their particular aim.</P>
    <P>I know of one lad from Sligo who went through it and is now a barrister in the Four Courts.  I often asked the boy whether he would stick it or whether he would get back safely from Galway, considering the hours which he worked. He never missed one hour's work and he went to classes four nights per week in Galway.  That lad, who came from a humble home near Carrick-on-Shannon, has made a success of it.  He is an able barrister today.  This is the type of <Col N="287" /> person I want helped, because we have lost the work ethic in this country. Whether we like it or not, we are a dependent society.</P>
    <P>I see the same thing happening elsewhere, and this example will illustrate my point.  There are people who work hard all their life.  When they reach 65 years of age they must undergo a means test for a pension.  If they have saved a few pounds, we penalise them because they worked hard all their life.  The fellow beside them, who drew the dole all his life, is given a council house and will be entitled to a full pension; but we penalise the people who do good for this country and who put muscle and money into this country.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to think of the cream of society.  They have a goal in mind, they know exactly what they are about and are paying their way to the best of their ability.  In no way should we militate against them.  I appeal to the Minister to get the money somewhere.  We have seen Governments get money for tribunals and millions of pounds for barristers, etc.  It is sad if we cannot find some way to get a few million pounds to pay for these people's education when they have the will and the way to do it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to delay the House unduly.  I add my support to the motion this evening.  I appreciate the efforts which the Minister has made. Like every other Minister, she has worked hard in difficult circumstances and, having been through the Estimates process on numerous occasions, I appreciate fully the difficulty which the Minister will have in trying to decide how to allocate the funds which are available to her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case has been adequately made by my colleagues.  It is necessary to look again at an agenda where the opportunity is presented to a number of people who wish to pursue third level <Col N="288" /> education.  In particular, I want to make a case here for people in towns like Ennis, where huge numbers are endeavouring to avail of third level education at a time when they do not have an educational institution within easy distance. I am speaking especially of employed people who see the opportunity for further advancement with further qualifications not only for themselves but also by creating employment opportunities by establishing small businesses, especially in the high-tech area.</P>
    <P>I compliment University College, Cork, which has over a number of years organised third level courses in Ennis. The benefit of this has been enormous, especially to those who are working all day and do not have time to travel long distances to university.  I have made the case that this area of activity should be expanded to areas where the availability could be provided through existing institutions, such as St. Flannan's College, Ennis.  The possibility of creating further opportunities in small businesses as a result of the advancement of skills in the high-tech area is apparent at the University of Limerick.  Exciting developments have taken place adjacent to the Limerick campus, especially with young graduates who have been able to establish their own small businesses, some of which service larger industries in the region.</P>
    <P>One of the major challenges facing people in education and in business generally will be keeping abreast of the changes in the whole area of technology and keeping skilled personnel capable of dealing with it.  These challenges are enormous; they are mind-boggling.  I have seen some of the work undertaken by the University of Limerick and some of the benefits which can accrue from the development of that type of education, especially in the creation of small enterprises and in openings and opportunities for people with degrees in computer science or whatever.  Many of these people are already working in <Col N="289" /> low-paid jobs.  They need the opportunity of attending university to get into the higher bracket and, where they are already contributing to the Exchequer, a genuine case can be made.</P>
    <P>Within the overall finances available to the Minister, this motion strengthens the Minister's hand in her dealings with the Department of Finance.  Everybody who has been a Minister knows the stranglehold which the Department of Finance has on every Department.  In agreeing this motion we are strengthening the Minister's case at the critical time of the final detailed negotiations on the Estimates.  I am sure they have not concluded yet.  They will probably be concluded the night before the budget.  In recognising and providing for this category of student, the Minister is making a very valuable contribution not only to the advancement of their careers in many cases but also to the prospect of creating many more small businesses which could enhance the prospect of many jobs for people who are unemployed at present.</P>
    <P>The move by the Department of Finance to give tax breaks to people who pay their children's educational fees is welcome and long overdue.  I have had the task of paying for two of my children in higher level institutions without any relief whatever.  It is a crippling burden on many families and it puts them to the pin of their collars.  The Minister can make a valuable contribution to the education agenda.  It would be widely applauded and welcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Miss Ormonde Miss Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us get back to the motion.  I acknowledge what the Minister has been doing with second level education.  This comes across in the White Paper in how she is trying to target disadvantaged second level student's access to third level education.  I go along with that, but we need the props, and there is no prop left when they try <Col N="290" /> to get into third level.  The main prop is if they do not have to pay the fees.  That is the greatest motivator of all.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that choices had to be made.  It is unfortunate that she had to use that line because choices should have been made to prioritise those students who need the props most.  The penalised students are the ones who had to make a huge commitment to get into third level and who had to find the money through bank loan schemes or in other ways.  The main prop which I, as a guidance counsellor, could offer students is that their fees will be paid.  If I could say that to students taking the leaving certificate, and particularly the disadvantaged ones, I could guarantee great leaving certificate results.  I cannot advise them go out and get a job and then go on to third level or do an evening course.</P>
      <P>The crux of the matter is that they would have to pay their fees.  The Minister made the wrong choice.  It is a pity we did not prioritise and look after those people.  I am batting for them tonight.  I take cognisance of everything Senator Lee said.  He knows what he is talking about because he deals with these people.  Having tutored in university, I know what people go through to get into third level education. We need this measure if we want a better society.</P>
      <P>I have heard nothing to indicate that I should withdraw my motion.  I regret the Minister made no commitment to a certain time scale as we requested.  It is a pity that we have to go down this road. In the near future the Minister might go back to the Cabinet.  She now has all the arguments to advance a good case.  We penalised those students.  I recognise that we must make a choice and that choice should have been to prioritise these students.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1993 the Local Government (Dublin) Act was passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas and I spoke at length in this House during the debate on that legislation.  There are a number of reasons that legislation was introduced, all of which were contained in the Act.  However, one of the unspoken reasons for its enactment and the setting up of the three independent local authorities, or extra county councils in my opinion and that of the members of those three new councils, was to do with the stranglehold which City Hall was rightly perceived to have on the county as a whole.</P>
      <P>In two of the new local authorities &mdash; South Dublin County Council and Fingal County Council &mdash; Dublin Corporation had significant interests in terms of land acquisition and major housing stock in the area.  I have been a member of the local authority since 1985 and Ministers in the current Government were members of Dublin County Council with me during that period.  We regularly pointed out the difficulties which we experienced as local authority members for areas such as Blanchardstown, Clondalkin and Tallaght. Although the people living in corporation houses were constituents of ours, they were totally disenfranchised because we and they had no representation at City Hall.</P>
      <P>When the Local Government (Dublin) Act was passed in 1993, the county council was abolished and the three new councils were set up.  Subsidiarity and devolution were the buzz words at that time in relation to the legislation.  I did something which I think was unprecedented.  We were in Government with the Labour Party when that Bill was enacted and I tabled an amendment to my own Government's Bill because I feared that the spirit and intent of the legislation would be frustrated by City Hall.  Almost two years down the road I am absolutely convinced that that has happened.</P>
      <P>The Third Schedule to the Act, which affects most directly the hold up in completing the independence of the three local authorities, states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part I of the Schedule makes arrangements to provide for the transfer of local authority dwellings and land acquired for housing owned by one of the principal authorities but located in the functional area of a different principal authority to the <Col N="295" /> authority in whose functional area it is located.</P>
    <P>I was very happy with that.  However, I was somewhat frightened that it would not happen, which is why I proposed an amendment to the legislation.</P>
    <P>What I feared has now come about. We are at the stage, as far as I know from the answer to a recent question to the manager of my local authority, where a mediator or conciliator has been appointed to try to resolve this situation. I believe it is always better to talk than to argue.  However, it will not work unless the Minister of State or the Minister for the Environment insists on the transfer of what is left of the lands and houses of Dublin Corporation to the three new local authorities.  Unless that happens, the strength of the three new local authorities will be lost.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation and the new local authorities made submissions but somebody has to act as God and make a decision, which I am asking the Minister to do.  The corporation says it acquired lands in the county in the 1960s and 1970s for the purpose of meeting its statutory needs and to facilitate the development of the new growth areas, as envisaged in the Myles Wright report. That formed part of its submission to the Minister and it stated that it was necessary to have a large land bank available which was capable of being serviced for housing development.  It is my understanding that the corporation funded an amount of this land acquisition out of its own funds, but I know for a fact that it did not fund all of it.  It purchased the land for public housing.</P>
    <P>We have had occasion to discuss semi-State and private developers in the last number of years.  If a private developer behaved in the way Dublin Corporation has the press would be screaming. We have had descriptions in the local authorities of speculative developers who come in and try to have land rezoned for housing.  That is exactly what Dublin Corporation did.  They purchased land in the 1960s and 1970s at <Col N="296" /> agricultural values, some for a pittance. Prices were about £1,000 per acre or a very small amount.  I have a schedule in front of me detailing land which has been disposed of.  The value of lands disposed of by Dublin Corporation since this legislation was enacted is in excess of £11 million, and most of these lands are in my local authority ward.</P>
    <P>Industrial lands in Ballycoolin were disposed of to Forfás, a semi-State body, for £1 million by Dublin Corporation. My local authority enhanced the value of those lands and the corporation sold them for £1 million.  I could go through the list of town centre lands sold.  We have just had a debate on education but lands which were reserved for a regional technical college for Blanchardstown have been sold by Dublin Corporation to the private developer who is building our town centre.  That is disgraceful and should not be allowed.</P>
    <P>That is the land side of the argument. My tally is that, in my area alone, £11 million has gone into the kitty of Dublin Corporation from the sale of lands.  It has been speculated by members of my council that these transactions were to fund the building of the civic offices; if this is so, so be it.</P>
    <P>What is more annoying and completely unacceptable to me is the fact that in excess of 2,000 corporation houses in my ward are now being left to fall into an unbelievable state of disrepair. Those houses were built 20 years ago and the corporation carried out only bare maintenance on them.  I pay tribute to the local depots who have done the best they can under the most difficult circumstances.  I invite the Minister to come and see these housing developments. Dublin Corporation has made very loud noises through its public relations people about the refurbishment of Darndale and Ballymun, and we paid tribute today to a former Minister who was responsible for those developments.</P>
    <P>I have the same type of courtyard housing as Darndale in my area.  The corporation did not request one penny from any Minister for the Environment <Col N="297" /> to improve the lot of those people. People tell me that when they request ordinary maintenance they are told that, as the houses are to be transferred, no maintenance is being carried out on them.  If the houses are ever transferred we will have a crisis on our hands.  I have put down a motion asking my own council to seek separate funding from the Minister for the Environment to clear up the mess which Dublin Corporation has created in the three new local authorities, but particularly in the Blanchardstown-Clondalkin areas.  The Minister and I know when Fianna Fáil was in Government we set up the first task force on crime in this country.  It was in a Dublin Corporation built area in Clondalkin.  The corporation has created mayhem; it is responsible for the most disastrous planning.  Now it wants to keep coining in the rents and allocating the tenancies, in the main to people from outside the council areas, which should not be allowed.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice has decided to intervene in the dispute with the Garda.  It is now time for the Minister for the Environment to call in Dublin Corporation and tell the city manager, who up to 1 January 1994 was the city and county manager &mdash; I would put a question mark over how he did his job as a county manager &mdash; that the Department knows what has been going on and that it understands the problems the corporation is worried about.  The corporation has decided that it will develop the inner city; it will no longer put its tenants into the county.  Therefore the land and housing must be transferred before any more damage is done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator McGennis for raising this matter. At the outset, I would like to set out for the House, in a general way, the background to the current position.  For many years, Dublin Corporation built houses and purchased land for housing and other purposes in County Dublin. The situation had developed to the point that Dublin Corporation had a <Col N="298" /> housing estate of some 7,500 houses in the county.  This was clearly not ideal from the point of view of efficient organisation and proper democratic representation. The fact that such a large number of houses in the area of one local authority are owned by another, which is responsible for their management and maintenance and that the local authority members elected by the residents of these houses exercise no control in relation to these matters, is clearly undesirable.  The same arguments apply, with lesser force, to land holdings generally.</P>
      <P>The break up of Dublin county into three separate local authorities was bound to exacerbate the position in relation to housing.  The Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1993, sought to rationalise this situation by providing that, in general, houses should be owned by, and be the responsibility of, the local authority in whose area the houses are situated.  Similarly, lands not immediately required would be transferred from one authority to the other.</P>
      <P>Clearly a reorganisation of this nature poses complex issues, including the terms under which transfers are to take place.  For this reason the Act set out a procedure which required schemes to be prepared by the managers after consultations with each other and their elected councils.  Schemes prepared in this way have been submitted to the Minister for the Environment for approval, and the other authorities affected have exercised their right to make submissions on these schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the provisions of the Act, the Minister is required to consider the schemes, together with the councils' submissions on them.  He may approve the scheme as submitted, make revisions to the schemes or direct that another scheme be made taking account of specified matters.  It is well known that there is a wide divergence between the transfer schemes submitted by the Dublin City Manager and the submissions made on the schemes by the county managers.  Accordingly, at the suggestion of the Department of the Environment, <Col N="299" /> the four managers are in contact in an effort to establish what scope there may be for achieving a greater level of agreement on the complex issues involved.  I understand that some progress has been made towards resolving these issues and I am told that it is hoped to bring the discussions to a conclusion very shortly.  The need for this has been stressed to the managers.</P>
    <P>Against this background, it would not be appropriate to comment at this stage on the possible outcome.  I can say, however, that the Minister considers the issue to be an important one and will do what he can to bring the matter to finality at the earliest possible date.  The comments made tonight by Senator McGennis will be brought to the attention of the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming in to respond to this matter this evening.  As he will probably recall, I referred to the substance of the matter here last week during the discussion on the Industrial Development Bill.  Some time ago the European Commission set up an independent group of experts to advise on the effects of legislative and administrative requirements on business, particularly on small and medium sized enterprise.  This committee is known as the Molitor committee.</P>
      <P>Molitor has reported and from my reading of the report the central theme is that over-regulation and the cost of compliance is inhibiting the growth and development of small and medium enterprises in Europe.  In addition, over-regulation is putting Eurobusiness, large and small, at a serious cost disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> the business and products of, say, North America and the Far East. The report calls for deregulation and for legislative and administrative simplicity on a wide scale throughout Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to pick up a few points mentioned in the summary of the report. <Col N="300" /> The report states that overregulation stifles growth, reduces competitiveness and costs Europe jobs.  It goes on to say that if Europe fails to take account of the likely trends in the business environment, including its regulatory frameworks, it will suffer reduced competitiveness, slower economic growth and higher levels of unemployment.  Europe cannot ignore the fact that other industrial countries with which it competes are making strenuous efforts to reduce their regulatory burdens.  The report further adds that there is little purpose in the Union simplifying its legislation if under the cover of subsidiarity or transposition, member states take an opposite course.</P>
    <P>The report was published last June and contains 121 proposals on how to improve the industrial development environment.  These proposals come under seven headings.  They will be further discussed in Madrid next month. A decision will then be taken to prioritise the proposals.  Therefore, decision time is near.</P>
    <P>I represent the Federation of Trade Associations on a committee in Brussels known as the Committee of Commerce and Distribution which is attached to DG 23.  The Molitor report has been discussed in that committee twice recently. I find myself at a considerable disadvantage because I do not know what the Government's position or policy on these proposals is.  There is also the disadvantage that no Irish official ever attends meetings of this committee; this contrasts with other members states.  I have previously drawn the attention of the Department to this.  It is to inform myself properly that I have raised this matter.</P>
    <P>The next meeting of this committee takes place on Friday week.  I would like information, if it is possible to have it, on the following points.  To what extent has the Molitor report been considered here?  To what extent does the Government accept its central theme, which is that overregulation is a hindrance to development and the expansion of business, particularly where small and <Col N="301" /> medium enterprises are concerned? How many of the 121 proposals for improvement are acceptable to the Government?  Which of them would the Government deem appropriate for priority?</P>
    <P>A number of the proposals are of considerable interest to me and I feel will they will impinge to a substantial extent on how industry progresses here. I am concerned to know what the position is with regard to these proposals, particularly Nos. 2, 4, 8, and 12, which are classified as general proposals. Under the heading of food hygiene, what is the policy on proposals 1, 2 and 15?  With regard to the environment, I am concerned to know what the position is on proposals 1, 3 and 9.  Where small and medium enterprises are concerned, I would certainly appreciate being informed, if this is possible, of what the Government's position is on all 14 proposals under that heading.</P>
    <P>The committee referred to what it considers an undesirable practice in which national governments, in giving effect to EU directives in domestic legislation, avail of that opportunity to add on an additional raft of regulations which are not required to give effect to those directives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  The Molitor report is important and it draws attention to an issue which is well understood by anyone in business, which is that increasingly there are heavy burdens in complying with a range of regulations across the board. Many of the regulations are important and are related to health and safety, labour rights and environmental protection. However, they have often evolved without a proper consciousness of the compliance costs imposed on business. Business has often not been properly consulted before the regulations evolved and the benefits of regulations were not compared with the costs they might impose on particular businesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="302" /> This group was named after its chairman, Dr. Bernhard Molitor, and had an Irish member in Mr. John Horgan, the former chairman of the Labour Court. The work of this group is important.  It would not be possible to respond to the Senator's queries on the hoof.  Out of 121 recommendations he has listed ten or 15 in which he is particularly interested.  The Government has not evolved a specific response to each one. At the Cannes Summit it was concluded that this issue should be addressed by the European Commission and that it should present specific proposals to the Madrid Summit.</P>
    <P>In Cannes some member states were concerned that simplification along the lines of the Molitor agenda might be a cover for throwing out important protections which they wanted to keep. Equally, most member states, including Ireland, saw the importance of simplification. At that summit the Taoiseach clearly supported the report and he noted the need to keep to an absolute minimum any friction between regulatory policies and the promotion of employment and competitiveness in Europe.  The world competitiveness ranking for the last 12 months shows that many EU countries, including Ireland, are declining in that ranking. We must be conscious that excessive regulation can be damaging to competitiveness.</P>
    <P>The European Commission is preparing proposals which will be presented in Madrid and my Department and the Government are awaiting these with interest to see how they set out the way in which the Molitor agenda can be advanced.  Everybody recognises that simplification of rules is attractive in principle, but it can be quite difficult to implement.  There have been efforts in the past at national level &mdash; I am sure the Senator is aware of them &mdash; to carry out an audit of all regulations with a view to simplification, but this has not gone far.  The process has to be accepted at the highest political level and there must be a commitment to see it through. There must be a proper strategy based <Col N="303" /> on consultation to make sure people are happy that the baby is not being thrown out with the bath water.  There must be an emphasis on small firms and a focus on creating a new administrative culture.</P>
    <P>The report was discussed in Brussels this week at the meeting of the Council of Industry Ministers.  The EU Commissioner, Mr. Bangemann, put forward some tentative views of the Commission as to how it might advance the agenda. It would like to see a move towards codification of law so that the review of certain regulations would be forced to surface and if they did not fit into the code they would cease to be applicable. The Commission seems to envisage an audit procedure.  At this stage, until we see the precise vehicles, it is hard to react to the overall report.</P>
    <P>Our own approach to the agenda is more important.  As well as a European agenda there is very much a national agenda in this area.  The Senator will be aware of the small business task force, which identified about 50 administrative headaches in taxation and other areas. All of its recommendations cannot be implemented but the Department is currently considering what can be implemented and we hope to make proposals for specific changes which could be implemented quickly.  We would also like to develop a process where simplification becomes a permanent feature in all Departments; it cannot be just driven <Col N="304" /> from one Department.  My Department does not have responsibility for many regulations which affect businesses.</P>
    <P>The Government supports the process and wants to develop the principles of simplifying forms, improving administrative procedures, creating a business friendly enforcement system and looking at compliance costs before signing regulations.  The issue now is how to move forward in this regard.  I hope to come up with proposals in the near future which will address the issue of administrative simplification.  I have appointed the small business forum which advises my Department and it has already addressed this issue as a priority.  We are trying to put together an agenda which will lead to an action plan.</P>
    <P>I assure the Senator that we are aware of this problem, but we are equally conscious that this area has been examined before without great success. We must prepare the ground well and we must ensure that people buy into the process.  However, that takes time.</P>
    <P>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  I know he would like a more comprehensive answer on issues such as hygiene, etc.  However, I will take note of the specific points he raised and, if possible, I will arrange to send him a more detailed response by letter.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 9 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 9 November 1995.</P>
