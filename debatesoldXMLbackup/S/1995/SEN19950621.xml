      <P>I have notice from Senator McGennis that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she wishes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to make a statement in relation to people who have been infected with hepatitis C as a result of blood transfusions.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by Senator McGennis as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business today is item 1, Second Stage of the Consumer Credit Bill, between now and 1 p.m., with not more than 20 minutes for each speaker by agreement.  There will be a sos from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. and item 2 will be taken from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m.; item 17, motion 19, will be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.</P>

      <P>We mentioned the OECD report last week but we have encountered extreme difficulty in securing copies.  Up to now we have not received any copies of the report.</P>
      <P>On the day the House will deal with the Consumer Credit Bill, the <i>Irish Press</i> workers will again walk the streets of Dublin and there is also the strike at Dunnes Stores.  The Leader is aware of our position in asking him to ensure that the Government does everything possible to help these situations.  We wish to ensure that the <i>Irish Press</i> workers retain their jobs and that the strike in Dunnes Stores is resolved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a question I would like to ask some Members on the Opposition benches with regard to real and half promises on issues.  I wish to raise motion 20 on the Order Paper.  It is an unusual motion on social welfare PRSI payments.  I express my appreciation of the fact that the Leader placed it on the Order Paper.  I recognise the significance of the motion being on the Order Paper and that many people would have objected to it.  He is following a tradition set by his party in earlier times.  It was my intention to propose&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I also express my appreciation of the fact that my Independent colleagues, Senator Norris, Senator Henry and Senator Lee, and my PD colleagues, Senator Dardis and Senator Honan, also put their names to this motion. Fianna Fáil, obviously forgetting that it is in Opposition and still believing it is in Government, refused to support it. That refusal is, in effect, a vote by Fianna Fáil today to deduct 5 per cent from the salaries of all new gardaí, nurses, teachers and civil servants.  It is a most invidious and divisive decision and a disgraceful abrogation of <Col N="4" /> responsibility.  We are now in a situation where the lack of action by Fianna Fáil in the House today&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I recognise that this matter was not at any stage signalled or announced by this Government; it was suggested by a former Government. That is not a bad speech either and I am sure they are feeling uncomfortable about it.</P>

      <P>In support of what Senator Wright said in respect of the Dunnes Stores and Sunday trading issues, when does the Leader expect legislation on Sunday trading to come before us?</P>
      <P>We should welcome the decision by Shell to abandon sinking the <i>Brent Spar</i> in the Atlantic Ocean and congratulate those who brought that matter to the attention of the public and individual Governments.  Our Government might have been a little quicker off the mark in voicing our opposition to that proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I will not find myself having to make a grovelling apology to you, Sir, like Senator O'Toole.  I ask the Leader to bring the unanimous voice of the House that was expressed here last week to the attention of the French Government in respect of nuclear testing in the Pacific Ocean, which is a far more serious matter <Col N="7" /> environmentally, and to continue to bring pressure to have something done about Sellafield.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise a matter with the Leader and to suggest that there are one of two ways with which it can be dealt, that is, by providing time for a short debate or by referring it to the appropriate Ministers.  I have seen in a number of retail premises in recent days notices saying &ldquo;No sterling accepted.&rdquo;.  I have never seen a notice refusing dollars or other currency.  We are at the beginning of what we hope will be a good tourist season and this is a most damaging exercise.</P>
      <P>In addition, some retailers are charging a commission of 10 per cent for changing sterling.  I changed sterling yesterday. The commission charge is a little over 3 per cent.  Having accepted that money at the weekend, I was happy to give a discount to the UK customers who came to my establishment.  This is a despicable practice that is damaging this country under three different headings: the tourism product, the peace process &mdash; because of the message that it conveys to the people across the Border &mdash; and the image of this nation to our nearest neighbours.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to treat this as a very serious matter and to take action either under the headings I have suggested, to provide time for discussion in this House or to deal with the appropriate Ministers.  Our media constantly jump on the shortcomings of society and their silence in relation to this issue has been deafening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Crime in Dublin has got out of hand during the past number of weeks, and particularly in the last few nights, with BMWs and other cars being stolen and four to five premises being raided.  When will the Minister for Justice come before the House to speak on this issue?  I have repeatedly requested a discussion on the present crime wave and what is being done to stop it.  I understand that rules have been introduced <Col N="8" /> which prevent the Garda Síochána from following such cars, it was reported on the news this morning that the Garda had seen those stolen cars but were not in a position to follow them.  It is very serious if criminals can run free, ignore the law and the authorities, raid premises and hold people to ransom.  It is disgraceful. When will the Minister come before the House so that we might have a full debate on crime and what we can do about it?  Members may have some positive solutions to offer.  It is time something was done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the decision of the Shell Oil Company not to scuttle the oil rig in the North Sea.  People in County Donegal had major concerns about what could happen, when prevailing winds from that area might carry the radioactive material and sludge from the oil rig into the sea around the county.  I welcome the Government's decision.  I was amazed at how quickly the British Government and the Shell Oil Company reacted within 24 hours to that decision.  Could we have a debate in this House on dumping at sea?  Shell have a large number of oil rigs which they intend to dump.  Would it be possible to have a short debate on the matter before the recess?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Maloney. While we would like to congratulate Greenpeace, the people who orchestrated the campaign to prevent the oil rig being dumped at sea, this raises serious issues with regard to how the Government dealt with this issue.  This would have been discussed at the International Convention on Dumping at Sea &mdash; to which Ireland is party &mdash; before permission was given to dump the vessel at sea.  Could the Minister for Foreign Affairs, or the Minister responsible, give some indication how that decision was arrived at with the Irish Government being party to it?  This is a fundamental issue and we should have an opportunity to discuss it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="9" /> The Minister for the Environment made a commitment that he would introduce measures to deal with the county road system which is breaking down at present.  Local authorities are laying off staff because of the unavailability of finances to deal with this crisis. The Minister gave an indication that he was prepared to make a statement and provide additional finance for local authorities.  When does he propose to do that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GordonWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that what I am about to say it in order.  I ask the House to note the great honour which was conferred last week, in the Queen's Birthday Honours List, on the Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland, Dr. Robin Eames.  He is one of the great men of modern Ireland.  This honour will afford him an opportunity to walk the corridors of power in the Upper House, admittedly in another jurisdiction. Those of us who heard him make his submission, on behalf of his church, at the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation know him to be a great man.  He will not let Ireland down.  I welcome the opportunity afforded to him to do his best for the whole of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>When will it be possible to have a debate on motion No. 4? I fear that the value of such a debate will have passed the point of having an impact because this is the seventh time I have raised this matter.  I do not mention that in a critical way since the Leader has been kind enough to acknowledge that this is a serious matter and he offered Government time to debate it.  Now, close on two months later when a great deal of the impact has been lost, it is misleading to tell community groups to get organised and to avail of European funding.  Community groups are now being encouraged to believe that funding is available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest that you do not judge the book by the cover on this occasion.  I am asking for fair play, a Leas-Chathaoirleach, nothing more.  As chairman of a cross-Border group, I have attended many meetings and it is clear that misleading information is going out to community groups.  I have consistently asked for a debate in this House that might impart useful information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Leader to take my request seriously, as I believe he will do.  I cannot understand the difficulty because no business is more urgent than the dispersal of funds available to those who have suffered so much in the North and in the South over the last 25 years.</P>
      <P>I wish to compliment the Shell Oil Company on making a very wise decision.  I am glad of the support from my colleague Senator Maloney from Donegal.  The Government came in pretty late because the business pressure from Europe was the major influence on Shell Oil's decision not to dump the rig.  As a Donegal man I think Irish fisherman will welcome that sensible decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>To follow up on the last point, I would ask the Leader to ensure that the decision made by Shell is carried through.  There has been no indication yet from the British Government that a licence will be issued to them to dismantle that particular rig.  I would like to know what is the situation.  If the British Government do not give a licence, do they tow it around the world trying to find a place to dump it?  There are huge implications if the British Government does not grant the licence.</P>
      <P>Should we decide to have a regular Committee on Procedure and Privileges subcommittee meeting and follow the example of the Leinster council by having trial by television?  We might then find out what is a question and what is a speech on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise this important issue on a point of order. There is nothing in the Standing Orders of this House nor in the Constitution which rules out a speech on the Order of Business.  On one occasion a previous Leader of the House, Professor Jim Dooge, made a 45-minute contribution on the Order of Business to point out that particular fact.  As long as a speech is on a matter related to the Order of Business it is acceptable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that my case for a Committee on Procedure and Privileges sub-committee meeting regularly has been strengthened.</P>
      <P>May I ask the Leader to pass our compliments to the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs regarding his attitude during his visit to the Middle East?  He did not bow down to pressure from President Weizman of Israel and he visited Orient House.  The peace process in the Middle East has to be progressed. Any obstacles placed by people such as President Weizman should be eliminated.</P>

    <Col N="12" />
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Lanigan that it was important that the Tánaiste visited Orient House to meet Mr. Faisal Husseini.</P>
      <P>In light of the considerable interest expressed on all sides of the House in the Shell oil matter, I ask the Leader for a general debate on the environment before the close of this session.  There are many issues involved.  I respectfully disagree with my friend and colleage, Senator Maloney &mdash; the British Government does not seem to have changed its view and its attitude was not influenced in the slightest by the views of the Irish Government.  The most significant feature of this issue was that, like the Vietnam protests, it involved the mobilisation of mass public opinion throughout Europe which hit Shell where it hurts most, in its trade balance.  This shows people power in action and I hope we see a good deal more of it.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;by refusing to allow Shell to dump the rig.  It is rather interesting that the British do not want it in their own back yard but are prepared to put it in ours.  I ask for a general debate on the environment to discuss that issue, and also the attitude of the French Government which says it is perfectly safe to explode atomic bombs. If it is so safe, why not explode one in a basement of the Louvre to test its safety before inflicting it on the unfortunate people of the south Pacific?</P>

Could the Leader find some machinery whereby this House could support an Irish mother whose son was murdered in France, apparently by a paratrooper, and who has been frustrated by the obfuscations of the French legal system?  This woman deserves every support this House can give her.</P>
      <P>Finally, I add my voice to that of my distinguished colleague, Senator O'Toole, on the PRSI issue.  I was lobbied extensively on this matter by the Senator's union, INTO and a number of graduates.

If it means something to put matters on the record of the House, while one recognises the authentic voice of the Government on the Brent Spar issue, one must also acknowledge the courageous record of Greenpeace, which had the effect of creating public opinion.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader if something can be done about the point raised by Senator Howard.  In my town of Mallow, I was advised by a visitor that his currency was refused in a shop two days ago.  This is disastrous and I ask the Leader to investigate the matter.</P>

    <P>Perhaps the Leader could tell us when the Government will pay compensation to people affected by flooding throughout the country, particularly in south Galway.  It will soon be the last week of June, but as yet not one penny has been paid to householders whose homes have been affected.  Many people have not returned to their homes since last January.  This is happening despite the promises given in the House by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Jim Higgins, that his <Col N="15" /> use of the Irish Red Cross would be a fast and efficient way to make emergency payments to these people.  It is disgraceful that nobody has yet received a penny from the Government.  This cannot be allowed to continue; therefore, I ask when this money will be paid.</P>

On that occasion, I asked if arrangements could be made for a debate on this issue.  We should have a debate on agriculture because it faces many problems at present, including the collapse of the farm pollution scheme and the decline in sheep farmers' incomes.  Recently I met many sheep farmers who are worried and concerned about this issue. They feel let down by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the Taoiseach.

This committee was formed at the beginning of the year, but it has not yet met.  Several Members have mentioned that it is past time for it to meet. Some weeks ago I asked the Leader to make time available for a debate on emigration and he agreed to do so.  We are coming close to the end of the session, but I do not want this matter to slip down the Order Paper.  I again ask the Leader for a debate on this issue.</P>

      <P>In view of the many promises made by this Government about local authority funding, particularly for county roads, and the publication of the local authority water charges Bill, which ensures that Democratic Left will not be embarrassed in Government, is this not the right time for the House to debate the problems caused by lack of funding at local authority level?  Library services are being reduced and roads are disappearing because of lack of funding.  I ask the Leader to ensure that we have a debate on local authority funding.  The new Bill on local service charges will make it very difficult for local authorities to collect the few pounds that are available to them from the local communities.  Will the Leader arrange for the Minister for the Environment to attend the House and state from where the local authorities are to receive their funding?</P>

      <P>The Leader of the Opposition asked about the OECD report.  I asked the Department of Finance to provide copies for all Members and was assured that this would be done; I am told that it is now being done.  I made further inquiries on the matter this morning, and I apologise for the delay.</P>
      <P>The Leader of the Opposition also raised the issue of the <i>Irish Press</i> and Dunnes Stores.  I do not believe there is anything very helpful we can do on the question of Dunnes Stores.  That battle is being fought elsewhere.  Over the last few days we wondered if Dunnes Stores and the Shell Oil Company had the same public relations people working for them, such was the impact they made on public opinion.  It is a matter on which we cannot usefully help.</P>
      <P>With regard to the <i>Irish Press,</i> there were some more positive signs in the last few days.  On foot of requests from Senator Cassidy, I asked the Minister if we could have a debate in the near future and I should have information on that later today.</P>
      <P>The answer to Senator O'Toole's question is yes.  Senator Dardis and others raised the question of the Shell Oil Company.  Any fair minded person must accept that the major impact in forcing the Shell Oil Company to change its mind came from Greenpeace and the mobilisation of public opinion, especially where it hit.  The Government made its view known very strongly, but we would be fooling ourselves if we thought that any small government would have a major impact on a matter like this.  In this instance, the impact came from public opinion.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis raised the issue of the French nuclear testing programme.  The record of the debate last week will be sent to the French Embassy to convey Members, views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Howard's question regarding sterling raises a disturbing point.  There will be a major tourism Bill in the <Col N="18" /> House next week when the Minister will be in attendance.  This will give the Senator and other Members every opportunity to put their point of view to the Minister and to get answers. With regard to Senator Farrell's question, there will be a debate this evening which will include the issue of crime. Other Senators raised the matter of county roads; Senator Daly has raised it on more than one occasion.  I have conveyed his concern to the relevant authority and will continue to do so.  Hopefully I will be able to bring the Senator more popular news in the near future.</P>
    <P>Senator Wilson mentioned the honour conferred on the Archbishop of Armagh.  All of us join in congratulating him.  The Archbishop, Cardinal Daly and other Church leaders, are among the most significant players in helping along the peace process.  It will be very useful that he will now have another voice in another House of Parliament where his sanity, tolerance and sense of genuine reconciliation will, hopefully, continue to make an even greater impact.</P>
    <P>As he remarked, Senator McGowan has raised his point on 14 occasions thus far.  I can assure the Senator that there will be a debate on this issue before the end of the session.  I hope to have it next week, but that is not a guarantee.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan raised the question of the Leinster Council of the GAA; I am not sure if it was raised in a substantive way or to illustrate a point.  The matter was handled in a mature way and with great common sense.  People, were prepared to admit they were wrong and a very good team will be given a second chance next week to prove that it is an even better team.</P>
    <P>I will also convey the Senators' remarks to the Tánaiste complimenting him on the way in which he carried out his public duties in the Middle East.</P>
    <P>The question of defamation was raised by Senator Mulcahy.  There was a major debate on that here about a year or so ago.  I will speak to the Minister and, if it is of any help, we will see <Col N="19" /> whether it can be done again.  I doubt whether it will be done this session. I will convey Senator Fahey's views to the Minister and see whether I can get some hard information for him in the next couple of days on the question of compensation for flooding.</P>
    <P>I will have news for Senator Mooney later today on the broadcasting control committee.  I cannot guarantee a debate on emigration before the end of the session as there is a lot of legislation, but I will do my best to see if it can be done. Likewise, I will convey to the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, Senator Kelleher's concerns on local authority funding.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Consumer Credit Bill represents a watershed in the history of consumer protection law in Ireland.  It shall alter, in an enlightened and radical way, the lender/borrower relationship that until now has been biased very much against the consumer.  Simply put, this is a pro-consumer piece of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need to enshrine readily intelligible legislative protections for consumers and to provide for their effective enforcement was never greater.  There is considerable competition among lenders for a grip on the personal wallets and purses of consumers and a massive proliferation of ever more complex lending and credit products.  The vast majority of consumers must rely on credit to undertake both medium and longer term purchases.  Equally, some consumers have no option but to resort to short term credit in order to tide them over periods of significant financial outlay such as Christmas, summer <Col N="20" /> holidays and back-to-school time. Unfortunately for many in our society, but especially for the disadvantaged and less privileged, indebtedness can be an overwhelming, crushing and spiralling burden.</P>
    <P>This legislation installs in a comprehensive and innovative way the protections required by the many varied categories of borrower, particularly those forced to avail of the services of legal moneylenders.  In addition, the Bill represents the first major assault on the heinous practice of illegal moneylending, which is a blight on the social landscape of our country.</P>
    <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to transpose into Irish law two European Union consumer credit directives.  These are Council Directive No. 87/102/EEC of 22 December 1986 and the amending Directive No. 90/88/EEC of 22 February 1990 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the member states concerning consumer credit.  These directives require member states to provide a certain minimum level of consumer protection in the area of credit.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the Bill, with its far-ranging reforms and extensive provisions, goes well beyond the minimum requirements of the EU directives.  It repeals all existing consumer credit law that is of a piecemeal nature and does not cater for the needs and circumstances of modern day borrowers. Additionally, there will now be just one unified and consolidating comprehensive piece of consumer credit legislation.</P>
    <P>I am also heartened by the fact that what was a good Bill, when it was published in January last year, has undergone a major process of improvement arising form both the elaborate Committee and Report Stage debates in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The most significant changes I am associated with are that housing loans advanced by local authorities are now within the scope of the Bill and local authority borrowers can have recourse, like other consumers, to the Director of Consumer Affairs; credit sale agreements <Col N="21" /> and also contracts for services obtained on credit are included; many of the existing provisions and valuable protections of the Hire-Purchase Acts, 1946 to 1980, have been reinstated; responsibility for bank transaction charges are being transferred from the Central Bank to the Director of Consumer Affairs; and responsibility for licensing pawnbrokers will now reside with the Director of Consumer Affairs rather than the courts and the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>I will now describe the principal provisions in the chronology and order in which they appear in the Bill.  The legislation will apply to and regulate virtually all forms of consumer credit, including moneylending, hire purchase and, for the first time, consumer hire or leasing.</P>
    <P>While the EU directives specifically exclude house purchase and house improvement loans, the Bill introduces a comprehensive regime of control on these types of lending, irrespective of the nature of the financial institution. Until now only the activities of the building societies have been subject to regulation.</P>
    <P>It is also important to draw Senators' attention to the fact that whereas the EU directive excludes loans below the value of 200ECU and above 20,000ECU, which at present exchange rate values are about £160 and £16,000 respectively, the Bill provides for no such limits.  My view, which was shared by my predecessor, is that the imposition of a lower limit would provide a legal loophole for small transactions in moneylending that, however, if added together could amount to a large sum for the borrower within a matter of a few weeks; and an upper limit would result in the undesirable exclusion of housing loans.</P>
    <P>Legislation, no matter how well intended or progressive, is worthless unless it is enforced with rigour and constancy.  Responsibility for the enforcement of the legislation is being vested in the Director of Consumer Affairs.  His main functions will be to <Col N="22" /> regulate and monitor the activities of all persons offering consumer credit or arranging such credit; to seek redress in the courts for breaches of the legislation; to direct lenders to withdraw or modify credit advertisements; to provide advice, guidance and information to consumers on their rights under and on the workings of the Consumer Credit Bill; to license moneylenders; to authorise persons to act as credit intermediaries or mortgage intermediaries; to investigate information given on the credit status of consumers; and to curtail and regulate bank customer charges.</P>
    <P>A term that is increasingly in public usage and that everybody is becoming familiar with is APR.  Unfortunately, in this instance familiarity is not the harbinger of enlightenment.  APR is the true rate of interest.  It means the total cost of credit to the borrower over the lifetime of the loan expressed as an annual percentage of the money borrowed. If this definition seems arcane, the formula for the calculation of the total cost of credit contained in the Fourth Schedule to the Bill is intelligible only to the chosen but numerate few. However, I can assure the House that this formula is the most favourable yet devised to cater for the needs of the consumer.  One of its main advantages is that it provides for continuous compounding or recalculation for any period during the currency of all loans.</P>
    <P>The media are now a potent force for the slick advertising and selling message. Consumers, when listening to the radio, watching television or reading their national or local newspaper, face an onslaught of seductive advertisements offering what seem like unbeatable credit bargains.  However, they can be a source of much confusion and could lead to uninformed and expensive credit decisions.  Normally these advertisements show or quote two rates of charge &mdash; the variable or fixed interest rate and the APR.  By definition, as the APR includes all charges as well as interest, it is higher than the nominal rate of interest.  The present text of the Bill provides that the APR must be <Col N="23" /> given greater prominence than a statement of any other charge.  In my view, this does not provide adequate safeguards for the consumer.  Accordingly, I propose to move an amendment on Committee Stage outlawing the use of any rate other than the APR in advertisements or quotations for credit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I also intend to prohibit lenders showing the annual weekly repayments when, in fact, repayments have to be made on a monthly basis.</P>
      <P>One of the most important protections introduced by the Bill is that the advertisements for credit relating to goods and services must show the cash price of the goods or service, the total cost of credit, the number and amount of instalments, the duration of the intervals between instalment payments, the number of any instalments which have to be paid before delivery of the goods and details of any deposits payable.  Credit agreements, many of which are written in the archaic and quaint language of the Victorian era, are a mystery to the majority of consumers.  Thus the Bill contains detailed rules on the form and content of all consumer agreements.  An amendment tabled by me and agreed on Report Stage in the Dáil provides that separate, specific and transparent requirements will apply as regards credit agreements for cash loans, credit sales agreements and credit agreements for the supply of services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Equally importantly, the Bill provides that a copy of the agreement must be handed personally to the consumer upon the making of the agreement or posted to them within ten days thereafter. In order to avoid the precipitous and often unwise entry into credit agreements, the consumer is now being given a ten day cooling off period.  I would strongly appeal to consumers to avail of this breathing space to ensure that they are fully informed of and alive to the extent and nature of financial obligations which they are undertaking. <Col N="24" /> The general experience until now is that adequate time or opportunity is not being given to consumers to study and, if necessary, take independent professional advice on agreements governing the granting of credit to them.  Apart from mortgage documents, the invariable practice has been to produce the loan agreement and have the consumer sign it on the spot.  This pernicious practice will now be illegal.</P>
    <P>It is also critical that protections do not cease for the consumer once the agreement has been signed.  It is sometimes the case that goods or services financed by, or secured on, credit may be defective in some respect or do not accord with conditions of the supply contract.  The Bill imports the provisions of the Sale of Goods and Supply Services Act, 1980, that where pre-existing arrangements exist between the supplier and the creditor, then both these parties can be held to be jointly and severally liable.</P>
    <P>Creditors sometimes pursue consumers who may have fallen into arrears by phoning or otherwise contacting them at their place of work.  Due discretion or respect for the privacy of the consumer is not a hallmark of what sometimes amounts to a witch-hunt. The legislation prohibits contact at the place of employment, unless the consumer expressly agrees in advance.</P>
    <P>For various reasons a consumer may wish to terminate a credit agreement before it has run its due date.  Equally, the creditor may wish to call in a loan where repayments are not being met. The Bill provides that in each of these circumstances the consumer shall be entitled to a fair and equitable settlement and without any unjustified enrichment of the creditor.  Formulae relating to early settlement may be approved by the Central Bank, in the case of agreements by credit institutions, and by the Director of Consumer Affairs for other classes of agreement.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, the Bill incorporates all the necessary protection required by consumers when entering <Col N="25" /> into hire purchase agreements.  Also for the first time consumer hire or leasing agreements are being regulated.  The legislation lays down rules relating to the form and content of such agreements, the right of the hirer to terminate the agreement, the obligation to the hirer to take reasonable care of the goods and the duty of the hirer to provide information on the whereabouts of the goods.</P>
    <P>There is a demonstrable and urgent need to impose controls on consumer leasing, particularly in respect of motor vehicles.  For a number of years now the financial institutions, together with the motor industry, have combined to formulate leasing schemes that have as their objective the eventual acquisition of the motor vehicle by the lessor, even though largely for tax reasons this was not stated in the lease document. Among the principal difficulties for consumers associated with this type of transaction are that many consumers do not understand the difference between a lease and a loan arrangement &mdash; the consumer cannot sell the car, buyout arrangements can be exorbitant, and sometimes balloon payments have to be made before the transfer of ownership can take place.</P>
    <P>The present moneylenders legislation, based on the Acts of 1900 and 1933, offers little or no protection to those forced by economic circumstances to resort to this type of credit.  Even more seriously, illegal moneylending, that often brings with it wanton violence and gross exploitation, has not been tackled comprehensively or painstakingly until now.  One of the reasons for the failure to tackle this problem is the present dispersal of responsibility for licensing between the courts and the Revenue Commissioners with a limited enforcement role being undertaken by the Director of Consumer Affairs.</P>
    <P>When the Bill is enacted, the Director will be empowered to grant a money-lender's licence in a District Court district in any particular district or part thereof, subject to whatever terms and conditions he deems necessary, to persons <Col N="26" /> wishing to engage in the business of moneylending.  Applicants for moneylenders' licences must pay an annual fee of £1,000 for a licence to trade in one District Court district and a further annual fee of £500 for each additional district or part district in which they intend to operate.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a list of grounds on which the Director may refuse to grant a licence or to vary, suspend or revoke a licence.  An application for a licence must contain certain information, including a statement of the proposed cost of credit, details of all other charges, particularly collection charges, and the terms and conditions.  Conviction for criminal offences or being the holder of a bookmakers, intoxicating liquor or gaming licence will automatically disqualify such persons from engaging in moneylending.  Another important reason for refusal shall be where the proposed cost of credit is excessive and/or the proposed conditions are unfair.</P>
    <P>Those refused a licence, or who may have their licences revoked or varied, may, within seven days, appeal the Director's decision to the judge of the appropriate Circuit Court district.  The court may on hearing the appeal confirm the refusal or decision, or may allow the appeal, whereupon the Director shall grant the licence or, as the case may be, not revoke or vary the terms and conditions of the licence.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains provisions to deal with a number of alleged practices currently used by moneylenders resulting in the borrower not receiving the full amount of the loan although the moneylenders' records would show this to be the case.  A moneylender may not give a loan while at the same time retaining a portion of it for repayment instalments or charges and then go on to demand repayment as if the full amount had been advanced.  Equally the practice of retaining part of a top-up loan in respect of an amount owing on an earlier loan, while basing the repayments on the full amount notionally advanced, is prohibited.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="27" /> Moneylenders will have to keep a record of all transactions in a repayment book.  This means that the consumer has at all times an up-to-date record of the repayments position.  It will also provide authorised officers of the Director with an effective means of checking that matters are in order.</P>
    <P>The repayment book must contain the name and address of both parties to the agreement, the amount of credit advanced, the date on which it was advanced, the number and amount of each repayment instalment, the rate of interest charged, including the APR, the amount payable in respect of the loan, the date of expiry of the loan, and the agreement number or other reference that identifies the loan.  The manner or form in which repayments are to be recorded is also prescribed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the effectiveness of the legislation is increased significantly by the designation of a specific role for the Garda Síochána in the eradication of illegal moneylending.  The Bill provides that the Garda Síochána is empowered to request persons engaged in collecting credit to provide a moneylenders licence or authorisation; to arrest, without warrant, persons engaged in unlicensed moneylending; and to seize any document belonging to another person being held as security by those engaged in moneylending.  The last mentioned power is aimed at stamping out the wanton practice by unlicensed moneylenders of holding and cashing social welfare payment books belonging to their clients.</P>
    <P>The purchase of a house usually represents the single most important financial transaction by most consumers. Despite this, existing protections for consumers are far from adequate. Specifically, the legislation provides for detailed rules on the calculation of the total cost of a housing loan; a clearly laid out format for housing loan agreements; early repayment of a variable housing loan without the consumer having to pay a redemption fee; exercise of choice by the consumer in taking out <Col N="28" /> house insurance; a prohibition on the lender from passing on to the consumer the cost of legal investigation of title to the house; the outlawing of the linking of insurance and other services to the grant of a loan; and the disclosure of all fees, charges and commissions in connection with a loan and any associated insurance policy.</P>
    <P>Many of these requirements are not mandatory, and, to the extent that they are, they apply solely to loans advanced by building societies.  Therefore, in future there will be uniform and extensive rules and procedures that must be observed by all providers of housing loans, including local authorities.  The objective of this approach is to ensure that consumers will have the necessary information to choose and decide on the form of housing loan most appropriate and favourable to their needs and circumstances.</P>
    <P>The regulation of the selling activities of financial intermediaries in the area of mortgages and other loans is neither excessive nor rigorous at present.  From now on, both credit and mortgage intermediaries will have to be authorised by the Director of Consumer Affairs and undergo strict application and vetting procedures.  Consequently, consumers can have greater confidence and trust when using the services of authorised intermediaries.</P>
    <P>Consumers can often be poorly served and find themselves in a financial dilemma having been urged on and enticed to take out endowment mortgages. Without doubt, endowment mortgages are complex financial products, not readily understood by many consumers.  In opting for an endowment mortgage, the consumer has to weigh up a number of considerations relating to credit, insurance and investment, each of them difficult in themselves, while, simultaneously, making important decisions on property and home ownership. Accordingly, the Bill places great emphasis on the need for transparent and intelligible information.</P>
    <P>Expert advice is required and this is normally provided by a mortgage or <Col N="29" /> insurance broker.  However, there is no doubt the high level of commission paid in respect of associated insurance policies has led to an undesirable situation of unsuitable loan endowment packages being forced on consumers.</P>
    <P>Increases in bank charges and their proliferation over the years have been a growing source of grievance to both consumers and business customers.  Customers find it difficult to understand, and the financial institutions have not been convincing in explaining, why customers should have to pay these charges when the cost of money to them is way above the level of inflation and dwarfs the level of interest paid on deposits.</P>
    <P>Until now, control of bank transaction charges has been vested in the Central Bank.  The perception is that the Central Bank has been preoccupied with more major decisions and that financial institutions have been given an easy run.  This unsatisfactory situation ought not be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that all proposals to increase charges or introduce new charges shall be subjected to detailed scrutiny by the Director of Consumer Affairs.  Applicants shall have to pay a fee of up to £25,000, money that will be used to part finance the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs and to discourage too infrequent or insignificant proposals.</P>
    <P>The proposed new control regime has given rise to concerns on the part of the Irish Bankers Federation, the Irish Finance Houses Association and the Irish Mortgage and Savings Association.  I have taken the opportunity of meeting with them and of consulting with the Director of Consumer Affairs.  Arising from the consultations, I am considering amendments for Committee Stage relating to the nature of the charges to be covered; how terms and conditions by financial institutions shall be dealt with; the impact of a £250,000 fee on institutions where the volume of transactions is not significant; the stipulation of a period in which the director would be required to respond to notifications to increase charges or introduce new <Col N="30" /> ones, particularly in so far as they would relate to new financial products; the passing on of third party charges, including those for the use by some institutions of the money transmission system; and allowing certain institutions to make group applications to the director, on the strict understanding that this procedure was not in breach of competition law.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a landmark in the advancement of consumer rights in Ireland and represents a long overdue reform of our consumer credit legislation.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and compliment him on the work he has done on this Bill.  However, I feel we should acknowledge the person who has been mainly responsible for it, that is the former Minister of State, Deputy O'Rourke.  She and her officials put an enormous amount of work into the Bill. She met approximately 80 groups of people and spent most of last July discussing the Committee Stage of the Bill. It is only right we acknowledge her work and the way the present Minister of State has added to it.</P>
      <P>The Consumer Credit Bill comprehensively addresses many of the imbalances from a consumer point of view, right across the credit sector, ranging from its advertising to its implementation, duration and determination.  The essence of the Bill is two-fold.  First, it will address the inherent imbalance in the relationship between the borrower and the lender; second, it will give the consumer full transparency to be able to look clearly and critically at credit products. The Bill gives the Director of Consumer Affairs wide powers to ensure the consumer is given clear communications on the one hand and a fair and reasonable deal on the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill gives the consumer access to the full facts by creating transparency, not just on credit products such as housing loans, but also on all associated products, such as property insurance, life assurance, endowment policies, hire purchase, leasing and moneylending. <Col N="31" /> This means full disclosure of hitherto hidden fees and commissions which can create bias and may mean the consumer is not getting the best or most competitive deal.  I welcome that the Bill addresses in an innovative and effective way problems associated with moneylending.</P>
    <P>In particular, I welcome that this Bill addresses in an innovative and effective way the problems associated with money lending.  I particularly welcome the provision to arrest illegal money lenders without warrant.  The maximum penalties for unlicensed money lending will now be increased to £50,000 and/or five years imprisonment.</P>
    <P>However, we should try to ensure that the practical effect of this Bill will become known throughout the country, because the Bill in itself will not enable consumers to find themselves in a better position overnight.  We need a massive countrywide education and communication process to show people that they have as many rights in buying money as the lender has in selling money.  We have an ethos in this country where we go to our bank or building society manager with cap in hand to get a loan.  It is important to change this and to teach people that they are buying money and, as such, have equal rights to the bank or building society manager who is selling them that money.</P>
    <P>The banks, building societies and all money lenders are perceived as having a dominant whip hand position with regard to the transaction of selling money.  This Bill only begins to address the situation.  We must ensure that the Director of Consumer Affairs will be in a position to educate people that they now have a level playing pitch when it comes to buying money, that they are of equal standing to the person selling the money to them and that there is a wide range of controls to ensure that they get a fair deal and the best deal possible.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister of State to spell out during this debate exactly what he proposes to put in place to ensure that the Director of Consumer Affairs <Col N="32" /> has the necessary extra resources to police this Bill properly and to provide the massive countrywide education programme which is urgently needed.  For example, we were told in the earlier debate by the former Minister of State, Deputy O'Rourke, that it is intended to provide extra financial and staffing resources to the Director of Consumer Affairs.  I ask the Minister to spell out exactly what he intends to provide in this respect.</P>
    <P>We were told by Deputy O'Rourke that she intended to open, on a phased basis, offices of the Director of Consumer Affairs throughout the country starting with Cork, Limerick, Galway, Athlone and Sligo.  Will the Minister of State tell us when he will have those offices opened to enable the Office of Consumer Affairs to be brought to the shop front and be available throughout the country so that people can be made aware of their rights?  This Bill could then be the forerunner to introducing a new ethos in regard to the purchase of money, rather than going cap in hand to the bank manager, where most people feel that he is in a strong position and they are in a weak position.</P>
    <P>The Consumer Credit Bill restores the balance to consumer rights in a financial services market which has become increasingly more complex and sophisticated.  It seeks to tackle the smoke and mirrors surrounding many of these products, both in terms of hidden linkages and margins such as non transparent fees and commissions.  There is nothing wrong with conflicts of interest and links between one product and another, or between one institution and another, provided &mdash; and this is an essential part of the Bill &mdash; the consumer is aware of such linkages.  Not only is it a requirement of this Bill that such linkages be fully disclosed, but the consumer must also be made fully aware of his or her rights in regard to those hidden linkages and margins.</P>
    <P>In the past Ireland adopted consumer credit legislation on a piecemeal basis, dealing mainly with instalment sales, hire purchase and certain types of personal <Col N="33" /> loans.  The primary purpose of this Bill is to give effect in Irish law to the two European Directives &mdash; Directive 81/102/EC of 22 December 1986 and the amending Directive 90/88/EC of 22 February 1990 &mdash; on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the member states concerning consumer credit.  However, this Bill goes far beyond those directives, and many of the initiatives taken by Deputy O'Rourke in additional areas are worthy of great praise.  The further additions made by the present Minister of State are also most welcome.</P>
    <P>The Bill strikes the right balance and addresses adequately the deficiencies and gaps in the present legislation.  I know that the former Minister of State consulted widely in the drafting of the legislation with the Consumers' Association of Ireland, the financial institutions and, more importantly, those representing the disadvantaged and vulnerable in our society such as Combat Poverty, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and money advice and budgeting services under the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>We have only to look at television or listen to radio to be aware of the increasing power of the media in advertising and promoting such products.  On radio and television and in national and local newspapers there are advertisements offering what seem like unbeatable credit bargains.  However, these heavily sold offers are often without adequate and clear details of many of the important loan conditions to enable the consumer to make an informed and rational decision.  This legislation provides that the selling methods must be accompanied by information on the cost of the credit and a statement of any restrictions on the availability of such credit.  There will also be a legal obligation, where goods are offered on credit, that the cash price, the total price, the total credit price and the number and amount of instalments must be shown clearly.</P>
    <P>The Bill also lays down detailed requirements on the form and content <Col N="34" /> of credit agreements.  Generally, consumers are not afforded sufficient time or opportunity to study, and if necessary to take independent professional advice on, agreements governing the granting of credit to them.  In that respect I welcome the Minister of State's initiative in including proper control of intermediaries who act between the lender and the borrower.  Apart from mortgage documents, the invariable practice has been to produce the loan agreement and have the consumer sign it on the spot.  Many of those agreements are weighed down by language which is scarcely intelligible to the legal and financial professions, and there is very little hope of the consumer understanding their terms and implications.</P>
    <P>In addition to providing for greater transparency and intelligibility, the Bill stipulates a cooling off period of ten days for all credit agreements except mortgages.  It is clear that if the market was distorted with regard to a cooling off period for mortgages, it would distort purchasing and selling arrangements and leave many people in a serious situation.</P>
    <P>The Bill also introduces important provisions in regard to moneylending, regulating most forms of consumer spending by introducing new and stronger provisions in that area &mdash; for example, regulating matters arising during and at the end of credit agreements; early repayment or prohibiting increased charges in the event of default; setting down parameters for the content of credit advertisements and credit agreements, and strengthening the Office of Consumer Affairs to allow consumers throughout the country easy access.</P>
    <P>The process of introducing this Bill began as far back as 1992 when the EEC Directiyes relating to transparency and various matters did not deal with many of the aspects dealt with by this Bill &mdash; for example, those relating to mortgages. In her pursuit of this Bill, Deputy O'Rourke was conscious of the fact that the greatest purchase consumers make is the purchase of their home.  Consequently, <Col N="35" /> she extended the legislation to include mortgages.  The Minister, who announced a further extension to include SDA loans or local authority mortgages, would be well advised to talk to the SDA loan authorities about looking at the interest rates they charge, which are considerably higher than market rates.  I do not understand why SDA loan rates cannot be reduced to reflect market rates, which have been among the lowest for some time.</P>
    <P>The Bill will include strong licensing and enforcement arrangements as regards legal moneylenders and strong prohibitions against illegal ones.  I will deal briefly with the other outdated legislation, the Hire Purchase Act, 1945 to 1980, although hire purchase transactions are subject to stringent legal conditions.  Finance companies in liaison with dealers have devised new methods of providing goods and services on credit to consumers which enables them to fall outside the remit of the Hire Purchase Act, 1946 to 1980.  For example, the number of personal loans not linked formally to the purchase of specific goods or services but required by consumers for those purposes, increased markedly after the enactment of the hire purchase legislation.  This Bill will remedy this mischief by adopting an all embracing approach to the regulation of consumer credit, which will ensure truth in lending.</P>
    <P>The part of the Bill relating to moneylending deals with a number of practices allegedly used by moneylenders and which result in the borrower not receiving the full amount of the loan, although on paper that would appear to be the case.  A moneylender may not advance a loan while retaining a portion of it in respect of repayment instalments and base the charges for the loan on the full amount advanced.  Equally, the practice is prohibited of retaining for a top up loan an amount in respect of an earlier loan, while still basing the charge on the full loan being advanced.</P>
    <P>It is also welcome that the moneylender will be obliged to keep a record <Col N="36" /> of all transactions in a repayment book. Many legal moneylenders already operate properly.  The purpose of this provision is to ensure that others do so also. It ensures that the consumer has at all times an up to date record of the position as regards repayments under the moneylending agreement.  It will also provide authorised officers of the Director with a simple and straightforward way of checking that matters are in order.</P>
    <P>The section of the Bill which covers the collection of payments is important. It will not be possible for lenders to make calls between 9 a.m. and 10 p.m. on Sundays or on public holidays.  The impact of the legislation is greatly enhanced by the inclusion of the specific role for the Garda Síochána in helping to stamp out illegal moneylending. Under the Bill the Garda Síochána is empowered to request a person engaged in collecting credit to provide a money-lender's licence or authorisation, to arrest without warrant persons engaged in unlicensed moneylending and to seize any document belonging to another person being held by those engaged in money lending.</P>
    <P>This latter power is designed to eliminate the practice by unlicensed moneylenders of cashing and holding social welfare payment books belonging to their clients.  Despite the fact that this matter has been brought to public attention in recent years, there is still evidence of moneylending that is not carried out within the strict regulations which will be laid down in this Bill. There is a need to carefully police these activities which are to be found in many cities, including Galway city.  It is vitally important that the Office of Consumer Affairs has the power to clamp down on moneylenders who do not operate within the remit of the law.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for including extra provisions.  I hope the Bill will pass quickly through this House and into law.  It is a reflection on us all that this Bill has been around since 1986 and is only now in its final stages.  However, it is better late than never.  I commend the <Col N="37" /> Bill to the House and I thank the Minister, his predecessor and the officials in the Department, who put much work into this good Bill.  I hope that with proper education this Bill will become an effective tool in the hands of those who are discriminated against by a system of moneylending which has not been favourable to the consumer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  This morning I looked back at some of the headlines in the newspapers in October 1993 when the Bill was first introduced.  They included headlines such as &ldquo;Customers Always Lose Despite Growing Competition&rdquo;, &ldquo;Bank Charges &mdash; Small Borrowers To Be Protected By Government Charter of Rights&rdquo; and &ldquo;New Charges &mdash; Banks Are Called To Account&rdquo;.  I have a few comments and criticisms to make on what has happened since then in the area of charges, banking and lending to the consumers.  This morning I spoke to somebody who was charged an outrageous amount of money on a loan which they had repaid in full.  They were being charged a penalty because they were repaying the loan six months early.</P>
      <P>As the previous speaker said, this Bill was discussed in 1986.  It has taken us nine years to come to grips with this particular problem. I welcome the Bill for a number of reasons.  The financial institutions should be regulated and, in particular, there should be some control on the way moneylenders deal with people. The Minister mentioned a number of provisions which I welcome.  The provision as regards APR is welcome in that the proper amounts and costs will be advertised in the future.  I also welcome the provision whereby those who have fallen into arrears will not be harassed in the workplace.  For 15 or 17 years I have been involved in organising loans and helping people to organise their own homes.  It is unfortunate but it is a fact of life that some people get into arrears and they do not need the type of harassment, especially in their workplace, which occurred in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="38" /> I accept and welcome the measure regarding a fair and equitable settlement without unjustified enrichment of the creditor.  This is only right and proper. It is preferable if a position can be agreed which does not involve interest charges in addition to outstanding interest.  Many banks have been most helpful in trying to reach settlements with people who get into difficulties. However, some lending institutions are not as helpful in that regard.  I make this point because I have experience of dealing with banks on behalf of many people in those situations.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that applicants must pay an annual fee of £1,000 for a moneylending licence to trade in one District Court area and a further annual fee of £500 for each additional district or part of a district in which they intend to operate.  How will that be controlled? If a moneylender secures a licence, what will stop him going into other districts?  Who will know if he goes into other areas?  How will this be organised?</P>
    <P>I welcome the important measure that a moneylender may not give a loan while retaining a portion of it for repayment of instalments or charges.  All politicians know from their experience that moneylenders have in the past retained a certain amount of the original loan and later sought repayment of the full loan amount.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to deal with redemption fees in his reply.  Before the Bill is enacted, I ask him to ensure that no penalties may be imposed by financial institutions when a loan is being repaid in full.  I make this point on the basis that I am awaiting a response from the institution I telephoned this morning for a client who contacted me.  An indication should be given that the law will be such that penalties may not be imposed on people repaying loans in full.  The message that we do not agree with such penalties should go out loud and clear from this debate.  With all due respect to the institutions, this is outrageous behaviour when one considers the amounts paid to the directors of <Col N="39" /> many of these organisations.  I hope this practice will cease as a result of this debate.</P>
    <P>In relation to how charges are fixed and the different rates for the different services provided, financial institutions tell us that charges in other European countries are higher than in Ireland. However, the profits of the main banks in the State are increasing substantially on a continual basis.  The banks' argument is that this is most important and vital to their survival.  I do not doubt this, but consumers are not ultimately reaping any benefit from the large profit increases.</P>
    <P>Small businesses, which are trying to survive, make a living and employ a number of people, pay the most in charges.  They may be over their limit by perhaps £2,000 and all their transactions are subject to charges, for example, referral fees.  Can proper rules and regulations be included in the Bill to ensure that charges over a certain amount may not be imposed?  From discussions with people I represent, I find they pay the most in bank charges, in addition to agreed interest payments.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to accept the level of charges.  The major institutions no longer take on full-time staff.  In the future &mdash; if it is not already the case &mdash; the majority of those dealing with people at counters will be full-time temporary staff.  People are no longer employed as full-time permanent staff, unless if it is for a specific job.  As a result, many staff members of the major financial institutions go elsewhere for their mortgages.  Some might say I do not know what I am talking about, but people have told me that they have sought loans from financial institutions other than those in which they work because, since they are full-time temporary and not permanent staff, they are ineligible.</P>
    <P>This matter must be addressed in the changes affecting the financial institutions. I presume this situation has arisen because banks do not want to have to fork out substantial amounts of <Col N="40" /> redundancy to these people who work nine or ten months of the year.  Perhaps this applies throughout Europe but I cannot speak for other countries.  It is a fact of life in Ireland and it probably will not change as a result of this legislation. However, it is important and it would be remiss of me not to mention how things have changed dramatically in this area in recent years.</P>
    <P>I attended a function last night and somebody with me was asked what he thought of bank managers.  This question was put to a very elegant gentleman who is high up in a financial institution and his reply was that they were like the tide; they come in and they go out.  He was asked to explain this further and he said that when things are going well economically in the country, they are there to give out quite a substantial amount of funds to as many people as possible.  However, when the squeeze comes, they are there to take it back as quickly as they can.  His comments are true and eloquently explained the position.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes made by the current Minister.  It is true that the former Minister did a substantial amount of work on this legislation.  It is interesting to note that work had commenced on the Bill during the current Minister for Enterprise and Employment's short time in the Department in 1986.  It is important to get the Bill right since it has taken so long to bring it forward. The changes which have been made, and there may be more changes before the Bill is passed, will ensure that consumers are protected by this legislation. If we do nothing more, we will be doing an excellent job ensuring that individuals at least have an opportunity to redress the balance which was not in their favour up to now.  They will have an opportunity to go to the Director of Consumer Affairs who can examine individual cases.</P>
    <P>It would be wise to implement the changes recommended by the Minister and the House should approve the Bill at the earliest possible date so that the type of problems about which I was contacted <Col N="41" /> this morning will not recur in the future.  If and when the consumer decides to repay in full a mortgage or other loan, be it commercial or otherwise, it should be on the basis of what is owed and penalties should not be charged on a three to six monthly basis. I welcome this Bill and look forward to the Minister's comments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Miss Ormonde Miss Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I sat beside the Minister for nine years in another Chamber and it is nice to see him in his new post.</P>
      <P>This is welcome legislation.  I must preface my contribution by paying tribute to the former Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy O'Rourke, for the groundwork and research she put into this Bill.  I also compliment the Minister who has incorporated all the points that were outlined by the former Minister on all aspects of this Bill.</P>
      <P>This is timely legislation.  It is a new approach to the regulation of all credit which, up to now, was piecemeal.  When looking for a loan, one never knew where one stood as to the procedures or the kind of information that was necessary to make a decision because they were fragmented.  People never knew how to make the first approach to the credit supplier.  One only has to open up the major newspapers and find up to three pages of advertisements promoting the goods or services of these institutions, which makes it confusing for the consumer to decide what they should get.  In the light of all that has happened, this legislation is welcome and will be welcomed by all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation outlines the cost of the credit, the restrictions on the availability of credit, the cash price, the total credit price and the number and amount of instalments.  It is important for anybody looking for credit to find out how much they will be paying every month in terms of the cash outlay and the number of instalments.  Up to now, little information and advice were given as to how one would go about it.  When one asked for advice, the language was unintelligible <Col N="42" /> to the ordinary Joe Soap that he would be inhibited from asking another question.  We must make the system more user friendly for the many people who may be daunted by the undertaking of financial arrangements.  I welcome the fact that the procedures have been made very much clearer in this Bill.</P>
    <P>This legislation will protect the consumer, especially in regard to intimidation when there is default on the number of instalments or if a person cannot fulfil his commitment to pay an instalment.  I am glad to see that the legislation will forbid such practices of intimidation.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the fact that we are now strengthening the role of the Director of Consumer Affairs regarding advertisements and credit agreements and helping the consumer, if he has any doubts about the way the credit arrangements are being conducted, and taking people to court, if necessary. However, now that he will be able to enforce the legislation, the fact that the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs will now be regionalised with offices in our main cities, if there is an office in Waterford, how will I as a consumer know that this office is there to protect me?  What kind of public relations exercise will the Minister incorporate into his legislation to get this message to the people?  It is great to see this legislation, but its implementation is also important.</P>
    <P>Before I came to this House, I never knew about Bills that were debated here.  Many people do not know that this Bill is being discussed in this House. If this Bill becomes law, I would like to see second level schools being informed next September about it.  I should be able to go to the leaving certificate business organisation or economics class and say that this is legislation they should know about; but how will their parents know about it?  At this moment there could be people going into the banks or other credit houses who do not know there is legislation coming through this House that will protect their rights.  How will they know that <Col N="43" /> next September or October they will be protected?  I would like to see the Minister incorporate in his presentation and the legislation a means to tell the public that we are protecting them, that the legislation is now in place and that they will know the exact cash price, the number of instalments and the kind of credit involved because it will be incorporated in the details of their loan; if they default on any payment, they will know the implications and they will not be commercially exploited or intimidated.</P>
    <P>It is wonderful that we can discuss this legislation but the public will want to know about it.  The more our deliberations are put out to them, the better. We will not do this through the media. Sometimes, the people who want to know this information do not get it through the television or the newspapers. It has to be done through residents associations, community involvement and second level schools, starting at junior certificate level.  Many young people do not stay on to do their leaving certificate; they leave after finishing their junior certificate.  These are the people who will be wondering if they can get a loan for a house or a car, how will they go about getting it and if they cannot get it, what does that mean? They should not be inhibited from getting a loan from the start.  It is important that the public should know about it.  It is great for us to talk about it in this House, but we should get the information out to the public.  This is wonderful legislation and I would hate to think that we were only talking shop, that we would not go any further with it and that the public would not know about it.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the fact that the Garda Síochána will be given more powers to protect the public against illegal moneylenders, that they will be empowered to require moneylenders to produce their licences and ensure the public are protected.</P>
    <P>Housing loans are the biggest financial outlay for most consumers.  We all know there are hidden charges when <Col N="44" /> one invests in a house; there is a special charge for investigating the deeds and title and an insurance charge.  The freedom to choose one's own insurance company is also important.  People do not understand these charges.  They do not ask enough questions because financial problems are alien to them.  People are not good at thinking financial problems through.</P>
    <P>The disclosure of all fees in relation to house loans is a welcome aspect of the Bill.  Most people buying a house would be pleased to know that they will understand the cost of the house, the charge for investigating the title of the house, the insurance, etc.  People do not understand what it means to take out an endowment policy and immediately run away from the idea.  The public must be knowledgeable.  That knowledge must be user-friendly and not consist of the jargon used by financial institutions. These institutions forget that ordinary people simply want to put down a deposit on a house, know the amount and number of instalments they have to pay, know the interest charged and the number of years it will take.  This is a simple exercise but it has become very complicated.  Financial jargon is used and confuses people.  It is important that the hidden charges will be revealed.  We will have much more transparency and accountability in relation to all aspects of credit as a result.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a uniform set of rules and will involve openness and transparency.  Professional advice is very important when people enter into negotiation. Perhaps the Minister would ensure that those responsible for giving professional advice are not above the people.  For example, people who teach computers are not really teachers.  They understand the mechanism but they cannot get their message across.  People who work for financial institutions are similar.  They are not teachers.  It is important that those giving out information &mdash; this also refers to the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs &mdash; are able to communicate in user-friendly language and make ordinary <Col N="45" /> people comfortable in negotiating one of the most important financial outlays of their lives.  There must always be sensitivity for these people at such times because they are facing a major decision.</P>
    <P>Information is very important and should be made easier to understand. People never know whether or not they are making the correct decision when seeking credit.  They are constantly afraid that the undertaking is too much for them.  Sensitivity is required.  The Minister should incorporate it in the legislation.  The financial institutions and people selected to communicate the information should be made aware that it is important the public are protected and feel comfortable in their surroundings. People are daunted by the very way that these institutions conduct their business.  This Bill should be an absolute guideline for people who want to seek credit in the future.</P>
    <P>Bank charges are another aspect which require clarification.  People never know what these bank charges entail.  I spoke to someone who had a loan or overdraft of £3,000.  They discovered they had gone over their limit and, on their next bank statement, were charged on the basis that they had exceeded that limit.  It is the bank's responsibility to give information to the client or consumer in relation to all aspects of credit and that there may be an extra charge if they borrow money and do not pay it back.  It should be the responsibility of the supplier of credit to inform the consumer of this at the outset in order that they are aware of the precise position with regard to bank charges.  I welcome this aspect of the Bill.  I am not sure how precise it is in the legislation.  The Minister should be aware that it is a very controversial, area because quite often in social conversation people will comment about bank charges they were unaware of being incorporated on their statements.</P>
    <P>Transparency and accountability are required.  The consumer should feel comfortable and this area should be made user-friendly.  Those in society <Col N="46" /> who do not understand finances of any kind should be protected.  I am referring to disadvantaged people who do not plan for a rainy day; they buy today and let tomorrow take care of itself.  These people need protection.  They go to moneylenders because they may not have access to the banks or other financial institutions.  I welcome the fact that under this legislation these people will be protected, educated and given assistance in budgeting their finances if they are seeking credit to buy a television or suite of furniture.  They will be informed about paying their instalments and the collection time involved.  This is where the scourge of illegal moneylenders comes into being.  They detect that these people are vulnerable, do not understand how to do business and are not <i>au fait</i> with the financial institutions.  These moneylenders are immediately on to a winner.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to have particular regard for those who are less well-off in society, who will not attend to their business in the ordinary way or do not want to be educated because it is not part of their ethos.  I have returned to where I began.  The public, our children and the community at large should be educated in order that those in vulnerable situations will have access to somebody who can give them advice or help.  I recognise that community welfare officers are there to set out budgets and give advice to people who need it. However, I do not know how many people are aware of this.  I do not believe it is well known that I can advise someone in my constituency, who is receiving social welfare payments, on how to go about buying a suite of furniture. The ordinary man in the street needs advice.  He may not want to go to the bank, or into the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs, simply because he does not like offices or having to conduct business across a counter.</P>
    <P>These barriers must be overcome if the public are to be educated.  This is a very good piece of legislation.  I believe it will redress the balance between the supplier and the consumer of credit.  It <Col N="47" /> will introduce more confidence and trust and a more user-friendly situation when dealing with suppliers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is a strong and detailed piece of legislation, which is very much pro-consumer. Before I begin, I would like to pay tribute to the former Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, and the current Minister.  Both have shown a great deal of commitment to this particular piece of legislation in terms of the wide consultation they engaged in and the detailed care they have given to the legislation going through the Dáil and Seanad.</P>
      <P>The Bill is quite detailed.  It began with 121 sections and now has 153 sections dealing with all aspects of consumerism and the protection of the consumer. There will be quite a detailed examination of it on both Committee Stage and Report Stage in this House. It is a strong piece of legislation which empowers a sector of the community that sometimes suffers from a lack of power.  I am referring to the people mentioned at the end of Senator Ormonde's speech &mdash; those without easy access to finance who have in the past frequently resorted to unlicensed moneylenders.  They are people who basically do not have any money and who cannot, therefore, even avail of the excellent services of credit unions because they have not built up the necessary credit to get a loan.  I wholeheartedly endorse the excellent work of credit unions in sections of society that do not have privileges such as bank accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1988 a report by the Combat Poverty Agency indicated that there were three unlicensed moneylenders for every licensed one.  All of us who work in public life have come across victims of moneylenders, people whose social welfare books have been taken and who have been put under other pressure to repay money they do not have.  Such people have come to us, as public representatives, with their rent books, ESB <Col N="48" /> and gas bills, as well as the amount they owe to the unlicensed moneylender and a whole lot of other problems.  They find it difficult to feed their families.  Very often it is the unlicensed moneylender who puts on the greatest pressure to repay and makes their victims' lives a misery.  I am delighted that this legislation gives more power to the consumer in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Bill also gives consumers the right to clear information about interest, repayments and the total amount to be paid back eventually.  They will also have the right to a repayment book so that they can keep an exact record of what they are required to pay and will not be open to exploitation in a way that many people have been in the past.</P>
    <P>The Bill is strong on licensing, enforcing and on the prohibition of illegal moneylenders.  I welcome the fact that the powers of the Director of Consumer Affairs are being strengthened.  On Report Stage in the Dáil the Minister indicated that the Director's staff will be increased from 30 to 60.  In addition, a number of centres will be established around the country in Cork, Limerick, Athlone and I am not sure whether it is Galway or Sligo.  There is some doubt as to which of the two places it is.  People will have access to information through these centres.  The fee of £1,000 is appropriate with an extra £500 if you go into another District Court area.  I noted Senator Farrelly's question, which is a legitimate one, as to how you actually police it.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the fact that under this legislation the Minister is including bank charges, which are a bone of contention for many of us.  When we get bank statements we sometimes find little £2, £3 and £4 charges and we wonder what they are all about.  You find that you have gone a bit above your limit and so every time you write a cheque you are being charged extra.</P>
    <P>Computers now bounce your cheques whereas in the old days you dealt with a person who knew you and understood that while you might have temporary difficulties you were basically a good <Col N="49" /> person to have around.  They were understanding, but computers do not understand people, unfortunately, and for that reason it is appropriate that bank charges are included in the Bill's provisions.  Consumers will have the right to know why these small sums of money, that add up in the end, are being included in their statements.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Minister indicated that in a number of areas he is going beyond the two EU directives in question, particularly the fact that he is including smaller loans.  I forget how many ECUs it was, but many vulnerable people borrow very small amounts and so it is appropriate that they should be included under the legislation.</P>
    <P>The APR question is as confusing to me as it is to most other people.  While the Minister's definition seemed fairly concise, the mathematics in the Bill are very confusing.  However, I understand that the Minister intends to convey to the consumer the ability to compare like with like.  In that way you will know that what one company is quoting is comparable to another and you will not be looking at different sets of figures from one company to the other.</P>
    <P>In the amendment that the Minister is proposing to move in this House, advertising will have to quote APR clearly without other distracting figures that might entice the consumer to go for one company rather than another.  I welcome the Minister's intention in that regard.</P>
    <P>The ten-day cooling off period referred to by many speakers is very important, because sometimes you sign things without taking the time to consider what you are letting yourself in for.  The cooling off period gives people an opportunity for second thoughts.  We all make quick decisions occasionally, due to pressure of time or having people ask us to do a lot of things at once. Despite what Deputy Ahern said about my party, none of us is perfect and we all make wrong decisions at times.</P>
    <P>The people covered in this legislation are often under severe financial pressure. They need money for Christmas, <Col N="50" /> Communions, school books and all sorts of urgent bills.  If somebody offers them money in the hand that looks attractive they will grasp it, but they may have taken on something they cannot deal with later.  For that reason the ten day cooling off period is very welcome.</P>
    <P>The roll over system, whereby you do not receive the full amount of money borrowed until a later stage, is now outlawed and, thus, you are not paying back on something that you have not yet received.  The clear recording of what people owe in repayment books is also important.  The powers of the Garda have been changed so that they can take immediate action if a person is lending money without an appropriate licence.</P>
    <P>Senator Ormonde mentioned the involvement of the community Garda, who will have an important role, because those who borrow from illegal lenders are not always very visible in society.  Often, they are people who stay at home a lot and who are not strong enough to fight for their rights.  The activities of illegal moneylenders can, therefore, be quite secretive and can be carried out without many people knowing about them.  Community gardaí, residents' and tenants' associations know what is going on in a community and may be better able to identify an illegal moneylender than the more formal powers.</P>
    <P>The points made by Senator Ormonde about information are important in that regard.  On Report Stage in the Dáil the Minister said that information sessions would be provided around the country to make people aware of their powers under this legislation. Community information centres scattered around the country will also be important tools in conveying information more widely because the centres to be set up will only be in major cities. There are many areas outside the main centres of population where access to such information is important and community information centres will be useful in that regard.  Local radio could also be used to give people information.  In <Col N="51" /> my experience a sizable proportion of those who have used illegal moneylenders would not be literate or would have problems with literacy and would therefore not necessarily read notices, local newspapers or information coming through their doors.</P>
    <P>I was approached by a number of people who could not read and had debts to illegal moneylenders.  They did not understand they had rights under the law.  They felt they had to pay back the money, even if they had no idea whether they had already repaid it a number of times.  Many people in this category listen to local and national radio, so it might be a useful vehicle for informing some of the most vulnerable people in society.</P>
    <P>The money advice officials of the Department of Social Welfare also do good work in helping people organise repayments to their various creditors on a weekly basis.  These officials should be used to the maximum extent.</P>
    <P>The original sections 46 and 47 of the Bill, now sections 50 and 51, deal with excessive charges.  If it is deemed or it is brought to the attention of the Director of Consumer Affairs that charges are excessive, there should be powers to redress that.  It is also vital that the public knows that power exists.  If a person thinks she is being charged too much she should have access to the Director, who in turn can initiate a legal transaction to re-open the negotiations and ensure they are conducted fairly.  The provision was changed to allow access to any appropriate court, as apposed to just the High Court.  It is right that the lower courts should be used where possible. Where a charge is perceived to be excessive it should be possible to re-open the matter and get redress.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation, because it gives people power over what is unfortunately a necessary part of their lives. They sometimes must borrow money to pay for things they want and need.  They should be protected and must know exactly what they are repaying, to ensure they are not charged excessive <Col N="52" /> amounts.  They should have control at all times over what they repay.  This legislation is comprehensive in that regard and we will have an opportunity to look at it in greater detail on later Stages.  Like Senator Farrelly, I hope it becomes law before the summer recess.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister and welcome him to the House on his first visit.  He has introduced a comprehensive Bill, which will have a safe passage.  It is welcome legislation and, without taking credit away from the Minister, his predecessor, Deputy O'Rourke, a former Member of this House, was much involved in bringing it to this point.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned directives for the protection of consumers, which are badly needed.  Consumers are pressurised every day by radio and television advertising.  Mr. Niall Tóibín is in one advertisement, which states that if a person buys a car from that company, it will be taxed free of charge for one year. That may save the person up to £400, if he borrows the money from the right place.</P>
      <P>Television advertising is getting even worse, because it now features &ldquo;sky shops&rdquo;, or satellite selling.  All a person has to do is call immediately, even if it is 4 a.m., and give his credit card number. He then has plenty of time to pay for it, because he will be paying for the rest of his life.</P>
      <P>As to credit cards, a person gets his first card, gets into trouble with it, and then gets a second card.  Soon he has a third and fourth card.  Out of the blue arrives an invitation for a brand new card which will take full responsibility for all the debts on the other cards, once he signs on the dotted line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt protection is needed and I hope it is provided in this Bill.  One matter which annoys me is when an offer specifies that a repayment is a certain amount per week, but one finds out later that payments are monthly rather than weekly.  This is false advertising.  I note the Minister intends to amend that section and I am <Col N="53" /> delighted about that.  He stated advertising for weekly rates will no longer be allowed when the repayments are monthly.</P>
    <P>The institutions which give credit have much to answer for.  Many people get caught in traps for which they are not responsible.  A person's circumstances can change overnight.  I will take myself as an example; I was not caught in a trap but I could have been.  In 1983 I lost a Seanad election.  Two months later I had a heart attack, I went to hospital and was off work for two years. If I had huge commitments, such as hire purchase payments on a car, I could not have met them on the money coming into my house at that time.  I could not claim anything through having been a Senator, because what covers people while they are Members does not cover them when they lose their seats.  I could not apply for unemployment assistance because I was unable to work, so all that was left to me was disabled person's maintenance allowance.  I lived on that for two years.</P>
    <P>This was not my doing.  What would happen to a person finding himself in that position, who has to pay up to £300 per month for a car but only receives £80 per week?  It is difficult.  Where something like this happens to a person which is beyond his control, such as sickness or losing a job, and which reduces his income to a level where he cannot meet his commitments, a provision of this Bill should protect them.  I have read most of the Bill, but I am not sure if this is mentioned.  In order to protect people, the Bill must include a provision that a loan can be recast to suit people's new circumstances.  For example, if a person's income of £1,200 a month is suddenly reduced to £400 and they must make a repayment of £200 on a car and £150 mortgage on a house, there should be some mechanism whereby that person or family can recast the loan to meet these new circumstances. If they have an agreement with a hire purchase company to repay the car loan over three years, they <Col N="54" /> should be able to change that to five years.</P>
    <P>Hire purchase companies do not care about people's circumstances; they will take the car if the repayments are not being met.  People may then get a telephone call to say that a car is available at a good price.  The Minister should include a provision in the Bill which states that hire purchase companies cannot confiscate a car and sell it for the amount they are owed.  It should be sold for its proper value.  I have seen cars which were bought from hire purchase companies and the purchaser got a bargain because it was bought for £5,000 or £6,000, although it was worth £9,000 or £10,000.  The Minister must ensure that lenders do not sell goods for the amount they are owed.</P>
    <P>Banks have the same attitude, because when they call in their loans or sell a person's property, they are only interested in getting back the amount of money owed to them.  They do not care about people once they get their slice of the cake.  The Minister should ensure that the true value of confiscated goods or a house taken by a building society is obtained.</P>
    <P>If a person wishes to buy a car, they sign their name, the money is paid and they get their car.  The hire purchase company does not care where the person goes or what he does with the car, provided he makes his monthly repayments. An onus should be placed on hire purchase companies to ensure that motor vehicles are insured in the same way as there is an onus on me or on anyone who has a mortgage on their home to keep it insured.  People who take out a mortgage on their homes are bound by law to take out a proper insurance policy on the property.  However, hire purchase companies do not care that motor vehicles should have insurance.  It should be in their interest to ensure that they do.  If a person in the fishing business goes to BIM for a grant for a fishing boat, the boat is not allowed to leave the harbour unless it is covered by insurance.  Hire purchase companies should be obliged by law to ensure that <Col N="55" /> people who borrow money to buy cars have an insurance policy.  This would ensure that all cars are covered by insurance.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why there is a demand for guarantors.  If you, Sir, asked me to be a guarantor for a substantial sum of money from a bank &mdash; I would love to do it because I know you have plenty of money&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I was elected to the county council in 1974 and I was guarantor for every second person in Dingle who wanted a loan for a new fishing boat.  I was guarantor for approximately 14 fishing boats which in today's money is approximately £14 million or £15 million.  I also signed my name as guarantor for half the houses in Dingle.</P>

      <P>This is a good Bill, which includes protection for people. We will discuss it in more detail on Committee Stage.  This is one of the first Bills which includes examples of mathematics which I could not understand. I thought I was back at school learning algebra when I saw the calculations such as &ldquo;K is the number of the loan&rdquo; and &ldquo;K1 is the number of the repayment&rdquo;.  I wish that was the case.  I never saw a Bill before which included such examples.  I will show it to my children to see if they understand it.</P>
      <P>I support this Bill and I hope it has a speedy passage through the House. Many Members want to make contributions. The Minister will probably return to the Seanad on more than one occasion with the Bill because of the amount of interest in it.</P>
      <P>I welcome the exclusion of credit unions from aspects of the legislation. They do a great deal of good and have become increasingly popular in the past couple of years.  Now many of those in the poorer parts of cities go to the credit union instead of the moneylender. There is an incentive with the credit unions to save a little and then to borrow. Credit unions are usually run by volunteers, as is the case in my town.  I am delighted the Minister has exempted them from some the provision of the Bill.</P>
      <P>However, I have no pity for the other institutions.  Every one of them is making a fortune, whether they be building societies or higher purchase companies. I never see any of them go broke.  They make their profits from the ordinary members of the public.</P>

The new age limit will apply in cases where an application for maintainance of a child is made under the provisions of Part III of the Bill and will apply also in cases where an application is made for maintenance under the Family Law (Maintenance of Children and Spouses) Act, 1976.  The Bill, of course, already provides that where a child is in fulltime education the upper age limit is under 23 years and there is no upper age limit where the child has a mental or physical disability such that it is not possible for the child to maintain himself or herself fully.</P>

      <P>I will deal with amendment No. 19 first.  This amendment is in substitution for section 11 regarding pension adjustment orders.  I indicated on Second Stage that I was concerned to ensure the pension provisions in the Bill would be comprehensive and the arrangements for their implementation would be as practicable as possible.</P>
      <P>In the course of framing the provisions contained in amendment No. 19 I have taken into account the consultations between my Department, the Pensions Board, the Irish Association of Pension Funds and other pension experts.  Those consultations have been ongoing for a considerable time since I initiated an examination in my Department of pensions in the context of marriage breakdown.  I have never doubted that the area is complex and the provisions in the Bill reflect that complexity.</P>
      <P>I have remained firmly of the view that pensions must be regarded as an asset just like any other asset whether it is real property, that is to say the family home, a farm or business property, or personal property, that is to say, money in a bank account, shares in a company or the contents of a home.  I am pleased to be able to inform the House that the consultations have resulted in a maximum degree of consensus on the best way to frame the legislative provisions on pensions so as to meet the support that may be necessary for dependent spouses and children in that area.  I thank the Pensions Board, the IAPF and all others concerned for their most helpful and valuable assistance in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general, the amended provisions are the same as in the original section. They provide for the earmarking and splitting of pensions.  However, the amended section provides additionally for new definitions and for situations where a member of a pension scheme ceases to be a member of the scheme before normal retirement age, and for situations where the dependent spouse dies before benefits come into payment. It also provides that the pension can be <Col N="59" /> split at the discretion of the spouse in whose favour the order is made.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the amendment are quite detailed and I propose to outline briefly for Senators their purpose and effect.  Section 11 (1) contains the relevant definitions.  Subsection (2) allows the court, following the grant of a decree of judicial separation and on application to it by either of the spouses concerned, to make a pension adjustment order designating a portion of the retirement benefit of a spouse who is a member of a pension scheme, that is the member spouse, for payment to a dependent spouse and children.  Such an order would have the effect of preserving for a dependent spouse an interest in the member spouse's pension benefit and the proportion of the pension benefit which would be paid to the dependent spouse and children would be determined by the court.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) has a similar effect to subsection (2) so far as a contingent benefit under a scheme is concerned.  A contingent benefit is a benefit payable under a pension scheme to a member spouse's dependants where the member dies before retirement.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) provides that, where the court makes a pension adjustment order, the spouse in whose favour the order is made may be entitled to the payment of the proportion of the benefit specified in the order to another scheme or arrangment so as to create an entitlement to an independent separate benefit, that is, the splitting of the pension benefit.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) provides for the mechanism whereby the pension benefit can be split on application by the person in whose favour the pension adjustment order is made.  Subsection (6) provides in so far as specific schemes are concerned that the trustees may at their own discretion transfer the proportion of the benefit payable to the dependent spouse to another scheme so as to create an entitlement to an independent and separate benefit for the dependent spouse.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="60" /> Subsections (7), (8), (9) and (10) provide for special circumstances where a member spouse leaves a scheme or where a dependent spouse dies before pension benefits come into payment. Specifically, they provide that where the member spouse dies or leaves the scheme before the payment of any benefit has commenced, the trustees must, within three months of the death of that spouse, transfer the proportion of the benefit payable to the dependent spouse to another scheme so as to create an entitlement to an independent and separate benefit for the dependent spouse.</P>
    <P>Where the member spouse ceases to be an active member of the scheme the trustees must inform the dependent spouse and the court concerned that the member spouse has ceased active membership. Where the spouse dies before the payment of any benefit has commenced the trustees must pay to the personal representative of that spouse the proportion of the benefit ordered by the court to be paid to the dependent spouse.</P>
    <P>The remaining subsections provide for notifications to the various parties to proceedings and for technical arrangements relating to the making of guidelines under the Pensions Act, 1990, for the calculation of the value of pension benefits.  The guidelines for the calculation of the value of pension benefits are to be drawn up by the Pensions Board and I am happy to be able to inform the House that the Pensions Board is commissioning pension consultants to undertake the work.</P>
    <P>In relation to notifications, I would point out that notice of any application in relation to a pension adjustment order must be given to the trustees of the pension scheme and the court, in making a pension adjustment order, must have regard to any representations made by the trustees.  The section also provides that the court, in making a pension adjustment order, will give pension trustees such directions as the court considers appropriate in relation to the <Col N="61" /> order.  I trust Senators will support these amendments.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether I will support these amendments. I do not understand the content. If the Minister wanted to ensure there was a balanced and informed contribution to the debate on this Bill, which by his own admission is important legislation, it would have been more helpful had we not received 18 pages of amendments yesterday, the bulk of which relate to pension matters.</P>
      <P>I hope to come back to these elements of the Bill when speaking to the section.  I do not have the benefit of legal expertise or back-up facilities and I do not fully understand the Minister's proposals in these lengthy amendments. The situation with the Bill as it stands, before any of these amendments are agreed to, is that a court may rule on the issue of pensions, which it could not before, and that is a welcome change. To date, pensions were not considered an asset when people separated.  The family home, etc., would be dealt with by means of a judicial separation, by agreement or whatever.  Pensions have not been part of that to date.  Even though they could be considered to be a valuable commodity, they have not been the subject of division of property. This legislation, as I understand it, gives the courts the right to decide on the division or apportionment of a pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the situation of either mediation or an agreed separation, am I right in saying that pensions cannot be dealt with as an asset to be apportioned, assigned or otherwise to one or other of the spouses, without going through the courts?  I will deal with the annulment issue later.  Is what is contained in this legislation in effect a lawyer's charter? There are couples who negotiate separations amicably and well through the mediation service, which the Minister has put additional funding into and has referred to in previous debates in this House.  He has admitted that if a couple are deciding to separate, this is a worthwhile way of doing so.  If I go to the <Col N="62" /> mediation service with my spouse and we agree on the division of property and whatever other assets we happen to have, what is the position with my pension or my husband's pension?  As I read it, even without the amendments the Minister is proposing today, the situation is that I cannot, without going to a court, have any portion of that pension assigned to me and my husband cannot have any portion of my pension assigned to him.</P>
    <P>I also understand that, in law, the trustees of a pension scheme cannot and are not empowered to agree such a division or allocation of a person's pension. Before this, it could not be done because a law was needed to enable the trustees of a pension scheme to deal with a pension, to divide it or whatever. This piece of legislation does that, but in circumstances where we do not want to go the road of divorce &mdash; the Minister has said that this is the blueprint for the divorce legislation which will follow &mdash; or judicial separation, then what is contained in this legislation is worthless to me in terms of my husband's pension or my pension.  If I am incorrect or I have missed amendments which are contained in the legislation which get around this, I would be delighted to hear so from the Minister.</P>
    <P>As I see it, we now have another important piece of family law which appears to be lacking unless couples go into courts and battle it through.  Maybe the Minister can confirm to me that I am wrong.  I would like come back to this issue when we are debating this section, having given this a little more time.  The Minister should accept that there is no way that this entire piece of legislation can be dealt with on Committee Stage between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. today.  I would like the opportunity to deal with the Committee Stage another day.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to get to the bottom of it, even for somebody who had a legal background and expertise in the subject. I will do the best I can with it within the timescale that we have.  It is true that this legislation will, for the first time, bring the question of division of pensions into play.  It is important that this be done.  It is a major step forward, but I am not suggesting that it is a panacea either.  There are certain limitations involved in it.</P>
      <P>Basically, a pension arrangement is a contractual arrangement entered into by the trustees of a pension fund on behalf of the beneficiaries of the scheme.  The terms and details of that are set out in an extensive trust document, which sets out the terms that apply, what the powers of the trustees are, what they may do and what discretion they may have in certain circumstances. The point to remember at all times is that the terms and conditions for a pension scheme vary from case to case.  All pension schemes are not the same.  It would be hard to find two that are the same.  The level of discretion granted to trustees varies from case to case, as do the rights of the members and their dependants.</P>
      <P>If one were to approach it on an out of court basis, the separating spouses or their representatives would have to look at the particular pension scheme and see what they were in a position to implement by agreement, having regard to the terms and conditions set out in the pension document.  That would be quite an undertaking.  It could be possible that the trustees would have the relevant powers and discretion and would be prepared to exercise their discretion in a way that the parties wanted; but one could not be certain of that.  They may not be prepared to commit themselves at any particular point in time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="64" /> The legislation intrudes, to a limited extent, on pension schemes when matters come before the court.  One could not bring in a generalised intrusion into what is, at the end of the day, a contractual arrangement between the trustees and the beneficiaries.  When the matter goes into court, the question of pensions can be dealt with under the terms of this Bill and provision is made for dealing with it in two ways &mdash; earmarking and splitting of pensions.  What I am proposing in this amendment is a variation on what was in the Bill before, giving the initial attention of the court to dealing with the particular pension scheme by way of earmarking and leaving rights in certain circumstances to the benefiting spouse under such an order to apply for a split based on the percentage earmarked for that spouse.  In some circumstances the trustees may likewise do that on their own motion.  That is a court situation.</P>
    <P>The question raised by Senator McGennis is the question of what arrangements may be appropriate or can be achieved down that same road but outside of court orders and court proceedings.  There is no easy answer to that.  It would depend on the particular pension scheme concerned.  The spouses, if they are minded to achieve a divide of pension benefits, would need to have their advisers look closely at what is possible within the terms of the particular pension scheme to which they subscribe.  If they can and want to achieve it, can agree on it and it is possible within the terms of the scheme, they may do that.  If a position arises where they can and want to achieve a split arrangement which is not possible within the terms of the scheme, they may in some cases have to achieve that by court order.  It will be possible to do that and that is a major step forward. Until now that would not have been possible.  It will be possible now and that could be of importance in many cases. I am sure that is not a comprehensive explanation but I hope it goes some way towards clarifying the position.</P>

      <P>I appreciate what the Minister is saying and I recognise that this is the first time we have got to the point where pensions can be considered. While we are at it and given the huge number of amendments proposed on the pension issue, is it not possible &mdash; I do not have the expertise but I will try to find it somewhere by Report Stage - to cobble something together which allows an out of court division of the pension?  The Minister and Members have said on a number of occasions that we must make proceedings in family courts as amicable as possible.  If a couple agree an amicable separation and do not want to go to court, is it possible to make provision for them in an amendment to the legislation?</P>
      <P>With due respect to the Minister, it does not matter what kind of pension scheme I have.  Pension schemes are as varied and numerous as the social welfare legislation.  The basic ground rule is that, regardless of the type of pension I have, the trustees may not dispose of my interest in my pension without going through the process described in section 11 of the Bill.  If that is the case, we are effectively saying that all the mediation services and separations which are worked out mean nothing unless one ignores one's spouse's pension or goes to court afterwards.  There is still a requirement to go to court.</P>
      <P>Is there not some mechanism or procedure whereby, if I agree in mediation that part of my pension will go elsewhere or <i>vice versa</i>, this could be registered in court?  I do not have the necessary legal expertise to know how this can be done.  I do not want the Family Law Bill to be seen just as a divorce Bill as it includes many other things and ensures access to one's rights and entitlements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said on Second Stage, this is good legislation but there are parts of it which could be improved, and this is one of them.  Let us not force everyone into the courts.  There were learned barristers and solicitors in this Chamber last week telling us they did work for <Col N="66" /> nothing and represented people who were in dire straits.  The majority of them do not do this and we are just setting up queues.  Everyone at some stage has some kind of a pension and therefore this is relevant to anybody who negotiates or decides to separate.  Somebody mentioned that there are 70,000 couples waiting for this legislation.  They will have to traipse into court to get their pension entitlements.  I ask the Minister, with his expertise and that of his Department which I do not have, if he can suggest something on Report Stage which would get over this?</P>

      <P>Like Senator McGennis I think the pension issue is extremely complex and the Minister has accepted that.  It is extremely difficult for us to absorb a seven page amendment when we see it for the first time the day before Committee Stage.  I found the situation complex before I saw this amendment; I found it very difficult to understand all of it last night and I hoped for enlightenment from the Minister today.</P>
      <P>The Minister's reply to Senator McGennis explained some of the issues I did not understand.  Is he saying that the only way we can intrude on pension schemes is when the matter comes before the court and that, as Senator McGennis said, they cannot be changed if there is a deed of separation or some other agreement outside court procedures? There is no way the trustees of the pension scheme can interfere with the the scheme unless the provisions are there.  I am not sure about that and I would be concerned.</P>
      <P>I accept what the Minister is doing in this Bill and this amendment tries to improve the situation.  As I said, last night I found it very difficult to go through the entire seven pages of the amendment and compare it with the Bill as passed by the other House to ascertain the difference.  I hoped for an explanation by the Minister today and I ask him to clarify that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I will outline the variation this amendment makes in simple terms. <Col N="67" /> There are two ways in which one can divide up a pension &mdash; earmarking and splitting.  It is complex enough to get to the bottom of that alone but take it from me that those are the two methods.  The Bill as passed by the other House provides that the court may either earmark or split.  This amendment provides a little differently.</P>
      <P>The amendment provides that the court, in the first instance, earmarks.  If it is going to deal with the pension at all, it does it by earmarking; that is phase one.  Having earmarked, a new situation comes into play.  It is now open to, for instance, the wife to ask for a split based on the earmarking the court did.  The court will not split initially, it will only earmark so it would be open to the wife &mdash; it could be either spouse &mdash; to apply for a split based on the earmark the court decreed.  In other circumstances, if the wife has not done that, it is also open to the trustees of the pension scheme to split based on the earmark if, for the various reasons set out in the amendment, they are minded to do that.</P>
      <P>This arises from the extensive consultations the Department had with the pensions boards and the association to which I referred.  They primarily are the people who would be operating these difficult procedures and it would not work unless they were satisfied with the arrangements we are putting in place. They are at the cutting edge and operate these pension schemes.  We, in the Department &mdash; I pay tribute to my officials on that &mdash; spent many long hours working with the pensions people who operate all these schemes to ascertain how it would work and operate in the most effective manner possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McGennis and Senator Honan made similar points.  In my view it would not be possible to deal with this in legislation in as broad and sweeping a manner as is posited.  If one was talking about a contractual arrangement between the two spouses, and they were the only two people involved, they could agree anything they wanted in negotiation or mediation and it could be <Col N="68" /> put into effect.  Nobody else would involved so there would be no problem. In this instance we are not dealing with an arrangement which pertains to just two spouses.  There are other people involved, mainly the trustees of the pension scheme and other holders who are beneficiaries under that pension scheme.  They are key parties to the pension contract.</P>
    <P>As this is a contract the spouses alone cannot alter the pension scheme by simple agreement between themselves.  The only circumstance in which they could do that would be if, in my opinion, the terms of the pension contract included sufficiently wide a purpose that would allow it.  The actual pension contract would have to provide that an earmark or a split was possible on notification and would be recognised by the pension trustees and have downstream effects.  If this was included in the contract, anything that complied with the contract could be done by mutual agreement.  I am not an expert in the pensions area but I think few pension schemes would be drawn that widely.</P>
    <P>While one is not actually altering a pension contract, one is certainly affecting it in a new and special way.  In most cases that would require a court order; that is unavoidable.  It arises from the fact that some parties to a contract cannot alter it without the involvement of all parties to the contract.  The trustees are key parties to the pension contractual arrangement and that is why the intervention of the court is and would be required in most cases.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 9, line 5, after &ldquo;decree of&rdquo;. to insert &ldquo;nullity or decree of&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I presume this Bill must go back to the Dáil because amendments have been made to it in this House.  The Bill was changed dramatically on Report Stage in the Dáil when all references to nullity were deleted.  Substantial amendments in relation to pensions have been made to the Bill in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Second Stage I said I was concerned the Minister had deleted all references throughout the Bill to nullity because I believe the situation for separated people, regardless of how their marriages have broken down.  Will amount to the same thing.  In a number of cases it will amount to children, and probably one spouse, needing to be supported and to the assets of the family home having to be divided.  The Bill as initiated catered for people who had obtained judicial separations or had their marriages annulled.  The provisions and protections of the Bill are no longer <Col N="71" /> extended to couples whose marriages have been annulled.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage I said it is important that before a divorce referendum is held, everything should be cleared up and out of the way.  Concerns about financial entitlements created the most concerns in the minds of peoples who decided not to vote for divorce in 1986. People were concerned they had not been financially provided for in law and that if the referendum proposal were carried, they would find themselves in a limbo situation.  I think the Minister would agree this would have been the effect if the referendum was carried in 1986.  The legislation which was needed to be put in place beforehand was not in place.</P>
    <P>This Minister, in the main, has put most of the necessary legislation in position before bringing forward the wording of the referendum amendment and a divorce Bill.  There are still issues which need to be tackled, an important one of which is nullity.  If we are to say that those who have ended legally binding marriages by way of judicial separation or divorce will be catered for, we will do a disservice to those who, for many reasons, have obtained Church or State annulments.</P>
    <P>My amendments are grouped together because they propose the same change throughout the Bill.  I am asking that nullity be included in any references to judicial separation.  If there were references to nullity in the Bill when it was initiated, why were they deleted on Report Stage in the Dáil?  I ask the Minister to accept these amendments. I do not know if there is any reason this cannot be done.  If there is a good reason why nullity had to be dropped, if it created another constitutional problem, we should say that and address that problem as well.</P>
    <P>If people's marriages are annulled and declared to be void they have no entitlements in law, because if the marriages never existed we cannot provide for the division of property and so on. We must be honest and up front with <Col N="72" /> people and say that there will be major problems in this area and that in order not to slow down the passage of the Bill and its laudable and welcome measures, we will have to address the issue of nullity separately.  This needs to be said today and I ask the Minister to say exactly what confusion and problems the inclusion of nullity causes.  My amendments propose the restoration of the references to nullity which were included in the Bill as initiated.  If the amendments cannot be accepted, how does the Government intend dealing with the serious situation of people whose marriages have been declared null and void?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The purported effect of these amendments is to restore within the scope of the Bill provisions for the making of ancillary orders by the courts in nullity proceedings which were deleted on my initiative in the other House.  The amendments purport only to have that effect.  This is because in a technical sense they do not do so comprehensively. However, since I am opposing the amendments in principle, I do not propose to dwell on the technicalities. I proposed instead to deal with the main substance of the amendments.</P>
      <P>It was represented to me in the other House and by some interested groups that while the provisions giving power in cases of nullity to make financial and property orders, including orders to enable provisions to be made out of the estate of the parties to an annulment, were welcome and overdue, there was the possibility that those powers could be open to challenge on the basis of constitutionality.  I had, in regard to those powers, moved a number of amendments to the Bill to strengthen the provisions further.  Those amendments had been framed in a way that would require the courts to take into account the interests of all parties concerned, including the rights of parties to a marriage that is contracted after the annulment of the marriage of either of those parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="73" /> However, questions remained, in particular, about the validity of rights given to parties to an annulled marriage in cases where the marriage is void and, in effect, there never was a marriage in the eyes of the law.  Those concerns were expressed in relation to the rights of the spouses in question and they were raised, even though the provisions were based largely on those contained in a paper on nullity prepared by the Attorney General in 1976, which took account of the laws in other jurisdictions. The provisions were also contained in the 1992 White Paper on Marital Breakdown.</P>
    <P>I concluded it would be better to provide for the matter in one form or another, perhaps in a modified form, in separate legislation.  Unfortunately, it has meant that while the Bill retains substantial provisions for support of spouses in the context of a judicial separation and in the case of foreign divorces, it does not now extend those powers to nullity.  The aim was to have all those provisions consolidated in one Bill and in time this may be possible.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the background which I have outlined, I am unable to agree that the nullity provisions should be restored to the Bill.  I am, therefore, opposing these amendments.  I ask Senators to agree that the better course at this stage is to progress this important Bill as it stands and not to put in jeopardy its implementation in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand what the Minister is saying.  However, I am probably now more concerned about the Bill than I was at the beginning.  The Bill specifically states that after people have secured judicial separations, they may be entitled to pensions and other rights.  Therefore, those who part amicably, as we discussed on the previous amendments, and who agree their separation by way of mediation do not have the protection of this legislation in certain parts.  Those who have received either church or State annulments are similarly left without the protection <Col N="74" /> which this Bill affords to people who have secured a judicial separation.</P>
      <P>When does the Minister intend bringing forward legislation to deal with nullity? If he cannot specify when, can he at least promise that such legislation will be brought in advance of the referendum on divorce?  It is not helpful at any stage for issues to be left over. There is a lobby which does not want to see a divorce referendum carried, and I would not automatically be put into that category.  It is bad enough that children will be used as ammunition in the next referendum but we, as legislators, should not leave loopholes which can be used &mdash; and rightly so in certain instances &mdash; to point out that the necessary legislation is not in place, that is, the situation in regard to pensions where people separate by mediation and must go to court to get pension rights and those with church or State annulments will have no entitlements under this legislation.</P>
      <P>There is still work outstanding.  Can the Minister tell us when he intends bringing in the separate legislation in regard to nullity to which he referred? If he cannot state that, can he give us a categorical assurance that this legislation will be brought in in advance of the divorce referendum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give any particular date as to when legislation will be brought in.  All I can say categorically is that it will not be brought in before the divorce referendum.  This legislation has been needed for a very long time as we have not had legislation on nullity before.  It was open to many Governments to deal with it but they did not do so.  I hope to do so when resources in the Department permit, but that will not be before the divorce referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nullity is a separate issue.  We are not talking about dissolving a marriage or the spouses in a marriage separating, but about cases where a marriage did not exist.  That has downstream constitutional implications which must be faced up to.  The question of how the property rights of the subsequent marriage <Col N="75" /> of one of the spouses would be impacted on by a property claim of a person who had never been a spouse quite clearly has constitutional implications and dangers.  That is why the only safe course I could adopt was to remove nullity from this Bill to be dealt with separately and, I hope, comprehensively at a later date.</P>
    <P>This Bill deals with a substantial range of material, such as the questions of judicial separations and foreign divorces which are recognised in this country. That is an appreciable volume of material.  The considerations in nullity are different and will require separate attention.  I hope that that will come about sooner rather than later, but it will not be before the divorce referendum.</P>

She reared and educated those six children on her own and worked and provided for them.</P>

    <P>The same State which the Minister is telling me says that a marriage never existed, demanded £8,000 from that woman from her State pension as a nurse in lieu of unpaid contributions for her widows and orphans pension.  As her children were all over 20 years of age, they were too old to get anything from the pension.  She was told by the <Col N="76" /> State that, in the event of her death, the husband of the marriage which never existed, and who had never supported her, would get full payment of the widows and orphans pension which she had paid.  She could not opt out because there was no opt out clause.  As she could not pay the outstanding £8,000 it was going to be deducted from her lump sum.</P>
    <P>I am not trying to make life awkward for the Minister but this is the reality. We cannot deal with pensions unless we go to court, and in a situation of nullity a mother of six children had an extra £8,000 deducted from her lump sum. The State said that a marriage did not exist in the context of divorce but in the case of her State contributory pension it existed to the extent that she had to pay £8,000.  I know the Minister loses the rag with me on occasion but I ask him not to dismiss me when I raise a point because I raise it for a purpose.</P>
    <P>This legislation is flawed as it does not deal with nullity; it deals only with judicial separation cases.  We are saying that those who quietly annul their marriages or go to mediation services will have no protection from this legislation. Those who are wealthy enough to get a foreign divorce or who are prepared to go through the costly &mdash; unless one is entitled to civil legal aid &mdash; judicial separation procedure in the courts will be looked after.  Unless one can spend the money, one will not get a pension or entitlements.</P>
    <P>I do not ask questions or table amendments lightly.  This is important and needs to be dealt with.  The Minister has admitted that it will not be dealt with before the divorce referendum. The people need to know before they vote that what happened to my friend in Skibbereen could happen to them.</P>

      <P>I do not want to get involved in any one particular case without knowing the full facts; I have no knowledge of this case.  Senator McGennis is getting carried away in saying that this Bill is flawed because it does not deal with nullity.  This <Col N="77" /> important Bill is certainly not flawed and deals with very important innovations which give very important new rights.  It does not purport to deal with nullity.</P>
      <P>Nullity is an important issue and I do not decry it or say that it would not be desirable to have a special piece of legislation developed to deal with it in all its aspects.  However, this Bill deals with the question of judicial separation, of which there are many thousands of cases each year, and the question of foreign divorces which are recognised here. It brings in many new and important remedies.</P>
      <P>There is nothing flawed about it, it is a very important and developmental Bill.  Its terms were agreed during the currency of the previous Government, in which Senator McGennis' party and mine were in coalition.  That was the format in which the Bill was developed to deal with those important&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If Senator McGennis looks at the Official Report of the Dáil debates, she will see that very considerable doubt was cast on the question of the constitutionality of dealing with the nullity provisions in the way proposed. We are all bound by the Constitution.  It is important that no constitutional question mark arises out of this Bill; it is much too important for that.  For those reasons, I deemed it prudent, based on the advice I received, to delete the nullity provisions &mdash; which were just one aspect of the Bill, although an important aspect &mdash; and leave that over to be dealt with separately and carefully at a future date as soon as possible.  It is important that we get on with this Bill which is giving new and important remedies which have been long sought, and which will be extremely helpful to people who are in marital breakdown situations as opposed to those whose marriages have been declared never to have existed in the first place.</P>

      <P>and</P>

    <P>(5) Any costs incurred in complying with a property adjustment order shall be borne, as the court may determine, by either of the spouses concerned, or by both of them in such proportions as the court may determine, and shall be so borne in such manner as the court may determine.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>This amendment provides that where a property adjustment order is made by the court and a person who is directed to execute a deed or instrument in relation to land which is the subject of the order refuses or neglects to comply with the directions of the court, where it is considered necessary to do so, the court may order another person to execute the deed or instrument.</P>
      <P>The amendment also makes clear that any costs incurred in complying with a property adjustment order will be borne as the court may determine by either of the spouses concerned or by both of them.

      <P>In my experience there has been much difficulty when the court has ordered a division of property in a separation under the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, and where the spouse in whose name the property is registered refused to co-operate in either signing the deed of transfer or agree to a transfer of the property as determined by the court.  It has posed practical difficulties when <Col N="82" /> that spouse leaves the country or wilfully refuses to co-operate.  I have known a few spouses who have been put at a severe disadvantage in trying to determine their property adjustments and settle the matter after the court decision has been made.  Therefore, this amendment is particularly important on a practical level.  I appreciate its inclusion in this Bill and I thank the Minister and his officials for doing so.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 11, after line 47, to add the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) Spouses may agree to settle matters in relation to property adjustment by Deed of Separation which will constitute a full and final settlement of all such issues between them.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is becoming more common for spouses in a separation situation to want to conclude a full and final settlement with one another which would ensure that no future applications could be made against one another for any form of financial relief.  At present it is not open to parties to conclude such a settlement, particularly in view of section 27 of the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976.  Spouses should be able to conclude such settlements and provision should be made in this Bill to allow separation agreements and court orders to be made full and final, provided that both parties consent to this and the court approves of the agreement and makes it an appropriate order deeming the agreement to be in full and final settlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="83" /> The Minister said that couples could do this when this matter was discussed on Committee and Report Stages in the other House, but the court could come back to this at a future date.  It has to power to do this if one spouse decides to take the other party to court.  I would appreciate it if the Minister could accept this amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Couples who wish to separate and who can agree on issues such as the custody of their children, maintenance support and the distribution of property, can enter into a voluntarily negotiated separation agreement which will arrange their affairs in a formal way without the need to obtain a decree of judicial separation or court-imposed ancillary orders.  In general the provisions of such agreements are legally enforceable in the same way as with other contracts.  They can also be made a rule of court under the provisions of section 8 of the Family Law Maintenance of Spouses and Children Act, 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Honan's proposed amendment would provide that where property adjustment is made as part of a deed of separation, it would be in full and final settlement.  The net effect of this would be that, irrespective of changed circumstances of the parties, it would not be open to either spouse to seek to have the arrangement varied. This could prove very much to the disadvantage of a dependent spouse where, at the time of contracting the deed, there may have been little property to transfer and what was provided for the dependent spouse &mdash; the wife in most cases &mdash; may have been very small. The husband may subsequently come into substantial property or income and the former wife would not be able to seek to have the provisions of the deed varied, insofar as property or income was concerned.  This could result in grave injustice for a dependent spouse. <Col N="84" /> I am opposing the amendment for this reason.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>Both spouses can decide that their agreement will be a full and final settlement which can be accepted by the courts.  Under the present legislation, if something happens subsequent to this event, one spouse can decide to return continuously to court and seek further settlements.  Effectively, there is no end to the actual agreement.  It is open to either spouse to return continuously to court.  I accept that the court has the power to review or vary maintenance agreements, for example. However, I cannot understand why the Minister is unwilling to accept the amendment if both parties involved in a separation agreement are willing to do this and want to settle their affairs, once and for all.  The Law Society, from representations they have made, also believe that it is becoming common among spouses in a separation situation to want to conclude a full and final settlement.  They are being prevented from doing so under this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>All things being equal, I am broadly in favour of the position where two parties who enter into a contract can make a final agreement between themselves if they so desire. However, the bases on which separation agreements are often entered into are not built on a foundation of full and genuine equality.  The dependent spouse will often be in the weak bargaining position, for various reasons, and may be constrained upon to enter into an agreement that is full and final.  That could turn out to be to her disadvantage, and the disadvantage of her children, in many cases &mdash; for example, where when the agreement was entered into the circumstances of the wife might have been good and she might therefore have agreed to accept less than she would otherwise been entitled to.  She would then be constrained to enter into such an agreement.  She could then fall on hard times, whereas the husband could come into good times and acquire <Col N="85" /> property, etc.  In that new situation, which could not have been anticipated and resulted from seriously changed circumstances in both their fortunes, she would therefore be debarred from seeking review or redress as she could at present.</P>
      <P>In this kind of contract agreement there often is no real bargaining position, from an equality standpoint, such as might be found in dealings and contracts between businessmen, which are different to the separation agreements entered into between spouses.  I ask Senators to agree that the only safe thing to do is to leave it open to a spouse whose circumstances have changed to review a situation.  That could be very important for many dependent spouses and children.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It has precisely the same status as a decree of judicial separation. Section 8 (1) of the Bill states &ldquo;On granting a decree of judicial separation or at any time thereafter...&rdquo;.  This is left open, because if the financial circumstances of either spouse change after a period of time, it would be a base to return to and seek a review.  It is right and proper that this is the case.  It would be quite dangerous to close off that <Col N="86" /> possibility.  The courts approach these cases in a very practical way.  If the circumstances had not changed, either from the separation agreement or the date of the judicial separation, anyone returning to seek a review would receive short shrift from the court.  They would be told that the circumstances were unchanged.  However, if they returned when there had been a major change in circumstances, up or down as the case may be, the court would have to review the agreement in light of the new situation.</P>

      <P>I was asked by the Family Law and Civil Legal Aid Committee of the Law Society to seek clarification about a case where a spouse entered into a deed of separation prior to the enactment of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989.  Is the spouse entitled to institute proceedings under the Act and claim the various reliefs provided?  The committee believe it is also unclear whether a spouse who entered into the deed of separation after the enactment of the 1989 Act can institute proceedings under that Act.  They also believe the same uncertainty would apply to this Bill, as it is unclear whether it would be open to a spouse who has entered a deed of separation either before or after the passing of this Bill to institute proceedings under this Bill.  They feel that if this is the case, it should be amended to clear up the uncertainty under the 1989 Act and the uncertainty that would occur if the Bill becomes law in its present form.  Perhaps the Minister could clarify the situation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 27:</P>
      <P>In page 19, subsection (2) (f), line 5, after &ldquo;family&rdquo;, to insert:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the work of the spouse within the home should, unless there are compelling reasons to the contrary, give rise to a joint interest in the family home&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is an attempt to recognise the work of the spouse within the home.  We are discussing the Bill and this amendment in the light of the declared unconstitutionality of the Matrimonial Homes Bill.  That Bill, which dealt with joint ownership of the family home, had the support of all parties in both Houses.  I know the Minister greatly supported the principle which this Bill tried to enshrine.  We were all disappointed that, in the light of the fact that the Supreme Court found the Bill to be unconstitutional, the Government is not pursuing alternative methods to enshrine the principle which we all supported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="104" /> Even though this Bill applies equally to men and women it will be of particular benefit to women.  Likewise when we discussed the Matrimonial Homes Bill we believed that it would be of particular benefit to women in the home.  The Matrimonial Homes Bill was trying to address that category of women who do not work outside the home.</P>
    <P>In cases before the courts, particularly L <i>v.</i> L, the court decided that because a woman did not contribute financially to the purchase of the home or the repayment of the mortgage she did not have a joint entitlement to the family home.  We are all concerned to address that position and these amendments try to do that.  The financial dependency of women is a huge issue that needs to be addressed.  Many women now feel that they must work outside the home in order to maintain this financial independence.</P>
    <P>The Commission on the Status of Women recommended that joint ownership of the family home should be enshrined in our laws and they went further in looking for community of property.  Obviously, we fell at the first hurdle.  The Supreme Court threw out the Bill on the basis &mdash; which none of us expected &mdash; that it interfered too much in the family.  Many of us expected they would find it unconstitutional because it interfered with property rights, but that was not the case.</P>
    <P>In trying to address the issue when dealing with the family, we are trying to create a balance.  Because of her work within the home a woman should have an entitlement to joint ownership of the family home.  Her work should be recognised.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Cork Examiner</i> today published a survey carried out by Irish Marketing Surveys on behalf of Ark Life, AIB's life assurance company.  The survey put a value of £486 a week on the work done by women in the home.  The survey also found that four in every five married women described their working status as full-time housewives.  At a rate of £486 a week, women would not be long in making a big contribution <Col N="105" /> towards ownership of the family home, and a very good one too.  We all accept the principle of the wife having an entitlement to a share in the family home, but up to now we have failed in our responsibilities to enshrine this into law.</P>
    <P>I will be interested to hear the Minister's reply and the plans he has to address the situation if he does not accept the situation if he does not accept what I am trying to do here.  Has he any plans to introduce the principles of the 1994 Matrimonial Homes Bill into law?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Honan's amendment tries to enable a spouse to obtain ownership of the family home where there is not a separation and there is an ongoing relationship between the two people.  A separation is catered for in the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, which is being updated by this Bill.</P>
      <P>The amendment deals with spouses who are not separating and dictates that the matter can only be settled by the court.  I would be concerned about bringing the court into the whole area of the marriage relationship and the effect it might have on the relationship. Obviously, it is designed to cater for a situation where there is some difference between the partners about the ownership of the home and only the courts can settle it.  We all know what effect bringing the courts into any relationship, even outside of marriage, can have on two people.  Litigation has ensured for generations that families were not on speaking terms.  We all know of these situations.  There are few families who have not been exposed to situations, where litigation has soured what previously could have been a reasonable and often close relationship.  Once the courts get involved, that relationship is invariably and finally terminated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the question of the uncertainty of calculating the non-financial contribution.  Senator Honan made one calculation today.  What kind of argument would ensue, if either a husband or a wife &mdash; it is not always the <Col N="106" /> wife who is in this situation, although invariably it is &mdash; puts the value of £480 per week on their contribution to the family home &mdash; in other words about £25,000 per year?  What kind of difficulties and arguments would that raise if the courts were to put such a figure on it?</P>
    <P>Finally, if the court calculated that the value of the non-financial contribution of the spouse to the family home was less than 50 per cent &mdash; for example, 40, 30 or 20 per cent &mdash; will they come back to court in five years for 25 per cent and again in ten years time for more?  Will there be continuous litigation?  Will the court have to decide over a period that there is an improved or changed non-financial contribution to the ownership of the family home?</P>
    <P>Involving the courts where there is not a separation and where the relationship has not broken down, could initiate the commencement of a breakdown in that relationship, and I would be concerned about that.</P>

      <P>I fully support the objective of Senator Honan's amendments. Senator Neville probably does too because I do not think he spoke with as much conviction as I have hear him on other amendments.  I do not think there is any disagreement between the political parties about the worth of what the Matrimonial Home Bill, 1994 tried to enshrine in law, that is, the right of the wife, normally, to a share in the family home &mdash; but it was declared unconstitutional.  The Minister does not need to be told that women should, of right in law, be granted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I agree.  All parties in the House at the time totally agreed with the Minister's efforts and he will probably continue to try to achieve that objective.  It appears that the more we try to improve the situation &mdash; and this is probably a criticism of myself and the 1937 Constitution &mdash; the more it has emerged, particularly in the women's rights committee, that there are areas of the Constitution which prohibit improvements in legislation: the Minister is currently dealing with one area relating to extending barring orders; the bail issue; the joint interest in the family home and the Minister's own Bill.  The nullity issue today poses another huge problem in relation to the Constitution. The Government needs to address the areas of the Constitution which have outlived their usefulness or which need to be amended.</P>
      <P>In relation to the amendment and the proposed referendum on divorce, maybe this is an opportunity, particularly in relation to the barring order issue, the family home and nullity provisions, to carry out a thorough review of the Constitution to see how we might amend it.</P>

      <P>A review of the Constitution is under way as Senator McGennis knows and, hopefully, these matters will be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 54 proposes to enable a spouse, who has made a non-financial contribution to the household, to go to court with a view to establishing an ownership interest in the matrimonial property in proportion to that contribution up to maximum of 50 per cent.  I appreciate that the Senator is seeking to give some legislative recognition <Col N="108" /> to the contribution to the family made by a spouse working in the home and caring for the family.  We are all conscious of the value of that contribution. It has already been given such recognition in Part II of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, which is being repealed and updated by this Bill, and section 15(2)(f) in particular refers.</P>
    <P>These provisions deal with situations where proceedings for judicial separation have begun and where the matrimonial property may have to be divided between the couple concerned.  In those cases, it is essential that the decision of the court should take fully into account any non-financial, as well as financial, contributions made by each of the spouses, and particularly the contribution made by a spouse in looking after the home.  That is specifically provided for.</P>
    <P>The amendment deals with spouses who are not separating or proposing to separate.  It provides that if one of those spouses wishes to assert an ownership right on the matrimonial property based on non-financial contributions and the other spouse disagrees, the dispute can be settled, and can only be settled, by the court.  Of course, if both spouses agree there is no problem.  If they disagree, the only way the dispute could be settled &mdash; and this is supposed to be in a non-contentious marriage situation &mdash; would be by the court.  Such litigation would involve substantial expense and, irrespective of the outcome as Senator Neville rightly pointed out, it would adversely affect the marriage relationship.</P>
    <P>It is true that under the present law financial contributions by a spouse towards the acquisition of the matrimonial property can give rise to proportionate ownership interests which can be determined by courts in default of agreement but there is a world of difference between establishing the extent of financial contributions, which are easily ascertainable and difficult to dispute. and that non-financial contributions made by either spouse from the date of <Col N="109" /> the marriage up to the commencement of the litigation.  This uncertainty would increase the likelihood of disputes and consequent recourse to the courts and it would also increase the costs of the litigation, which would normally have to be borne by the defendant spouse irrespective of the outcome.  It might also be open to a spouse who had successfully established a share in matrimonial property of less than 50 per cent to return to the courts more than once to get extra credit for work carried out in the home in the meantime and eventually build up his or her share to the 50 per cent limit. In contrast, the determination of non-financial contributions on the occasion of a separation is a once-off evaluation of those contributions made during the period when the couple were living together.  Moreover, I do not accept the suggestion that such a provision would help spouses get their partners formally to convey to them a share in the family home or other matrimonial property on the basis that otherwise proceedings would be taken against them.  I believe such an implied threat of litigation could have the opposite effect.</P>
    <P>In my opinion what is wanted most by spouses working in the home who do not wish to engage in litigation with their partners is a practical recognition of their contribution.  The real deterrent is the formality and costs associated with putting the family home into joint names.  I am giving consideration to whether legislation would facilitate more simplified and less costly arrangements. Such provision might enable couples who live in harmony to give full and effective recognition to the contribution made by the spouse who works in the home.  By encouraging litigation between spouses we could do more harm than good.</P>
    <P>The Senator's related amendment, No. 27, to section 16 (2) (f), proposes that there should be a rebuttable presumption that the spouse's work in the home should give rise to a joint interest in the home unless there are compelling reasons to the contrary.  I understand the Senator's motivation in putting <Col N="110" /> down this amendment but here we are dealing with the matters to which the court must pay particular regard when making an order under various sections of the Bill.  These could include maintenance orders or pension adjustments orders, with the grant of a property adjustment order giving a spouse an interest or an enlarged interest in the family home, and might not be the best or most appropriate option for the parties. In those circumstances obliging the court to give an ownership interest in the home to one of the spouses might be contrary to that spouse's best interests.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the presumption is expressed to be subject to there being compelling reasons for not granting a joint interest in the home but it seems to me it would be much better to leave the fullest discretion to the court to do justice in the circumstances of each case, once it has had particular regard, as the section requires, to any past or future contributions made by each of the spouses to the welfare of the family.  I much regret, therefore, that for these reasons I am not in a position to accept the Senator's amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government side has said we are dealing with separation agreements and there is provision for division of the property in that light. Here, however, we are talking about cases where there is no marital breakdown and there is a stable relationship. The Minister said trying to do this might have a detrimental effect on the relationship.  Many women do not have any rights in relation to the family home, which has a damaging effect on their relationship, yet they are expected to put up with that.</P>
      <P>Does the Government intend amending or reintroducing the Matrimonial Home Bill to make it constitutional?  I moved these amendments because that Bill was found to be unconstitutional and the Supreme Court said it was up to us as legislators to introduce legislation to address the problems they found with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="111" /> These amendments were also tabled by my colleague, Deputy Keogh, in the other House.  I subsequently received representations from the Dublin Solicitors' Bar Association, which was concerned that this Bill does not give the court power to award an interest in property by reason of that spouse's work in the home.  Case law under the Married Women's Status Act, 1957, section 12, shows the court will declare an interest in favour of the spouse who has contributed in money or money's worth to the acquisition of the property, but the courts have not gone as far as to declare work in the home sufficient to entitle a spouse to an interest in the property.  That is worrying for women who work full time in the home and they can take no reassurance from what we are doing today or from the refusal to accept these amendments.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the difficulty in accepting amendment No. 27, which provides for a rebuttable presumption that the work of the spouse would, save where there are compelling reasons, give a joint interest in the family home. If I could be assured by the Minister that he would introduce an amended Matrimonial Home Bill, taking account of the concerns of the Supreme Court yet enshrining the principle we supported, I would be happy; but he has not made any such promise.  Has the Government given up on that issue, or is it willing to bring forward amended legislation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not need any persuasion as to the value of women's work in the home.  I remind the House that it was the previous Government and I which brought forward the Matrimonial Home Bill.  Senator Honan's party, the Progressive Democrats, was in Government before that and could have introduced that Bill, which was in preparation at that time.  I did not start it from scratch.  The Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat Government did not introduce it, nor did it bring forward any measure on that topic.  I was determined <Col N="112" /> to introduce it and was hopeful it would have been found in order; I had advice to that effect and we believed it was constitutional.  It is to my deep regret that the court found otherwise.  My bringing it forward is an indication of the bona fides of that Government and I on this issue.</P>
      <P>Like her colleague in the other House, Deputy Keogh, Senator Honan laid stress on what efforts were being made to fix the Matrimonial Home Bill, as they put it.  That Bill cannot be fixed to make it constitutional.  If there is to be legislation in this area it would have to be different in kind to the Matrimonial Home Bill and by implication it could not be as far reaching.  This is a difficult area, since the Matrimonial Home Bill finished as it did, and it is not easy of resolution.</P>
      <P>There are now two categories of cases.  Under this Bill, if the marriage breaks down all the property of the marriage is available for division.  That includes not only a half-share of the matrimonial home, as would have been provided in the Matrimonial Home Bill, but the entirety of the property.  In some cases it is considered appropriate that the entirety, not only half, of the matrimonial home should be given to one or other spouse &mdash; I know cases where that happened.  All property is on the table &mdash; the matrimonial home, its contents, the family farm, the family business, shares, bank accounts, etc.</P>
      <P>Where there is no breakdown, where the family is intact and remaining so, there are two possibilities.  Either a transfer of a half-share or a proportionate interest will be done by agreement, or it will not.  If agreement is reached by the two spouses where the marriage is intact, all they have to do is have a deed drawn up transferring whatever share they may agree at that point and that will be done.  In that area we may be of help by devising simpler, cheaper forms of conveyancing transfers than those that pertain at present.  The Department is examining whether that can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If in an intact marriage the partners do not agree, what would happen if <Col N="113" /> Senator Honan's amendment was applied?  In this intact marriage, one spouse would bring the other to court and have a panoply of legal proceedings drawn up.  They would battle each other in court as to the value of the work each did, with costs mounting up on both sides in the meantime.  A court may decide that 15 per cent is appropriate, but two years later, as a result of further contributions, another application will be made to the court to upgrade that.  It does not add up in an intact marriage situation.  The matter cannot be resolved that way.</P>
    <P>If there had been no court proceedings on the Matrimonial Home Bill, 1993, it would have been an automatic provision that the home and contents belonged to both parties rather than being based on house contributions.  A court would not be necessary because they were both spouses.  One can appreciate its thrust and purpose, which would have been all right if it had stood up, but unfortunately it did not.  We are now faced with a difficulty and there is no easy route to take.</P>
    <P>One cannot fix the Matrimonial Home Bill, 1993, because it was declared unconstitutional.  A different type of legislation is needed to replace it.  I am keeping the situation under review.  If the constitutional position changes as a result of the review group's work, I would be delighted to reintroduce the Bill in its original form because I now believe it was the right thing to do.  In the meantime we should try to simplify the conveyancing procedures because that would help many people in an intact marriage situation.</P>

We appreciate what he has done, but we are concerned about women in these circumstances. Senators on all sides of the House would prefer to do this an easier way.

However, we should raise this matter at every opportunity and try to ensure it is kept on the Government's agenda.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 31:</P>
      <P>In page 23, before section 22, but in Part II of the Bill, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;22.&mdash;(1) In any case in which application is made to the court for an order under section 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 17 or 35 of this Act, each party to the application shall file an affidavit which shall:</P>
      <P>(a)  state his or her income and the source of such income;</P>
      <P>(b)  exhibit statements for the last three years of any and all bank or building society accounts, credit union accounts or accounts with any other financial or credit institution of such party, whether in his or her sole name or held jointly with another or by a nominee on his or her behalf, and whether located within the State or in any other state;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="116" /> (c)  disclose the nature, extent and location of any assets currently held, or held over the last three years, by him or her, including, without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, any interest in any lands or premises or other property, or any stocks, shares, cash, motor vehicles, Government securities, prize bonds, policies of life assurance or bloodstock, whether held by him or her solely or jointly with another person or by nominee on his or her behalf;</P>
    <P>(d)  disclose all income and/or monies received by him or her from any source whatsoever within the last three years, whether within the State or in any other state, including income and/or any other monies derived from any trade or profession carried out by him or her; income and/or monies derived from any dividends or interest, emoluments or remuneration received by him or her from any company of which he or she is or was a shareholder and/or director, and/or rental income, and</P>
    <P>(e)  exhibit returns of tax made by him or her for the last five financial years.</P>
    <P>(2) It shall be an offence for any party to such application knowingly to conceal or to attempt to conceal the existence of any of the matters referred to in subsection 1 from the other party or from the court.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to cover all orders which involve money. There should be total transparency, openness and accountability in relation to all assets and income.  No one should have any reason to conceal anything from the other party.  The Minister said in the other House that rules of court will take care of this, but if one files an affidavit of means which is subsequently discovered not to have contained everything, one can be prosecuted for perjury. <Col N="117" /> I ask the Minister how many people have been prosecuted for perjury in the past ten years.  That is not done in practice.</P>
    <P>I have support from the Dublin Solicitors Bar Association which said that this Bill imposes a duty on the spouses or dependent members of the family in certain proceedings under the Bill to give such particulars of his or her property and income as may be reasonably required.  In many cases the present discovery court procedure is not taken seriously enough.  Under the rules of court an additional offence cannot be made.  The association has said it has never heard of a party in a family law proceedings case being punished for contempt of court for failing to obey an order of discovery.  The extension of attachment of earnings orders will not help where one spouse is self-employed because it may be difficult for the other spouse to get full details of their income and assets.  This amendment should be accepted in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of Senator Honan's amendment is to provide that parties to proceedings under the Bill are required to make full disclosure of their assets and income.  In the course of the Bill's passage through the Dáil, this question of disclosure was debated at length and section 37 of the Bill was amended to provide that each of the spouses concerned shall give to the other spouse or defendant such particulars of his or her property and income as he or she may reasonably require for the purpose of the proceedings.  In addition, amendment No. 58, which I propose today, provides that the court will have power to direct persons to comply with the provisions of section 37 for disclosure of information and, where they fail to do so, they will be in breach of a court order, which, as Senators will be aware, carries its own penalty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 66 provides that the important provisions in section 37 are also incorporated in the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) <Col N="118" /> Act, 1976, which will provide for the first time that parties to maintenance proceedings under that Act will be required to make full disclosure of their property and income.  Section 37, with the amendment I am proposing today, provides for full disclosure of information in relation to the parties' property and income, which can be enforced by a court.  Senator Honan's amendment is, therefore, not necessary and I am opposing it.</P>

      <P>(a)  to inquire as to whether, and to find and declare that, a husband or wife, by reason of the extent of his or her non-financial contribution to the family household, has directly or indirectly enabled or assisted the other spouse to acquire or enlarge any interest, legal or equitable, in such property,</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 55:</P>
      <P>In page 35, subsection (2), lines 39 to 41, to delete subsection (2).</P>
      <P>The Circuit Court is overburdened with work and cannot deal with the cases it already has.  The Circuit Court does not issue written judgements.  It does not have its own body of case law and there would not be any great consistency between courts around the country.  The judges in the Circuit Court would not have other court decisions to go on.  It is not appropriate that the Circuit Court would deal with these cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 37 of the Bill provides that the Circuit Family Court shall have jurisdiction concurrently with the High Court to hear and determine proceedings for a decree of nullity.  The effect of Senator Honan's amendment would be to limit jurisdiction in such proceedings to the High Court only.</P>
      <P>The purpose of providing, as the Bill does, for the Circuit Family Court to have jurisdiction in proceedings for nullity is to ensure that persons involved in such proceedings will have greater access to the courts and also to minimise the costs of such proceedings for the parties involved.  It will also mean that the Circuit Court will have jurisdiction to deal with all family law matters.  I am satisfied this is as it should be and I do not think the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court in family law matters should be limited.  That would be the effect of the amendment and, consequently, I oppose it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 28 of the Bill is a useful provision for persons to seek declarations by the Circuit Court regarding the status of their marriage.  This may involve a declaration concerning the validity of a marriage.  In these proceedings it may well transpire that the court will treat the proceedings as an application for nullity and the Bill provides for that eventuality in section 28 (7).  If, as this amendment proposes, nullity is confined to the High Court, parties involved in the proceedings I have mentioned <Col N="127" /> would end up in two courts.  That would be an inefficient use of the courts' time and an unnecessary expense on litigants.</P>
    <P>While I appreciate the Senator's comments in relation to the volume of family law business currently before the Circuit Court, I would direct Senators' attention to the announcement made yesterday by my colleague, the Minister for Justice, in relation to measures for tackling the backlog of cases in the courts generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome what the Minister has said, particularly in relation to the announcement by his colleague the Minister for Justice yesterday.  The Minister said that by dealing with nullity decrees in the Circuit Court one was giving greater access to the courts.  The Circuit Court does not have adequate resources to deal with the present family law jurisdiction.  With increased jurisdiction, particularly in rural Circuit Courts, I cannot understand how people will have greater access.</P>
      <P>The Solicitors' Bar Association is concerned that the Circuit Family Court is being given concurrent jurisdiction with the High Court in nullity matters because the Circuit Court has no jurisprudence in this area and few written judgements are handed down in Circuit Court family law cases.  Thus, the law of nullity will not continue along the lines of the development which has been ongoing in the High Court, particularly in the area of inability to enter into or sustain a normal marital relationship. This is particularly worrying in view of the failure to codify the law of nullity, notwithstanding the recommendations of Mr. Justice Costello's discussion paper on that issue.  Because of the huge number of cases and the backlog in these courts, I do not accept that we are, in effect, giving greater access.  A fully contested nullity petition would take up to three of four days in the Circuit Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Regrettably, there is also a backlog of cases in the High Court. <Col N="128" /> Let us not get the idea that the Circuit Court has a backlog and the High Court does not; the High Court also has a backlog.  My colleague, the Minister for Justice, has indicated that the issue of backlog in all courts is now going to be effectively addressed by the Government.</P>
      <P>When one talks about access to the courts, one is talking to a large extent about costs.  I have to point out to Senator Honan that the cost of access to the High Court is considerably higher than it is in the Circuit Court.  There are many people who would be financially unable to bring an application that they wanted to bring in the Circuit Court and simply could not afford to do it all in the High Court.  Therefore, access to the courts for remedy in such a case will be open to people if there is a Circuit Court jurisdiction, whereas it would be closed off to them from a cost point of view if it were confined as at present to the High Court.</P>
      <P>I have to confess that I do not follow the question about availability of jurisprudence. Whatever jurisprudence that is there for a High Court judge is equally available for a Circuit Court judge.  They can examine the jurisprudence and have it submitted to them by solicitors and counsel on both sides and that jurisprudence is available for them. They will quickly bring about their own jurisprudence as well in addition to that. The fact of the matter is that there is not a great deal of jurisprudence on this subject anyway &mdash; what is there is quite limited.  I agree with Senator Honan that it would be desirable to have a new piece of legislation brought in dealing with all aspects of nullity.  As I said earlier in the debate, I would like to see that happen.  It is something that should have been done a long time ago.  I hope to be in a position to address that during the lifetime of the current Government but I am not in a position to give any commitment in respect of it until I see how other matters progress and are dealt with.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 69:</P>
      <P>In page 42, subsection (1), to delete line 4 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;a decree of judicial separation,</P>
      <P>(b) a Deed of Separation, or&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section deals with capital gains tax treatment of certain disposals by spouses.  Under this Bill there is an exemption from capital gains tax for certain transfers between spouses.  I am concerned that this exemption only <Col N="134" /> applies to transfers made pursuant to an order under this Bill.  Most legal separations are concluded by means of a deed of separation.  Confining the exemption to transfers made pursuant to an order under this Bill would inevitably force spouses to institute legal proceedings against one another.</P>
    <P>Section 49 as drafted is contrary to the spirit of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, which encourages spouses to make every effort to resolve matters by means of a separation agreement.  This exemption should be extended to transfers made pursuant to separation agreements and other court orders, such as those under the Married Women's Status Act, 1957. I ask the Minister to clarify if that is the case or if I misunderstand the provision.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann, having regard to</P>
      <P>the present overcrowded situation in Irish prisons and the urgent need for additional prison places;</P>
      <P>the ever growing problem of serious crime and, in particular, of drug-related offences;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>the additional pressure on prison accommodation which will result <Col N="136" /> from the enactment of the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Bill, 1995, and from the stated intention of the Minister for Justice to change the law regarding bail;</P>
    <P>the commitment in the Government <i>Programme for Renewal</i> that prisoners will be discharged from prison in an orderly manner and not on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis;</P>
    <P>the very substantial expenditure which has already taken place in relation to the provision of a new prison in Castlerea, County Roscommon;</P>
    <P>deplores the recent decision to defer this project indefinitely; and calls on the Government to reverse this decision and to proceed immediately with the provision of this prison in accordance with the commitment which was given by the previous Government and which was reiterated on a number of occasions by the present Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  In my contribution I do not intend to engage in any political point scoring or unfair criticism of the Minister for Justice. I come from County Roscommon and we never needed the support and goodwill of the Minister for Justice more than we do at present.  Even though a Government amendment has been put down, there is not a single aspect of the motion with which any Member would disagree in any material respect.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice would be the first to accept that there is a serious overcrowding problem in Irish prisons and an acute shortage of prison places. Many members of the Government are on record as acknowledging this fact. This situation has pertained for a number of years.  Every day prisoners are released prematurely on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  There are regular reports of prisoners being admitted to prison in the morning and released in the afternoon. The revolving door situation is nothing new.  The people who should be behind <Col N="137" /> bars are out and about and committing further crimes.</P>
    <P>The Transfer of Sentenced Persons Bill is going through the Oireachtas at present and will soon become law.  In reply to a Dáil question from Deputy John O'Donoghue on 11 May 1995, I understand the Minister for Justice stated it has been estimated that the number of prisoners who would apply for transfers to Irish prisons under this legislation would be approximately 40 in the first year and ten a year thereafter. It is obvious from these figures that the implementation of this legislation will put additional pressure on prison accommodation.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also stated her intention to change the law with regard to bail.  The Government's policy document, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> provides for an examination by the Law Reform Commission of legislation to allow courts to refuse bail where the court considers it desirable to do so.  On the basis of that report, I assume the necessary legislative changes will be put in train and, if necessary, that proposals will be brought forward for an amendment to the Constitution in order to tighten up the bail laws.</P>
    <P>Everybody would welcome this move as an essential step in the fight against crime.  When one considers the number of crimes committed by persons on bail and that this number has risen from approximately 2,500 in 1990 to approximately 4,500 in 1994, the urgent need for drastic changes to our bail laws is obvious.  Such changes will have far-reaching implications for prisons.</P>
    <P>The motion also refers to the ever growing problem of serious crime and drug related offences in particular.  The Minister for Justice was quoted in one of the national newspapers last week as stating that the provisional crime figures for 1994 show an increase of 2.1 per cent on the 1993 figures.  In the same report she was also quoted as stating that drug abuse is now a problem of serious proportions in Mountjoy Prison and that, at a conservative estimate, approximately 3,000 of the 6,000 to 7,000 inmates who <Col N="138" /> will pass through Mountjoy this year will have a background of serious drug abuse in the community.</P>
    <P>The Government amendment refers to the pressure placed on the prison system, caused not least by the extent of drug related crime.  I welcome the recent initiatives taken by the Garda Síochána to make life more difficult for the drug barons and major drug dealers in Dublin and elsewhere in the country. Many of these people are quite well known to the Garda and newspaper crime reporters and security correspondents. It is extraordinary that we can read almost daily in the newspapers about the exploits and adventures of characters such as the Monk, the Penguin and the Footballer and yet for some reason the Garda Síochána is unable to secure sufficient evidence against these people to put them behind bars.  I hope they and other perpetrators of serious crime will be tracked down, convicted and sentenced.  The more successful the Garda is in dealing with them, the more the question of the availability of prison accommodation will arise.  The Minister for Justice has expressed on several occasions her determination to deal with the perpetrators of serious crime and I want her to be successful in that effort.  The more success she has, the more pressure will be put on our prisons.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the extraordinary decision two weeks ago to defer the building of the new prison in Castlerea.  In March 1994 the then Government decided to provide a high security prison in Castlerea to cater for 150 male offenders and this was welcomed by people not only in Castlerea and County Roscommon but throughout the country.  The fact that Castlerea was selected as the location for this new prison was warmly welcomed by the general public because it was seen as a vital step in the fight against crime and, just as importantly, it was seen as evidence of the Government's commitment to the development of the west because very little development has occurred there.  The decision to provide <Col N="139" /> the new prison in the grounds of St. Patrick's (Psychiatric) Hospital in Castlerea was seen as an earnest of the Government's decision to tackle in a serious way the spiralling crime wave which threatens this country.</P>
    <P>While a high security prison catering for 150 inmates might not be Castlerea's first choice, if it had a choice, the proposed prison was seen as a development which would provide a lifeline to a town and community where the population and economy has long been in decline. The prospect of jobs and the economic activity which would be generated during and subsequent to the construction of the prison gave new hope to a whole region which badly needed a confidence boost.  When the announcement about the prison was made, the local paper, the <i>Roscommon Champion,</i> commenting on the sheer elation and joyous celebrations in Castlerea which followed the announcement of the provision of the prison, stated that anybody could be forgiven for believing the entire town had won the lottery.</P>
    <P>In June 1994 the building of the perimeter wall commenced.  The wall is now almost completed at a cost of £2 million.  It is almost a mile and a half long and 20 feet high.  Tendering for the main prison building was set to close this month.  In addition to the £2 million the wall has cost, the Department of Health provided a special grant of £3.1 million to the Western Health Board for the relocation of the psychiatric services and the patients who were housed in St. Patrick's Hospital.  For this purpose the health board has acquired a number of properties in Castlerea, including the Don Arms Hotel.  This £3.1 million is also committed at this stage.  The total expenditure to date arising from the prison project is in excess of £5 million.</P>
    <P>It is no wonder that people everywhere, especially in Roscommon and the west, could not believe their ears when, on 8 June, they heard the Castlerea prison project was being shelved.  The dismay, disbelief and anger throughout the region were unprecedented. <Col N="140" /> Sooner or later a prison will have to be built to provide the additional prison places so badly needed at present and which will be needed even more in the future for the reasons I outlined.</P>
    <P>Surely, in view of the substantial expenditure which has already taken place on the Castlerea project, the obvious thing for the Government to do is to continue the provision of the prison without any interruption.  Has the Government decided to abandon the project entirely?  If this is the case, it will leave a mile and a half of wall, 20 feet high, which cost £2 million of public money as a monument to its memory in Castlerea.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  It is sad that we have to try to change the Government's mind on the Castlerea project.  It does not seem, from the Government's amendment, that it wishes to change its mind.  The decision to defer or shelve the project is cruel and callous.  What right has any Minister or Government to play political roulette with the people of Roscommon and, in particular, the staff and psychiatric patients at St. Patrick's Hospital, who now find themselves surrounded by a wall which is 20 feet high and one and a half miles long?</P>
      <P>This must surely be a sick Irish joke. How can any Government or Minister stand over a decision to shelve a project which was announced by a previous Government, provided for in the Book of Estimates and on which £5 million to date has been spent?  Surely there is a moral obligation to deal with public finances in a better way than this, apart from the consequences of the fight against crime and the devastation felt by the people of Castlerea and County Roscommon.  Surely no Minister has the right to fool around with public funds in such a way.  A sum of £1.5 million has been spent on this wall, a monument to this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems extraordinary that there are 70 psychiatric patients and staff behind that wall.  Their lives have been upset <Col N="141" /> and they do not know where they stand. Can any thought be spared for the prison officers who bought sites and houses and made provisions for their families to move to the area?  I attended a public meeting in Castlerea over a week ago. A person would have had to be there to believe the desperation in people's voices.  They genuinely felt their opportunity had come to transfer to the west. Some had bought houses in Castlerea and Roscommon, and some had bought sites and were in the process of building houses.  They suddenly found it was all in vain and they were caught in a catch-22. The wives and children of some prison officers in Mountjoy and Arbour Hill are living in Roscommon, and they now have to uproot themselves and try to establish a base in the city again.  No Minister has the right to do that.</P>
    <P>There are many aspects to this debate.  It is the reversal of a decision made by the last Government.  That decision was based on two very important points: the fight against crime and the need to provide extra prison spaces, which every Government over the last number of years has agreed on.</P>
    <P>It was also a commitment to the decentralisation of Government services to the regions, in particular to support a major public debate and request from many people in the west, including the bishops, for the Government of the day to support the development of the west. That was all part and parcel of the last Government's decision.  That commitment rings very hollow now because some Ministers say it has been deferred and another says it has been shelved.</P>
    <P>One clear aspect of this decision, is that the people of County Roscommon have found themselves without any political clout at Cabinet or Minister of State level.  They saw that at the time their project was shelved, not alone were other projects allowed to continue but new ones were announced.  In the same week that the Castlerea project was shelved, a decision was taken to extend the light rail system into the heart of the by-election area.  The people cannot be other than cynical <Col N="142" /> when such decisions and announcements are made.  I read in the newspaper afterwards that the decision on the light rail was taken in March and it was made public at the same time as the announcement was made about Castlerea.</P>
    <P>The people of Castlerea are cynical and believe that they are paying the price for their lack of political clout as far as this Government is concerned. They see that because there was no vote for Deputy Quinn or the Labour Party in that constituency, the prison project could be shelved without doing any political damage to the Minister for Finance or his colleagues.  I believe that if the area had had a Minister or a Minister or State this decision would not have been taken.</P>
    <P>There seems to be plenty of money for other projects but not for the people of Castlerea or for the fight against crime.  I totally reject the statement that extra spaces will be made available as a result of the peace process.  From the information I have received from prison officers and others, it seems that 50 is the maximum number of places which will become available in that way.  That will not solve the situation.</P>
    <P>Every day there are between 600 and 700 criminals walking the streets who have been sentenced to imprisonment but are not in custody.  As my colleague said, they are brought to prison in the morning and are given money, put on the train and are back in Roscommon, Ballinasloe and other towns in the midlands and the west before the gardaí who brought them to prison are home. Those facts were presented to me by members of the Garda Síochána and others.  At the same time, we are turning down a project for which money was provided for in the Book of Estimates and which was to create prison spaces to help attack the major crime epidemic.</P>
    <P>It was a political decision to scuttle the Castlerea project because there were no pluses in it for this Government. The last Government decided to put the prison there and this Government did not want to support a decision <Col N="143" /> of the last Government.  Therefore, they scuttled it and to hell with the people of Castlerea.  In Cromwell's time the saying was &ldquo;To hell or to Connacht&rdquo;; today it is &ldquo;To hell with Connacht&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;mindful of the pressure placed upon the prison system, caused not least by the extent of drug related crime,</P>
      <P>notes in particular, the review of prison operations with the objective of ensuring that optimum use is made of all available accommodation,</P>
      <P>noting the enormous cost to this State from 25 years of violence, welcomes the opportunity and resources which have and will become available as a result of the Peace Process,</P>
      <P>supports the use of non-custodial treatment of offenders, especially the possibilities for expansion of community sanctions and other measures as an alternative to imprisonment,</P>
      <P>notes the commitment given by the Minister for Justice to bring forward comprehensive proposals to Government very shortly on important aspects of law enforcement and inter-agency co-operation with regard to the drugs problem,</P>
      <P>welcomes the measures being taken to prevent drugs being smuggled into our prisons, and</P>
      <P>supports the provision of treatment programmes within our prisons for those prisoners suffering from drug addiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House knows, the Government has commenced a review of the 1996 <Col N="144" /> budget, as was agreed in the programme <i>A Government of Renewal.</i>  The Government is committed under that programme to achieving a target of 2 per cent real growth in gross current supply services expenditure in 1996.  The Government is determined to ensure a strategic approach to the allocation of available resources in 1996.  This will involve all Ministers, including the Minister for Justice, in a review of the existing policies and expenditures with a view to maximising benefit within the Government's spending target for 1996.</P>
    <P>It was in this context that the Government found it necessary to defer &mdash; and I emphasise the word defer &mdash; the Castlerea project.  The House will be aware that a contract for the perimeter wall and associated works was placed in May 1994 and is due for completion by the end of this month.  The total cost of this contract will amount to approximately £1.3 million and works under this contract are virtually complete.</P>
    <P>I wish to convey the apologies of the Minister for Justice for not attending this debate, although she is more than adequately replaced by the Minister of State.  The Minister for Justice intended to be here but she had travel difficulties getting back from Brussels and, unfortunately, she was unable to make the debate.</P>
    <P>At present, there are 12 prisons, including three open centres in the State &mdash; Mountjoy Prison, the training unit in Portlaoise, Arbour Hill, Limerick, Cork, St. Patrick's Institution, Wheatfield, Fort Mitchell, Loughane House, Shelton Abbey and Shanganagh Castle &mdash; allowing for a total of approximately 2,240 prison spaces.  The Department of Education has places of detention at Oberstown and Trinity House, each of which accommodates up to 30 people. The Minister is reviewing all aspects of prison operations with the objective of ensuring that optimum use is made of all available prison accommodation.  In particular, the Minister is examining the opportunities which are likely to arise in Portlaoise following the effects of the peace process.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="145" /> She is also examining the issue of payment of fines and debts by such means as attachment of income or a phased payment system, to which I will refer later.  Such changes will ensure that punishment other than custody can be used for such offenders.  Although the number in custody at any time for such offences is small, the Minister is most anxious that more serious criminals will occupy prison spaces.  Within the limits of financial constraints, the Minister will also be taking a hard look at the non-custodial treatment of offenders, especially opportunities for the expansion of community sanctions, as an alternative to imprisonment in suitable cases.</P>
    <P>As outlined in the Government's amendment and in the motion, drug related crime is putting extensive pressure on our prison service.  Seventy per cent of the inmates of Limerick Prison are in for drug related offences. However, there is no drug problem in Limerick Prison and what has happened there should be examined in the context of what is happening in other prisons.</P>
    <P>There has been an unprecedented level of success in counteracting the drug trafficking problem in 1995.  A few weeks ago we outlined the successes, and there have been more since then. This tends to highlight the level of drug activity, but it also highlights the success of the Garda their fight against drug trafficking.  While we are targeting drug traffickers and peddlers, we are not doing enough in terms of the demand for drugs.  We should educate more and point out to those who use drugs and who are being misled the dangers of taking that route and the eventual outcome for most.  If there is a demand, there will be a supply.  If we reduce the supply, we will drive up the price if the demand remains.  It is important that both go hand in hand.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice is determined that all possible steps are taken to deal with the drugs situation.  The Garda Commissioner has focused special attention on the drugs situation because it is at the root of a significant proportion <Col N="146" /> of crimes committed in our society and is the cause of the pressure in the prison service.  All Garda drug units are co-ordinated on a national basis through the National Drugs Administration Office in Garda headquarters, which is staffed by full-time gardaí with a detailed and specialised knowledge of the drug problem.  In Dublin drug units have been established in each of the five Garda divisions and their activities are co-ordinated through the central drugs squad.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks we have heard about the number of gardaí assigned to full-time drugs duties.  It is claimed that there has been a reduction in their numbers since the mid-1980s.  The facts tell a different story in that twice as many gardaí are employed in the drugs unit than in 1985.  There are now drug units outside Dublin in Cork, Galway and Limerick.</P>
    <P>We all know about the tremendous profit which can be made from drugs.  It is not sufficient that drug traffickers who carry on this evil trade are dealt with by way of imprisonment and fines. Other measures are called for; in particular, the confiscation of the proceeds of drugs.  These measures are provided for in the Criminal Justice Act, 1994.  It is evident from the Act that our law makes extensive provision for powers which enable the law enforcement authorities to identify and secure restraint and confiscation orders in respect of the proceeds of drug trafficking.  These powers came into operation in November 1994.  In addition, the Minister for Justice has brought into force, with effect from 2 May 1995, a number of provisions in the 1994 Act which requires banks and other financial bodies to take certain measures &mdash; for example, the identification of customers and reporting suspicious transactions &mdash; which will make it more difficult for drug traffickers to launder their dirty money.</P>
    <P>Efficiency in the prison service is important.  We must ensure that taxpayers get the maximum value for money.  We must also ensure that the <Col N="147" /> transfer of Garda and prison resources, thankfully coming on stream as a result of the peace process, is carefully done. Careful planning must be applied to ensure the maximum benefit of the reallocation of resources so that it targets more serious crime.</P>
    <P>For centuries our approach to crime has been to send people to prison. Imprisonment is important as regards those who have committed serious offences.  However, a different approach should be taken for the non-payment of small debts, fines and so on.  Areas which should be looked at have been discussed in the House on numerous occasions.  We should look at the use of probation and fines rather than imprisonment. We should confiscate income or assets in certain cases.  Restitution should be paid, particularly to the victims of crime.  We should expand community service orders and look at the disqualification and withdrawal of licences and require more attendance at treatment centres.</P>
    <P>We should also look at the confiscation of goods.  For example, if a person does not tax or insure their car, we should confiscate it rather than send them to prison.  The same should apply to those who fail to pay their television licence.  Rather than imposing a heavy fine, which is sometimes not paid, or sending them to prison, we should confiscate the television.  We must look at alternatives to sending people to prison. Last year an 18 or 19 year old girl spent two weeks in prison for not paying her DART fare.  That should not happen. Serious offenders should be in prison, not those who commit minor offences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the document which the previous Minister for Justice produced last year on the management of offenders.  It was the first time the Department of Justice produced a document which contained a plan.  I was delighted that it was under the heading of management of offenders and not of prisoners or so forth.  I find it depressing that so early in this Government the <Col N="148" /> plan appears to be abandoned and we seem to be proceeding on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis again.</P>
      <P>I have great sympathy for the inhabitants of Castlerea as regards the &ldquo;delay&rdquo; in building the prison there.  However, I was one of those who questioned the wisdom of building a prison there. Those in Castlerea suffered a blow when the psychiatric institution was closed down and they now suffer the double blow because the prison, which was promised, may or may not proceed in the future.</P>
      <P>There was a considerable amount of criticism as regards siting the prison in Castlerea.  In all studies on prison it is reckoned that the most important thing is to try to keep them as close as possible to the centre where the prisoner lives so they can maintain contact with their families.  Although sanction is imposed on the prisoner, their liberty is taken away and they are unable to commit crime, we must hope for rehabilitation so they can be let out into the community again.  One of the strongest findings as regards the prevention of recidivism is that there should be close contact between prisoners and their families for the duration of the sentence to try to build up some home life and structure for the person to come out to. Building a prison in the midst of County Roscommon, an area not noted for great crime, was doubtful.  However, I understand the dismay of the people of Castlerea.</P>
      <P>It was a strange decision to build a prison in Castlerea in view of the fact that Wheatfield prison is only half developed.  Some 320 places have been provided in that prison.  It is a serviced site and another 300 places could be created if additional accommodation was built.  It is one of the best prisons around and it has splendid facilities; it even has a theatre.  I question why that site was not developed because it is easily accessible and most prisoners come from the Dublin and surrounding areas. It was an odd decision that it was not looked at first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="149" /> The delay &mdash; I presume it is only a delay &mdash; in building the women's prison should give us time to have a greater public debate as regards the type of women's prison we need.  Each year 20 to 30 people occupy the prison here.  It was proposed to build a prison with 60 secure places.  I realise attempts were being made to have a drug free area and to have high and less secure areas. However, a prison with 60 secure places is considerable in a country of this size, given that Iceland manages without any at all.  I know it is small country with remote places where it can put serious criminals to keep them out of the way of the population.</P>
    <P>I have visited women's prisons abroad.  We had a large plan and we should look at it again.  It must be remembered that 95 per cent of women in prison are in for shop lifting and 95 per cent of them are drug addicts.  They are in for two to three weeks; they are out and they are in again.  We have, therefore, no notion of how many women, indeed how many people, go in and out of Mountjoy Prison.  There are so many readmissions of the same people that it is impossible to keep up with the statistics.</P>
    <P>It is right that all speakers have mentioned the appalling situation in our prisons. I was interested in Senator Neville's remarks regarding Limerick Prison, but the important thing to remember about the serious situation with Mountjoy Prison is that it is a remand prison.  People are coming in, going out and going to the courts.  In addition, there are visitors every day.  It is, therefore, a nightmare trying to prevent drugs from getting into the prison.</P>
    <P>The notions of strip searchers, sniffer dogs and so on are pathetic because they have been found to be useless elsewhere. In addition, prisoners are inclined to react to a challenge to see if they can overcome it.  Has the Minister considered more positive things that can be done?  For example, given the way it is presently constructed, we cannot have drug free areas within the prison. <Col N="150" /> However, it should be possible for prisoners to volunteer for urine analysis and where it was found that they were drug free for five days of the week they could be let out for the weekends.  This would be a positive development.  The prisoners would have a carrot to stay off drugs for the week and they could at least go to see a football match at the weekend.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Such a move would also provide space in the prison at the really serious times when there are crises &mdash; for example, when people are admitted to prison at weekends &mdash; with the result that people have to be given temporary release for no reason.  I do not suggest that serious and violent be criminals be released in this way, only those imprisoned on lesser charges.  Other imaginative programmes must be considered.</P>
      <P>There is no counselling regarding drug abuse in the prisons.  There is only a pathetic, almost cold turkey, physeptone programme, where the men get one week's physeptone and the women two weeks.  Any programme under three weeks is very little.  In addition there is nothing regarding alcoholism. Alcohol is a very serious drug.  While prisoners may not be getting it while in prison, alcohol is seriously involved in recidivism.  When they eventually stop reoffending, an enormous number of prisoners realise that alcohol was heavily involved in the times they reoffended and that if they can avoid alcohol they are less likely to reoffend.  We talk about drug facilities in prison and the rehabilitation of offenders.  It is now midsummer's day, yet when the snowdrops were here I was promised by the Minister of State that the detoxification unit was about to open in Cherry Orchard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The psychiatric situation must be tackled because it goes along with the drugs problem.  According to the director of Dundrum Mental Hospital, there are ten psychotic patients every day in Mountjoy Prison.  Dundrum has been <Col N="151" /> described as not suitable for the kind of patients it is treating.  Mentally handicapped patients, who should be described as patients and not as prisoners, are not assessed or segregated once they get into Mountjoy Prison.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that legislation will be enacted to substitute community service for lesser crimes.  The present position in this respect is ridiculous.  With regard to the transfer of prisoners legislation, prisoners abroad should be told about what they are coming home to.  A home description of the prison they were to enter may deter some of them from transferring.</P>
    <P>With regard to the cutback in the building programme, will the Minister ensure that the replacement visitors' centre in Mountjoy Prison is not abandoned? The present visitors' centre is disgusting; it is a disgrace.  The Religious Society of Friends, the Quakers, have offered to run the Mountjoy service and I understand the Department of Justice is enthusiastic about this.  They already run the two services in the visitors' centres at the Maze Prison and Maghaberry Prison in Northern Ireland.  If any building work is to be kept on with these cutbacks, I urge that it be this centre. It is an appalling experience to visit Mountjoy Prison and see where we are incarcerating people.  It is enough to take peoples' liberty from them, never mind treating them in this inhumane manner, where a large number of them do not have daylight.  Retaining the programme to build the replacement visitors' centre would show that we had some notion of following the management of offenders plan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment to the motion.  The motion as put in both cases is varied and it is difficult to focus on any specific issue when addressing the issue of crime in general and the prison system specifically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We live in a society where, unfortunately, crime has become all too common. It is not only an Irish but a world problem, stemming in many ways from <Col N="152" /> the same developments that opened up telecommunications, transport and so on.  This opened our little place on earth to the influence of greater forces.  When so many people have televisions, videos and satellite dishes, it is no wonder that the ill effects of displays of violence, sex crimes and abuse, which are viewed almost as heroic on our television screens every day of the week, arise in society.</P>
    <P>We should tackle the causes of these problems rather than the symptoms. The focus of the Fianna Fáil motion is towards the incarceration of all unwelcome people in our society, preferably by imprisoning them at the proposed Castlerea Prison.  This is not the answer; it is certainly not as simple as this.  We must develop a society where people accept individual responsibility for their own actions.  Nowadays we talk of our rights and entitlements, but not our duties.  In this respect education has a major role to play in promoting individual and civic responsibility.  Young people need to be taught the value of property; it does not grow on trees. They also need to be taught the impact of crimes on their victims and on society.  In this respect we must again consider how we should control the availability of videos, satellites and so on.  It is difficult in this day and age, but their availability starts the ball rolling with regard to many of the problems we have.  Not everything is down to the Government of the day to tackle.  Individuals, especially parents, have a responsibility to know where their children are at night, to know what is happening within their own family and to deal with it as best they can in a tough world.</P>
    <P>With regard to the drugs crisis, legislation was introduced recently dealing with the proceeds of the trade.  The legislation improves the powers of the Garda Síochána in making arrests where drugs are involved, which is welcome. However, we appear to be almost powerless in the face of what is a global, highly organised racket.  We should introduce drugs legislation where it <Col N="153" /> hurts the drug traffickers &mdash; in their pockets.  Those with lifestyles which exceed what the social welfare system could afford them, including the drug barons in this city, should be subject to legislation which would allow the Revenue Commissioners or the Garda to take cases against them for tax evasion, or whatever it takes to ensure that a jail sentence follows, in addition to stripping them of their illgotten gains.  We must address the confiscation of the proceeds of crime.  The drug dealers need to be tackled in this way; otherwise we have no hope.</P>
    <P>There is much talk about the peace process relieving space available in prisons. With regard to the Garda Síochána, it is suggested that we do not need the number of gardaí in the Border region that have been deployed hitherto. However, we continue to need the same number of gardaí because the drug trafficking and the availability of drugs in the Border region was to some extent controlled by paramilitary organisations and they are no longer involved in this activity.  This has resulted in an additional problem for people in my region, where we must now deal with the increased problem of drug availability. I therefore urge the Minister and the Department of Justice to ensure the continuing availability of the gardaí we need in areas such as County Cavan and County Monaghan.</P>
    <P>The proposed prison in Castlerea was to have provided another 150 places.  In terms of what I have read regarding prison systems generally, that is not a lot. It certainly would not have solved the problem.  We might still have had a lack of space and increasing crime rates. Locking people behind doors is not the obvious solution.  We already have 12 prisons, three open centres and two education institutions, which hold a total of 2,240 people.  If we need more spaces, we should look at finishing Wheatfield Prison, which is already under way.  That would be an obvious answer.  We should also look at converting <Col N="154" /> the old military barracks that are available in this city.  As Senator Henry said, these buildings are situated near where the perpetrators and their families live.</P>
    <P>We should look at building or providing separate remand centres.  It obviously does not work in the likes of Mountjoy Prison where one has long term prisoners mixing with people who are in and out on a daily basis.  It would be much more practical in terms of security and in dealing with the drug problem within the prison system to have separate remand centres.  Existing facilities in our cities could be converted for that very purpose.</P>
    <P>We must, however, examine the non-custodial treatment of offenders in a serious way.  The motion put down by Fianna Fáil does not do that.  It costs at least £700 a week to keep somebody behind bars.  One could stay in the best hotel in Ireland for the same money. That is an enormous cost, not only for the Government but the taxpayer as well, and there is no return for it.  The 1992 Report on Prisons and Places of Detention, which was published in 1994, recommended that radical alternatives be provided for prisoners, such as community work or the expansion of the programme of prisoners aid through community effort.</P>
    <P>When we talk about prisons, are we saying that we want to get the troublemakers out of society for a while, punish them for their wrongdoing or rehabilitate them in the hope that there will be fewer criminals in the future.  As things stand, we are only dealing with the first option.  We are putting them behind bars, but we are not punishing them as befits the crime &mdash; victims have to be remembered in that regard &mdash; and we are not addressing rehabilitation at all.  These people need to be shown a more useful way to conduct themselves in society, whether that is by getting involved in voluntary work or the need to get some training.  These people come <Col N="155" /> from disadvantaged areas throughout out country.  In the main, they never had a chance.  Education within the prison system could open a door for them. They may not have known they had a talent in a certain area.</P>
    <P>On the practical side, I look at Loughan House in my constituency. People are often delighted to get back there because they meet up with their old friends, have some craic and are treated well for a while and things are relatively easy there, although the more serious criminals do not go there.  I would be happy to see a work system being brought in that would allow those prisoners to be involved in draining the sides of the roads where there are serious road problems, in planting shrubs and trees, in painting walls and in doing up derelict buildings.  Not only would that give something to the prisoners, it would also deliver something back to the society from which they have taken.  That would be a practical and useful way to rehabilitate prisoners.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the speakers on the Fianna Fáil motion, it would be easy to be political and say that Castlerea got a hard deal because of this Government. It is not fair to say that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, would have ulterior motives in making that decision. Fianna Fáil seem to think that no Government can make decisions based on objective fact.  It would prefer to pull strokes or deals, but that is not the way that we in public office should behave and it is not the way this coalition behaves.  We practice what we preach in terms of accountability and the books must add up.  They will not if we continue to put money in on the basis of previous promises.</P>
    <P>I feel sorry for the people of Castlerea.  I come from a rural area and I know the importance of getting jobs into the community.  However, the prison should not be the be all and end all. It would serve the same politicians well <Col N="156" /> to put their energies into working with the Government in the hope of getting manufacturing or service industry jobs into Castlerea and I support their efforts in that regard.  That idea could get support. In putting jobs into the area, they should not depend on locking people behind bars as their sole source of income.</P>
    <P>In terms of the motion, it is important for us to realise that the Minister for Justice has a job to do.  The priorities of that would rest in tackling the serious nature of drug trafficking and drug crimes throughout this country.  In that regard, that is where the primary effort should lie.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Miss Ormonde Miss Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>A letter published in yesterday's <i>Irish Times</i> from a resident of Castlerea, Marian Caulfield, whom I do not know, expresses in far more eloquent terms than I ever could the sense of despair at the stupidity of the Government's decision to abandon this project.  This letter says that &ldquo;The recent decision to defer the project for Castlerea is a cynical exercise in political expediency.&rdquo;  It goes on to say that</P>
      <P>I was born and bred in the west of Ireland and I am proud of it.  It is heartbreaking to watch the decline of the entire region in economic, in sporting and in human terms.  We were being given a lifeline, just to have it cruelly withdrawn in order that we may stay in line for our EU partners in monetary union.  It might perhaps profit the present Government Ministers more to part with their &ldquo;Programme Managers&rdquo; and &ldquo;Advisers&rdquo; for the greater good of fiscal rectitude!  Of course Labour and Democratic Left are not depending on votes in the west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has abandoned the west.  It has also given up the ghost in the fight against crime.  The Minister's predecessor had put together the biggest peacetime plan for tackling <Col N="157" /> crime.  It consisted of 13 major initiatives at a cost of £66 million.  This Government is now dismantling this unprecedented plan of action, brick by brick, just as it is dismantling the necessary facility earmarked for Castlerea.</P>
    <P>It is patent nonsense for the Minister's socialist colleague in the Department of Finance to say that the effects of the peace dividend are such that Castlerea prison or the extra gardaí are no longer required.  The Minister also had the bare faced cheek to lecture us that Portlaoise Prison, now that it is empty according to him, will house ordinary criminals.  This is stretching our credibility to breaking point.  Some 60 republican prisoners were housed in Portlaoise Prison.  The recent releases have diminished this somewhat, so at the very most 60 places will be available, and probably not for some time to come.</P>
    <P>Contrast this with the 700 criminals who are allowed to roam freely around the streets this very evening because there is no place to put them.  My party never pretended that Castlerea or the new women's prison would solve all the problems.  In fact, the plan devised by the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, which was referred to earlier, had an element to recruit more probation and welfare officers to supervise those prisoners released on a proper basis.  The previous Government made a start &mdash; a good, honest attempt at solving the problem. This Government, with its battalions of advisers, programme managers and back up staff, is saying to the countless victims of crime that it has nothing to offer to them.  They should go home and lock their doors and make fortresses out of their houses.  Fine Gael was once known as the law and order party.  It is no longer the law or the order party.  It is now succumbing to the socialist dogma and indeed, other agendas.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice turns her back and what happens, she not alone is <Col N="158" /> knifed by her partners in Government but also by her party, including her party leader, and this was done to the Deputy Leader of Fine Gael.  By way of illustration of this Government's attitude to the crime problem in Ireland and the casual, uncaring approach to its victims, we read that £10 million has been found for a museum in Galway, £2 million to close down two car parks in Clare and Wicklow and £700,000 to buy a private house and garden in Clonsilla. Yet the Government cannot seem to find a further £2 million or £3 million to move the Castlerea project into the construction phase.  Need I say more?</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I say to the people of Castlerea that their spirit was not broken by Cromwell or the Famine and it will not be broken by the present Government.  They are unlucky because had it been a Labour Party or Democratic Left Minister for Justice, there would be JCBs and bulldozers in Castlerea at present.  I rest my case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that all Members would agree that there is a serious problem with regard to crime in Ireland.  The present Minister for Justice is making a major effort to try to combat and tackle crime.  It is important that there be widespread agreement about many of the issues we are discussing here.</P>
      <P>I found it somewhat amusing that, two days after the recent change of Government, the former Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Deputy O'Dea, commented on the sudden escalation of crime across Ireland.  I do not know whether the then Minister or his advisers told the Deputy that there was a considerable amount of crime during his time as Minister of State; the situation did not worsen overnight. This is a problem which we all must confront.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to make a number of suggestions.  I genuinely believe that the Garda Síochána are now facing criminals with one hand tied behind their backs.  They are up against a very well organised, highly efficient and ruthless <Col N="159" /> group of criminals.  The Garda Síochána are a very skilled and professional force but, irrespective of their efforts, they are finding it very difficult to get people to come forward to give evidence because of intimidation.  We have seen where a journalist was attacked, intimidated and threatened with murder.  We have to be very careful about the direction we are taking.  Building a prison at Castlerea will not solve the entire problem.  Unless major efforts are made in the area of criminal law, intimidation will be rife within five years and the situation will be completely out of hand.</P>
    <P>The time has come for a close examination of the rules of evidence.  They need to be changed, as does the situation with regard to the right to silence. Unless the right to silence is closely examined and amending legislation introduced so that people will have to account for their movements, we will face turmoil in the future.  An ordinary law abiding citizen must answer specific questions when the Revenue Commissioners call on him.  He has to give account of where he obtained money, where he went on holidays, how his wife managed to get a new coat or how he managed to change his car.  Everyone has to answer these kinds of questions. There is no right to silence.  The Revenue Commissioners are empowered to enter premises, seize books and documents for examination and people must explain their business dealings to them.</P>
    <P>I will give an example of a serious crime that took place &mdash; it was actually murder &mdash; in this country.  When the accused was brought in for questioning he said he wanted his solicitor, his doctor and his dinner.  He has not opened his mouth since his three requests were granted.  We are dealing with quite ruthless and sophisticated people who know their rights.  If things continue as they are it will be almost impossible of the Garda Síochána to obtain convictions in court.  However, I also believe that fair play for everyone is important.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="160" /> I would like to see a major effort made to clean up Mountjoy Prison.  I have visited Mountjoy on a number of occasions and spoken to many people who have been there.  People break laws and are committed to prison; it is a serious thing for a person to go to prison. However, I believe that whatever wrong they committed, people should be in good health when they are set free. At present there is a drugs problem in Mountjoy which did not arise when the Minister of State, the Minister for Justice or the former Minister came to power.  The problem is ongoing.  I am not pointing the finger at anyone.  A serious effort must be made to ensure that drugs are not allowed into Mountjoy and that people who are on drugs are segregated so that other prisoners do not come into contact with them.</P>
    <P>I have met many respectable young people who committed crimes but are still respectable and decent in many ways.  They do not fear the prison sentence. They fear the unknown in Mountjoy Prison with regard to drugs and the AIDS problem.  We must ensure that people's health is not put at risk when they are placed in Mountjoy. People should be put to work when they are in prison; there should be a strict regime; prison should not be a holiday camp.  People should know they are in prison but they should be clothed, fed and exercised properly while they are there.  When their sentence is completed, they should re-enter society a little better than when they were put in prison.</P>
    <P>There are many prison spaces across the country.  I believe a prison in Castlerea would benefit many people.  I hope the decision made with regard to Castlerea is short term and that the prison will eventually be built there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Crime is a very serious problem at the present time.  I wonder if any real effort is being made to put an end to it.  When I see old age pensioners being mugged in broad daylight and no one arrested for it, BMWs being stolen <Col N="161" /> in this city &mdash; the culprits have a planned programme of ramming different premises and robbing them &mdash; and the Garda Síochána see the offence but cannot follow those involved, something is radically wrong.  There is also something wrong when journalists can practically name the criminals, trace them down and yet the law cannot.  What is the reason for this?</P>
      <P>Something should be done about the right to silence but it is also very important that people have a solicitor with them.  I would not have said that two years ago.  However, I know four men who came across a man lying dead on the road on their way home.  He had been the victim of a hit and run accident. The men telephoned the Garda and the ambulance service.  The Garda told them to go about their business and thanked them for doing the good deed. Three days later when there was a fuss because no one had been apprehended, those boys were hauled in.  Four squad cars arrived at a man's house and a van was seized.  The headlines ran: &ldquo;Van driver helping police with inquiries&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Luckily I went with those lads to the barracks.  We thought we were going to help the Garda.  One of the lads asked for a solicitor and I went with another. They tried to argue that the lad was driving the van, forcing him to admit that he had killed this man.  I intervened in the end and told them about something I witnessed that affected some of them.  It hit too close to the bone and that finished the inquiry.</P>
      <P>Some days later a superintendent told me that when the forensic experts finished examining the van I would be proved wrong, but the forensic experts could find nothing on the van because it never touched the man.  They held parts of that van for three months, which is blackguardly work.  This is why you have to be very careful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Garda are hell bent on getting someone, regardless of who they might be.  It may only be a small minority in <Col N="162" /> the Garda but one is enough to give the lot a bad name.  A solicitor must be there at all times but we should not be pussyfooting at the same time.  We must be careful to see that things are done correctly.  I would hate to think what might have happened if I had not been there that evening.</P>
    <P>Recently I was playing golf with a detective who said: &ldquo;For heaven's sake will you talk to the Minister for Justice and put every man we have on crime for one year.  Forget about road traffic accidents because if crime is not faced up to with every available man, soon this country will not be fit to live in.&rdquo; That is the stage we are getting to.</P>
    <P>There have been several crimes in my own area, including the shooting of a postman.  The poor fellow has died since and no one was ever arrested even though it happened in broad daylight in a quiet rural area and the barracks was not closed.</P>
    <P>Too many Garda are on road traffic duty harassing the poor old motorist who is treated like a criminal in today's society, although he is going about his business and working hard.  Maybe he has the right foot too heavily on the accelerator at times, but no drink has been taken and very often he wears a pioneer pin in his coat.  He may be cruising at 75 or 80 mph and is no danger to anybody but he is still brought before the court and fined.</P>
    <P>The criminals can do 120 mph however, and the gardaí seem to let them pass and wave them good-bye.  Is it not time our Garda were supplied with specially reinforced jeeps so that they can meet those vehicles head on?  We have to do something to apprehend these people.</P>
    <P>There should be an Army unit for all those joy riders, not to abuse them but to take them in for two or three years to educate and train them.  They have brains in abundance and great ability but they are focused in the wrong direction. We should make more use of our <Col N="163" /> Army; with a good training school those boys would have enough people to supervise them and they could learn about the good side of life.  Their talents could be used in a productive manner.  I have been saying this for some time but nobody takes any heed of it.</P>
    <P>Manpower is wasted in other areas also.  The other day I gave a lift to a poor alcoholic whom I know very well. He said that he had been in Mountjoy Prison because he was caught after hours in a pub.  He was fined £25 even though he did not have two pence to rub together.  Since he could not pay the fine two gardaí spent three or four days trying to get him to pay it.  Then they employed a taxi to drive him to Mountjoy but when he arrived there the prison governor said it would cost more to feed him there for five days than the £25 fine and he sent him home because there was no place for him.</P>
    <P>The man could not go home because he had no money, so another taxi was called to drive him to Connolly Station. They put him on the train back to Sligo. How much money and time were wasted in that exercise?  Is it not time we stopped that kind of nonsense?  I appeal to the Minister because this is happening all over Ireland.  Poor fellows are being dragged into prison for a paltry few pounds that they have not got. We might as well write it off from the word go.  It is nonsensical to summons them in the first place because they have a problem and they badly need help.  That kind of help, however, is no good.</P>
    <P>We also have to come to grips with the problem of drugs in prisons.  What is the point of sentencing someone who may only be dabbling in drink but who will leave prison a drug addict?  We are adding insult to injury.</P>
    <P>We must take positive action if we are to come to grips with crime, otherwise it will destroy our tourism business. Tourists are being picked off in Dublin <Col N="164" /> in broad daylight.  The money should be found to pay Garda overtime and to put every available man out there for one year to catch criminals.  There is not a teenager going to a disco who cannot tell you who is selling drugs.  They can get drugs, yet the Garda cannot catch the pushers.  Why?  There is something basically wrong there and this must be talked out with the Garda.  We must find out why they are not doing their work.</P>
    <P>In many cases the courts have gone soft and judges will have to realise that they are dealing with criminals.  When they have plenty of evidence that a man, woman or person &mdash; it is an awful job trying to be politically correct when you are speaking &mdash; is guilty, they should be kept in prison, but they know they will be set free and they can commit as much crime as they like because they will get away with one summons and one fine.</P>
    <P>I could continue speaking on crime for an hour because it is a serious issue. I feel sad about what is happening in Castlerea because we do not have enough prison places.  Let us release people who should not be in prison in the first instance.  Let us rethink the Castlerea decision because if we do not provide places for those people we cannot hold them on remand.  We must be able to hold them on remand because they know that once they are pulled, they have a free passport to rob and plunder as much as they like.  They know that there will only be one sentence regardless of the number of crimes they commit.</P>

      <P>I apologise for the absence of the Minister for Justice who had hoped to be here.  Unfortunately, she was unable to return in time for the debate, although she would have wished to be here in person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There can be no doubt in this House or anywhere else that the fight against drugs is a matter of the highest priority for the Government, but if the Opposition <Col N="165" /> is honest it will know that there is no simplistic answer to this complex problem.</P>
    <P>As a society our core values and stability are threatened by all crime but particularly by drug related crime.  With other developed countries we are facing an attempt by the international drugs trade and their local Irish associates to flood Ireland with drugs.  Let there be no doubt about the Government's resolve to deal with this threat using all the resources at our disposal.</P>
    <P>I think it is fair to say that we are facing, in Dublin, Cork and other cities, a threat from drugs which is on the same scale as that which was posed by terrorist violence.  I am aware that even small towns and villages which were previously considered immune from the drugs problem are now also facing this problem.  Now that we are in the process of achieving a permanent and lasting peace on this island, we can properly anticipate devoting some of the resources of the peace dividend to tackling this grave threat to our society.</P>
    <P>The fight against drugs is a fight which engages not just the Department of Justice but almost every Department. This Government has invested huge resources in education particularly in disadvantaged areas; it has invested in local development in disadvantaged areas; it is utterly committed to bringing deprived people and their areas into the mainstream of society.  In the long term, this investment is of much greater value than a simplistic solution which is solely centred on prisons.</P>
    <P>I want to remind the House that prisons are a sign of failure in society.  The achievement of social order and harmony is best progressed by positive initiatives in the areas of education and employment.  Building more prisons means society is failing to achieve the order and harmony which it ought to.</P>
    <P>Not only are prisons an indication of failure but they themselves often fail to achieve their intended purpose, as many <Col N="166" /> Senators on both sides of the House pointed out.  It would seems logical that if you lock up as many offenders as possible, the rest of society would be orderly and harmonious; but this is not the case.  The society with the highest rate of imprisonment in the western world &mdash; the United States &mdash; is not a safer, more crime free society than Ireland is.</P>

      <P>I am not suggesting that prisons are not needed.  They are because society has, and will always have, failure.  Should we succumb to address our failures in a negative rather than a positive way?  We need to look to alternatives.  Investment in education, local development and employment will have long term effects.  In the short term, we intend to address the major problem of drugs and to look at non-custodial alternatives to prison.</P>
      <P>In relation to drugs, the multi-agency approach involving the Departments of Health, Justice and Education and their respective agencies, has been recognised by the Government as providing the best possible framework to deal with the problem.  Essentially, we must deal not just with the supply of drugs, but also the demand; we must focus on both parts of the equation.</P>
      <P>This is precisely what the Government strategy to prevent drug abuse is about.  It proposes a multi-disciplinary approach requiring action in the areas of supply reduction, demand reduction and increased access to treatment and rehabilitation programmes.  In other words, the strategy calls for integrated action on the problem on a number of different levels.  This approach provides the best possible framework for dealing with the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turning to the specific law enforcement response, which is, of course, an essential subset of the broader multi-agency <Col N="167" /> response, I want to point out the following: all Garda drug units throughout the country are co-ordinated on a national basis through the national drug administration office in Garda headquarters, which is staffed by full-time gardaí with a detailed and specialised knowledge of the drugs problem; in Dublin, which is the main area where heroin is a problem, drug units have been established in each of the city's five Garda divisions and their activities are co-ordinated through the central drug squad.  In addition to the central drug squad, full-time drug units operate in Santry, Cabra, Raheny, Dún Laoghaire, Crumlin, Ballyfermot, Tallaght, Store Street, Pearse Street, Kevin Street and Donnybrook; outside Dublin, there are full-time drug units in Cork, Galway and Limerick.  While the strengths of individual units naturally fluctuates, I can assure Senators that we have never had more specialist garda committed to the fight against drugs.</P>
    <P>The Garda and the Customs and Excise service, supported when required by the Defence Forces, have had a number of very significant drug seizures. Indeed, as the Seanad will acknowledge, record amounts have been seized and the law enforcement agencies deserve the thanks of a grateful nation.  These seizures are not, of course, any reason for complacency.  There can be no doubt about the extent of the problem.  Nevertheless, the seizures show we can hit the traffickers and we must continue to do so.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of interagency co-operation, I should mention that the Department of Justice has finalised a detailed and comprehensive report on important aspects of law enforcement in relation to the drug problem here.  It will form the basis of a comprehensive and far-reaching set of proposals to be brought before Government shortly. The main task of the report was to identify the best arrangements for achieving <Col N="168" /> a cohesive and co-ordinated response to the drug trafficking problem by the existing law enforcement agencies and the proposals will mainly be concerned with this aspect.</P>
    <P>However, the report also examined the legal powers of members of the law enforcement agencies and the need for legislative changes to assist the law enforcement response.  The contribution in the health and education areas in developing strategies to reduce demand for drugs is also considered and the proposals that will be brought to Government shortly will cover all these aspects.</P>
    <P>We are not in a position, for obvious reasons, to search every person and consignment that comes into the State. Effective intelligence-based strategies are crucial in combating the importation of drugs; and in this regard the European Drugs Unit, which was established in the context of the relaxation of frontier controls within the EU, plays a major role.  The unit, which became operational in 1994, is charged with the essential mission of exchanging and coordinating drugs intelligence throughout the EU.  A liaison officer from the Garda Síochána is serving with the unit.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of comment about those who organise the importation and distribution of drugs without ever coming into contact with the drugs they trade in &mdash; the so-called &ldquo;drugs barons&rdquo;.  It is suggested they are in some way beyond the reach of the law.  Let me state here and now that we are determined to get at those who direct things behind the scenes.  In this regard, the Criminal Justice Act, 1994 provides for the seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of crime, including drug trafficking.  Part II of the 1994 Act confers power on a court to make a confiscation order on the application of the Director of Public Prosecutions against a person who has been convicted of a drug trafficking offence.  For that purpose, &ldquo;drug trafficking&rdquo; is defined in the broadest terms, including importing <Col N="169" /> drugs into the State and laundering the proceeds of trafficking.  Where a court determines the offender has benefited from drug trafficking, it can make a confiscation order for the amount of the benefit he or she has received from all drug trafficking and not merely from the specific offence in respect of which he or she has been convicted.</P>
    <P>Another feature of the Act is that it provides that a court is required to assume that all property in the hands of an offender at the time of conviction and all income or other assets received by him or her in the previous six years were part of the proceeds of drug trafficking. It is up to the defendant to prove to the court that particular assets including money or property were not, in fact, derived from trafficking.  Where a court is satisfied that proceeds of drug trafficking arose prior to six years before the conviction, these can, of course, be confiscated.</P>
    <P>A further provision of the 1994 Act empowers the High Court to make restraint orders freezing assets, including money that may be liable to realisation if a confiscation order is made at a later stage.  The effect of a restraint order is to prohibit any person from dealing with the property to which the order applies.  Applications for these orders are made by the DPP.  They can be made without the need to give notice to the party against whom an order is sought.  In addition, with effect from 2 May 1995, a number of provisions in the 1994 Act require banks and other financial bodies to take certain measures &mdash; for example, the identification of customers and reporting of suspicious transactions &mdash; which will make it more difficult for drug traffickers to launder their ill-gotten gains.</P>
    <P>The House is aware of the level of drug abuse in Mountjoy Prison.  It is difficult to make categorical statements about its true extent because drug taking is a covert activity.  What cannot be denied is that, in common with the <Col N="170" /> experience in other jurisdictions, drug abuse by prison inmates is a problem of serious proportions.  Finding the solution to this problem is far from easy. Considerable ingenuity is employed by offenders inside and outside prison to ensure that supplies to those in custody are maintained.</P>
    <P>Prison management strategies must pass the tests of practicality and acceptability in human rights terms. Many such strategies are employed with success.  I can inform the House that three specific new options are under active consideration for the management of drug dependent offenders in prison.  They are continuance on methadone maintenance for offenders who come into prison while already on a maintenance programme; the creation of a detoxification facility; and the establishment of a secure drug free unit.</P>
    <P>In relation to the use of methodone, one must be aware that where it is mixed with even small quantities of other drugs and where it is used in an open environment in prison, it can be extremely dangerous.  In fact, it can pose a threat to the lives of prisoners.  We also must also bear in mind that to successfully limit drugs in prison it might be necessary to ban all physical contact between prisoners and their visitors, including their children.  That is a serious restriction which may have serious implications for prisons.  The Minister has taken a number of initiatives in recent months to prevent as far as possible the smuggling of drugs into prison.</P>
    <P>This Government is committed to achieving 2 per cent real growth in gross current supply services expenditure in 1996.  Therefore, as the House is aware, the Government is reviewing the 1996 budget proposals.  This review extends to all Ministers, including the Minister for Justice.  In order to ensure a strategic approach to the allocation of available resources, all existing policies and expenditure will be examined with the <Col N="171" /> aim of maximising benefits within the Government's spending target for 1996. In that context the Government found it necessary to defer the Castlerea prison project and the women's prison project at Mountjoy beyond 1996.</P>
    <P>The extent to which both the Castlerea and women's prison projects will be deferred will depend on a full assessment of need against the background of an ongoing evaluation of the contribution which might be expected by, for example, making greater use of custody alternatives, by developments in the peace process, etc.  It is reasonable for the Government to take stock at this point so as to be satisfied beyond doubt that there are no better ways of achieving results in offender management terms without incurring sizeable capital and ongoing current charges on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>In relation to the women's prison, I want to see proper facilities for women prisoners and I am aware the current facilities are lacking.  However, we now have an opportunity to look at alternatives for women prisoners who have not traditionally formed a large part of the prison population.</P>
    <P>This Government is committed to policies that will ensure the level of crime in our towns and cities is reduced. An indication of the Government's commitment to tackling crime in all its form is that in excess of £589 million has been allocated to the general Justice area in this year's Estimates.</P>
    <P>Parents, teachers, the Churches and voluntary groups all have a role to play in reducing the incidence of crime. While crime cuts across all classes, it can be said to be particularly prevalent among unemployed youth in disadvantaged urban areas.  The Government supports and is funding many community projects, such as GRAFT in north Clondalkin, part of my constituency; the KEY project in Killinarden, west Tallaght; in Moyross in Limerick; <Col N="172" /> in the Knocknaheeny-Hollyhill area of Cork city; and more recently the Working to Enhance Blanchardstown project, also in my constituency of Dublin West.</P>
    <P>I am also confident that the extensive probation supervision scheme can be extended.  Under this scheme offenders are challenged to confront their offending behaviour, examine its causes and consequences not just for themselves but also for the victims of their crimes and to adopt a more constructive lifestyle. The success rate, measured by the numbers who remain out of crime and by the attendance and level of commitment to the programme, is approximately 75 per cent.</P>
    <P>I am fully committed to the requisition and renovation of premises for use as probation centres.  I am also fully committed to the development of a system by which certain offenders at an appropriate stage of their sentence may be released back into the community under the supervision of the probation and welfare service for the balance of their sentences.  The objective is to increase the number of offenders on supervised temporary release.</P>
    <P>In summary, there are other ways of dealing with offenders: first, by assessing whether by following a more broadly-based approach to the problem of crime we can reduce the incidence of offending; and second, by dealing more imaginatively, effectively and less expensively with those who do offend. It is right that we look at the available alternatives before we ask the taxpayers to foot the bill for the most obvious, although not necessarily the most effective, solution.</P>
    <P>In that respect, the number of people imprisoned annually for fines is a relatively small proportion of the total prison population.  I hope the day will come when no one is in jail for fines and there will be alternatives such as attachment of earnings, payment by instalment and other mechanisms by which fines can be paid.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="173" /> I have one political point crucial to this debate.  Senator Ormonde strongly attacked the Government, but I have a question for the leadership of both Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. I understand the frustration and disappointment felt by people in Castlerea and I say the following not to score a point but to tease out this issue. I listened in the last few months to the most stringent and eloquent attacks by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats on Government spending.  Those parties called for substantial cutbacks in the 1996 Estimates.  One of the consequences of those demands, and properly so, is that all Government expenditure is being reviewed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>In this regard the argument must be connected in a rounded way.  If one calls for savage cutbacks in public expenditure, one cannot isolate the areas which ought to be exempt at the expense of others.  If one makes the argument to control public expenditure, as their spokespersons and leadership have done on many occasions in recent months, one must also take some of the responsibility for the consequent decision on Castlerea.</P>
      <P>The Government is attempting to exercise a degree of fiscal prudence. The deferral of the Castlerea project is obviously a disappointment to local people, but the call for those cutbacks came most strenuously from the leadership of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion and condemn the Government for the deferral of and withdrawal of funds for the prison in Castlerea.  I do not condemn <Col N="174" /> the decision because Castlerea is affected but because we need an extra prison and more cells.  Crime is rampant throughout our cities, towns and villages.</P>
      <P>I almost laughed when I heard speakers from the other side of the House suggest we could rehabilitate prisoners by putting them to work, cutting briars on the side of the road and opening gullies. I agree, but is that what those speakers would do with the person who attacked a tourist in Galway recently who needed 15 stitches?  That was a malicious attempt to maim that lady.  Do those Members suggest the sentence the courts should impose for that attack is to send the convicted person to a boreen to cut briars?  What about the 75 year old woman in Dublin who was raped, beaten and left?  Is that the sentence those speakers recommend for the perpetrator of that crime?</P>
      <P>I agree with much of what the Minister said.  We should not need prisons and she is right to say they indicate a failure in our society.  We have gone soft over the years and have not meted out the proper punishment to those perpetrating these crimes.  Some of the people who spoke should know better.  Senator Gallagher is involved in the law.  If we followed her proposals, no prisons would be needed.  I agree the day should come when that will be the case.  I also agree with Senator Neville that prisons should not be required.  However, terrible crimes are being committed. Whether we like it or not, the people committing these crimes have to be put away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Enright was right when he said we are going soft.  Prisoners can make more demands than those of us who never committed a crime.  In prison they can demand a right to silence and they can go to the European Court of Human Rights or the European Court of Justice.  Although the authorities know they are guilty they cannot prove <Col N="175" /> it.  They may be let off scot-free, back into society to commit crimes again.</P>
    <P>We need prisons; in particular we need a prison in Castlerea and we need it soon.  We are legislators and we pass many Bills.  The Minister of State has been in this House many times. Towards the end of each Bill come the sentences for associated offences. About half of the legislation that passes through this House include sections outlining offences and punishments.  If we taking a soft line there is no need to include jail sentences.  We can include punishments, such as sending the offender out to cut briars in Dingle for two months or picking stones for a farmer in a meadow.  Are we to put this in legislation?  It is laughable.</P>
    <P>I regret the Government's decision.  I do not want to attack the Government for cheap political reasons.  It is my honest view this is a mistake.  We have to think of the west and the pleas made by the bishops.  Senator Mullooly and I agreed with them when the statement was issued asking why the DART extension to Greystones was not cut back. Why was something in Dublin not cut back?  A great amount is spent in the city compared to the country.</P>
    <P>The people in the country are worse off in the country than the people in the city.  We in the country pay for everything, as Senator Neville and others here would know.  If we want to go outside at night we have to use our own lights; if we want footpaths we have to put them down ourselves.  People in the cities and towns can walk out their doors and they have footpaths and lights provided at the taxpayers' expense. People in rural areas protest that all Governments have not looked after them.  This is a typical example.</P>
    <P>I thought it was a great decision to build the prison in Castlerea.  Some people might say it was being done because the Taoiseach came from that area.  However, it was an ideal plan <Col N="176" /> which distributed money in the country and addressed a problem which had to be tackled.  I ask the Minister of State to do her best to shorten the deferral of this project.  The Minister said the project would be considered for 1996 but she had some doubts about it, in other words, the Government doubts it could happen in 1996.  I would say go ahead with it now.  The Government should change its mind.</P>
    <P>I agreed with the Minister when she said society has failed because we must have prisons, yet we need them.  I agree with Senator Neville that many people who have committed minor offences should be given community work sentences. However, with the nature of crime being committed nowadays we have to get hard before we get soft.  The punishment must fit the crime.</P>
    <P>Senator Mullooly and I do not wish to be political this evening.  A genuine case was made by two Senators from Roscommon.  Perhaps the Leas-Chathaoirleach may have an opportunity to speak on the subject.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of crime and prisons is broad ranging.  There is no doubt it is not a problem that has arisen only in the last five or six months: the increase in crime has been taking place for quite some time.  Crime related to drugs has escalated at a great rate across the western world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister said, a lot of credit must be given to the Garda and the Army for their excellent record in detecting the importation of drugs.  In many cases the offenders are not originally from this jurisdiction.  We have to realise there is an international escalation <Col N="177" /> of the drugs problem and every nation will have to face up to it.  I congratulate the Garda and the Army for their efforts on this front.</P>
    <P>A lot of crime is drug related.  Deprivation was the reason given for crime in the past, but it is now drug related.  In the next few years major decisions will have to be made with regard to the safety of property and the person.  A culture is emerging that crime is all right and that the judicial system has only a limited ability to deal with it.  I welcome the fact that the Government will be taking an overall look at offenders and how they pay the penalty.</P>
    <P>It is amazing that the taxpayer pays for certain conditions in our prison system and that the offender does not pay anything back to society or to the victim. The offender only pays back the time spent in prison.  That is the present system.  Is it fair that taxpayers have to pay for such a system?  I say it is not. The offenders should repay their debt to society for their offence in some fashion other than being kept in prison indefinitely by the taxpayer.  I agree that there are people who have to be locked up for various reasons and cannot be let out because they can pose a physical danger to somebody else.  On the other hand, the idea that everybody has to be locked up is not the answer.  No society can afford it; nor should it be asked to afford it in the long term.  I welcome that particular aspect.</P>
    <P>I attended two meetings last week with the action committee from Castlerea, who came up to Dublin and met the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, and the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen.  I do not have to repeat what has already been said here today on the impact, shock and disappointment that this decision has led to in Castlerea and in the outlying areas. There was certainly a welcome for investment by the State in Castlerea. People had already made personal plans to move down there, buy houses, etc. <Col N="178" /> The business people in the area, suppliers, etc. were extremely disappointed. It is in that environment that I, as a politician in the constituency, am most aware of the problem.  These things were pointed out by the action committee to both Ministers and especially to the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>As has been said, the present Minister for Justice was totally committed to this project.  The decision to go ahead with this project in Castlerea was taken two years ago.  Nobody can deny that the peace initiative has created extra prison places.  I cannot number them now, but the Minister did point out that there could be at least 100 extra places because people have been released before their time.  That is one aspect of it.  I also feel that the action committee are totally justified in expressing their disappointment and concern as regards the lack of further investment in the project.  There is not alone the cost of the wall, which was in the region of £1.5 million, but also the aspect of over £3 million from the health board.  Again, if we want to be accurate and fair, a lot of that money has been spent for good reasons.</P>
    <P>The tendency in health care has been towards smaller institutions and to sending patients back out into the community in private houses or in smaller buildings.  That particular pattern was happening across the country, and rightly so.  To say that that particular money has been squandered is not true. I listened to the Minister for Justice with the action committee.  She outlined the present situation, which she will be reviewing.  I support her in what she told the action committee at the meeting the other day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Mullooly for sharing his time with me.  I welcome the Minister to the House.  I missed the beginning of her speech but I got most of it.  I accept what the Minister has said: that, in order to achieve a 2 per cent real growth in current supply services expenditure in 1996, the Government is reviewing the 1996 budget.  As part of that review, the Minister for Justice had to be included and, in that context, the Government found it necessary to defer the Castlerea prison project and the women's prison project at Mountjoy Prison.</P>
      <P>My concern in all of this is that I cannot understand on what basis the decision was made in the first place and then how, after engaging in substantial expenditure, it was decided to defer these proposals indefinitely.  We have had many debates in this House on crime and all of us were of the opinion that we need extra prison space, because as things stand at the moment, the prison system only works by releasing convicted prisoners prematurely from prison to make room to remand an accused person in custody.  In effect, we have a crazy system where guilty people are released in order to make room for people who are still on remand.  There are new facilities provided in Wheat-field Prison and we were expecting this new prison in Castlerea.  I do not know on what basis the decision was made initially and I then find it hard to understand how the decision was reversed so quickly after substantial amounts of money had been spent.  We need a modern prison to replace Mountjoy Prison. We have a huge number of young people in our prisons who should not be in places like Mountjoy at all.  I accept that whatever we do is going to cost money and that is acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Providing prisons is a costly service &mdash; it is estimated that it costs almost <Col N="180" /> £40,000 a year to keep a person in prison. This is a huge amount of money, particularly when we ask, as Senator Belton said, what we get out of it.  All we do is keep people out of society for a certain period and then we send them back into society no better than they were when they first went into prison. They get very little education or counselling &mdash; few rehabilitative measures are carried out in prison.  Many of our prisoners are coming out and going back in again and again.  When I was a member of the Council for the Status of Women we visited Mountjoy Prison. There are few women prisoners.  Out of the total 2,000 prisoners, only 35 are women.  Again, the people in charge there will tell that the same women are coming in again and again and they have experience of children of women they have known now coming in.  The prospect is bad if that is going to continue.</P>
    <P>We should be looking at how we can keep people out of prison, rehabilitate them, and remove drug addicts from the prisons.  A huge percentage of our prison population are drug addicts and I wonder what we are doing about it.  We do not even carry out urine and blood tests to see if prison inmates are on drugs.  This could be done to prevent them from getting remission of their sentences if they were found to be continuing their habit while in prison.</P>

      <P>I had a lot to say but I obviously do not have the time &mdash; I am sorry about that.  I accept that there must be some cutbacks.  It is a question of prioritising and using the large sums of money that we spend on our prisons in the best possible way to ensure that we do not have people going back in again.  I also want to question the basis on which the decisions to build at <Col N="181" /> Castlerea and then abandon it were taken.</P>

      <P>When I rose to propose the motion, I said that I did not intend to engage in any political point scoring and I did not.  I endeavoured to put forward all the arguments as to why I felt that the Castlerea prison project should proceed.  It is now obvious from what the Minister said in her contribution that this project has been deferred indefinitely and, more than likely, has been abandoned permanently.  If it is the case that the Government have decided to abandon the project completely, then the people of Castlerea should be told that that is the situation. As the Leas-Chathaoirleach knows, this is an enormous blow to Castlerea and the west of Ireland.  The people of Castlerea and that region will not take this decision lying down.</P>
      <P>Today, the Shell Oil Company, one of the biggest multinationals in the world, understands the meaning of people power.  I assure the Government that if this decision is not reversed, it will also understand the meaning of people power.  I have to ask why the people of Castlerea, County Roscommon, and the west of Ireland should have to engage in protests, marches, public meetings, organising petitions, rallies and so on when the only sensible decision is to proceed with the provision of this prison. The campaign which is being planned in support of this project will pull no punches.  I have never seen such anger and bitter disappointment as there is in the Castlerea area and the west of Ireland because of this decision.</P>

    <P>People made investments on the basis of this project going ahead.  Prison officers and their families moved into the area and invested in property.  This time last year the town of Castlerea had a psychiatric hospital, two hotels and the promise of a prison.  Today, 12 months later, Castlerea has no psychiatric <Col N="182" /> hospital, one hotel, because the Western Health Board has acquired the other hotel, and no prison.  It has a wall which cost almost £2 million of public money and is being described as the largest handball alley in the world. Where is the commitment of this Government to the development of the west of Ireland?  I cannot understand that the Government would not have considered the impact this decision would have, not only on the economy of the west but on morale generally in that region.</P>

      <P>It is regrettable that my time is up.  On page nine of the <i>Roscommon Herald</i> of Friday, 16 June, the interesting views of a number of elected members of the Government party are set out in detail in an article dealing with the views and reactions of people in County Roscommon to the decision not to proceed with this project.  I accept your ruling, Sir, that I do not have time to put them on the record of the House this evening, but I intend to do so at some time in the future.</P>
