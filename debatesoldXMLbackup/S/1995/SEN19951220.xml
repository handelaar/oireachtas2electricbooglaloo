      <P>I have received notice from Senator O'Sullivan that, on the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to reassess the means testing for disabled person's maintenance allowance payments, particularly where the spouse or partner is employed on a community employment scheme.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Rory Kiely on the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht to provide funding by way of a reasonable grant to Shoestring Theatre and Arts Club, Charleville, County Cork.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Sherlock on the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to introduce a home improvement grant and water installation grant.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Neville on the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1778" /> The need for the Minister for Social Welfare to change the eligibility for payment of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance to non regular dockers in Foynes Harbour, County Limerick.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator O'Sullivan, and Senator Kiely, matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Before announcing the Order of Business, I welcome back our colleagues, Senator Magner and Senator Bohan, who have returned from the Russian elections.  It is an indication of the growing interdependence of democracies that people from our Parliament were present to help ensure that democratic standards were maintained in the Russian elections.  We should be very pleased that our colleagues made the sacrifice to do this work.</P>
      <P>This is the last sitting day of the year and, on behalf of the House, I thank the staff of the House for their work during the past year.  It has probably been the most difficult year, certainly of recent years, for the Seanad.  We lost two of our most beloved Members during the past year, which was a major shock.</P>
      <P>It has also been a year in which the Seanad has done a great deal of very good and useful work, and has been in the forefront of a number of major debates.  I pay tribute to the staff of the House, the secretariat, the reporting staff and the press.  Even if we do not always get the coverage we believe is our due, this is certainly not the fault of the people who cover this House on a regular basis; we are all very grateful for their accuracy and the fairness with which they cover events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also thank the ushers and those who make the working of this House possible. In particular, I thank the Opposition <Col N="1779" /> parties for the co-operation which has characterised everything they did during the year.  We have had our difficulties and disagreements, as is natural in politics, nonetheless there has been a good spirit of co-operation and generosity for which I am extremely grateful. On behalf of the House, I wish all staff and Members a very happy Christmas and I look forward to seeing people back here early in the New Year.</P>
    <P>I may have exhausted all the good wishes by the time I have finished detailing today's Order of Business which is items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. Item 1 will be taken without debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will we have midnight mass here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>We will take Report and Final Stages of item 2 which should not take too long because there is a wide measure of agreement.  Item 3 is a small technical measure of which we will take all stages.  There will be a sos then until 2 p.m. at which time we will take the Appropriation Bill.  In accordance with established practice there will be one speaker per group with 20 minutes each.  The Appropriation Bill must pass all stages today and there will be a debate on the Bill very early in the next session.  I will try to organise it to coincide with the budget in the other House so there is a twin-track approach to financial and budgetary matters in the next session.</P>
      <P>Item 5 is a motion for earlier signature. We will take the Committee and Final Stages of item 6 which could take some time.  Item 7 is the Committee and Final Stages of the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which should not take too long and item 8 is a motion for earlier signature.  If the morning's business has not finished, I have made provision for it to slot in at the end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not repeat the Leader's remarks as he spoke on behalf of the House when he thanked all those mentioned.  With regard to the goodwill <Col N="1780" /> he accepted from this side of the House, as I said in private last night the House will know when the chief whip and the leader of Fianna Fáil come in different doors next year that we are all on a different footing.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Marine is at a meeting on EU fishery policy.  Will the Leader ensure that the Minister is aware of the support he has from the Seanad for his efforts to secure the very best deal for the fishing industry and those involved in it?  I will not go over last week's debate.  We realise the importance of those discussions and I ask that the Leader let the Minister, Deputy Barrett, know that we want him to secure the best deal and to resist, if at all possible, some of the proposals which will be to the detriment of the industry and lead to job losses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the thanks to you, a Chathaoirligh, the staff and everybody else.  I wish all Members a happy Christmas.  I do not have any particular problem with the Order of Business. There is an amount of material on it and it might be suggested that we have taken on too much.  It is regrettable that it has come so late.  Nevertheless, much of it is of a routine nature and will not take very long.  In the spirit of Christmas, we will accept the Order of Business as proposed.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, yesterday I felt it necessary to condemn a shooting in Belfast and there has been another within 24 hours.  It is important to condemn these shootings.  We thought we would never again have to do so in the House but for the second time in 24 hours I feel forced to comment on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party group, I thank the staff of the House, the reporting staff, the press, the ushers and others.  I wish everybody a happy Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join Senator Dardis in condemning the atrocities in the North of Ireland over the last two days.  As said on the radio this morning, it leaves ten children <Col N="1781" /> without a father and it is alarming to see this trend again.  If anybody can influence the situation and the people involved they should do whatever they can to halt this alarming spiral of violence in the North.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the spirit of Christmas, I congratulate the Labour and Democratic Left Ministers on all the goodies they got from Santa Claus in their Christmas stockings for Christmas and the New Year.  I especially congratulate the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, for the toy soldiers he got for his own private army which will enable him to fight all the battles he needs with the Government over the next 12 months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

      <P>On behalf of the Independents, I thank the staff of the House and other Members for all their help during the year and wish them a very happy Christmas.  The Independent Senators probably give the staff of the House <Col N="1782" /> more trouble than anyone else because we act as five individual parties.  We owe them a great debt of gratitude for all they did for us during the year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>When Senator O'Kennedy mentioned Christmas goodies, he reminded me of the many children who are disappointed at the decision of the manufacturers' of Rolo to reduce the number of sweets in a packet from 11 to ten.  What does the Leader intend to do about the missing Rolo?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate with the Minister for Health soon after Christmas?  I note that Senator O'Sullivan has asked for a debate on the Adjournment.  I want to give the reasons for my request briefly and without making a speech.  In the general hospital in Letterkenny there are 2,400 people on waiting lists for orthopaedic treatment which, the orthopaedic surgeon indicates, will take six years to clear.  Apparently the Minister for Finance did not know this when he criticised a former Taoiseach on Brian Farrell's television programme on Sunday evening and said that Charles Haughey forgot about the number of people on health waiting lists.</P>
      <P>The general hospital in Letterkenny has 2,400 people on a six year waiting list for orthopaedic treatment.  I am sure the House will support my request for a debate on the current situation because the Minister for Finance said we are paying up front.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask for a debate on the health services early in the New Year.  They are not being provided despite an undertaking that funding is provided for all expenditure.  There are many services&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Will the Leader of the House arrange an early debate and bring in the Minister for Health?</P>
      <P>I also ask the Leader of the House to send a strong signal to the Minister for the Marine indicating that to neglect the fisheries in Donegal and give 25 per cent over and above their share of the mackerel quota to the Norwegians will spell trouble.  I am not indicating the nature of that trouble but I know the attitude of the fishermen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>

      <P>Senator O'Kennedy's remarks might have much more credibility if he had made the same speech when Deputy Tony Gregory not only got all the presents but ran away with the reindeers and sleigh too.  I do not remember the Senator opening his mouth on that occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the kind remarks of the Leader about the monitoring of the elections in Russia, we did not teach the Russians anything.  Perhaps the Leader could arrange a debate in the new year because I found they were far more democratic in relation to the franchise than is the case in Ireland. One of the polling stations I monitored was in the foyer of a large general hospital.  There was a fixed station and <Col N="1784" /> a mobile box and there was a 90 per cent vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>One should not lose one's franchise because one is in hospital having one's appendix removed.  There is ongoing discussion about votes for emigrants and in the spirit of Christmas, as Senator O'Kennedy mentioned, this matter should be considered in the new year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support my colleagues, Senators Wright and McGowan, regarding the negotiations on fish quotas.  Will the Leader convey to the Minister the impact the proposed cuts will have on fishermen's incomes and people employed in the fish processing business? If the proposed cuts go ahead, fishermen will suffer severe losses of income but it will also mean the loss of permanent jobs in the fish processing business.  This could have a devastating impact on the entire fishing industry.</P>
      <P>The Leader is aware that the House of Commons last night rejected a motion on the common fisheries policy. However, the UK fishermen will be less seriously affected than Irish fishermen if the cuts proceed.  In view of the fact that the Spanish&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to cutbacks and quotas in the fisheries sector generally, <Col N="1785" /> the Leader is aware that from 1 January there is the further threat of the Spanish armada entering the Irish conservation box off the south west coast.  This will cripple the fishing industry.  People fear their constitutional right&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>

      <P>Following the comments yesterday of our distinguished colleague, Senator Ross, on the issue of corporate boxes, an informal <i>ad hoc</i> committee including Members from all sides met in the early hours of this morning.  The group suggests that the Cathaoirleach might wish to purchase a box in Croke Park for Senators.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Cathaoirleach is as perceptive as usual.  The group concluded that, following the Cathaoirleach's likely inability to purchase such a box, an all party approach could be made to Senator Ross to examine whether we could lease, hire or rent one <Col N="1786" /> of the <i>Sunday Independent</i> boxes in Croke Park.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>My question relates to the Green Paper on broadcasting.  Concern has been expressed in certain quarters about statements made by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht recently that he does not intend to issue a White Paper following widespread consultations.  As the Leader is aware, in recent months practically the world and his wife have sent submissions to the Minister about broadcasting.</P>
      <P>In addition, on the eve of Christmas, the Independent Radio and Television Commission has five applications within its grasp for a national radio licence and there is also the ongoing discussion on the establishment of TV3.  All these matters will reach a conclusion before the end of next year.  In that context, I ask the Leader to make time available as early as possible in the new year to discuss the implications for broadcasting in Ireland in light of the stated views of the Minister that there will not be a further opportunity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to consider a debate on accountancy bodies. As he is aware, the Institute of Chartered Accountants is the regulatory and disciplinary body with regard to accountants.  The existing practice is that many people who are not qualified accountants are putting themselves forward <Col N="1787" /> as accountants.  Some are doing a good job but others are not.</P>
      <P>At present, there is no statutory control in this area and I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on this matter at an early date.  The House could discuss it and formulate views which could be forwarded to the relevant Minister.  The debate could also cover the controls and regulations on bodies relating to solicitors, dentists and doctors, etc.  The Institute of Chartered Accountants is anxious that such controls should be established.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader make time available early in the new year for a debate on European Monetary Union?  The Leader is aware of the uncertainty as to whether Ireland will participate in the European Monetary <Col N="1788" /> Union if the UK does not participate.  It is important the House holds a general debate on the European Monetary Union, given the uncertainty which surrounds it and the question as to whether the UK views itself as a full and committed member of the EU.  This is particularly relevant given last night's vote in the House of Commons and the possible UK veto on aid for Irish Steel.  I ask the Leader to arrange a full debate on the European Monetary Union early in the new year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage Senator Fitzgerald agreed to withdraw his amendment seeking the deletion of section 13 (7) on the understanding that I would give further consideration to the bonding provision.  Senators will recall the Irish Ship Agents' Association was of the view that the bonding provision as provided for in section 13 (7) contravened the law of agency and may also be contrary to EU competition rules. Advice from the Attorney General's office was to the effect that there was no valid legal basis to the objections raised by the association.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding this, I undertook to reconsider the matter with a view to ensuring equity in relation to the provision, for example, that ship owners, masters and agents are treated in the same manner and, to limiting the bonding provision to cases where difficulties are being encountered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendments I propose &mdash; new subsections (7) and (8) &mdash; provide that where there is an unsatisfactory record, for example, where outstanding harbour dues are in arrears or where default in payment occurs, a company may require the owner, master of or the agent for a ship to give a bond or such other type of security as the company specifies, to the company for the payment of those charges.  The amendments also provide that the bond or security as the case may be which may be sought by a port <Col N="1795" /> company shall not exceed 25 per cent of the annual harbour charges imposed by a company on the owner or master of a ship or the agent for a ship &mdash; that is under subsection (7) (b) (i) and (7) (b) (ii).</P>
    <P>The amendments also provide that in the case of a ship calling to a port on a once off basis not operating through an agent, or where there is no record, a company may seek such security from the owner or master of the ship in question in relation to the payment of harbour dues as it deems necessary.  I again confirm the majority of agents &mdash; in excess of 90 per cent &mdash; pay their principal's charges in full and on time and the amendments as proposed will not penalise or place any burdens on them for so long as they continue to pay in full and on time.  The amendments protect the port companies in relation to late payments and defaulters.</P>
    <P>I also emphasise, in case there is any doubt in the matter, that the new subsections 7 and 8 are not making ships' agents liable for their principal's charges.  I draw particular attention to subsection (8) (a) (ii), under which where the owner has paid harbour charges to the agent and the agent is late in handing these over to the port company or defaults in paying them over, then in such circumstances and only in such circumstances the port company may seek a bond or security from the agent concerned.  The majority of ships' agents will therefore not be affected by the new provisions.  I commend the amendment to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister on the new subsection (8) (b) (ii) and I will not go back on my word.  I said on Committee Stage that people who are in default should have a bond. If a shipping company pays an agent money which he has not handed over to the harbour authority, that is a ridiculous situation and no one could condone it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1796" /> Subsection (8) (b) (i) concerns the first time a ship enters the harbour and states:</P>
    <P>has not entered the company's harbour on any previous occasion and the company does not regard it as likely that it will enter its harbour again in the period of 12 months commencing on the entry concerned.</P>
    <P>I have no reason to ask the Minister to change this but he must bear in mind that new business is always welcome in a port and, as the subparagraph relates to new business, one should be careful in this respect.  Does the Minister think a bond is needed in such a case, when a ship enters a harbour only once a year or perhaps once over a longer period? However, I agree with the rest of the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The new subsection (8) (b) (i) must be read with subsection (8) (b) (ii) because they go together.  This provides for a situation where a ship enters a harbour only once and an agent has not been engaged.  A port authority may then exercise its discretion to require a bond.  It is an enabling provision and does not place an obligation on the port authority to look for a bond on each occasion.  The authority may exercise its judgment as to whether a bond might be required.  This enabling provision covers once-off situations where an agent has not been engaged.</P>

      <P>Given the Minister's wide experience of this legislation he may be able to clarify the following point.  When Irish Shipping went into liquidation, some of its ships on the high seas made for the nearest port.  I had a personal interest because the <i>Irish Spruce</i> made for Marseilles, where my brother was living, and for the next six months the captain and crew had to stay within the harbour.  The ship was not allowed to leave and a document was placed on the mast of the ship because money was owed and the company had been placed in liquidation.  In the context of bonds under this amendment, if <Col N="1797" /> a company goes into liquidation and its ship is in port or makes for the nearest harbour, what happens when a bond is not entered into and the harbour master is faced with the ship needing to enter the harbour?  What are the financial consequences of that, if it is covered by this amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of provisions cover that.  The most effective is probably that whereby the port may take and sell the vessel in order to discharge whatever liabilities there are.</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 3:</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of these amendments is essentially to enshrine in the Bill a mechanism whereby the local lights dispute between New Ross Harbour Commissioners and Waterford Harbour Commissioners can be dealt with to the satisfaction of both parties. I will again briefly outline the background to this dispute.  Ships bound for New Ross Harbour must pass through the port of Waterford.  At present these vessels are charged lights dues at the same rates as ships proceeding to Waterford.  New Ross Harbour Commissioners claim the charges imposed are not related to the cost of providing the lights and are in their view excessive, making New Ross port uncompetitive. Waterford Harbour states, on the other hand, that the lights which New Ross bound ships avail of are sea lights and buoys and are consequently expensive to install and maintain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1798" /> Senators will recall that on Committee Stage I outlined details of efforts made to put an administrative arrangement in place to deal with this issue; those efforts were unsuccessful.  I also advised Senators that I supported both the principle that the user or shipper pays for facilities provided and the New Ross view that charges of this nature should be fair and equitable and that there should be full transparency in relation to them.</P>
    <P>The amendments now proposed provide that such charges shall be fair and equitable having regard to all the circumstances. They also provide that if the first mentioned harbour considers the charges so raised on ships proceeding to it are not fair and equitable, and in the absence of agreement on these matters with the company raising the charges, the matter shall if so required by either company be determined by an independent arbitrator nominated by the Minister.  These amendments fully meet the demands of New Ross Harbour Commissioners and details of the proposed amendments were outlined to Waterford Harbour Commissioners who have raised no objections in the matter.  I commend the amendments to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage I tabled an amendment but I was slow to move it because I felt this argument was between New Ross and Waterford. I am glad to say there is now agreement on both sides.  What will happen is that if New Ross is dissatisfied it can approach the Minister, who in turn will appoint an arbitrator.  He will act as a judge and whatever he deems right will be paid.</P>
      <P>Despite all the hassle and haggling of recent months, assuming New Ross and Waterford come to a prior agreement, for a certain charge over one year or a greater period, presumably this subsection will not come into play because there will be agreement.  Will the Minister clarify that?</P>

      <P>I too welcome the amendments.  Having discussed the position with the New Ross commissioners I am aware of their concerns in this regard.  It assists the matter in that the review group is looking into it also.  The amendments also strengthen the Bill regardless of the difficulties between New Ross and Waterford.  This general provision will apply to other ports which may in the future have differences, especially where ships travelling to a port must go through the jurisdiction of another port.  To cite the example of Foynes and Limerick, if a difficulty on charges arises in future this provision can be used.  I will be discussing hold ups through ports later as they do not relate to this amendment.  It strengthens the Bill and caters for any difficulties that may arise in future between ports.</P>

      <P>As I said on Second Stage, this is a matter of some concern. The Minister made a reasonable effort to sort it out to everybody's satisfaction and is to be commended for this amendment. It is reasonable that people responsible for the installation and maintenance of lights should be able to levy charges.  However, when there is a potential competitive element between the two, there is the potential for dissatisfaction on the part of one party.</P>
      <P>The end of this amendment states that &ldquo;either company may refer the matter&rdquo; by way of an appeals system. Did the Minister at any stage consider intervening without reference to either company referring the matter? Obviously, the dissatisfied party will come to the Minister but I envisage circumstances in which it might be desirable for him to intervene at an early stage.  I agree with Senator Neville. When a passage is shared, this does allow, not only in this circumstance but also in others where there might be potential for dispute, a procedure where that can be resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>My question refers to &ldquo;may refer&rdquo;.  In the event of a dispute, is it possible that the party in the <Col N="1800" /> ascendency &mdash; obviously there will always be an aggrieved party &mdash; could take a unilateral decision not to refer the matter and impose the charges anyway? Does the use of &ldquo;may&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in this amendment allow it to do this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a similar question. The Minister handled this matter constructively and achieved a positive outcome that was difficult to envisage when all the representations were being made.  Therefore, I have a lot of confidence in the Minister's judgment as to how the matter ought to be handled from now on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their kind remarks.  Senator Fitzgerald asked about the desirability of the ports concerned reaching agreement and I agree with him.  The ports concerned should endeavour to reach agreement before triggering the arbitration process which, as provided for in the amendment, is intended as a fall back position if agreement is not reached.  The two port companies should endeavour to reach agreement in the first instance.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis asked whether it is envisaged that the Minister would intervene. The whole thrust of this legislation is to take the Minister out of day to day matters in running the ports. There is a provision in the legislation where the Minister may make or issue policy guidelines.  It is possible a Minister might decide to issue policy guidelines on charging but that would be of a general nature.  It is not intended that the Minister would intervene or get involved in the detail of discussions between two ports.  The onus would be on the ports to reach agreement and if they failed to do this, the Minister would then appoint an arbitrator to decide the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Mooney asked what would happen if either port decided to impose charges and did not want it referred to arbitration.  The other port would, of course, be free to refer it to arbitration. The term &ldquo;may refer&rdquo; is governed by <Col N="1801" /> either company.  It does not require the agreement of both companies.  If one is dissatisfied, it may seek arbitration. That will obviously exercise its own discipline on both port companies.</P>

In other words, the normal position will be that the harbour master may attend at his discretion. This, of course, will be solely in an observer and-or advisory capacity and he may participate in discussion at board meetings at the discretion of the board.</P>
      <P>However, as I was at pains to point out on Committee Stage, there may be occasions where particularly sensitive issues may come up for discussion, such as for example, the assessment of the performance of senior staff, including the harbour master.  In such circumstances, the board must, as an exception to the normal practice, have the right to discuss these matters in the absence of the harbour master.  The amendment provides for this possibility in section 5 (b).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment strikes a fair balance between the view that a harbour master shall have an unrestricted right to attend all board meetings and the contrary <Col N="1803" /> view that such attendance should, in all circumstances, be subject to the total discretion of the board.</P>
    <P>I stress, however, that this qualification to the right of attendance would not allow a board to make a general decision to exclude the harbour master from all or particular parts of meetings, neither does it allow boards to generally prevent a harbour master from contributing to a discussion at a board meeting.  I am satisfied this amendment will allow harbour masters to attend meetings and contribute to discussions while at the same time ensuring the board retains overall control of the conduct of its business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for introducing this amendment. Like myself, Senator Neville also had talks with the harbour masters. They are a dedicated group of people. They not only run our ports and harbours during their normal working day, they are on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week and for that, we are deeply grateful.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister and his staff for giving us so much time and for bringing the matter to a successful conclusion. The harbour masters are satisfied with this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Senator Fitzgerald's view.  It would be ludicrous if the chief executive of any company could not attend board meetings.  I am glad the Minister has taken that principle on board and that the harbour master can now attend.  However, I am a little uncomfortable with section 5 (5) (b), which states: &ldquo;The directors of a company may, where they are of the opinion that the attendance by the harbour master at a particular meeting aforesaid or at a part of such a meeting would not be in the best interests of the proper and orderly conduct by them of the business at that meeting...&rdquo;.  They may ask the harbour master not to exercise his right to attend.  That gives a wide discretion to the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1804" /> I fully understand this if matters such as the harbour master's competence is being discussed.  In such cases, it would be appropriate that the person in question would be required to withdraw from the meeting.  However, that gives wide discretion to allow the company to decide to exclude the harbour master on what might be spurious grounds and I am not altogether comfortable with that part of the amendment.  I accept that being this specific is difficult to legislate for but I would not like it to be used as a device for exclusion and there is a possibility it could be used in that way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this amendment.  I thank the Minister for listening to all sides of the House on Second and Committee Stages on this issue.  Those of us who are on harbour boards, like Senator Fitzgerald and myself, are keenly aware of the need for this amendment and for the opportunity for harbour masters to be present at meetings.  As I said on Committee Stage, 99.9 per cent of issues discussed at any harbour board meeting concern the harbour master.</P>
      <P>Having looked at it in detail and having discussed it, I do not share Senator Dardis's worries.  If it was used as a device it could be challenged in court because it would very soon be seen to be going against the spirit of this section of the Bill, which is that the harbour master should attend practically all meetings except where there are issues which are sensitive to his own position or person.  Those are the only ones that he would be excluded from.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I have discussed it with the harbour masters who convey their thanks to the Minister of State, Deputy Gilmore, and to the Minister, Deputy Barrett, for listening to them and seeing to it that an acceptable amendment was inserted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this amendment which I look at from the point of view of good business practice. It seems to me very good business practice that the harbour master should not <Col N="1805" /> have the right to attend but normal business practice will be, as Senator Dardis said, that the harbour master will attend on every occasion.  I was impressed by the fact that the harbour masters are pleased with this and, as far as I can understand, they were not seeking the right to attend.  The harbour masters were certainly anxious to be able to attend but not as a statutory right.  It is good business practice.  Like Senator Neville, I do not have the concern that Senator Dardis has, although I can understand why he expressed it.  It does seem a rather cumbersome term to use. The Minister has listened to the concerns and has found a suitable way round them which is worthy of support.</P>

      <P>I also welcome the Bill.  If the harbour masters are happy with it then I have no problem.  I have a slight quibble, however, although it is purely a semantic point.  Given the general desire to have access to the harbour masters' advice and opinions, the phraseology &ldquo;if the directors, in their discretion, permit him or her to do so&rdquo; seems slightly grudging.  To some extent it seems to go against the grain.  Likewise, Senator Quinn referred to the phraseology in subsection (b), but I am happy with the substance so I will not linger unduly over that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also like to support the amendment.  It is only fair that the harbour masters' views should be known at meetings.  There is a clause in it whereby the directors can request the harbour master to leave if they think it is desirable.  I welcome the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Members for their generous remarks in relation to this amendment.  I will start with Senator Lee's point.  What we are doing here is slightly unusual in that we are making provision for an officer of the <Col N="1806" /> harbour company to attend meetings of that company and to be enabled to participate in the business of the company. As you will appreciate, the rules governing the participation of members of the harbour board &mdash; the actual directors &mdash; in harbour meetings are set down elsewhere. We have to write rules which provide for harbour masters to attend but do not confer on them rights over and above those of full directors of the board.</P>
      <P>I appreciate what Senators have said. The language used is phrased in a negative way but it is not intended to be in any way grudging or unnecessarily restrictive.  It is intended to ensure the board retains control of its business while at the same time harbour masters can participate.</P>
      <P>To clear up a point raised by Senator Kelly, the board of a company will, of course, have to take account of advice given by a harbour master whether at a board meeting or not.  There are a lot of provisions in this legislation which confer very important powers on the harbour master.  There are several sections of this Bill where the harbour master may act without reference to the board under specific powers given to him or her.  There are also provisions which require the board to take account of safety and navigational issues and environmental concerns which are matters under the harbour master's control. They will have to be taken account of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The harbour master is not actually the chief executive of the harbour company. There is a separate chief executive.  Subsection (b) is not designed to exclude.  It states, &ldquo;The directors of a company may, where they are of the opinion that the attendance by the harbour master at a particular meeting aforesaid or at a part of such a meeting...&rdquo;.  In other words, that exclusion relates solely to particular meetings or parts of meetings. It would not be open to a board to decide that they could exclude the harbour master from all the meetings from June to December or whenever.  It relates only to particular meetings and obviously there would have to be good <Col N="1807" /> reason.  I gave examples such as the fact that the harbour master's pay or performance might be up for discussion. The question of safety in the harbour, which might require a second opinion, might also be up for discussion.  There are a number of circumstances of that type and it is not possible to anticipate all of them in the legislation.  It is to provide for exceptional situations that the provision is included.  It is not intended, nor can it be used, as a means of generally excluding harbour masters from meetings.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Government amendment No. 6:</P>
    <P>In page 27, line 43, after &ldquo;examination&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;; such an examination and a report shall be completed by the said person within the period of 6 months from the date of his or her appointment&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators will recall that on Committee Stage I indicated I was happy to accept Senator Fitzgerald's suggestion that there should be a time limit for the carrying out of performance audits.  I sought time to reflect on whether it should be three months or longer.  The amendment now provides that the performance audits shall be completed within a period of six months from the date of the appointment of the suitably qualified person to perform the audit.  It is only reasonable that a period of six months should be allowed for performance audits at the bigger ports such as Cork and Dublin.  I commend the amendment to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I meant to raise this observation at an earlier stage.  Performance audits have become very fashionable and who can be against them in principle?  However, I wonder how this will operate in practice.  I agree with the time limit and have no problem with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1808" /> If one is going to get a suitably qualified person to carry out a performance audit it has to be somebody who has a comparative perspective on the performance of ports so that they can have some criteria by which to assess efficiency and cost effectiveness.  There cannot be some theoretical principle by which one could determine the efficiency and cost effectiveness of an individual port independently of circumstances elsewhere.  Is it appropriate to ask if the Minister has a concept in mind of how this is intended to operate or if it is just in there as an enabling clause at this stage?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first occasion that we have provided in legislation for performance audits.  We have also included a new provision in relation to the reportage of these companies through a confidential report from the chairperson of a company to the Minister. It will be an additional annual report to the normal one.  This Bill is providing two new measures &mdash; performance audits and the chairperson's report &mdash; for these semi-State companies which have not existed in previous legislation.</P>
      <P>I take the point Senator Lee made that obviously the performance audit will need to relate to some criteria or targets established for the companies. There is provision in the Bill &mdash; I believe it is in section 44, but I could be wrong &mdash; that targets and standards for each of the ports may be set by the Minister.  It will be against those targets that the performance audit would be evaluated.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(6)  The Minister shall appoint 3 members of a prescribed local authority or local authorities (each of whom has been nominated for the purposes of this subsection in the prescribed manner by a prescribed <Col N="1810" /> local authority or local authorities) to be each a director of a company.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage I indicated that I had no objection to amending section 36 to provide that the local authority directors shall be elected members of a local authority or local authorities.  However, I could not accept Senator Fitzgerald's amendment providing for this because it would have meant that only one local authority would be empowered to nominate the three local authority directors.</P>
      <P>I pointed out that in the case of the Galway port company, for example, it may be decided that of the three directors to be appointed, two should be nominated by Galway Corporation and one by Galway County Council.  Similarly, careful consideration will need to be given to the question of the appointment of local authority directors to the board of the Shannon Estuary port company where at present five separate local authorities have representation on the board of Limerick Harbour Commissioners.</P>
      <P>The amendment now proposed provides that the three local authority directors shall be elected members.  It also gives the necessary flexibility in relation to the appointment of local authority directors to the boards of such companies as Cork, Galway and the Shannon Estuary port companies.  I remind Senators that once the legislation is enacted, regulations prescribing the nominating local authorities and the manner in which such directors are to be selected will be made by the Minister for the Marine following consultation with the Minister for the Environment. Such regulations will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and either House will have the power to annul them within the next 21 sitting days.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very happy with the Minister's response.  I feared that people who were not elected members could become members of these boards, <Col N="1811" /> for example, a county secretary or a citizen.  Between us, the Minister and I have done a good job.  We must also take into account what was said in the review group's report.  The River Shannon is under the jurisdiction of Clare County Council, Kerry County Council and Limerick County Council.  I believe a member of Tipperary South Riding was on the old port authority there. However, I will allow Senator Rory Kiely and Senator Neville to sort that out.</P>
      <P>I am happy that county councillors will be appointed to these boards.  I said on two occasions in the House that the powers of county councillors have been eroded over the past ten years.  My party did not appoint elected members to the proper boards and we have continued to lose power.  As Senator Cregan said, elected representatives are the best members on boards or committees because they are constantly in touch with the people and they make excellent contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this amendment. It is important that the position of local public representatives is copper-fastened so that it cannot be eroded, as could have happened under the original wording of the Bill.  As Senator Fitzgerlad said, county councillors play a very important role in presenting the views of those they represent and they are accountable.  This amendment confirms that public representatives will be represented on the boards of these new semi-State companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this amendment which is a watershed.  I have been a Member of the House since 1987 and it is the first time legislation has been introduced which copperfastens the right of elected members of local authorities to be considered for appointment to boards.  All legislation which has come before both Houses in which local authority members or Members of this House have traditionally had a role to <Col N="1812" /> play at local or regional level has not only eroded that role but abolished it.</P>
      <P>I would like to know when this trend developed.  At what point in the early 1980s did the bureaucracy or, as the late John Healy called it, the permanent Government decide to put forward proposals of this nature to a Minister?  This has spread like a cancer through every Department so that all legislation to come before the Oireachtas contained a clause which debarred elected members of local authorities.  In a report published last year Professor Barrington indicated that there are 2,300 appointments in the gift of the Government of the day.  That is an astonishing figure compared to the 1,500 to 1,600 elected members of local and urban authorities.</P>
      <P>I have never doubted the credentials of this Minister, who is a member of a local authority, in his fight for local democracy.  I hope he can bring influence to bear on his colleagues in Government so that there is a strong and important role for elected members of local authorities on boards at local and regional levels, particularly on statutory boards.  I hope this legislation will be a precedent and will act as a bar against any other Minister bringing legislation to the House which specifically excludes local elected members from boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are witnessing a crisis in local democracy, such has been the growth of quangos over recent years.  The concept of a bottoms-up approach to involve and empower local communities evolved in Europe.  I enthusiastically welcome that growth, but it has been without any parallel acknowledgement of growth in the democratisation of local authorities.  We now have an imbalance in our society; there is greater power and a greater role for the voluntary non-elected sector than there is for the elected sector.  In 1998 we will once again face local elections.  Why should people today contest elections when all they have to do is be appointed to various non-elected boards which have real budgetary power and money? The local authorities have little money <Col N="1813" /> and its members find themselves fighting among each other over roads, footpaths and street lighting.</P>
    <P>This is another opportunity for my colleagues and I to put on the record how important legislation such as the Minister is introducing today is for the future of local democracy.  I wholeheartedly welcome it and I commend him for introducing it.  I hope it will act as a benchmark for future legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this amendment.  I spoke earlier about the need to have elected members of local authorities on the harbour boards.  The greatest example of the contribution elected members of local authorities can make to these boards is the success of Foynes, a nine member authority of whom six members are also members of local authorities.  Senator Neville, is a member, as is Councillor Kevin Sheehy who is in the Visitors' Gallery with Councillor Paddy Hourigan who replaced Deputy Michael Finucane, and Councillor Máirín Barrett, daughter-in-law of Councillor Jim Barrett, a former chairman.  They contributed to the success of Foynes and it is most important we have elected representatives on such bodies.</P>
      <P>It will be changed now, of course.  The membership of Limerick Harbour Board, which was 28 members, has been reduced to 12, whereas the Foynes Harbour Board membership has been increased to 12.  Only 25 per cent of Foynes Harbour Board are elected representatives of local authorities.  As the Minister pointed out, in Limerick five authorities are represented at present. What will happen in the future when only three will be represented?  Clare County Council, Kerry County Council, Limerick County Council, Limerick Corporation and Tipperary North Riding County Council are represented at present.  I welcome the amendment and compliment the Minister.  We all did a good job on this.</P>

      <P>I too welcome this amendment and thank the Minister for <Col N="1814" /> accepting the views of Senators from all sides.  It was very important to adopt this amendment because there is a strong relationship between the Seanad and the members of local authorities.  It is fitting that we should be seen to be looking after the people who elect us and make sure that members of local authorities are fully represented on our boards.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Mooney's comments. In County Limerick we know that a very capable individual who did not get elected to the county council is now in charge of more money and has more discretion at his disposal than any of us who were elected to the council.  It is galling that we are barred from sitting on any of the committees of that body. It appears that the attitude is that as we are elected, we are somehow lesser beings than those who stood for election and failed.  It does not make sense and does nothing for our standing as public representatives.  The concept of local democracy is very important.  We should avail of every opportunity to defend our rights as elected representatives, not selected representatives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>However, I strongly support the principle enunciated by Senator Mooney and supported by Senators Kiely and Kelly.  There has undoubtedly been a serious erosion of local government here, particularly since 1977 and the abolition of rates.  I do not want to pretend that local government was somehow ideal before 1977; it was not.  There were many weaknesses and some abuses but it seems to me that we have gone in entirely the wrong direction in effect trying to subvert the authority of local <Col N="1815" /> government, to reduce it with the result that there are now complaints about the calibre of some local representatives.</P>
      <P>The point made by the Senators is incontrovertible.  One cannot expect to have as many local representatives of the calibre one would wish if one does not allow them the exercise of responsibility in local affairs.  I do not see why people would put themselves out the way that our local representatives do if they have as little authority as at present.  For that reason, in terms of the direction in which it is going, I very much welcome the inclusion here of this measure and I hope it signals a change of attitude and mentality at central Government level about the role local government ought to play in our society.</P>

      <P>I welcome what the Minister is doing.  I will not repeat what Members said about the local authority aspect of it other than to say that I support them.  It is curious that it was a condition of membership of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation that the parties represented would have a democratic mandate.  At that level we are saying that people should have a democratic mandate, but when it comes to local level, the democratic mandate seems to disappear as a qualification.</P>
      <P>Senator Mooney has a concern which I will raise on his behalf as he did not have the opportunity to raise it when he was speaking.  It is that there will be situations, I can think of at least one, where five local authorities could be represented on a harbour board.  I assume that three members will be selected from the five.  How will the three be selected out of the five?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with and welcome the amendment.  Members of local authorities are very busy and concerned people.  I recall that some years ago in County Cork when the Cork-Swansea service was threatened, the fact that we had a member on the Cork harbour commissioners alerted everybody to that fact.  This resulted in the local authorities <Col N="1816" /> of Cork and Kerry coming together at the time to try to solve the problem.</P>
      <P>Perhaps it is outside the remit of the local authority, but emphasis should be placed on keeping such authorities informed. Openness and accountability are very much part of the local authority system.  The legislation is very important for harbour development and is very closely linked to the local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators will be aware that the Murphy review group did not recommend that there should be representation from local authorities on the boards of the harbour companies.  The report of that group was accepted by the Government, with one significant exception.  The Government decided that the boards of the new harbour companies should include representation from local government.  This decision was taken for two reasons.  First, an important link exists between the ports that serve an area and the local community, town and economy.  The Government felt it important that the legislation underpin that link.  The second reason is that it is Government policy to devolve as much power as possible to local government.  Under the legislation local port authorities will be established as semi-State companies and it makes sense that the right to nominate directors to the boards of those companies should rest, to some extent, with local government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When that decision was taken, it was intended that the directors appointed by the local authorities would be elected members of those authorities.  The Bill, as originally drafted, did allow for the option to be exercised that an appointee might not be an elected member but could be an officer of the local authority. I served on two local authorities for ten years and feel very strongly that there is no substitute for the elected mandate.  At present, many comments of a very derogatory nature are made in relation to the elected mandate held by <Col N="1817" /> public representatives at local and national level.  In a democracy, it is important to utilise every available opportunity to underline the primacy of the elected mandate.  If local government representatives are to be appointed to the boards of port companies, it is the Government's view that they should hold an elected mandate and are consequently accountable to the public as a result.</P>
    <P>The problem of five into three will not go to which Senator Dardis referred only arises in the case of the Shannon Estuary Port Company.  No decision has yet been taken in this regard.  The Ministers for the Marine and the Environment will have to engage in a process of consultation in relation to that issue. One of the factors which may help to resolve the problem is the added dimension that there are two ports in the general area to which appointments must be made.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 9 not moved.</P>
    <P>Government amendment No. 10:</P>
    <P>In page 28, after line 48, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(7) The Minister shall, in selecting one or more persons to be appointed as a director or directors of a company (not being a director or directors to whom a preceding provision of this section applies), consult with</P>
    <P>(a)  the Chamber of Commerce of Ireland (or any successor of it),</P>
    <P>(b) the Irish Business and Employers Confederation (or any successor of it), and</P>
    <P>(c)  such other persons as the Minister consider appropriate,</P>
    <P>and each of the said persons may, following such consultation, recommend to the Minister that a particular person or persons be appointed as such a <Col N="1818" /> director or directors and the Minister shall consider such a recommendation.&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I accepted an amendment in principle from Senator Fitzgerald on Committee Stage to the effect that the Minister, before appointing ministerial directors, should be statutorily required to consult with the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland.  However, I indicated that I would like to broaden the consultancy process to cater for situations, such as Foynes, where there are no chambers of commerce in existence and also to provide for consultations with other bodies such as IBEC and leisure and other interests where appropriate. The amendment meets these requirements and I commend it to the House.</P>
      <P>The term &ldquo;persons&rdquo; in the context of the amendment includes bodies or groups.  It would also be necessary to change the title of the section to &ldquo;Employee, Local Authority and Other Directors&rdquo;.  The parliamentary draftsman has advised me that this can be achieved in consultation with the Bills office.  Therefore, a specific amendment changing the title to the section is not necessary.</P>

      <P>I welcome the effort the Minister has made in this amendment. The legislation has moved a good distance from denying the chambers of commerce any representation on the boards of the new companies.  With the consultative role they will have, the chambers of commerce are reasonably happy they will have an input into the nomination of one person.</P>
      <P>On Foynes, the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland informed me that every trader who uses the Shannon Estuary and Foynes harbour are members of Limerick Chamber of Commerce. I am happy with the amendment.</P>

      <P>We shall have to stop congratulating the Minister because he will get a swelled head.  However, he is to be congratulated on this amendment. <Col N="1819" /> It is very important that the business communities in harbour areas should be represented, particularly in view of section 30 (1) (a) which states: &ldquo;The Minister shall as respects a company, the employees of which are more than 50 in number, appoint to be each a director of the company 2 employees....&rdquo;. In that context, it is essential that the business community be represented particularly, as Senator Fitzgerald stated, where they are users of the port.</P>
      <P>When this issue was discussed on Committee Stage, the Minister made the point that not all ports were represented by chambers of commerce. From that point of view, it is reasonable that IBEC be included in the amendment. The Minister should request the Minister for Finance to reconsider the situation whereby the chambers of commerce were not afforded the same opportunities under the county enterprise partnership boards &mdash; they are represented on many of them but not as of right &mdash; as they are under this Bill.  It is a very desirable development, and one for which the Minister should be commended.</P>

      <P>The Minister has responded to a number of concerns expressed.  He has covered the situation in relation to the chambers of commerce and IBEC.  Senator Dardis made the point that the users and customers of a port are the people who will ensure its success or failure.  I was pleased to note from the Minister's contribution that he includes the leisure industry as a user of our ports.  As a business, the leisure industry is of vital importance particularly in regard to tourism.  Concerns have been expressed that many ports did not regard the leisure industry as a customer in the past.  A tendency existed to believe that this industry was merely obstructing the important business of ports.  However, it seems that, in many cases, the leisure industry is a very important element of the business of ports.  The Minister responded in a satisfactory <Col N="1820" /> manner and I congratualte him for doing so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this amendment. I am glad it has developed to include IBEC, which has made a great contribution to development in this country and which would have strong views on the type of people who should operate on any board, including semi-State boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to throw a spanner in the works.  I will not welcome this enthusiastically not will I criticise it. Having already defended stoutly the right of elected members to be on boards, this raises again the perception of attitudes to elected members on which the Minister touched.  There is a widespread view in this country that county councillors do not have any business experience, do not know how to run a business or do not know what that entails.</P>
      <P>I know I am indulging in semantics here but encouraging and protecting the right of business organisations to be consulted gives the impression that, on the one hand, the Minister will appoint local authority members and, on the other, he will consult the business sector on further appointments, that the two are immutable and somehow one is isolated from the other.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt, and am sure all my colleagues will agree, that there will be a great deal of thought put into who should be appointed by the local authorities concerned to the harbour boards. I am not anticipating the decisions of local authorities in this regard but the chances are that these people will almost certainly have an interest in the harbours and will have the business acumen required to ensure the harbour authorities operate in a cost efficient and responsible manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is more a case of semantics than objections.  The one aspect of the Minister's amendment which I welcome the words &ldquo;such other persons as the Minister considers appropriate&rdquo;, which infers that the Minister is not totally <Col N="1821" /> bowled over by the fact that expertise reposes exclusively within the sanctums of the Chamber of Commerce of Ireland or, indeed, IBEC.  Individual members of both organisations have not always been the greatest supporters of local authorities or of elected local representatives.</P>
    <P>I do not want to open up a can of worms here; I am only sounding a sour note.  I do not wish to have my remarks misinterpreted.  What the Minister is doing here is right.  It is important that business organisations which must be viable, such as these semi-State bodies, should have business expertise on their boards.  There seems to be a perception that people elected to local authorities do not have business expertise.  Several people here who are members of local authorities come from a business background or are involved actively in business. That is the only point I want to make.</P>
    <P>I do not believe we should necessarily go down this road every time a board is being set up and that there must be this requirement to consult the business organisations in order to make an appointment.  Why not consult with elected members within the various parliamentary parties in Government?</P>

I feel sometimes that taking decisions, as in amendment No. 10, copperfastens this widespread perception particularly among these organisations.  Why do they not stand for election?  They would then have a far better chance of being involved in such boards.</P>

      <P>When the Bill was circulated I was a little surprised that it did not include chambers of commerce; I had representations from Cobh Chamber of Commerce.</P>
      <P>When enacting legislation, the most important thing is to respond as far as possible to submissions from such groups.  That is what really strengthens legislation.</P>
      <P>When I read the amendment I thought I would have been critical but it does say &ldquo;...a director or directors ...&rdquo; so the consultation process with the chambers of commerce, IBEC, etc., is not confined to just one director.  It could be one or more directors.</P>

      <P>Senator Quinn mentioned rightly the leisure industry.  I want to express the hope that he would consult, under &ldquo;other persons&rdquo;, ISME which represents small and middle sized businesses.  I know there are rows or there were rows between IBEC and ISME &mdash; I do not know if they are ongoing. The reason I mention this is quite specific.  I do not represent ISME and never had any discussion with them. One of the main problems in this country is getting our small firms to grow and since they will only grow by exporting, they must become involved in international trade.  Therefore, anything which induces them to go in that direction and which gives them a voice in foreign trade affairs is worth encouraging. I hope the Minister will keep in mind the possibility of consulting people who may have an interest in membership of these boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this legislation is to set up the 12 largest ports in the country as commercial semi-State bodies, to give them a commercial mandate and, essentially, to give those ports a new lease of life in relation to their management, their role and contribution to the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In doing that, the overriding consideration in appointing the boards of directors of the companies will be to select and appoint the best possible board of <Col N="1823" /> directors.  In the course of the discussion about how directors should be selected and who should be selected, I said here before and in the Dáil that it is the Government's intention that the people who are appointed will, in the main, have business and professional experience and expertise and will be able to bring that to bear on the work of the board.</P>
    <P>The requirements of each port will vary, as will the type of board appointed, who should be appointed to different boards, appointees' backgrounds and their necessary business experience.  It is prudent that there should be a formal consultative process to illicit the views of the interested organisations, such as the chambers of commerce.</P>
    <P>I do not want to get into this because trying to establish the jurisdictional area of respective chambers of commerce can be as tricky as establishing the jurisdiction of ports.  There may be different chambers of commerce or business organisations which have a particular interest in a port.  For example, there may a port which would have a large amount of agri-business and it may be prudent to consult bodies involved in agriculture or in agri-business generally. Similarly, some ports have a high profile in the leisure area.  For example, a port in my constituency, Dún Laoghaire, has a strong profile in the leisure area and it would be appropriate to consult leisure interests in appointing the board of a company like that.</P>
    <P>What we are providing for in the amendment is a process of formal consultation with named organisations with the option of other organisations being included.  In addition, it is open, of course, to any organisation or individual to make recommendations about who should be appointed to the boards of these companies.  Indeed, many organisations and individuals have already communicated their views as to who should be appointed to the boards of these companies so, while there is a consultative process formally built into the <Col N="1824" /> legislation, I do not envisage there being any great difficulty in practice establishing the views of interested parties on who should be on the boards of the companies.  I have no doubt that a wealth of talent will be recommended for appointment to the boards of these companies.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 14 is an alternative to amendment No. 13 and amendment No. 18 is related.  The three amendments will be discussed together.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 44, to delete lines 10 to 22, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(31) (a) The harbour master of a harbour may refuse entry into the harbour of a ship, vehicle or other conveyance that is carrying dangerous goods (within the meaning of the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code) which, in his or her opinion, would be likely to endanger persons or property.</P>
      <P>(b) None of the following, namely</P>
      <P>(i) a nuclear powered ship, vehicle or other conveyance,</P>
      <P>(ii) a ship, vehicle or other conveyance that is carrying one or more nuclear weapons,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(iii) a ship, vehicle or other conveyance that is carrying <Col N="1825" /> nuclear material (within the meaning of the Radiological Protection Act, 1991),</P>
    <P>shall enter a harbour.</P>
    <P>(c)  (i) The Minister may by order exempt a ship carrying nuclear material of a specified class or classes from the application of paragraph (b) (iii) and for so long as such an order is in force paragraph (b) shall be construed and have effect in accordance with the order.</P>
    <P>(ii)  The reference in this paragraph to an order in force shall, as respects such an order that is amended by an order in force under section 3 (4), be construed as a reference to the first-mentioned order as so amended.</P>
    <P>(d) If a ship, vehicle or other conveyance</P>
    <P>(i)  being a ship, vehicle or other conveyance that has been refused entry in to a harbour under paragraph (a), enters the harbour, or</P>
    <P>(ii) in contravention of paragraph (b) enters a harbour, the owner and master of the ship or the owner of the vehicle or conveyance or the person to whom the vehicle or conveyance is hired for the time being shall each be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>(e) In this subsection 'International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code' means the International Maritime Organisation and includes any amendments of that code for the time being adopted by that organisation.&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators will recall that on Committee Stage I indicated that I intended to split section 52 (1) (a) into two separate paragraphs: one empowering the harbour master to refuse <Col N="1826" /> entry into the harbour of dangerous goods as classified in the INDG code which in his or her opinion would be likely to endanger persons or property and one statutorily requiring the harbour master to refuse entry into the harbour of a ship or a vehicle or other conveyance that is powered by or carrying nuclear material.  Exemptions will have to be granted under this provision in respect of hospital materials and medical supplies which may have levels of radioactivity and materials which in the normal course of events have low background radiation levels.  These exemptions will be set out in a ministerial order to be made under the section and following consultation with the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland.  A ministerial order of this nature will have to be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas, either House having the power to annual it within the following 21 sitting days.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 13 provides for the foregoing in so far as the 12 new port companies are concerned.  As Senators are aware, a number of harbours may continue to operate under the Harbours Act, 1946 and with a view to ensuring that nuclear materials or nuclear powered ships are also prohibited from entering these harbours I am putting forward an additional amendment No. 18 to provide for this.  The latter amendment amends the Harbours Act, 1946, by the insertion of a new section, section 87 (a).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is Government policy that ships carrying nuclear materials should not enter into an Irish port.  Earlier this year I instructed Dublin port not to admit a vessel which was carrying nuclear materials bound for the Sellafield plant in Cumbria.  The new measure I am proposing in the Harbours Bill will make it illegal for vessels carrying nuclear materials or which are nuclear powered from entering any Irish port.  Harbour masters of the ports will be required to refuse entry to such ships.  Many local authorities throughout the country have already indicated their desire that the ports in their areas be nuclear free.  The <Col N="1827" /> effect of these amendments is to give the force of law to the nuclear free principle in the ports of this country.</P>
    <P>I am extremely concerned about the transportation of nuclear materials by sea.  Prohibiting such cargoes from entering Irish ports is one clear measure which will help protect our people from the risk of an accident involving a nuclear ship.  In addition to preventing nuclear ships from entering Irish ports, I have also taken a number of initiatives to seek a tightening of the international rules governing the shipment of nuclear materials.  Recently I secured agreement from the International Maritime Organisation to review the INF code which governs the shipment of nuclear materials.  In March next year a special meeting of the IMO will be held to address our concerns in this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am extremely happy with this amendment.  The Minister has gone further than I had envisaged.  I agree that all ports should be included. The only possible complaint I might have is that the fines and penalties are a little low because it would be a serious matter for somebody to contravene this measure.  A penalty of £1,500 is very little nowadays.  However, I am delighted with the amendment.</P>
      <P>My one regret is that neither the Minister nor I nor this House has received the credit we deserve for introducing this legislation.  It is probably the first legislation to ban nuclear power in this country.  If another party &mdash; a somewhat green party &mdash; had happened to open their mouths reams of paper would be written about it.  Last Sunday's newspapers had pages on nuclear power.  I am not looking for any haloes or bouquets but the Minister, his staff and this House should be given the credit they deserve for putting this amendment into the legislation.  I hope nobody in the other House will even dream of trying to undo what has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very happy that this provision will be law and I am delighted with how <Col N="1828" /> the Minister has handled the matter.  As I said earlier, I am proud of him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Minister's decision.  It is far reaching and has implications for the future.  We are heading towards having a total ban on all nuclear power throughout the country. We discussed this matter on Committee Stage so I will not delay the House now.  I congratulate the Minister on his historic decision.  The amendment in itself is important but it also puts us on an important policy course.  I look forward to similar approaches in future legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on his initiative in this regard.  I raised an aspect of this issue on Second Stage when I asked a question of the Minister.  I appreciate that he is not in a position to give a conclusive answer.  An American warship visited Dublin port some years ago and questions were raised about its nuclear status.  The American Government issued a statement at the time that its policy was never to comment on the nuclear status of its ships.  My question to the Minister is, in the context of the powers of the harbour master and of this welcome amendment, what steps in practical terms can the harbour master or the Government take to ascertain whether a visiting naval vessel is nuclear powered if the policy of the home Government is not to reveal such information?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a little like Dublin being declared a nuclear free zone &mdash; and it was in that context that the aforementioned controversy arose &mdash; in that it is a pious aspiration which certainly sends a signal from this country as to the views of our people on nuclear power.  For that reason I strongly welcome the amendment. I do not wish to give the impression that I would oppose the spirit or the letter of it.  However, in practical terms perhaps the Minister would outline how he sees harbour masters coping &mdash; I am thinking of harbours such as Dublin and Cork rather than the smaller harbours &mdash; if such a situation <Col N="1829" /> should arise, without creating an international incident or giving the impression that we do not welcome visiting navies to our shores.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms. Kelly Ms. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this amendment and congratulate the Minister on taking such a strong stance.  It has long been the policy of my party to have Ireland declared a nuclear free zone.  Will such ships be banned in future from Irish territorial waters?  It is important that these waters be nuclear free.  If they are not nuclear free, how would we cope if a ship experienced difficulty close to our shore?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the sentiments unanimously expressed by Senators in complimenting the Minister on this worthwhile initiative.  Senator Fitzgerald rightly pointed out that the £1,500 fine proposed for summary conviction would not be see as severe in today's circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is good and the Minister is to be commended for it.  I share Senator Kelly's view that it would be desirable to exclude nuclear vessels from our territorial waters and the Minister may be able to say how this might be done.  I assume the usual seafaring norms would apply when ships are in distress.</P>
      <P>The amendment says that the harbour master &ldquo;may&rdquo; refuse entry.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; causes problems all the time, not just with regard to this Bill but to many others.  It might be preferable to use the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; instead but I accept that the amendment, even with the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;, is a considerable improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Bill apply to ships from foreign navies or is this within the ambit of the Minister for Defence?  I share the view that fines are totally inadequate given the value of ships entering our harbours.  I am fascinated by the words &ldquo;vehicle or other conveyance&rdquo;.  I assume this applies to things which are part of the cargo of a ship.  I had visions of a nuclear powered bicycle coming up the Liffey.  I am relieved by the Minister's <Col N="1830" /> nod that I am correct in my assumption.</P>
    <P>I wonder how in practical terms we could exclude a ship which is determined to dock.  Would the harbour master go out in his launch and try to turn back the <i>USS Enterprise</i>?  This would be an unequal contest.  This is a more serious point than it might appear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has spoken strongly about taking action. The public are realising that there is serious intent with regard to this issue. Amendment No. 18 provides for the insertion of a new section after section 87 of the Harbour Act, 1946.  It is not possible to repeal this section of the 1946 Act?  How does that Act fit in with this Bill?  The inclusion of these amendments in the Bill is welcome and signifies the serious intent which is being put into effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this important amendment.  On Committee Stage Senator Mooney raised the issue of dangerous goods.  Senator Dardis made the important point that the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; should be changed to &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  It is important that a harbour master has power to refuse entry into a harbour of any vehicle carrying dangerous goods, within the meaning of the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code.  This applies to ships carrying nuclear and other dangerous material.  I ask the Minister to comment on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>We are amending the 1946 Act because the Bill establishes the larger ports as port companies but smaller harbours will continue to function under the 1946 Act.  To provide for the ban, it is necessary to amend not only the Bill but also the earlier Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each section of the 1946 Act provides for its own level of fines and penalties It was necessary to include in the section amending the Act a specific penalty. The £1,500 limit is purely for summary convictions.  We have no discretion in this matter.  In 1937 minor offences were defined as offences for <Col N="1831" /> which there are fines of not more than £100.  The updated value of this amount is £1,500.  If a case were to be taken under the Bill.  I envisage that it would be taken by way of indictment rather than summary conviction.  For convictions on indictment there are penalties of a £100,000 fine or two years in prison.</P>
    <P>The distinction between &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall&rdquo; was raised.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is used in paragraph (1) of the amendment because this refers to ordinary dangerous materials defined in the IMDG code.  The harbour master will be able to exercise judgment as to whether or not a particular dangerous material coming into a port is likely to endanger persons or property.  Discretion is provided for the harbour master with regard to this list of dangerous goods.</P>
    <P>In the case of nuclear materials and nuclear powered vessels there is no discretion.  It will be illegal for any ship carrying nuclear materials or which is nuclear powered to enter an Irish port and the harbour master will be required under the Bill to refuse entry to such ships.  In exercising their functions under this provision, harbour masters will have available to them the services and technical information of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland in cases where there is doubt.  The Bill provides considerable powers to harbour masters to enable them board ships and examine materials.</P>
    <P>The practice has been that naval vessels from other countries do not declare whether they are carrying nuclear materials or are powered by nuclear fuel.  That is claimed under what is called sovereign immunity where a country's naval or defence forces exercise an exemption from the normal rules which govern civil business.  That concept of sovereign immunity is being debated internationally.  We are making provision in the Dumping At Sea Bill which will come before this House shortly, to end sovereign immunity in this State.  We can use the moral authority that move gives us to seek to end <Col N="1832" /> the sovereign immunity concept internationally.</P>
    <P>Regarding the transportation of nuclear materials by sea &mdash; Senator Kelly asked what happens outside harbours &mdash; it is governed by the International Maritime Organisation code, which is known as the code.  It is our view that this code is weak.  We sought and got agreement some weeks ago at the International Maritime Organisation conference to amend the code. There will be a special meeting of the IMO in March to address the proposals this country put forward in that regard. We are seeking to have amended the rules governing the transportation of nuclear materials, including notice and the issues raised here about the possibilities of accidents.</P>
    <P>This country is giving the lead internationally in its efforts to change the rules governing the transportation of nuclear materials.  I have no doubt the steps we are taking in our legislation to ban the entry to our ports of ships carrying nuclear materials or those powered by nuclear fuel will greatly strengthen the moral authority this country will have internationally in its efforts to tighten up transportation, which is extremely dangerous.  We spend much time talking about nuclear power stations which are located on land, but there are considerable dangers associated with the transportation of nuclear materials on the seas.  The potential for catastrophe if an accident, a collision or a terrorist incident should occur is considerable.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business it was agreed that there would be a sos at 1 o'clock.  As we are making good progress I do not think we should have an artificial shut down, as it were.  If this item needs to be continued after 1 <Col N="1833" /> o'clock I hope I will have the agreement of the House to conclude it.  Item 3 was meant to be taken before 1 o'clock. That is now postponed until the afternoon and I will have discussions with Senators Rory Kiely and Dardis about arranging a time later in the afternoon to discuss it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 72, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(7) On the commencement of this subsection there shall stand transferred to Kerry County Council the following harbours and piers at Tarbert and Salleen and the areas within both piers including the Tarbert Island jetty, Tarbert Ferry Terminal and Tarbert Gantry.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister could explain the situation as regards transfers as they apply to harbours which will not be set up as semi-State bodies.  I am particularly interested in the development of Sligo harbour, a matter that was raised by Senator Reynolds on Second Stage but which the Minister did not respond to then.  A strong case has been made for the development of Sligo port and a good deal of money has been invested in it.  However, there is a huge geographical gap as regards the ports which will be created as semi-State bodies <Col N="1835" /> because most of them will be located south and east of Galway.  I am concerned about the absence of development at Sligo port, particularly in the light of the development of the Masonite timber plant in Carrick-on-Shannon. This will have an industrial and economic benefit not only for the immediate area but also for the north-west.  The company has plans to transport its materials by rail, therefore, it will want port access.  At present there is a strong lobby in the north-west to have the N16 road upgraded.  This will create greater access to the port of Larne and will have an inhibiting effect on the future development of Sligo harbour as a commercial entity.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not been given notice of any other matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the pier at Tarbert and the Tarbert ferry terminal are already in the ownership of Kerry County Council.  The Tarbert island jetty is owned by the ESB and is under the jurisdiction of Limerick Harbour Commissioners.  The Tarbert gantry is a Commissioners of Irish Lights buoy repair yard.  I further understand that Salleen pier is owned by the Commissioners of Public Works, although I have been unable to clarify this definitively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I draw the Senator's attention to section 91 which deals with the limits of harbours under the control or management of local authorities.  That section empowers the Minister after consultation with the local authority concerned to define the limits of a harbour which is under the control or management of a local authority.  As the pier at Tarbert is already in the ownership of Kerry County Council, section 91 could <Col N="1836" /> be invoked if at some stage Kerry County Council wished to have harbour limits defined for Tarbert.  In my view, the initiative in this regard would have to be taken by Kerry County Council in the first instance.  There would also have to be full consultations with Limerick Harbour Commissioners on the matter as the definition of limits for Tarbert would involve encroachment on an area over which Limerick Harbour Commissioners exercise jurisdiction at present.  The amendment is unnecessary and I ask for it to be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>As regards the point raised by Senator Mooney, the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Barrett, visited Sligo port last week.  There is a number of options open to ports which are not being set up as semi-State bodies under this legislation.  They can become semi-State bodies in the future, they can remain as they are under the 1946 Act or they can be transferred to the local authorities, with the agreement of the local authorities concerned.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 18: 18 has already been discussed with amendment No. 13.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In page 76, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) The following section is hereby inserted after section 87 of the Act of 1946:</P>
      <P>87 A. (1) The harbour master of a harbour may refuse entry into the harbour of a vessel, vehicle or other conveyance that is carrying dangerous goods (within the meaning of the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code) which, in his or her opinion, would be likely to endanger persons or property. (2) None of the following, namely</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1837" /> (a)  a nuclear powered vessel, vehicle or other conveyance,</P>
    <P>(b)  a vessel, vehicle or other conveyance that is carrying one or more nuclear weapons,</P>
    <P>(c)  a vessel, vehicle or other conveyance that is carrying nuclear material (within the meaning of the Radiological Protection Act, 1991), shall enter a harbour.</P>
    <P>(3)  (a)  The Minister may by order exempt a vessel carrying nuclear material of a specified class or classes from the application of subsection (2) (c) of this section and for so long as such an order is in force the said subsection (2) (c) shall be construed and have effect in accordance with the order.</P>
    <P>(b)  The Minister may by order amend or revoke an order under this subsection (including an order under this paragraph).</P>
    <P>(c)  The reference in this subsection to an order in force shall, as respects such an order that is amended by an order in force under paragraph (b) of this subsection, be construed as a reference to the first-mentioned order as so amended.</P>
    <P>(4)  If a vessel, vehicle or other conveyance</P>
    <P>(a)  being a vessel, vehicle or other conveyance that has been refused entry into a harbour under subsection (1) of this section, enters the harbour,</P>
    <P>(b)  in contravention of subsection (2) of this section, enters a harbour, the owner and master of the vessel or the owner of the vehicle or conveyance or the person to <Col N="1838" /> whom the vehicle or conveyance is hired for the time being shall each be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>(5)  A person guilty of an offence under this section shall be liable</P>
    <P>(a)  on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding £1,500 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both,</P>
    <P>(b)  on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding £100,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or both.</P>
    <P>(6)  In this section &ldquo;International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code&rdquo; means the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code adopted by the International Maritime Organisation and includes any amendments of that code for the time being adopted by that organisation.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister for the way he handled this Bill.  I thank and commend my team on this side of the House, Senators Fitzgerald, Daly, Mooney and Rory Kiely who played their part.  The Minister also played his part in responding to amendments that he and those advising him believed would make for a better Bill.  The number of amendments taken in the House is probably unique.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to section 88, I am sure the Minister would not wish to ruin a very good Bill by not dealing with the issues relating to an area dear to my heart.  I do not speak entirely politically, but as part of a family that has been part and parcel of the two areas of Skerries <Col N="1839" /> and Balbriggan for 100 years.  If fish was caught in those areas, my family bought it.  Indeed, today's local paper reports that all members of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour, Progressive Democrats, Green, The Workers' Party or Independent, supported a motion on this issue two weeks ago.</P>
    <P>The Minister advised me this morning that there was another role with regard to consultation and so on.  I hope that when requests are made by Fingal County Council, the Minister and his Department will meet those who have an interest in the area to ensure basic facilities.</P>
    <P>When I mentioned last week that some resources were being put into the area for the first time since 1972, the Minister rightly advised me that he was involved.  However, I ask him to understand that it is not enough for a port of the importance of Skerries to be satisfied with the removal of two wrecks at a cost of £20,000, or that the port considers this to be the fulfilment of an obligation.  The Minister and his Department will have an opportunity to put this right, and I hope that in the consultation process in the coming months, and before the two areas are handed over to Fingal County Council, the Minister will ensure that some of the basic needs of Skerries Harbour will be identified and looked after.</P>
    <P>The Minister has done a good day's work on this Bill.  I have no doubt that the industry, and the position of the harbours, will be improved following enactment of this legislation.  The Minister suggested, off the record this morning, the kind of process that will take place. I ask him to ensure that this process is given a chance so that section 88 is improved and that the two harbours in question will play their part in the promotion of the fishing industry in the area I represent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the passing of this Bill and congratulate the Minister. It is one of the most significant to have been put through the House this session. <Col N="1840" /> It is an exciting Bill in that it creates a new scene throughout the 12 harbours concerned and creates 12 new semi State organisations.</P>
      <P>I especially congratulate the Minister for taking on board the views of the House, on Second Stage and on Committee Stage.  The House has significantly improved the Bill.  It is important that Ministers listen to what we say, in this instance, the Minister listened carefully to what we said and took all the positive points on board.</P>
      <P>I raised problems on the issue of pilotage in Foynes and Limerick.  We must ensure there are no delays on ships coming through Foynes as it creates a non commercial situation.  Perhaps the Minister will also look at the involvement of Foynes and Limerick, if difficulties arise, in the review group similar to the one that has taken place in the Minister's office in Waterford.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister, and the senior Minister, for listening to the various organisations outside the House that lobbied him over a number of months. The Government, the Ministers and their officials listened to the views of people, as we did.  We were lobbied very strongly on this Bill and we were happy to listen.  It is good for democracy that we are advised and spoken to by those who have expertise in this area.  It improved the Bill.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister, Noreen O'Mahony and her staff for their work on the Bill for probably a number of years, certainly months and especially over the last number of weeks while it was going through the Dáil and the Seanad.  We have done a great few months' work in ensuring that there is a very bright and exciting future for our harbours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very happy with the Bill.  Perhaps for the first time, the other House and those outside will see the valuable contribution that this House can make to a Bill.  The Minister listened to all arguments, and I know that, behind the scenes, he and his staff, including Noreen O'Mahony, consulted <Col N="1841" /> groups that had problems with the Bill, even as it was going through the House.</P>
      <P>I thank Senators Daly, Rory Kiely, Dan Kiely, Wright, Mooney, and Neville, the Leader of the House, the Independents, Senator Dardis and all who contributed to the Bill and helped to make it better.  In addition, I do not wish to forget the role played in lobbying us by the harbour masters, the chambers of commerce, the pilots, New Ross and Waterford Harbours and the ship agents.</P>
      <P>Probably the happiest people leaving the House today are those from Foynes. They did a very good job at lobbying and took a fierce interest in the Bill at all stages.  Every day some member of the harbour board, in the form of either Councillor Kevin Sheehan or Councillor John Griffin and others, was in the public gallery watching the Bill progress through the House.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister and Noreen O'Mahony and her staff for all the months of hard work they put into this Bill.  I recall speaking to Ms O'Mahony almost two years ago and she worked hard on it since then.  It might have been better to have introduced two Bills within a short space of time, the Harbours Bill being one of them, and a Bill dealing with pilots and pilotage. However, that is all water under the bridge.</P>
      <P>When the Minister for the Marine, spoke on Second Stage he referred to the debate on the 1946 Act and mentioned the Senators who contributed to it.  I hope at some time in the distant future, other Senators and another Minister will when contributing on another Bill acknowledge what this House, the Minister and his staff have done here.  I thank the Minister from the bottom of my heart.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very proud of the Minister of State.  His stature as a Minister has been enhanced by the compliments paid to him and to his staff.  It was important for the Minister to enact <Col N="1842" /> legislation providing for the establishment of State companies to handle port operations and pilot it through the Seanad.</P>
      <P>I was concerned about some aspects, having had consultations on two or three occasions with the pilots in the Cork harbour area.  They expressed concern about the vulnerability of the harbour now that it has been designated a chemical industries harbour.  Their main concern was about granting licences to masters or mates of ships carrying dangerous cargoes.  This amendment will assuage their fears.  The Minister said the international maritime dangerous goods code was being examined to see if it was strong enough.  That will reassure the people to whom I have spoken about this important legislation. Safety precautions must not be sacrificed to commercial interest and we must always keep the balance right.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to have been given an opportunity to comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I echo the remarks of other Senators but not in any ritualistic way.  I am glad Senator Sherlock spoke immediately after Senator Fitzgerald because I needed time to wipe away the tears following Senator Fitzgerald's eloquent touching oration.  This is a good Bill.  The Minister gave an impressive performance.  Some of his colleagues might note the way in which he met the concerns of Senators.  His listening was exemplary and encouraged Senators who put some work into trying to master the details of the legislation.</P>
      <P>I also appreciated Senator Fitzgerald's significant contribution which helped make this a very good Bill. People form their opinions about a Department at least partly on the performance of a Minister in this House and the demeanour of the civil servants behind him.  I go away with a very high opinion of the Minister's Department and the calibre of his staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I join other Members in thanking the Minister and his staff for the way they have conducted this legislation <Col N="1843" /> through the House.  It has reflected very well on the House, the Minister and democracy in general, and is an example of how we should do our business.  We have had a debate in the true sense of the word rather than, as we sometimes have, a dialogue of the deaf.  The Minister is to be commended for the way he listened.</P>
      <P>I endorse what Senator Lee said about Senator Fitzgerald.  It required a great deal of work to put down the number of amendments he proposed on Committee Stage.  But for those amendments, it is arguable whether we would have improved the Bill to such an extent.  He deserves a particular word of praise.</P>
      <P>I have no objection to lobbying, as it is part of our democratic process. However, there is a lesson to be learnt here.  It is far more effective to come and talk to people and go around to the various parties and groups than it is to indulge in mob rule at the gates of the House.  Other groups might learn from the way in which lobbying was done effectively, well and in a balanced way in this instance.  Nobody was put under undue pressure.  We were just told people's case and we listened.</P>
      <P>Senator Fitzgerald referred to the nuclear aspect.  We have done a practical and effective thing in legislating to control vessels coming in and I suspect it will not get any attention.  People get very excited about Sellafield and get much attention.  The Minister made the point that there is a great deal of material being transported and that it is not just the land based facilities which pose a problem.  In many ways what is aboard vessels is an even greater problem. We have done an effective job and a good day's work.  I hope the legislation achieves the desired results.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I also compliment the Minister on the way he handled this legislation.  He listened to the debate and took on board any complaints.  This Bill was vastly improved in this House and it shows how important this House <Col N="1844" /> is to the legislative process and proved that the input of Senators is necessary. My colleague, Senator Fitzgerald, was rightly applauded.  There is a great sense of Kerry loyalty here but he deserved every praise for the amendments he proposed.  I am delighted the Bill has passed.  This is the third Harbours Bill to which I have contributed.  I was very much involved in the two earlier Bills which caused general elections.  Thank God this one did not.</P>
      <P>I compliment the people who came and spoke to us privately.  Senator Neville said on Committee Stage there was no need for all the lobbying from Foynes.  However, it was necessary and they proved that lobbying in the right way can achieve success.  I am pleased that the people from Foynes will go away happy.  I am concerned about Limerick. We did not agree with elements of the extension of jurisdiction to Foynes. However, Limerick, the Shannon Estuary authority and the Foynes authority will have a successful dialogue and ensure that everybody in the area is happy.</P>
      <P>Senator Wright made a valid point about Balbriggan which I am sure the Minister will take on board.  He mentioned the £60,000 funding offered by way of grant to both ports.  It is very little and it is possible to make a comparison with the agricultural industry in this instance.  We are supposed to maintain European standards and modernise our systems, particularly in the dairy sector.  To keep in line with European standards, it would cost a farmer £100,000 to modernise a medium size farm, but the two ports will only receive £60,000.  This is wrong.  I appeal to the Minister to improve the funding for the ports of Skerries and Balbriggan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Minister for his deliberations and for listening to the lobbyists. I am sure everybody will be happy with the Bill.  It has been promised for a long time.  This is the third Harbours Bill to which I have contributed.  I was the Opposition spokesperson on the Marine when former Minister of State, Deputy Nealon, introduced the first Bill.  It was <Col N="1845" /> controversial legislation and I am glad we finally have a Bill which pleases everybody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Members for their help and co-operation in ensuring the Bill is passed by the House today.  I also thank the officers and staff of the House for their help and co-operation in this regard and I thank the officials from the Department for the considerable work they put into the preparation of the Bill and the consultative process which surrounded it.</P>
      <P>I mentioned this point on Second Stage but, as I referred to the consultative process, it is not inappropriate to again acknowledge the considerable work done in the early stages of the preparation of the Bill by the former Minister of State, the late Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan.  We all remember him with a great deal of fondness.</P>
      <P>The Bill was not contested and its object was generally accepted across the political spectrum in both Houses.  It attracted quite an amount of attention inside and outside both Houses.  A number of Senators mentioned the amount of representation and lobbying which was received.  It is also good and healthy that we should endeavour to improve the legislation as originally drafted as it passes through both Houses.  I was happy to accept several amendments in this and the other House with a view to improving the Bill.  This is important since it was not contested.</P>
      <P>It is a substantial Bill, containing 105 sections and a number of Schedules, and it is good that the views, opinions and concerns of those who must work it in the future, such as people involved in harbour companies, were brought to bear on it.  It is also good that the considerable experience of Members of both Houses, who served on harbour boards, who have been associated with such companies or who have particular knowledge of this area, was brought to bear on the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1846" /> Senator Wright mentioned section 88. This is an enabling provision and an order must be made to commence it.  A specific section relates to Fingal County Council, which involves the transfer of Skerries and Balbriggan.  A commencement order must be made but there will be a consultation process prior to its commencement involving the county council and the port authority.  In any event, an opportunity will be provided to Members of both Houses to raise the issue prior to the order coming into effect.</P>
    <P>The Bill is important to the country. It is a cliché to point out that Ireland is the last island in the European Union, but it is the only EU member state which does not have a land link.  This has significant implications for our trade with the rest of the EU.  Over 90 per cent of the State's trade goes through the sea ports and their management and condition, the facilities provided and the shipping services to and from them are critically important to the economic well being of the country.</P>
    <P>This legislation is important in that it gives the larger ports a new mandate and a new lease of life.  However, it must be read in conjunction with the considerable investment which is taking place at the ports.  This will involve over £140 million in the next four years and is aimed at improving facilities and reducing costs to port users.  It must also be read in conjunction with the considerable advances being made in the shipping area.  A large number of new vessels are coming into service and there are new operations to and from the ports.  These matters are indicative of healthy economic activity.</P>
    <P>I am pleased we have produced legislation which confers a commercial mandate on the port companies.  It will release them from the day to day control of the Department of the Marine and enable them to carry out their functions freely and commercially.  At the same time, the Bill tempers the commercial mandate, given the requirements to care for the environment and to take account of the critically <Col N="1847" /> important areas of safety and uses of harbour facilities other than shipping, such as leisure, recreation and tourism amenities.</P>
    <P>A well rounded piece of legislation has been produced.  I have no doubt, given the investment in ports and advances taking place in shipping, it will serve the economy and country well in the years ahead.  I again thank Members for their assistance and co-operation in dealing with the Bill.</P>

      <P>I ask Members to bear with me regarding a change in the running order of business today.  With the agreement of Senator Dardis and Senator Fitzgerald, I understand the debate on the Appropriation Bill will not be overly long.  The Members who have offered do not intend to speak at length.  I ask the House to agree to take item 1 which was scheduled for this morning.  It will not take long.  Another reason for this request is that Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, is taking the Appropriation Bill and the Commissioners of Public Works (Functions and Powers) Bill and he needs time to brief himself on some of the amendments which have been put down.  I ask the House to agree that the business today will be item 4 at 2 p.m., as agreed earlier, and item 3 immediately afterwards. Senator Kiely assured me Senator Dardis will not speak for long.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney) Avril Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the unavoidable absence of the Minister for Finance.  The annual Appropriation Bill gives statutory effect to the Departmental Estimates for the supply services, non-capital and capital, including all Supplementary Estimates which were approved by the Dáil since the last Appropriation Act.</P>
      <P>The 1995 Bill appropriates to the various services listed in the Schedule the sum of £10,398,104,797.  This total amount comprises the original Estimates of £10.192 billion set out in the revised post-budget Book of Estimates for 1995; Supplementary Estimates totalling £204,208,000; and an Excess Vote of £1,788,797 for 1993 on the International Co-operation Vote.  Following the normal practice, the Bill also approves the use of certain departmental receipts amounting to £963,222,880 as appropriations-in-aid.</P>
      <P>When the Bill was debated in the Dáil, certain exaggerated claims were made by the Opposition parties about its implications for the increase in spending this year; they said it would be of the order of 12 or 13 per cent.  The Minister for Finance set out the position on 1995 spending in his statement to the Dáil on 14 December in the course of the debate on this Bill.  I will summarise and repeat the facts as he presented them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Finance's best estimate of the outturn for 1995 current spending is £11.7 billion.  This includes £140 million in respect of equal treatment payments which the Government decided to accelerate.  When this amount is excluded the current spending outlook for 1995 shows an increase of 6.1 per cent over 1994 or 3.5 per cent in real terms.  They are the facts and <Col N="1849" /> claims from the Opposition parties and reports in the media that the increase in spending this year will be in the region of 12 to 13 per cent are simply not true.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the allocation of an additional £204 million to the original 1995 departmental Estimates.  This money is required to enable Departments and their agencies implement their planned programmes of services and activities this year.  This is a net expenditure figure which takes account of a £59 million shortfall in departmental receipts by way of appropriations-in-aid. When that shortfall is excluded the additional sum being allocated to gross departmental expenditure is £145 million, of which £115 million relates to gross non-capital spending.  The Bill does not highlight savings which have arisen in various Departments.</P>
    <P>The 1995 figure for gross current expenditure in the Appropriation Bill before the House is £10,080 million. However, this does not include the gross expenditure from the social insurance fund which is not voted by the Dáil. Taking this into account the gross current 1995 figure implicit in the Bill is £11,774 million.  This is the figure for gross current expenditure which is shown in the Abridged Estimates Volume published last Monday.  As I mentioned earlier the expected outturn is lower than this.</P>
    <P>The Departments with the most significant Supplementary Estimates and the main factors giving rise to those additional allocations are as follows.  An additional sum of £89.9 million is being provided to the Department of Health, of which £60 million relates to the establishment of a special fund for payments to people infected with hepatitis C.  The balance of £29.9 million relates to additional funding requirements for demand led schemes, mainly drug refund schemes.</P>
    <P>An additional sum of £45.4 million is provided to the Department of Education, the main component of which is in respect of a shortfall in appropriations-in-aid as a result of delays in receipt of transfers due from the European <Col N="1850" /> Social Fund.  Additional provision is also required for recoupment to the vocational education committees in respect of payments made by them under the higher education grants scheme.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment receives an additional sum of £23.1 million, mainly in respect of additional funding for the Government's restoration programme for non-national roads.  The Department of Social Welfare is being provided with an additional sum of £19 million, mainly to cover the cost of the payment of a Christmas bonus to social welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>As Senators will be aware, the Government has decided to use gross &mdash; as opposed to net &mdash; non-capital supply services expenditure as the measure of public spending in 1995.  This has given rise to some comment in recent days. Gross current spending is used as it provides a more accurate and realistic measure of what the Government spends and is a more appropriate and valid basis on which effective overall control on public expenditure may be exercised.</P>
    <P>In the annual Appropriation Act, which is the statutory authority for expenditure on supply services, the House approves first, the net amount needed for each service and second, the amount of cash receipts, known as appropriations-in-aid, which may be spent on the service.  These two amounts taken together make up the gross amount of each Vote.  A gross measure of public spending is a better measure of total Government spending.  Net spending reflects receipts which partially fund spending.  These include receipts of Government Departments by way of charges for services and certain EU transfers.  A modest increase in net spending may mask significant increases in overall spending if there are compensating increases in departmental receipts.</P>
    <P>The use of gross supply services spending as a measure of public spending is not a new concept.  The annual Book of Estimates has, traditionally, <Col N="1851" /> provided details of departmental expenditure on a gross as well as a net basis. While the amounts voted by the Dáil and provided for in the Appropriation Bill are net amounts, Government accounting has always been on a gross basis, that is, receipts are not offset against payments.  part II of each Vote sets out the gross provision sought by subhead.  The subheads of a Vote are the headings under which the Department is required to account for expenditure and determine the items in the appropriation account.  The gross approach facilitates the financial control of the Dáil and enables the Department of Finance to exercise control of expenditure.</P>
    <P>This year's Bill covers an excess Vote relating to 1993.  The excess of £1,788,797 arose from the over issue of funds to bilateral aid project accounts as a result of inadequacies in the system of financial control operated by the Department of Foreign Affairs which have now been rectified.  Following established practice, the Committee of Public Accounts has examined this excess Vote and has no objection to it.</P>
    <P>This year's Bill includes provision in section 3 for setting up a special account, to be funded from moneys provided by the Oireachtas by way of Supplementary Estimate on the Health Vote in 1995, to be used to pay awards on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis made by the tribunal appointed by the Minister for Health for the purpose of administering the scheme of compensation for victims of hepatitis C.</P>
    <P>What the Government is doing, namely introducing a Supplementary Estimate to make available money to be paid into a fund created by the Appropriation Bill, had been decided on some time ago in the light of official and legal advice on accounting procedures and on the best way of supporting the work of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>I repeat the assurance which the Minister for Finance gave to the Dáil last week, that there is no question of section 3 having been a last minute <Col N="1852" /> addition.  The Appropriation Bill cannot be finalised until all Supplementary Estimates are known.  For that reason, the Bill is always one of the last items published and brought before the Oireachtas each year.  If the section had been an afterthought, the Supplementary Estimate would not have taken the format it did.</P>
    <P>One of the precedents followed in drafting section 3 of the Appropriation Bill was the Air Companies (Amendment) Act, 1993, which created a similar fund to cover the payment of equity to Aer Lingus in the following year.  If anyone cares to check the wording of these two Acts, it will be seen they are almost exactly the same.</P>
    <P>Apart from authorising the Estimates and any Excess Votes, the Appropriation Bill also has another essential purpose. It provides a statutory basis for the calculation of the issues which the Minister for Finance is authorised, under the Central Fund (Permanent Provisions) Act, 1965, to make from the Exchequer towards meeting the cost of the following year's services before the Dáil has an opportunity to approve the Estimates for that year.  Accordingly, the Appropriation Bill must be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas before the end of the year to allow the provision of the 1965 Act to come into effect.</P>
    <P>As we are approaching the end of the financial year, I take this opportunity to comment on the satisfactory performance of the economy over the last year and to look ahead to prospects for 1996.</P>
    <P>The economy is performing strongly and it is now clear that economic growth this year will again be strong following last year's exceptional performance when GNP grew by some 7 per cent. The strong economic growth we are now experiencing is well balanced with both the domestic economy and exports contributing strongly to this growth. Improved confidence among consumers is reflecting itself in more buoyant consumption this year and last year, especially in areas such as new car purchases. Low nominal interest rates and <Col N="1853" /> the generally favourable demand conditions have resulted in stronger investment by businesses.</P>
    <P>Our good competitive position and success in attracting investment helps us to gain market share with the result that our export performance continues to be exceptional.  For instance, the latest figures show that in the first six months of the year, merchandise exports were one fifth higher than in the first half of 1994. Because growth has been both robust and well balanced, employment &mdash; which of course is the key measure of economic success &mdash; has responded strongly.  The Department of Finance estimates that over the two year period 1994-95 employment has increased by over 80,000.  In fact, the increase in employment in the year to mid-April last of 49,000 was the highest ever recorded in the labour force survey. This is a remarkable performance by any standard.</P>
    <P>Inflation has remained extremely moderate at under 2.5 per cent over the last two years, below the average of our EU partners.  Our balance of payments was in surplus to the tune of £2 billion last year and the expectations are that this will be exceeded this year.</P>
    <P>This strong performance should continue into 1996.  Confidence among consumers and investors remains high, interest rates are low and international economic prospects look generally good.  The current growth phase should continue with another year of strong economic growth, albeit somewhat slower than the truly exceptional rates of this year and last.  A further strong increase in employment is in prospect as growth is again expected to be well balanced.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, the European Council in Madrid over the weekend took a number of very important decisions in relation to economic and monetary union.  The first and most important of these decisions is that the Council confirmed unequivocally that stage three of European Monetary Union will commence on 1 January 1999.  The Council also adopted a reference <Col N="1854" /> scenario on European Monetary Union setting out the steps to be taken in the transition to a single currency which, the scenario makes clear, will be completed by the middle of the year 2000.  The Council also decided that the name of the new currency will be the Euro.</P>
    <P>The decision on which member states fulfil the conditions for entry to European Monetary Union and the single currency will be taken as soon as possible in 1998.  This decision will be based on 1997 outturns, although it will also have regard, of course, to the achievement by member states of a high degree of sustainable convergence.  This means that the performance of member states in meeting the Treaty convergence criteria will assume an even greater importance from now on.</P>
    <P>In recent years Ireland has made excellent progress on convergence.  We have kept our general Government deficit below 3 per cent of GDP every year since and including 1989.  We have reduced our debt-to-GDP ratio from over 116 per cent in 1986 to under 92 per cent in 1994 &mdash; a reduction of some 25 percentage points &mdash; and a further significant reduction is in prospect this year.  Indeed, Ireland is the only EU member state which will have a lower debt-to-GDP ratio in 1995 than it had in 1991.  The Government is determined to ensure that Ireland goes on meeting the criteria so that we will be fit and ready to join European Monetary Union when it commences in 1999.  This Government will maintain the discipline necessary to ensure that we will be able to join European Monetary Union when it finally happens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House for this debate which enables us to have, at least, a brief analysis of the elements contained in the Appropriation Bill, the expenditure pattern of 1995 and the expenditure allocations for 1996.  The Minister's final line, in which he mentioned that &ldquo;this Government will maintain the discipline necessary to ensure that we will be able <Col N="1855" /> to join European Monetary Union when it finally happens&rdquo; does not reassure me.  If the maintenance of &ldquo;the discipline&rdquo; is at the same level and commitment as we have seen in recent times under this Government, then I am afraid it will not be adequate to qualify us for membership of the European Monetary Union in 1999.</P>
      <P>The Estimates for public expenditure published by the Government this week lack the credibility essential to maintain international confidence in our economy and the confidence of our partners which, as the Minister has said, has been consistent in recent years.  The difficult decisions which the Fianna Fáil Government took in public expenditure control since 1987 are the reasons such a level of confidence has been generated in the economy.  It is ironic that that level of confidence accures to the benefit of this leftist dominated Government whose members in Opposition fiercely opposed the essential financial constraints imposed by Fianna Fáil since 1987.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will refer to that.  I and every member of that Fianna Fáil Government would feel obliged to acknowledge the major contribution made by the Fine Gael Party at that time and the responsible attitude of its then leader, Deputy Dukes.  The achievements on which the Fianna Fáil success was based in 1987 would not have been possible without the responsible contribution of Fine Gael towards a common purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My observations will be directed towards the profligate spending pattern of the partnership which my party had to live with, although I was a reluctant supporter of it.  My record in this House has been consistent in that regard. Fianna Fáil and Fianna Fáil dominated Governments since 1987 not only adhered to their financial targets but bettered them each year.  Public expenditure <Col N="1856" /> allocations and projections are important to give the signal to the market. The realisation of targets 12 months later is significant to domestic and international markets and to our partners in Europe.  Each year since 1987 we bettered the targets we set ourselves which were tough and disciplined.</P>
    <P>In contrast to that performance by Fianna Fáil since 1987, this Government has already clearly breached its own financial targets for the second year running by a wide margin.  This is a matter of regret and concern.  That is serious enough but its spurious attempts to conceal this from the public and, perhaps more importantly, from the financial markets and its European partners will do a grave disservice to the people and will damage the economy.</P>
    <P>The recent conduct of Government in breaching all the rules of public accounting, such as the spurious transfer of £60 million from next year's Estimate to the 1995 one in respect of the hepatitis C victims, raises fundamental questions of trust for the domestic and international financial markets which has been at the base of the growth to which the Minister referred.  That did not happen overnight; it was the result of disciplined control and the achievement of targets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We seem to have a degree of consensus &mdash; perhaps something new is about to break on the political scene.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Health in 1995, to which the Minister referred in passing, was presented to the Dáil on a false basis because it states that it is the amount required in the year ending 31 December 1995 for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Health and certain services administered by that office.  It is abundantly clear that the £60 million is not required this year as the Estimate suggests because no individual liabilities will be processed, much less determined, by the <Col N="1857" /> tribunal before next year.  The Estimates for next year should properly include the £60 million provision.  Some might say that it is Government expenditure one way or the other, whether it is for 1995 or 1996, but we all know that these Estimates, the outturn and the expenditure on the Estimates together, become the key which influence the markets and financial services.</P>
    <P>To attempt to deceive the other House is serious but I would not worry about it &mdash; that is not to say that I do not have respect for the Oireachtas &mdash; because here we engage in political debate and argument.  Everyone makes the best of the case they are presenting and the other side makes the worst of the case presented; that is the nature of political argument.  However, to attempt to deceive the markets is much more damaging; the hard won confidence in which I acknowledge Fine Gael &mdash; in Opposition, significantly &mdash; played such a positive role in gaining and which has been exhibited in the Irish economy since the control actions of 1987 is now being recklessly forfeited.  There is a terrible irony in the fact that Fine Gael, which played such a positive role in Opposition, is having that role undermined by the left dominated elements in this Government, to which I propose to refer somewhat more in the course of this brief contribution.</P>
    <P>I take issue with the Minister in regard to the alleged overall target of an average 2 per cent annual increase in the current supply services for the reasons I have given.  It is a false target. The underlying rise in 1996 is now likely to be nearer 3 per cent, which is a reasonable estimate, not a wild one, on my part.  I will quote another authority on this, someone with whom I served in the Seanad when we both came here first in 1965.  I am the only survivor of those days.  I am the only survivor of those days.  I am speaking about the former Taoiseach, Garret FitzGerald.  He said rightly of practices which had been current in Fianna Fáil's time but which he acknowledged were no longer current, that &ldquo;The best thing the Government could do now [he was talking of <Col N="1858" /> this Government earlier this year] would be to bury quickly this unhappy and, I believe, uncharacteristic piece of creative accountancy.&rdquo;  It is to be expected that he would say nothing else than that it was uncharacteristic of a Government in which his own party was involved, but he said a few months ago that the best thing would be to bury it quickly.  What happen has happened? Instead of burying it quickly, the Government has resurrected it and paraded it as being a major achievement in discipline and control.</P>
    <P>For the second year in succession the Government has breached its own financial targets in advance but, even worse, it is anxious to conceal this fact from the public and the financial markets. Any notion that the financial markets can be decieved by that kind of creative accounting shows extreme naiveté. The net result of all of this is that in this current year, the Government which reaped the rewards in 1995 of sound fiscal policy constructed by Fianna Fáil, has presided over a real growth of public expenditure in 1995 of the order of 13 per cent.  The Minister may say that it was not 13 per cent but many people will demonstrate that, taking account of everything, it was.  Public expenditure growth was the highest since 1978 and it was far in excess of the rate of inflation.</P>
    <P>It is even more serious that this has cast grave doubts over the credibility of the Government's Estimates for 1996. The consensus which existed at least between the two main parties in the other House from 1987 was very important and helped to bring about discipline and control.  During my years in Government, that consensus was probably one of the most positive and encouraging initiatives with which I was privileged to be involved.</P>
    <P>It became apparent in 1987 that it was necessary to effect a major reduction in the number of staff in the public sector. At the first meeting of the Cabinet that year it was realised the days of the easy option were at an end.  In a formalised agreement with the trade unions, <Col N="1859" /> employers and farming organisations we managed to achieve a discipline, understanding and common purpose that enabled us to reduce numbers in the public service.  Since that agreement, those numbers have again mushroomed to the point where maybe we should not have undertaken that necessary exercise. Perhaps I should withdraw that last remark because, if we had not undertaken it at that time, Members can imagine how many people would be employed in the public service at present.</P>
    <P>I want to pay particular tribute to the current leader of Fianna Fáil, Deputy Bertie Ahern, for the role he played in achieving that understanding.  It is appropriate that I pay him tribute because he could hardly do so himself. The goal that was reached in convincing the national trade union movement to accept a reduction of numbers in the public sector of the order that was achieved was a tribute to his relationship with that movement and the trust it placed in him.  Other Ministers at the time were able to build on this achievement and benefit from it.</P>
    <P>I will provide an example to illustrate the case.  When I entered Government in 1987 as Minister for Agriculture there were two agricultural advisory and research organisations, namely, ACOT and the Agricultural Institute.  The total Estimate for 1986 for those organisations was in the region of £35 million to £36 million.  My colleagues in Government, as a measure of what I was to do to take part in the sacrifice and discipline, made a sum of less than £30 million available to me for the following year.  The reduction was allocated toward essential advisory and research services and was achieved on the basis of the agreement for redundancies and displacements.  I negotiated long and hard with the agricultural organisations &mdash; the IFA and the ICMSA, for example &mdash; to agree to those reductions and pay contributions toward advisory services.  I informed those organisations at the time, in <Col N="1860" /> relation to such services, that if they are worth getting, they are worth paying for. That breakthrough was achieved but the numbers in Teagasc, which has replaced ACOT and the Agricultural Institute, have returned to the level they were at before I achieved the reductions referred to earlier.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of nonsense over which the current Government has presided.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge the less than benign influence of the Labour Party in the Fianna Fáil/Labour Government which preceded the current Administration.  That influence was felt at that time, but not to the same extent.  I hope it is clear that a policy exists, on the part of the Labour Party and the Democratic Left &mdash; which Fine Gael is unable to resist and which my own party did not succeed in resisting in the way I would have wished &mdash; of public expenditure growth.  We are currently receiving statements of their intent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will illustrate exactly how spurious are those statements.  The Democratic Left has managed to ensure that its Minister in Government retains the same level of back up service, advisers and researchers as the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste.  We are informed that this is justified because the Minister requires that level of service.  The Minister for Social Welfare is, effectively, his party's only representative in Government &mdash; although an arrangement exists which permits one of his colleagues to attend <Col N="1861" /> Cabinet meetings.  I find it totally unacceptable that he needs that in order to have the same degree of information and research as the Taoiseach and Tánaiste, particularly when it means increasing his personal staff by five and when he demonstrated that the real job of Minister for Social Welfare does not mean that much to him when he gave a paltry 2 per cent increase to the old age pensioners last year.</P>
    <P>People will look at this kind of public expenditure control with a degree of cynicism.  I find it not only sad but outrageous that all the reductions which were achieved by us in Government have now been thrown aside and the numbers in the public service are at an even higher level than when we tackled them in 1987.  There will always be a difficulty controlling current expenditure in particular, but it is important that the priority targets, be they the old, the sick, the young and those in education, will not suffer and that the administrative mushroom is cut back to the bone.  I have no confidence in this Government's capacity to state that, having totally repudiated it in the last few years, they will now suddenly reduce the numbers in the public service.  It is a belated dawn; it is outrageous.</P>
    <P>Throughout his speech, the Minister made reference, not surprisingly, to the continued strong economy.  We are agreed on the reasons for that.  That economic growth will not last forever, certainly not with these policies.  What we should be showing is discipline and control instead of the profligate and spendthrift actions which are evident in these expenditure allocations.</P>
    <P>Expenditure allocations should also indicate Government priority.  Last week, we had a long debate on the Courts and Court Officers Bill, 1995, and we are all agreed that the control of crime is important.  We need more judges, courthouses, prisons, etc., but despite all that, there is a 1 per cent reduction in the 1996 Estimates over 1995 for the courts system and 2 per cent for the provision of courthouses. Where is the consistency there?</P>

I find that reprehensible.</P>
      <P>I do not believe there is any cohesion in economic policy in this Government and I think I can identify the differences immediately.  Even with parties which have no cohesion of economic policy, there is one common interest, and it has nothing to do with economic policy or the national interest.  It is the common interest of securing the survival of Government in the interest of its individual members, irrespective of the interests of the nation.  Regrettably, I must disagree with the Minister who talks about Ireland's capacity to quality for entry into European Monetary Union in 1998.  With the pattern which we have seen in recent times and despite all the solid work of Government and Opposition up to recently, rather than qualify for European Monetary Union we will find ourselves risking being rejected for the first time by our partners and the financial markets.</P>

    <P>The Appropriation Bill comes before this House every year.  I remember Senator O'Kennedy making a lengthy contribution to the 1994 Bill also.  The Bill is mainly about setting up a special account into which £60 million will be paid for people entitled to awards as a result of contracting hepatitis C.  The <Col N="1863" /> Bill also states where the account will be and its purpose.  It will enable people who have contracted hepatitis C to go before the tribunal set up by the Minister for Health and secure their awards rather than have to wait many years for them.  Does Senator O'Kennedy believe that people with hepatitis C should wait six or seven years before they receive the payments to which they are entitled?</P>
    <P>The Government decided to establish a tribunal under the aegis of the Minister for Health to administer a special compensation scheme for those affected by hepatitis C.  Compensation will be paid speedily and without lengthy court proceedings to those who are found to be entitled to it.  The tribunal will be formal, flexible and private.  It offers the best way of meeting the needs of those affected by hepatitis C.  It was agreed that a special fund would be created to meet the cost of compensation to show the Government's continuing firm commitment to this policy.  Above all, setting up a specific fund into which Exchequer money would be paid as soon as possible is the clearest way of showing that the Government will do all it can to ensure that the tribunal is effective.</P>
    <P>There is nothing hidden in what the Government has done.  Its policy on hepatitis C has been stated by the Minister for Health on many occasions. Equally, in so far as accounting for public funds is concerned, there is nothing hidden.  The Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, has made absolutely clear to the Dáil and the Seanad the amount of money involved and how it will be administered.  In the first place, a Supplementary Estimate of £60 million has been provided in the 1995 Department of Health Vote to provide the necessary funds.  Parts II and III of the Supplementary Estimate explain that the money will be paid to a special account for the compensation tribunal.</P>
    <P>The Appropriation Bill before the House provides for the creation of a special compensation fund into which <Col N="1864" /> the money voted in the Supplementary Estimate will be paid.  Section 3 of the Bill provides for the creation of the account and the rules under which it will operate.  Again, there is nothing underhand in what the Government is doing here.  The Government's decision to introduce a Supplementary Estimate for money to be paid into a compensation tribunal fund was made some time ago in light of official and legal advice on accounting procedures and advice on the best way of supporting the work of the tribunal set up by the Minister for Health.  There is no question of section 3 of the Bill being a last minute addition.</P>
    <P>The Bill cannot be finalised until all Supplementary Estimates are known; that has always been the case.  For that reason, this Bill is always one of the last items published and brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas each year. Senator Roche is looking at me with suspicion.</P>

      <P>That has been the case every year.  The Government has performed exceptionally well over the last 12 months.  I congratulate the Government, the Minister for Finance and his Minister of State the way they have conducted the affairs of the country.  A 0.5 per cent reduction in interest rates was announced last week.  This will give confidence to the country and to the Government.  This time three years ago people were paying up to 46 per cent in interest rates.  The present Opposition leader was the Minister for Finance at the time and his inability to make a decision caused interest rates to escalate to the highest and most unprecedented levels we have ever seen.  Hard pressed business people had to pay unprecedented interest rates of up to 46 per cent.  We now have low interest rates of approximately 10 per cent.  I compliment the previous Government for their great work in bringing interest rates under control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy mentioned Deputy Dukes and the stance he took <Col N="1865" /> as Leader of Fine Gael in 1987.  He must be complimented for what he did as Leader of the Opposition at the time, even though this was not in the best interests of Fine Gael, but Fine Gael has always put the country first&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and is doing so now. We bore the brunt of the criticism for the hard decisions which were made at the time.  Senator O'Kennedy stated that Fianna Fáil in Government reduced the numbers employed in the public service and this is true.  However, he now suggests that over the last 12 months the numbers have been restored to their original level.  More people were employed in the public service at the end of 1994 than in 1987.  Fine Gael supported the work of the Government in 1987 but it is sad that the achievements of that Government were rapidly eroded by 1994.  The present Government has to tackle this problem.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that the rate of growth of public spending during 1995 and 1996 will be substantially below that achieved in earlier years, particularly by the Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrats Government.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The Government's policies will ensure that we are in the first rank of the countries which will qualify to take part in the EU single currency zone.  This task has not been made any easier by the high spending of the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government during which Senator Roche was a Member of the Dáil.  The Government's policy of keeping borrowing and spending within prudent limits means that interest rates can be maintained at low levels.  During the past week interest rates were reduced by 0.5 per cent and I have no doubt the Minister expects further reductions over the next 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1866" /> The increase in current spending for 1996 has been kept close to the target of 2 per cent which is contained in the Programme for Government.  This is exceptional.  I compliment the Government and the Minister for Finance for their good work and I ask them to continue along those lines.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides £60 million for the tribunal established by the Minister for Health.  People who have contracted hepatitis C will be able to obtain awards from the tribunal rather than waiting for six or seven years.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not happy with the level of spending set out in the Estimates published last Monday.  I compliment the Government for setting spending targets in the first place.  That was a new and welcome departure, in spite of the fact that many people believed a 2 per cent increase in spending over inflation was still too much.  The spending target, however, has now turned out to be a hostage to fortune because the Government has missed it by a kilometre. I appreciate the Minister's honesty in providing us with a menu of interpretations as to how far the target has been missed.  That degree of honesty has not been a common practice in the past. A target which was too high in the first place has been missed.</P>
      <P>We are now beginning to get a clear picture of the spending policies of the Government.  We have had one budget and half of the next one.  The decisions being taken reflect a view of reality which I, or many business people, do not share.  Every penny provided for in the Estimates is being spent on a worthy cause.  However, the question is whether we can afford particular outlays at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since I came into the House I have considered every Bill as if I was at a board room table assessing it from a business point of view.  When a business sets out its plans it wants to hold on to its best people by paying them more.  It wants to ensure that it trains them properly by spending more on education and <Col N="1867" /> it wants to ensure that its customers remain healthy, as it were.  However, as it is restricted by what it has to spend, it must look carefully to see if it can do all it wants to do.  We are attempting to live beyond our means and that is a road that leads to trouble.  It pushes further away the day when we can afford to do all the things we want to do.  However, the Government seems to have decided to take that road.</P>
    <P>The management of our public finances is all wrong.  We concentrate on spending and then we try to find the resources to meet that spending.  It makes much more sense to approach it the other way around.  When one is devising a household budget or involved in business, for example, one does not start on the basis of what one would like to spend, but on the basis of how much income there is to spend.  Then we ask how we might divide that amount among the various demands.  However, in the case of public finances, we ask what we would like to do and then how we might raise the money to make it happen.</P>
    <P>The way businesses and households approach budgeting makes much more sense.  A business taking a long term outlook looks at budgetting in a much different way from one that is taking the short term outlook.  In a book entitled &ldquo;A Better Way to Plan the Nation's Finances&rdquo;, in which the Taoiseach was involved as Minister for Finance in 1981, it is stated at section 1.18:</P>
    <P>The need to look beyond a single year stems from the fact that the cost implications of new services and, indeed, of existing services may not be fully reflected in the estimates of the immediate budget year.  There may be implications for later years in relation to the use of resources which are highly relevant to the wisdom or feasibility of the decision taken in the immediate budget year.  Ideally, therefore, expenditure estimates should include, in fairly simple terms, <Col N="1868" /> projections of the cost of Government programmes.</P>
    <P>I have not had a chance to look at this carefully, but I will do so to see if the Taoiseach has followed through on what appears to make a great deal of sense. When we return to this issue in the new year I have great confidence that it is so worthy of being followed that it will be followed.  However, I wonder if it has been adhered to on this occasion.</P>
    <P>In the interest of jobs we should take a long term outlook and consider long term projections.  If we are really serious about creating jobs, and I hope we are, we must realise that taxation is a big factor in the number of jobs created. Taxation is not the whole answer, but it is a very important part of the solution.</P>
    <P>If our top priority is jobs we should be asking what type of tax regime will help create the most jobs?  What are the barriers to job creation in the present tax regime?  If we did this and acted on it, there would be a cost.  I am not one of those who believe that tax cuts can be completely self financing.  I would like to think this were so, but it is unlikely to happen too often.</P>
    <P>However, do we not owe it to those without jobs to create the tax regime that would be the most favourable to putting them at work?  More jobs means more income for the Government, and this means less tax per taxpayer.  This is one example of a &ldquo;win win&rdquo; situation, so concentration on tax in order to create more jobs is likely to benefit, before we start to decide how we will spend it.</P>
    <P>This should be our starting point, and only afterwards should we turn our attention to spending.  We should approach spending on the basis of what we have left to spend after we have created a tax regime to encourage the greatest possible level of job creation. When it then comes to spending decisions, it is a question of a limited amount of money to distribute among all the claims on it, similar to a business and a household.  While, for example, acknowledging the need for Teilifís na <Col N="1869" /> Gaeilge, one asks if it can be afforded this year or, while acknowledging that the abolition of university fees for middle class people is good, again one must ask if this is the year to do that, if it might not be better to spend half the money on increasing grants to working class students who need much more than the abolition of fees to make university education a viable proposition for them.  We look at spending first, instead of looking at what we have to spend.</P>
    <P>The other way in which we have it backwards is in our attitude to cutting spending.  I note we are back to the embargo on recruitment in the public service that we heard of so often before. For every three vacancies that arise, only one is to be filled.  Let us make no mistake about it, that is a very crude and counterproductive tool.  It is a cowardly way of cost cutting because it neatly side-steps any confrontation with the existing vested interests involved.  As such it is understandable but it is certainly not defensible.</P>
    <P>I recommend the technique of zero budgeting with which I am sure the Minister is familiar.  Traditional budgeting, which I hear is very much alive and well in the public service, is based on examining the previous year's expenditure and assessing how much extra is needed in the current year.  Zero budgeting starts from a different premise and asks, at every line of spending, whether we can dispense with the item involved.  It starts from scratch every year and it is interesting to observe how it operates in a business.</P>
    <P>One starts by saying, for example, there will not be any spending on electricity this year.  Immediately everybody howls that we must turn on the lights. One then says that the lights need only be put on for a certain time and that we do not need all the lights.  Before one knows it, instead of saying our electricity expenditure will be the same as last year plus a little for inflation, one starts from scratch and almost begs for every lamp bulb.  However, it has an <Col N="1870" /> amazing effect on costs.  One does not assume that one will spend what one spent last year, with a little addition. One starts by justifying the first pound spent rather than just the extra pounds. This has a dramatic effect on costs.</P>
    <P>It is a useful discipline and a much more effective tool than crude approaches like employment embargoes which are a little like cutting off one's nose to spite one's face.  It is time to recognise that this is indeed a spending Government and one that, in my opinion, is spending beyond our means &mdash; note I use the first person plural. There is still work to be done on how we structure our approach to Government spending.  I am not convinced that our present approach gives the best value for money and I am still less convinced that it is appropriate when the national priority is creating more jobs.  I urge the Government to give that serious consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the House for its interest in this Bill and particularly Senators O'Kennedy and Quinn for their contributions.  I also thank Senator Burke for his supportive comments.  There was reference to a couple of common themes on which I would like to comment.</P>
      <P>The fact that we are arguing about whether the Government will spend plus 2 per cent or 3 per cent in real terms next year speaks for itself.  This is not because I want to make an excuse about missing a target but because I want to contrast it with the spending levels of the past four or five years when, everybody agrees, the economy was well managed.  From 1991 through to 1995, the real increases were 6.5 per cent for the first of the three years, dropping to 4.8 last year and 3.5 this year.  We will drop well below that next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not find any joy in defending the non achievement of a target of 2 per cent.  I take issue with Senator Quinn's view that the target was too high.  Historically, it is a very low target.  This is a <Col N="1871" /> little different from a business.  One can do things in business that one cannot do as easily in Government.  We have substantial commitments in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> where, for example, in 1996 the public service pay bill will increase by between 6 and 6.5 per cent.  In that context it is difficult to work within a 2 per cent real increase.</P>
    <P>We are supposedly working in good times, but it was a tough three months working with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, and the line Ministers towards lowering expectations at a time when the public has high expectations. It was not a question of one Minister getting the better of another.  The Minister for Finance placed a strong restraint on all Departments and I participated in that move.  It was not confined to one Department over another.</P>
    <P>Inevitably, Departments such as Health, Education and particularly Social Welfare, which are demand driven, are by far the most difficult areas in which to enforce an increasing level of discipline.  However, the Government, and the Minister for Finance in particular, is committed to maintaining a level of discipline which will meet the Maastricht criteria and go close to meeting, if not precisely, the targets set by the Government.  This was not done before and the targets were considerably lower than the achievements of the previous five or six years which people now appear to admire.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's point that it is brave of any Government to set targets.  However, the targets are not entirely voluntary in this case because, as the Minister is aware, there are certain responsibilities under the Maastricht criteria.  The Minister paid handsome tribute to previous Governments and I accept the role played by the Opposition.  However, an extraordinary game is being played with the public accounts.  The Minister is a businessman and he is aware that one cannot retrospectively secure overdrafts.  This is what is being done in parts of this legislation and the sham approach is a pity.</P>
      <P>The creation of a special account, involving £60 million in this case, is not something anybody would condemn in itself.  It is a good thing and difficult to do within the constraints imposed on the Government.  However, the accounting procedures being adopted are close to fraudulent in the true sense of the word.  I accept the Minister for Finance faces certain problems and he must ultimately come broadly within the 2 to 3 per cent range.  However, in reality, there is a fragmentation of what was a brave target and the attempt to overcome that through fraudulent accounting practice is reprehensible. Whether it involves this Government or a Government of any other political shade, it is important that Members of the Oireachtas point out that certain standards of accounting within the public accounts, which are loose and shoddy in themselves, are being thrown out the window.  This is a pity.</P>

      <P>I absolutely refute the notion that the Government is acting in a fraudulent manner.  I accept it is a valid debating point but the Government acted in a most transparent fashion several months ago.  It was open to advice in the Department <Col N="1873" /> of Finance and legal advice from the Attorney General.  It did not act, in any sense, in an underhand or fraudulent way.  I accept it is a debatable point but the Senator's language is over strong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to mar the occasion by being over strong.  My information is that there is the gravest concern within the Department of Finance about the accounting procedures being used with regard to this matter. When I was an official in the Department of Finance, this type of procedure would not have been used.  Whether one ultimately calls it fraudulent or creative, the Government and the Minister for Finance were courageous in setting a target.  That is a good practice to which all Governments should adhere.  When a target is set one cannot start to change the rules, yet the rules are being changed in this case.  The precedents quoted are not true precedents.  An overdraft is being created and that is not the way to approach matters in business or public accounting.  I accept what the Minister has said about the bravery of setting a target.  That is a good procedure.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred earlier to the difficulty of containing the expenditure of demand led Departments in particular. However, we can anticipate significant savings in social welfare as unemployment reduces.  There should be positive benefits in that.  On the social welfare side of the accounts we are seeing the emergence of a dangerous trend. This is more than a debating point and we will no doubt return to it in the New Year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Milk (Regulation of Supply) Act, 1994, which it is now proposed to amend, was, as Senators may recall, initiated in this House.  It provided for the abolition of the Cork and the Dublin District Milk Boards and the setting up of a National Milk Agency to regulate the supply of liquid milk for consumption throughout the State.  It also provided for the sale of the milk boards' ancillary businesses and included measures to protect the interests of the staff in this context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Act has worked very well since it became law and several important objectives have been achieved under its provisions.  For instance, in mid-November <Col N="1875" /> 1994, about 50 of the milk boards' staff were allowed to take voluntary early retirement on generous terms.  This was part of a staff rationalisation programme designed to make the board's ancillary businesses more attractive to potential purchasers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>An interim board was established to oversee the management of the ancillary businesses and to make arrangements for their sale.  On 30 December last the milk boards were abolished and the National Milk Agency came into being.  In late April and early May this year the former milk boards' ancillary businesses were sold as going concerns and, on the sales, some 80 staff who had not applied for early retirement transferred to the employment of the new owners.</P>
      <P>The National Milk Agency is comprised of a part-time chairman and 12 ordinary members.  These are representative of milk producers, processors, distributors, retailers and consumers.  The first members of the agency were appointed on the nomination of interest groups for each category of member.  Of the 12, five were producers' representatives, four were representatives of the processors, while consumer, retailer and distributor interests each nominated one member.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the agency is to regulate the market in such a way that the consumer is guaranteed fresh drinking milk throughout the year.  The drinking milk industry must be supplied all year <Col N="1876" /> round and has evolved a pricing structure to compensate producers for the higher costs entailed in winter milk production. The mechanism by which the agency regulates the supply of milk for liquid consumption involves the registration of what are termed liquid milk producers, all drinking milk pasteurisers and of the contracts made between them for the supply of milk.</P>
    <P>While the Act provides that the first producer representatives shall be appointed by the Minister on the nomination of producer interests, it goes on to state that &ldquo;in the year of establishment of the Agency&rdquo; the Minister must appoint a day for the election of producer representatives and prescribe the manner of election.  All producers registered with the agency on the first day of the month before that in which the election takes places are eligible to vote in this election.  The persons elected must be registered with the agency to hold their place as producer representatives.</P>
    <P>This provision is based on the assumption that, by the time an election is called, the agency will have established a comprehensive register of producers. However, because of start-up difficulties outside the control of the agency which were not foreseen when it was established, it has not proved possible to register the vast majority of producers in the year of establishment of the agency.  Accordingly, it was not possible to conduct a legitimate election of producer representatives within the timescale envisaged by the Act.</P>
    <P>To overcome this problem it is proposed to amend the Act to provide that all the existing representatives, both of producers and, for reasons I will explain shortly, the representatives of the other interests, should continue to hold office until sufficient producers are registered to facilitate holding an election.  Both farming organisations have requested the amendment to allow the impasse to be resolved.  The amendment, as set out in this Bill, is a small but necessary measure which received the support of both sides of the House when it was <Col N="1877" /> passed by Dáil Éireann on 13 December last.</P>
    <P>The Act also provides that &ldquo;in the year of establishment of the Agency&rdquo; the Minister shall again appoint processor, distributor, retailer and consumer representatives on the nomination of the relevant interest groups. At this stage the processor representatives must be processors who are registered with the agency.  However, because of the difficulties I mentioned earlier about there being so few processors registered at the relevant time, it was not possible to obtain a sufficient number of valid nominations to fill the number of places available for processors in the agency.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is necessary to amend the provision of the Act relating to the appointment of processor representatives on the same lines as applies to the election of producers.  In the circumstances, commonsense dictates that the appointment of the other three members should be synchronised with that of producers and processors, as envisaged by the Act.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, it is proposed to effect this slight technical amendment to the Act which will provide that the election of producer members and the appointment of all other members should take place not in &ldquo;the year of establishment of the Agency&rdquo; as provided for at present, but as soon as is practicable in 1996.  It is to effect this amendment that the present Bill has been drawn up.  It is purely intended to overcome a practical problem and has no policy implication.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, there is one slight correction to the text which I must ask the Cathaoirleach to authorise under the Standing Orders of this House.  In section 1 of the Bill, which defines the Principal Act as being the Milk (Regulation of Supply) Act, 1994, the words &mdash; The Principal Act &mdash; should be in inverted commas.  I would be most grateful if this correction could be effected.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister of State who introduced this Bill. He said that &ldquo;The purpose of the agency is to regulate the market in such a way that the consumer is guaranteed fresh drinking milk throughout the year.&rdquo; and that is essential.  However, the real purpose of this Bill, which is technical in nature, is to postpone until 1996 the election of members to the agency.  It was originally in the Bill that they would be elected in the year of establishment.  But, because of start-up difficulties outside the control of the agency, it has not proved possible to register the vast majority of producers in the year of its establishment.  While I appreciate this is the case, I was surprised the Minister did not outline the start-up difficulties.  Many people are aware of them and the House should also be told.</P>
      <P>I am not sure if a Bill similar to this asking for the elections to be delayed until 1997 might not come this time next year.  I know there are many problems involved.  The register of contracted producers who constitute the electorate was set up as recently as last October.  On 1 November, out of an estimated 5,000 liquid milk producers, only 40 producers were registered.  Progress has been slow. I do not know &mdash; maybe the Minister does &mdash; how many milk producers are currently registered.</P>
      <P>There are approximately 40 pasteurising dairies in the country employing 5,000 people and 4,500 farmers supply them at an annual value.  I know processors must also have an election.  How many processors are registered at present?  Is the Minister's Kerry Co-op registered?  I saw him photographed with Michael Hanrahan lately.  How many milk producers in Kerry have been registered as milk producers? These questions are interesting because it is important to ensure that this agency works properly and that we will have co-operation on all sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1879" /> The cause of the trouble was section 6 (c) of the original Bill which refers to the registration of contracts, and states:</P>
    <P>...in the opinion of the agency provides adequate compensation to the producer of raw milk supplied under the contract throughout the year taking into account, in particular in relation to the winter months, the economic cost of the production of raw milk of suitable quality for heat treatment or liquid consumption all year round.</P>
    <P>This is very important.  People supplying raw milk for liquid milk consumption must be adequately compensated.  The Minister and Senator Dardis know there was a protest recently by dairy farmers who did not feel they were being adequately compensated by the co-ops. We will have to get to grips with this very soon.  We must ensure that in the near future a mechanism can be set up to register producers and to ensure that elections can be held.  If they are not registered as liquid milk producers they cannot vote.  Only 40 out of 5,000 producers were registered as of 1 November 1995, even though the original Bill was passed by the Oireachtas in 1994.  What is causing the delay?  The situation is serious.</P>
    <P>This Bill is essentially of benefit to producers and consumers who have to be assured of an adequate daily supply of fresh milk all year round.  The producer will have to be adequately compensated to ensure that supply.  The only way that can be done is through this National Milk Agency with the co-operation of all concerned in the provision of natural fresh milk to the consumer.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's reply I would like to hear what progress is being made to register producers and processors and to ensure that these elections will be held in 1996.  I understand that registration of producers and processors must be completed by 1 April but I doubt if that will happen unless the difficulties to which <Col N="1880" /> the Minister referred, but did not specify, are addressed in the meantime.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Kiely asked why there have been start-up problems. Those of us in the trade know well why the problems arose.  We have had a dispute between processors on the one side and producers on the other and we wonder why there are world wars.  They had 12 months to iron out their problems and failed to do so.  I hope that the remaining problems between producers and processors will be ironed out and that we will be ready for an election.  I am a producer but I am also involved in processing.  We all wonder why there are wars but it takes people a long time to iron out even simple problems because they become intransigent. Retailers had it their way for a long time but they must now share the responsibility with others in the same industry.</P>
      <P>This Bill was debated in the other House for two days.  An EU regulation moved the Cork District Milk Board and the Dublin District Milk Board from the processing side of the milk industry and set up an independent board to deal with this issue.  I am not satisfied that some of the things we hoped would happen have transpired. After the previous legislation was passed the Cork District Milk Board and the Dublin District Milk Board were purchased by Progressive Genetics for approximately £4.2 million.  I was glad that a foreign investor did not buy what belonged to the farming community. Farmers built up these milk boards over 35 years, although they were obliged to buy back their own property from the Government.</P>
      <P>There should be a programme of research and development in respect of breeding both on the dairy and the beef side of the industry.  Research and development is very important, irrespective of what line one is in.  I am worried by the amount of Holstein blood being introduced to the milk herd.  The more Holstein blood, the poorer the quality of beef.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  However, we can have just as good a breed if we mix the British Friesian with the Holstein rather than allowing the Holstein to take over.  No research is available to anyone, including the Department, to indicate what is happening. Approximately 85 per cent of our beef is exported.  EU requirements will not be in keeping with the Holstein breed.  Holsteins cannot supply the beef required by the export market &mdash; I say that with authority.  I appeal to the Department and Progressive Genetics to come together to establish a proper programme of research and development to ensure that we do not have too high a level of Holstein blood in the national herd.</P>
      <P>I refer to the question of discounting milk in supermarkets.  A board has now been given the responsibly to carry out certain functions in relation to this issue. Dunnes Stores has made several attempts to damage the liquid market and liquid producers.  It has developed its own brand of milk that is produced in Northern Ireland which is not under the jurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry as far as producers are concerned, or under the jurisdiction of any board.  It processes it in Donegal to cover the company under legislation and it distributes it to its supermarkets across the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company is trying to set up a monopoly side by side with discounting. Two litres of milk is selling for about £1.12 in its stores while elsewhere the cost is £1.28.  I would not mind that if producers from the Republic were allowed space in these supermarkets. Space should be allowed in those supermarkets for milk produced and processed in our own country.  The company wants Irish farmers to attend their supermarkets, it wants the people employed in the milk industry to buy in its own supermarkets but it will not allow them to sell their produce in the <Col N="1882" /> supermarkets.  That is Dunnes' Stores and I object to that.</P>
    <P>The company has made at least two attempts, one very abortive attempt three years ago, to set up a monopoly. We did not allow it but, unfortunately, it got around that legislation by supplying milk from Northern Ireland and processing it in Donegal.  That very sad situation must be highlighted.  The Minister is setting up this new board.  That is, and should be, their function.  I do not mind any processor or producer selling in any supermarket provided others are given the same opportunities particularly those whose products are imported.  I describe that milk as imported and I am correct in stating that.</P>
    <P>The question of price has been a slightly vexed one for some time.  The Minister is here today because the processors did not get their way.  Senator Kiely has already alluded to the price. Up to 1 November, manufacturing milk was fetching a higher price than liquid milk.  Dublin city in particular can be grateful to a large number of liquid milk producers who supplied this city in bad days and good with a very high quality milk, and they have continued to do so. They found themselves in a situation at the end of this year where the price of liquid milk fell below the price of manufacturing milk.  It is considerably cheaper to produce manufacturing milk because it can be produced in the summertime. As regards liquid milk, the farmer is under contract to the processors and must supply 40 per cent of his or her quota during the five winter months.  That is a restriction and cows must be calved in the fall of the year.</P>
    <P>The Minister is in this House today because the processors have been most unfair.  They have failed to put their house in order.  All that has happened in the last two months is that the price of manufacturing milk and liquid milk has been put on a par.  How long will the liquid milk producers continue to supply high quality milk when they find they can produce their quota as manufacturing milk in the summer without any <Col N="1883" /> feeding of their cows?  That must be looked into.</P>
    <P>I fully support what the Minister is doing and I hope Senator Kiely's fears will not come to pass and that the board's functions will be carried out as laid down by law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>This is relatively uncontentious legislation and I do not intend to detain the Minister or the House.  I support what the Minister is attempting to do and I understand the reasons for it.  Extra time is required to allow a truly democratic process to take place so that the milk producers can be properly represented on the board of the agency. However, I wonder &mdash; this is something to which Senator Kiely referred &mdash; about the status of legislation we put through the House and how it should apply.  There is a certain degree of retrospection about what is before us today. This matter dates back to 1988.  There is no need to catalogue the reasons for the original legislation which was concerned with European regulations.  It would be charitable to state that the original Bill enjoyed a leisurely passage through the House.</P>
      <P>I remember the House discussed the matter in 1991.  Very serious concerns were raised then by the staff of the milk boards, including those at the testing station in Enfield.  Much discussion took place in relation to the maintenance of pension rights, the transfer of staff and the maintenance of their status.  It took a considerable period to resolve those matters.  The House did not deal with the next session of the Bill until October 1994.  It seems that liquid milk becomes a matter of concern to Seanad Éireann, on an annual basis, in the weeks preceding Christmas.  I hope this Bill will bring the matter to a conclusion and that we will not have a further instalment before next Christmas.  I say this on the basis that we will all be here then.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that time is needed to allow producers to negotiate contracts.  Such matters are not easily resolved.  Section 7 of the Bill states that the agency shall maintain a register of contracts, a register of producers &mdash; in which shall be entered particulars of every producer who is a party to a registered contract &mdash; and a register of processors. There is a distinction between the register of contracts and that of producers, who will elect the farmer representatives to the agency.  What progress has been made in respect of the register of contracts?  When it is stated that only 40 people from a total of 5,000 are registered, is that in respect of the register of contracts or producers?  I am sure the Minister will deal with that matter when replying to the debate.</P>
      <P>The issue of adequate compensation and price was raised earlier.  I do not have to explain that it is an expensive and difficult process to produce liquid winter milk.  It costs much more and people should be adequately rewarded or they will switch to manufacturing milk.  If the agency was established by law, why did the IFA feel obliged to conduct a campaign to have the price increased?  When achieved, that price increase was not put in place unilaterally. Various co-ops passed the award on to farmers in November or December and others backdated it.  I do not understand that process, in the context of this legislation, and it should be explained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The boards did an excellent job and, other than by compulsion of European law, there was no need for change. However, we must accept that this was <Col N="1885" /> required and we were obliged to comply. I do not object to what the Minister is attempting under this Bill.  I support it.  However, I would like to see the elections conducted promptly.</P>
    <P>In terms of all agricultural legislation to establish boards or agencies, we receive legitimate requests for farmer representation.  I recall that this happened when the Bord Bia Bill was before the House.  If such requests are to be taken seriously, measures are required to ensure the registration of the electorate.  There must be a followup process.  Otherwise one begins to question the commitment to the establishment of the agencies and to securing representation on them.</P>
    <P>From what I understand from the IFA, only about 40 producers were registered out of an estimated 5,000 milk producers on 1 November.  I accept what they say, an election in 1995 would be ludicrous on that basis.  Why has it taken so long to get to this point?</P>
    <P>When we make provisions here, we make them as we did earlier today with the Harbours Bill, 1995.  We give them consideration and take them seriously. When legislation is seriously considered there is an onus to follow up and make sure its provisions are implemented.</P>
    <P>The boards did a good job and we accept the reasons they had to be changed.  Liquid milk production is a particular type of production and I agree with Senator D'Arcy who said people must be adequately compensated.</P>
    <P>I also agree with Senator D'Arcy's views on Holstein blood.  It would be regrettable from the overall industry point of view, not only the dairy sector but also the beef, if Holstein blood was to become dominant within the whole dairy herd.  When CAP reform is taken into account, the impetus to individual cow production and this high individual productivity is not quite as severe as it was five or ten years ago.  The same type of pressure is not in operation and it is necessary that there is balance within the breeding system to ensure Holstein <Col N="1886" /> blood does not become dominant within the herd.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senators for their contributions which were longer here than in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Senator Rory Kiely raised the issue of start up difficulties.  Unfortunately, there was an unavoidable delay in acquainting producers and processors with the new procedures.  As he knows, outside the Cork and Dublin districts the procedures were new to a large number of suppliers so it took some time to create an awareness among producers and processors.  Thankfully, we have now resolved those difficulties.</P>
      <P>There was a dispute between producers and processors over price, producers would not sign contracts so they could not be registered.  As Senator D'Arcy said, this matter has now been more or less resolved and I hope we can make progress.  In addition, there was consultation about a standard contract and this issue is also now largely resolved.</P>
      <P>There are 879 producers registered and more are expected to be registered shortly.  I am delighted to tell the House that all the processors in County Kerry are registered.</P>
      <P>Senator D'Arcy, who is a producer and processor, raised the issue of discounting the price of milk which is not a matter for the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry as I told him previously.  It is more a matter for the Director of Consumer Affairs and market forces.  We cannot prohibit imports of drinking milk from Northern Ireland or, for that matter, from any other part of the EU.  The last thing Ireland wants is arbitrary controls on inter-Union trade which would be totally against our interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1994 Act exempts from its provisions milk imported lawfully into the State.  This has led to fears being expressed in some quarters that the legislation leaves the way open for cheap imported milk from Northern <Col N="1887" /> Ireland.  This view is without foundation as there is nothing to suggest that the agency's operations are significantly altering the situation which pertained in the industry before the legislation became law.  In any event, there is no possibility that the European Commission would allow us to insert any provision which would inhibit trade in the Internal Market, such as licensing systems for imports which some have suggested.</P>
    <P>With regard to milk prices, it has been and might be argued that in requiring the agency to take account of the supply price as one of the factors in deciding whether a contract should be registered, the 1994 Act effectively provides for the re-establishment of a minimum producer price.  We do not accept this view nor do we accept that the agency should become involved in fixing minimum prices.  The price paid for milk is a commercial matter between producers and pasteurisers.  Under the agency regime this continues to be the case.  The only role the agency has in relation to price is to determine whether it is adequate to ensure supply throughout the year. Producer organisations favour involving the agency and the Minister in the process of fixing prices and that is something the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry cannot countenance.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis asked about registers. Three separate registers are maintained by the agency: a register of contracts between all producers and processors, a register of producers and a register of processors.  Once the agency has registered a contract, it proceeds to register the producer and the processor involved in that contract unless, of course, they are already registered by virtue of a previous contract.  Generally, each producer will be a party to only one contract while a processor will be a party to hundreds or even thousands.  However, each party will be registered only once.</P>
    <P>I seek the Seanad's support for this Bill.  It received unanimous support in the Dáil and I hope it will receive a similar response in this House.</P>

We are talking about adequate compensation and it is up to the producer to supply the milk as economically as possible.  I have been a liquid milk producer and a beef producer. Liquid milk can be produced more economically from Holstein cows than from British Friesians.  We can have a discussion about beef on another occasion.  There is also a reference to supermarkets.  I understand that the profit supermarkets make on a gallon of milk is nearly the same as the price the producer is paid for that gallon of milk.</P>

    <P>There is so much emphasis on the Dublin and Cork Milk Marketing Boards that one would imagine these are the only two areas which supplied liquid milk.

Will liquid milk producers who have applied to be registered be informed before 1 April 1996 whether they will be registered?

      <P>This is a technical amendment to correct an oversight in the original drafting.  We wish to add the definition of &ldquo;development&rdquo; as stated in the amendment.  The reference is to development land. Section 2 (6) of the State Authorities (Development and Management) Act, 1993 defines &ldquo;development&rdquo; as &ldquo;...the carrying out of any works on, in or under land or the making of any material change in the use of any structures or other land.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The proposition that the commissioners undertake work was referred to in the Bill initiated in this House by my party and later voted down.  It was again referred to in the Bill taken later by the Minister, but that Bill was not amended even though we made certain proposals in this regard.  While the amendment and the section does not directly relate to this matter, they reflect, to some extent, our view that there were complications with regard to what was being decided by the Department at that time.  It would appear that although the Department had six months to deal with this issue, it still had to introduce amendments at this late stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are the proposed amendments now the final solution to the problems with this Bill?  I hope the Minister will understand why we have put down amendments, <Col N="1893" /> and that we have put much time and effort into dealing with what may or may not be in the best interests of the country with regard to flooding in 1995 and in previous years.  I also hope the Minister will respond positively to our approach today.  If so, he can be assured of full co-operation from this side of the House.</P>

      <P>The Senator can take it that, to the best of our belief and the advice we have received, the amendment would make section 1 as perfect as we can make it.  With regard to his comments on his amendments, we recognise that the Senator, Senator Daly and others, have put thought and time into this issue.  We propose to accept some of the amendments.  Some we are not willing to accept, but we can discuss these in a constructive fashion as we proceed.</P>

      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), line 11, after &ldquo;have&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;, and be deemed always to have had,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 12 states:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (4), lines 1 and 2, to delete &ldquo;all such incidental, supplemental, ancillary and consequential&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;, and be deemed always to have had, all such&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The addition of the words &ldquo;and be deemed always to have had&rdquo; in these <Col N="1894" /> sections simply validates actions carried out by the commissioners in good faith over the years.  I understand it is a standard provision where legislation has to be introduced to, in effect, restore powers which a State authority was thought to have had.  It is an important protection, not only for the State authority but also for anyone who may have made agreements with it as it gives a sure legal basis for such agreements.</P>
    <P>In the case of amendment No. 12, the parliamentary draftsman has, on further reflection, suggested the rewording of this section to provide that the commissioners have all of the powers necessary to perform their functions as defined in the Bill rather than just incidental, supplemental, ancillary and consequential powers.  He has also advised that subsection (1)(a) of section 3 should be deleted.  The net effect of these combined changes is to give a tidier wording to the Bill.  They do not alter the powers being given to the commissioners from those which were originally proposed.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Government amendment No. 3:</P>

      <P>This amendment simply tidies up the wording suggested by the parliamentary draftsman after he had more time to reflect on the original text.

I intended to put down an amendment with regard to some type of independent arbitration system but the Minister is the final arbiter in these matters.  The Minister of Finance has a particular interest in the expenditure of public finances and great care should be taken to ensure spurious applications are not considered.

      <P>The parliamentary draftsman advised that this provision is unnecessary as section 2 defines the functions of the commissioners.  Subsection 2 (a) as amended provides that it shall be, and be deemed always to have been, a function of the commissioners to acquire, maintain and dispose of land and interests or rights in or over land and other property of any type and an interest in such other property for use by the State, the commissioners and other State authorities or any other persons specified by the Minister.  The parliamentary draftsman further advised that there is a legal presumption that where a function is confirmed, the powers necessary to carry it out are also confirmed and therefore this measure is superfluous.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1) (c), line 21, after &ldquo;kind,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;where this is necessary, but only necessary, as a result of flooding,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment relates to the powers of the commissioners to demolish buildings, structures or other works or property of any type.  Perhaps clarification from the Minister will solve my difficulty. The Minister referred yesterday to his functions and those of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht. I previously dealt with the unsatisfactory nature of that arrangement whereby different Ministers deal with different parts of the activities of the Office of Public Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday the Minister mentioned the allowances which will be made for the demolition of, for example, a dwelling house, which will form part of the compensation package.  This is reasonable and it is good it is included in the Bill.  The Minister also made the point that people could carry out the demolition of their own accord.  However, it appears the provision is drafted with particular sets of circumstances in mind. <Col N="1898" /> It does not appear to relate to the other activities of the Office of Public Works. It appears to confer a power on the commissioners, not just in respect of damage caused by flooding or natural disaster but, for example, if they decided in the morning they wanted to demolish Leinster House they could do so.  This is my concern about what I regard as a wide power which is being given to the commissioners.  It is not the narrower power the Minister wishes them to have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the main reasons behind the provision in section 3 (1) (c) is to permit the demolition of houses damaged by flooding.  However, there are other circumstances, for example, site clearance for the development of Government buildings, such as Garda stations and social welfare offices, where this power would be required.  The amendment is inadvisable as it would restrict the commissioners in the performance of their normal functions. In any event, demolition is subject to the normal controls under planning legislation to which the Office of Public Works is required to adhere.</P>
      <P>This Bill has two main functions &mdash; to deal with the humanitarian aid for flooding and the various schemes associated with that and to clarify once and for all the powers of the commissioners in their widest sense.  Those powers were found wanting in the case of Mullaghmore. The Bill is not just to deal with flooding but also the general powers of the commissioners.  I could not accept such a restrictive amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise there are circumstances in which the commissioners should be able to act.  I am prepared to accept the wording I have drafted may be two restrictive but what is in the Bill is far too liberal in terms of what it will allow the commissioners to do.  The Minister has confirmed my fears that they will have very wide discretion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are subject to the law as concerns the demolition of certain buildings but the Bill gives them inordinate powers <Col N="1899" /> to interfere at their will in matters which, at the least, should be under the scrutiny of the Oireachtas.  If the Bill provided that such matters should be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas before work is done that would be acceptable.  From what the Minister has said I am confirmed in my belief that the State can carry on to get rid of buildings it does not like.</P>

      <P>I am guided by the Chair, but I would have thought amendments Nos. 7 and 8 had something in common.  I appreciate Senator Dardis' point.  I do not believe the Office of Public Works will demolish all before it. However, we would like safeguards in the legislation.  Senator Daly proposes a safety valve in amendment No. 8 whereby the local authorities and the Heritage Council might have a say.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at the concern expressed.  The Office of Public Works is involved in a multiplicity of building projects around the country.  In some instances demolition is a normal and necessary part of its work.  There is nothing in this Bill which gives the Office of Public Works any power in addition to that which it thought it had. In addition, it is now subject to the full rigours of the planning laws.  One might as well limit their powers to erect certain buildings in certain places.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Office of Public Works, as the agent of the State in providing public buildings, etc., needs the basic power to demolish a building that is in the way of a new building, subject to the normal restrictions laid down by the planning authorities.  I do not think there is any danger.  If this was a wide power which they could sweepingly adopt, irrespective of any considerations of planning, the Senator would be right but that is not the case.  In the circumstances I cannot accept the amendment as it is much too restrictive &mdash; we would have to return to seek new powers under another Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Office of Public Works as currently constituted has no malicious intent.  It would be wrong to suggest otherwise, it does its job well and we have only to look around the Chamber to see its work. What concerns me is that the legislation as it stands confers powers on it. Senator Daly's amendment is related and possibly could have been discussed with this one.  What he suggested covers adequately what I have in mind &mdash; there must be some measure of restriction in the law.  I accept the current position but we are framing the law for future Governments and we cannot anticipate what attitude they might take.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1) (c), line 21, after &ldquo;kind,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;after consultation with the relevant planning authority, heritage or cultural authority.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is related to the last discussion and there is no point in prolonging the debate &mdash; I almost said agony.  It is necessary to have at least a consultation process before demolition, especially if one is talking about demolition of important buildings which may well be listed as having special attractions.  The Minister of State is aware that from time to time, because of flooding, bridges and <Col N="1901" /> other important constructions had to be demolished, which caused other problems. The commissioners' technical staff will advise the Minister that solving one problem can sometimes create another, possibly greater one.</P>
    <P>While I sympathise with Senator Dardis I was not fully prepared to remove the demolition powers because that would negative the process. However, in connection with important buildings which possibly are listed, it may be necessary to consult the Heritage Council, another cultural authority or the planning authority, which may have listed a building or construction for a reason and may not wish to see it demolished.  The Minister should have a mechanism whereby consultation or discussion would take place before that would proceed.</P>
    <P>I do not expect this would be used widely or that it would frustrate the commissioners in their work.  It would be used on occasions where it would be obvious to the people involved in the demolition that there was a special building, construction or monument which should not be removed without at least consulting the Heritage Council or the local planning authority which may have listed it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I also voice my concern. I accept the intentions behind this are honourable and echo Senator Dardis's tribute to the Office of Public Works for its fine work here and elsewhere.  I am concerned, however, at the way we are going through this as if it simply tidies up powers already exercised.  While Senator Dardis's amendment may have been too restrictive the principle underlying Senator Daly's is one on which one hopes there is agreement.  On a point of information, is it already required of the office to engage in consultation of this type?  Does it already do that or is this something new that will be required of them?  The explanatory document says the Bill does not provide for additional powers or functions other than those already exercised.  Is the office required to consult before it <Col N="1902" /> engages in demolition work of this type? It may be, in changed circumstances and it would be wise to include that at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works are now fully subject to the provisions of the planning Acts.  This means that where they propose to demolish a building unless it is an exempted development they will have to seek planning permission from the appropriate local authority in the same way as any other citizen or organisation. It would not be fair or reasonable to impose an additional statutory duty on the commissioners.  In practice, considerable informal consultation takes place.</P>
      <P>With regard to consultation with heritage and cultural authorities, any building worthy of protection or preservation will be listed in the local authority development plan.  This ensures their demolition will require planning permission. This is the appropriate mechanism for a statutory consultation with such bodies.  The commissioners also have a good record of informal consultation with statutory and non-statutory bodies interested in the heritage.</P>
      <P>We have to get planning permission for practically everything we do.  The only exceptions are with regard to security of State prisons and the Houses of the Oireachtas.  If these buildings have any heritage value, which they invariably have, consultation will certainly take place.</P>
      <P>I am not against the spirit of what has been suggested but it is superfluous to include in the Bill something we already do.  The requirement to comply with the planning Acts has been superimposed on the Office of Public Works.  Therefore, we are adequately safeguarded in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's point.  We do not want to put in a new planning structure just for the sake of it.  The requirement on the Office of Public Works to go through the planning process is welcome.  Unfortunately, <Col N="1903" /> it was not there ten years ago.  If it was, we might not have wasted as much money as we have recently, but that is not the Minister's fault; he was not in this portfolio at the time.  A great deal of money has been wasted recently and all public representatives, whether they be county councillors, Senators, or Deputies may be to blame.  If we had put our house in order some years ago, the situation might have been different.</P>
      <P>The amendment we want is not to planning but to the heritage content of the Bill.  The only current safeguard for those buildings is if they are listed in each county's development plan.  There are two pages of buildings listed in my county's development plan but if one asked the councillors to name them, they may only be able to list up to six. We have not taken an interest in the heritage of certain buildings.  While these buildings may not have been demolished, their entrance structures, which are just as important and give a good message as to what lies within, have been interfered with, removed, replaced, bought and moved by those who can afford it.  In some cases, they were sold by agents of the State.  For example, the Land Commission has sold entrance structures to individuals.</P>
      <P>While the Office of Public Works has to go through the planning process, would another process, such as consultation with heritage bodies, be necessary, other than just listing these buildings in county development plans?  That is the intent here.  I am not sure whether our amendment is the solution but there is a view on this side that maybe there is some need for written consultation. We do not seem to have that at the moment apart from the one area I have identified in our county development plan.  Perhaps the Minister can enlighten us if there are other areas where a consultation process takes place.</P>

      <P>The Minister has gone some way towards allaying our fears. However, I will give him an example. Section 3 (1) (c) states, &ldquo;to demolish <Col N="1904" /> buildings or structures or other works or other property of any kind.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Grand Canal outside Athy is a natural heritage area which, to my mind, means that you do not interfere with it. Yesterday we discussed the need for an environmental impact assessment for a river like the Barrow if some work was to be done on it.  The Office of Public Works was able to clean up the river banks and it looks very well from a superficial point of view.  The banks are now graded and the top has been levelled but there is no grass there.</P>
      <P>If it is a natural heritage area how is it possible to conduct that sort of work without any reference to anybody?  I do not know of any consultation that took place in respect of that work.  Would this allow the Office of Public Works to demolish a bridge on that stretch of the canal if that was what they thought they should do?</P>

      <P>I wish to divert the Senator's attention from that point, which I will come back to.  One of the issues Senator Dardis raised, which is relevant and has caused a lot of confusion, concerns what is happening <i>visà-vis</i> the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and the Office of Public Works.

Anything the Office of Public Works proposed to do in those areas since I came into office has &mdash; because of this ongoing switch &mdash; been subject to a double check.  The Office of Public Works does its own work, it relates to the planning authorities and then has to obtain sanction from the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht which, in turn, is speaking to the new Heritage Council.  Far from being a limited form of control, there is at least an extra layer of control and concern from the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.</P>

      <P>I do not necessarily agree with every aspect of what was done but the decisions were made and the transfer is taking place.  Because of the nature of the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht there is, conceivably, a sharper focus on the things the Senator is talking about than might have been apparent in a wider body like the Office of Public Works.  I am not saying that is the case, but the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht certainly ought to focus on protecting the heritage areas being transferred to it.  I would like Senators to bear that in mind.  There is an increasing focus on environmental considerations and the protection of our heritage which is going to be almost entirely under the control of the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht which may on occasion use the services of the Office of Public Works, but only under specific instruction and control.  Heritage will be well protected in those circumstances, irrespective of how we reached this point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given us fairly firm assurances that the commissioners will have close consultation with planning authorities, certainly on an informal basis.  Nevertheless, there is a view that since legislation was introduced <Col N="1906" /> as a result of the Mullaghmore issue, there is a need to further strengthen it.  That is why we wish to include this provision.  Long before the Commissioners of Public Works negotiated a site for Mullaghmore, they were in consultation with and got approval from the planning authority to locate the building in an area which caused much controversy.  It is well known that consultation took place with the Clare planning authority, which was satisfied with that site, before the decision was taken.</P>
      <P>A provision should be included in legislation so that consultation would take place, particularly in view of what the Minister said.  It is more important now given the transfer of responsibilities to the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  Rather than arguing against this amendment, the Minister argued in favour of it because the responsibility has been divided and the issue is in a haphazard state.  I will not comment on what the Government is doing in this area because it is so convoluted. As far as I am aware, no regulations have been made to transfer responsibilities in a statutory way to the different Departments.  If the Minister assures us that the amendment is not necessary, I will not press it.</P>

When I moved to this Department the decisions had been taken but they had not been implemented.  I was in limbo because Deputies and Senators wrote to me about heritage issues but I had to refer them to a Minister who was about to accept responsibility for them.  That confusion is coming to an end.  Much care and control will be exercised by the <Col N="1907" /> Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht in relation to heritage.  That is the Department which should be responsible for heritage, although not everyone would agree.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(f) to carry out a scheme of drainage maintenance on the main channel and tributaries of the River Shannon,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is in response to a situation that has prevailed for a long time and with which we now have the opportunity to deal.  I have proposed the carrying out of a scheme of drainage maintenance on the main channel and tributaries of the River Shannon.</P>
      <P>There is a very good reason this amendment should be taken on board by the Government.  It is established that the River Shannon is one of the finest waterways, if not the finest, in Europe.  The Shannon is used by up to 100,000 people annually for different purposes and has a catchment area of 250,000 acres, yet that stretch of river is not maintained.  It is an extraordinary situation and the Government and the Office of Public Works should take this matter on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Approximately 70,000 acres of peat-lands drain directly or indirectly into the <Col N="1908" /> Shannon, 50,000 drain directly and approximately 20,000 acres drain through the River Suck.  This alone creates a massive build up of silt in the River Shannon.  It is not possible to continue to drain 70,000 acres annually into this river over a period of 20 or 30 years as happened previously.  Massive peat development has taken place in the midlands and the west where 70,000 acres have been developed and drained.  The farming community in the 250,000 acre catchment area of the Shannon and its tributaries, have availed and are availing of grant aid to drain and improve their lands, yet that same channel that runs right through the middle of the country and eventually between the counties of Limerick and Clare has never been maintained.</P>
    <P>I am attempting to make somebody take on a national responsibility, of maintaining the Shannon.  I am not talking about drainage, I do not propose the removal of any major rock outfall. People use the Shannon every day for their own purposes.  Bord na Móna drains 70,000 acres of land into it, farmers use it to drain 250,000 acres of land, boating people and fishing and leisure groups use it extensively.  At least 100,000 people must be involved in the use of the Shannon.  All the local authorities use it for their sanitary services systems, yet we do not have a single shovel, never mind a single machine, to carry out maintenance on one yard, not to mention one mile, of the River Shannon.</P>
    <P>The Shannon cannot and is not dealing with the major developments that have taken place.  Many of the present drainage and flooding problems are the result of lack of maintenance of the River Shannon.  There has been a massive build up of peat silt at the weir in Meelick.  It is generally acknowledged that there are hundreds of thousands of tonnes of peat stacked up in that section of the river.</P>
    <P>We should not have to request that something be done about the river Shannon in the future.  It is necessary to write into law that the Office of Public <Col N="1909" /> Works can, as it deems fit, carry out a drainage scheme on the River Shannon and its tributaries.  This is the purpose of amendment No. 10.  The solution to providing finance for such a scheme is also incorporated in that amendment.  I do not believe that the interests to which I referred &mdash; and those to which I did not refer &mdash; are entitled to use and abuse one of the finest waterways in Europe without carrying out maintenance on it.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 10 provides for a drainage maintenance scheme to be carried out jointly with another person or body subject to such terms and conditions as the commissioners may determine. The opportunity is included in this amendment for the Office of Public Works to carry out a drainage scheme, in association with bodies such as Bord na Móna, the ESB, farming organisations or local authorities, to ensure that maintenance of the channel takes place. We can no longer allow the river Shannon to be used as an outfall without deciding, as elected representatives, to do something about its maintenance.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the Bill, this House has been presented with the opportunity to ensure that the river will be maintained.  There are few rivers in the country which do not have some type of scheme, or joint scheme, to cater for their maintenance.  However, our finest and greatest river has no such scheme.  We have an opportunity and a responsibility to deal with this matter and we should do so now.  The House should make a unanimous decision that the river Shannon will be maintained from 1996 onward.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the Bill will become law because the provisions it contains are necessary.  I ask that this further provision be included in the Bill to deal with what I consider to be one of the most outstanding problems relating to the River Shannon.  This issue has been discussed many times in both Houses in the past, on the basis that no one would take responsibility for it. Many proposals, forums and joint authorities have inquired with regard to <Col N="1910" /> where that responsibility should lie.  It is everyone's and no one's.  We must ensure that navigation authorities, the ESB and the Office of Public Works become involved in this regard.</P>
    <P>Farmers on both sides of the river must endure flooding and are caught in the middle of the problem.  They have requested, over many years, that the river be maintained and a drainage scheme be put in place.  They have also requested the establishment of a body to oversee water levels, etc., but perhaps that is a matter for another day.  We have an opportunity to deal now with the maintenance of the river.  I hope the Minister will respond positively to amendment No. 9.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case, I apologise to Senator Finneran.  The spirit of Mr. de Valera is only half alive in Senator Finneran.  I can recall fishing for salmon above Meelick Weir thirty years ago.  At that time the water was clear.  I brought a boat from Banagher to Meelick Weir and there was fishing to be had all the way down the river.  This is a slightly different point but it underlines the State's responsibility &mdash; which the Minister has already conceded &mdash; to maintain the waterways in as pristine a condition as possible.  What Bord na Móna did to the River Shannon is disgraceful. At the time, none of us paid a great deal of attention to it and, perhaps, there was a certain casualness and even an inevitability about it, but the way peat was allowed enter the water course, and the damage it did to it and the environment, was wrong.  Perhaps, the State has some responsibility to assist in the type of work on which Senator Finneran commented <Col N="1911" /> and he mentioned the different bodies which might be associated with it.  Given Bord na Móna's financial state, I wonder how it might manage to contribute but we should be concerned about the issue.</P>

      <P>I hoped Senator Lee might tell us something of the history of the non-drainage of the River Shannon and he might do that yet.</P>
      <P>I do not take issue with what Senator Finneran says about the River Shannon. The problems are twofold. If we accepted the amendments which nominate specific projects many Senators would ask me to do the same for the River Blackwater, the River Liffey and a whole host of projects.  This legislation confirms powers which were in question. It gives specific powers to deal with a specific national flooding problem.  It would be inappropriate for me to accept an amendment dealing with one river, albeit the most important river in the country.  We have wide powers under the Arterial Drainage Acts with their 1995 amendments to undertake localised schemes and to maintain them.</P>
      <P>On both scores, I ask Senator Finneran not to press this amendment.  It has nothing to do with the merits of the River Shannon or what he says about it but it would be inappropriate for me to amend this Bill to deal with specific projects.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">

      <P>I cannot give the Senator a categorical assurance about that.  The Office of Public Works has nine priority schemes for local drainage which are already in the design phase and about which I spoke yesterday.  In addition, the Office of Public Works will be preparing a national priority list over the next year.  It would be inconceivable that we would prepare such a list without including the Shannon or its tributaries. That is as far as I can go.  The needs of the Shannon waterways are evident so it would be inconceivable that our largest river and its tributaries would not feature high up on that priority list.</P>

The history of the drainage or non-drainage of the Shannon is very complex and it became something of a national joke over the decades. However, it is not a facetious issue and I was glad to hear what the Minister said in response to Senator Finneran.  He has pointed out a serious problem.  It is a problem now but what will happen if it continues is something we ought not to have to contemplate because it can only get worse.  I hope that what the Minister said will be acted on by the Office of Public Works and that it will make vigorous use of its powers under the Arterial Drainage (Amendment) Act.</P>

I am not in the business of telling people that there might be a crock of gold at the end of the rainbow. Is it the case that the 1995 Act and the Bill will not preclude the opportunity of stretches of the Shannon and its tributaries <Col N="1913" /> being included for maintenance and drainage purposes?

While the Minister gave details yesterday of the state of these works, it was obvious that it would be some time before they would be completed.  On Second Stage we discussed the Gortaclare/Mortycloch area of north Clare on which there have been strong representations and about which the Minister has written to Clare County Council and me.  People in the area fear it will be excluded because of the work being done in Gort and that it will be many years before an investigation is undertaken there.  Is it possible for this area to be included in the Gort investigations?</P>
      <P>The Minister will be aware of representations made by Clare County Council, other bodies and representatives from all parties about the particularly sensitive area of the Burren adjacent to New Quay, which has experienced severe problems.

I understand that the area about which the Senator is speaking is part of a separate catchment area with a similar geology.  The lessons which will be learned from the study for which consultants have been appointed will have wide application to problems in Clare.  While we cannot extend the study area, which is already large, it would be reasonable to suppose that what emerges from the study will inform us of likely solutions to the problems in the areas mentioned by Senator Daly.

There are opportunities for joint approaches in the amended drainage scheme, which I fully support and which should have existed many years ago.  The Commissioners of Public Works do not have full responsibility for the maintenance of the Shannon. Amendment No. 10 is an opportunity for the Minister to deal with this issue in co-operation with other bodies which are as responsible as the commissioners, if not more so, for the maintenance of the Shannon.  Does the Minister see an opportunity for the Office of Public Works to enter a scheme with another body to maintain sections of the Shannon under the Arterial Drainage (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1995, and the Commissioners of Public Works (Functions and Powers) Bill, 1995?</P>

      <P>This amendment is designed to achieve three purposes.  It provides that where the commissioners are entering land adjoining land which they are dealing with under a humanitarian assistance scheme, they must secure the consent of the owner, which will not be unreasonably withheld.  It replaces the phrase &ldquo;person concerned&rdquo; in line 38 with the more precise phrase &ldquo;person affected&rdquo;; it replaces the phrase &ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;or the carrying out of any such operation.&rdquo; with the phrase &ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;or the carrying out by the members or agents of any operations on the land.&rdquo;.  The amendment also gives a more precise wording to the subsection without changing the original intention.  It was appreciated that, with regard to the humanitarian schemes where we would, for example, be entering to demolish a house, in some situations we may have to cross the land of somebody else and we would have to get permission to do so.

I realise that Senator Daly has some <Col N="1917" /> further amendments which relate to my concern.  When we debated the National Heritage Council legislation, there was much discussion on the possible damage that might be caused to property by a JCB which may be used by the Director of the National Museum &mdash; not that the director would presume to put a JCB onto an archaeological sight, but one never knows.  However, there was a potential damage to land and my concern was that people would not be compensated. I commend the provision for compensation here, but I am worried about the right to appeal.  If people do not agree with the levels of compensation being awarded, what recourse have they?</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">

While I agreed with the county council, had I not agreed I could have gone to independent arbitration, and I would only have had to have recourse to the courts if the arbitration was not to my satisfaction.  There needs to be an informal vehicle of this kind, an independent arbitrator, whereby people have the right to make an application to some body or person &mdash; even perhaps the Minister &mdash; within a specified period on the basis that they are not content with the award that has been made.</P>

      <P>During the discussion on the amendment and on Second Stage, we dealt mainly with problems relating to the flooding of private dwellings and lands and buildings associated with farms and farm dwellings.  There have been serious problems with the flooding of business premises in some towns.  It is not clear, especially with the removal of subsection (a), whether there is a method for dealing with businesses in small towns, such as Ennis, which were severely flooded during the crisis, lost an amount of business and suffered substantial damage to property.  I am not clear whether it is beyond doubt that buildings connected with the operation of small businesses in towns which experienced flooding are covered under this section.</P>

      <P>Yesterday I spoke about the functions and powers given to the commissioners under this Bill.  The Bill relates mainly to flooding and many Senators made excellent contributions on that issue.  However, these are general powers.  I listened carefully to the Minister's reply, particularly as it related to paragraph (c), and I hope we do not live to see the provisions abused in any way.</P>

      <P>During the debate, Senator Finneran mentioned the possibility of joint schemes between private persons, the Office of Public Works and/or local authorities.  I have written letters recently about a small number of drains that could be worked on by the Office of Public Works.  They are too big to be included in a local authority improvement scheme and too large to be looked after by private land owners. The replies one gets from the Office of Public Works are very negative.  It seems they do not take account of the extra powers given to them in 1995. They should look more closely at some of the schemes which involve co-operation between the county council, the local authority, landowners and the Office of Public Works.  Their replies indicate that they have not reassessed the schemes under the old Act.</P>

      <P>I assure Senator Henry there is absolutely no question of the power of demolition being used in an excessive fashion.  It is a normal, necessary power for the Office of Public Works, which is involved in a wide range of projects for which it has the power to demolish a building to create another.  The Office of Public Works is subject in full to the planning Acts and the Senator can be assured the provision will not be abused.</P>
      <P>In relation to the two contributions about local drainage schemes, partnerships, etc, the Office of Public Works must send a loud and clear message that it is not taking over every drainage problem from local authorities.  It does not have the resources to do so.  Within the constraints facing every Department, we have identified nine priority areas and those schemes are all in the preparation stage.  Construction of the first scheme in Sixmilebridge should commence in the spring and the others should commence later next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This work has put pressure on staff resources in the Office of Public Works, but, while it is ongoing, we are commencing the process of identifying a national priority list for the years ahead.  In the <Col N="1921" /> interim period, it is impossible to take on board local drainage problems which may arise.  It takes time and we want to do this in an orderly way and prioritise matters.  Those judgments are subjective and it will be difficult to satisfy everybody but I hope we will approach it in an orderly and sensible manner.  The proposals will be considered on their merits and a number of schemes will be carried out each year.  I will fight for the resources available for that purpose because the work is necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) The Commissioners may arrange for the provision of buildings and offices other than living accommodation as may be agreed upon by the Commissioners at any place.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I should have put down this amendment to section 2 as it attempts to deal with the matter mentioned by the Minister of State a moment ago regarding giving authority to the commissioners to deal with buildings apart from private dwellings.  Many small businesses were seriously affected by the flooding, particularly in Ennis where for many days people were put out of business.  In common with some of those affected in Gort and other areas, they did not have the capacity to recover from the loss of income and damage to their properties caused by the floods.</P>
      <P>While I support the principle of relocating people in private accommodation, there is an equal responsibility in relation to small businesses which suffered serious damage in terms of their income and which were almost put out of business.  Something should be done for these people and this aspect is not covered in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 (1) gives the Commissioners of Public Works the power to formulate what has been referred to as humanitarian assistance schemes.  The wording of the measure is quite broad and would cover the provision of buildings and offices if the Government decided they should be included in a scheme.</P>
      <P>Section 4 is specific in that it provides that a housing authority, in effect, a local authority, can provide houses acting as agents for the commissioners.  It is a tightly drawn section.  It would not be appropriate to ask local authorities to become involved in providing offices or other buildings as they have no statutory role or expertise in that regard.  I assure the Senator it is covered under section 2 (1).  We accept what the Senator is saying but we do not consider it appropriate to include it in a section dealing with local authority housing.</P>

      <P>When the Office of Public Works asks the local authority to carry out a housing project on its behalf, is that done on a temporary or permanent basis?  If it is on a temporary basis and the local authority buys a building or property and the Office of Public Works compensates those involved, will the local authority be left saddled with the property?  Will the ratepayers have to pay for the property they would have acquired in the first instance?</P>

      <P>In this instance the local authorities would act purely as agents of the Office of Public Works and would be remunerated in full for what they do.  They would not be working under the housing Acts in the normal fashion.  This provision would be very specific.  These powers would be unlikely to arise but in no case would the local authorities' finances be impaired by them.</P>

      <P>I wish to be parochial for a moment.  The Office of Public Works uses machines on floats to clean lakes by cutting the weeds.  I understand there are a number of such machines in the Dublin region but there are none in County Mayo or in the west.  I ask the Minister of State to use his good offices to ensure we get a machine in the northwest area.  There are probably more lakes in County Mayo than any other county.  I ask the Minister of State to get one of the machines to carry out works in the Castlebar lakes in particular.</P>

      <P>I understand there are a number of canals and stretches of rivers which have a problem with a particular type of weed.  Experiments are taking place and machinery has been brought in from England in some cases to deal with it.  This poses a major problem for tourism on the River Shannon in one particular region at the Lake Gara canal.  None of the brochures now mentions the canal because the boating <Col N="1924" /> companies had run into problems with the weed fouling propellers.  The matter should be dealt with even if technology has to be imported.  Perhaps the Minister would look into the matter.  Perhaps he and his officials could take note of it and come back at another point; it may not apply to section 5.  We should not allow a position to develop where the tourist trade will decide, as seems to be the case at present, this may be what concerned Senator Burke also.  The officials should look at this problem.</P>

      <P>As the Senator said I was not prepared for this but my officials know something about it. Apparently this weed is resistant to any chemical which has been tried.  I am told the Office of Public Works co-operates with the Central Fisheries Board in the area of weed control in rivers and the canal in question is regularly dredged, although that does not necessarily solve the weed problem.  Does the Senator know whether this manifested itself after the hot summer or&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It has been a problem for five or six years.  In fairness to the Office of Public Works, it introduced a machine which cut the weeds and sent them by conveyor belt onto the land.  It has not resolved the problem so perhaps it could be taken up again.  I understood research was being done in another country and a machine was being brought in.</P>

These have been difficult times for the Office of Public Works and the morale of some staff suffered because of the chopping and changing which took place.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I asked the Minister about the possibility of extending the gas pipeline to the midlands and I especially mentioned Mullingar, which has a population of 15,000. While most other towns of comparable size have benefited from the decentralisation of sections of Departments in recent years, Mullingar has not been included.  I presume the main reason for this has been its proximity to Dublin, although principal towns in counties closer to Dublin were fortunate enough to benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mullingar is the principal town of County Westmeath and the midlands. From that point of view, I ask the Minister if he would undertake a feasibility study in extending the gas pipeline &mdash; it already goes to Leixlip and Maynooth &mdash; to Mullingar and other major towns in the midlands region.  In other words, when he announced yesterday in the House that the line was being extended to Shannon, Ennis and into Galway, it was not highlighted that the ring line could come back into Loughrea, Ballinasloe, Athlone and Mullingar to meet the line from Leixlip to Maynooth.  I would ask the Minister to consider my proposal to have a feasibility study done when the line is being put in place in the Clare, Limerick and Galway areas. Maybe this line could be brought back <Col N="1928" /> to have its own ring line thus bringing cheaper energy to the region which would entice more manufacturers to the area and boost employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>The criteria BG uses for the extension of the gas network are commercial laid down in the Gas Act which established Bord Gáis. That being said, I have asked BG to undertake a study to establish how, given that criteria, they can extend the network to a number of towns.  While I did not mention Mullingar, I would see that town as a primary objective of the study.  I thank Senator Cassidy for raising the case of Mullingar with me.  I will again convey to BG my desire for them to find a commercial basis for extending the pipeline there.  That is not beyond the wit of man.  With their excellent record, BG can find the means to fund that and make it a commercial reality. I look forward to the response to that study.</P>
      <P>In my contribution yesterday I mentioned a number of towns including Tralee, Ennis, Shannon and Galway.  It would be a logical extension for it to come back through the midlands and join up with the Dublin line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very detailed area and I do not wish to pin down the Minister of State on any particular issue. However, he will be aware that on a number of occasions announcements were made about the extension of the gas line to Shannon.  Amounts were mentioned and apparently Government approval was given at some stage.  There is still grave doubt about whether it is proposed to extend it, even though further studies have been undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue has been going on for some time.  Given the necessity for and desirability of industrial development, airport development and the development of Shannon town itself, there is no question this will take place.  In spite of the fact that we have had several announcements by various Ministers over four or <Col N="1929" /> five years, we still have not seen an indication of any positive proposal to deal with that.  Perhaps the Minister can clarify the current situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, I have asked BG as a matter of urgency to undertake a study to establish how, within the commercial criteria they are bound by within the Gas Act, they can meet the desire of the House, and indeed of the Government, to extend the pipeline.  I cannot put it more strongly than that. There is widespread demand from people currently outside the gas network to have a supply.  It means a huge boom to the economy and to the comfort of those who obtain this supply domestically.  Commercially and industrially it makes a huge difference to what can be done in those areas.  I will certainly take the message from the House and will send it directly to Bord Gáis.  As soon as I have word on that report I will convey it to the two Senators who raised the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to indicate the state of negotiations between unions and management in the ESB in relation to rationalisation.  There is anxiety among the staff about future restructuring and the prospect of fairly severe job losses.  I am particularly interested in Moneypoint.  At present 400 to 500 people are employed in Moneypoint, mainly on a full-time basis but with some part-time staff as well. Indications from the negotiations are that the workforce may be reduced to 250.</P>
      <P>That that would be a catastrophic reduction in the workforce in an area which is underdeveloped and with few other job opportunities.  There is considerable concern among the families of ESB personnel about their future.  Many young families have only recently moved into the west Clare area.  They now feel threatened because of these new arrangements.  I am aware that agreement will be reached between unions and management but there is anxiety in the local community about the effects of the rationalisation.  Will the Minister clarify the present state of play?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The section we are dealing with relates to the ESB superannuation scheme.  It makes a minor change to the scheme to allow members of the ESB who are elected to the Oireachtas not to be disadvantaged from a pension point of view.  However, I take Senator Daly's point.  He is probably aware that, by and large, agreement has been reached between the Department, the ESB and the unions through a tripartite system. That process must be completed and unions members must be balloted on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the ESB does not become more efficient, its competitors will beat it on every occasion, it will go out of existence and outside and private operators will take over its operation.  The object <Col N="1931" /> of the exercise is to make the ESB slim and mean to enable it to meet and beat competition.  An EU directive is being discussed today by the Council of Ministers which will open up competition for the ESB not only in generation but possibly in transmission and sale.  This will have an effect on the ESB if it is not capable of meeting that competition. The Department and ESB unions and management have co-operated to get a planned change in the company which will allow it to be more effective.</P>
    <P>I take Senator Daly's point about the effect of redundancies on local economies. There is a commitment and agreement that there will be no forced redundancies within the system.  The redundancy packages will be quite generous and will enable people to set up in alternative areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>So many people will be made redundant that we may well have a Moneypoint candidate standing in west Clare in the next election.  The point is constantly made that in the new arrangements to be put in place, quite an amount of the work will still have to be undertaken by private subcontractors. Perhaps the Minister might communicate to me what the impact on Moneypoint will be.  I am picking Moneypoint out as the generating station in my constituency where the CCR will have a major impact.  It will probably be the worst affected of all the generating plants of the ESB.  There is widespread anxiety in the community and among the staff about the final outcome of the deliberations.  Perhaps the Minister of State could brief me about the current situation.  He could speak to me privately if he cannot do it here.</P>

      <P>Money point is the biggest power station within the ESB system, generating 40 per cent of total requirement. Moneypoint can generate a unit of electricity for as cheap as one penny whereas electricity units cost up to 18p in other stations.  There is a huge variation in costs within the system.  Moneypoint <Col N="1932" /> is the biggest station so it is likely to carry its share of the planned 2,000 redundancies under the agreement.  The people who work there will be directly involved in making the decision.  I will check with my officials and I will come back to the Senator with the detail of how it will be effected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very serious matter. It is planned to build an expensive new generator which will probably be less efficient.  At very small cost the fourth phase of Moneypoint could be put in place and the high level of efficiency and good management already there could be continued.  It could reduce the level of redundancies planned there at present.  To build a new station at a time when we can easily expand an existing one, is daft.</P>

If we do not slim down the ESB and make it efficient with modern work practices, it will not be in a position to tender.  The expansion of Moneypoint is a possibility the ESB will put forward when new capacity is required.  Others will tender for that as well.  The ESB needs to be in a position to tender successfully.  The CCR exercise is to make the ESB efficient so it will win the tender.</P>

      <P>I wish to ask a pertinent question, from a business point of view, in relation to this section.  The taxpayer is making a commitment to provide moneys to Bord na Móna.  I spoke in favour of this matter on Second Stage, despite various comments from the other side of the House &mdash; though not from the ministerial chair.  In the past, Bord na Móna has been handcuffed with debt.  The company is forced to pay millions of pounds in interest each year as a result of its overdraft facility.  The Minister stated that the amount is somewhere in the region of £20 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to make £120 million in equity available to Bord na Móna to facilitate the clearance of its debt.  That debt did not arise from bad commercial decisions taken by Bord na Móna.  It arose from bad political decisions taken by a succession of Ministers, none recent, over a long period of time.  The debt is an old one.  Bord na Móna has been carrying that debt and paying in the region of £20 million interest per year to the private commercial banks.  Effectively, up to the present time the banks owned Bord na Móna. The company has always been profitable in its operations and the money from those profits went to pay a debt &mdash; which was not of its own making &mdash; owed to the banks.  In the past, the banks have fared well by receiving in the region of £20 million per year from the profits of Bord na Móna.  The company was left with only a small amount to reinvest in its own commercial activities and enterprises.</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that the moneys being made available by the Government will be paid to Bord na Móna over a three year period, which will reduce its debt to manageable proportions.  Part of the company's commercial plan, presented to the Government, is to convince Government of its commercial viability. That plan shows that the company will be able to manage the remainder of that debt.  It will then be selling its produce, in competition with the produce of other companies, to the ESB or anyone else who wishes to buy it, including the owners of the new peat burning station. If anybody else can supply fuels to that station they will be free to do so but Bord na Móna will be competing in that environment.  It is proposed that £100 million of the £120 million will be made available now by Government to a special fund and that £30 million of it will be made available to that fund immediately for transfer to Bord na Móna.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for answering the various points raised.  A lot more could be done to market the products of Bord na Móna, particularly abroad.  We saw the enormous success over the last two years of the novel marketing campaign &ldquo;The beat on the peat&rdquo; in various cities in the US.

      <P>This product is unique to Ireland and a few other countries.  The board should look into the enormous growth in popularity of its products.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions and particularly for their constructive approach to the debates during the Bill's passage through the House.  I emphasise the importance of the energy sector.  State investment in energy infrastructure is £5 billion and energy imports represent 2 to 3 per cent of GNP.  The final energy demand bill at £2.5 billion is 10 per cent of GNP.  Energy policy is important too because energy as an input to industry can significantly affect Irish competitiveness.</P>
      <P>The energy sector is a dynamic one where the forces of change are strong. Major developments such as the restructuring of the ESB, the new peat fired power station, the completion of the Ireland-UK natural gas interconnector and EU proposals for the electricity and gas sectors are influencing the shape and structure of the energy sector.  This Bill is an important measure remedying a number of defects in existing legislation. It also introduces important new measures.  Effective ministerial monitoring of exploration and production as well as safety and the control and prevention of pollution arising from a licence or lease issued by the Minister, will be greatly facilitated.  Similarly, the ability of the ESB and BGE to detect theft of electricity and gas will be strengthened through the powers conferred on them as well as by the offences and penalties relating to such theft outlined in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One very important measure is the statutory basis provided for the introduction of a system to allow Bord Gáis Éireann to transmit gas owned by another party through its gas network at a price to be negotiated.  This marks another milestone in the development of what is still a young and successful gas industry in this country.  BGE's customers <Col N="1939" /> who are above the threshold prescribed in the Bill for third party access account for approximately 75 per cent of BGE's annual total gas deliveries. A sizeable market is being made potentially available.  To enable me to exercise my functions in relation to third party access, my Department is acquiring the necessary expertise and I hope to announce shortly the appointment of consultants to advise me on the charging methodology and other conditions relating to the granting of third party access.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides the statutory basis for an injection of £100 million in equity in Bord na Móna.  This is the major part of the £120 million investment approved by the Government. The first tranche of £30 million cannot be invested in Bord na Móna until the terms and conditions specified by the Minister have been satisfied and the investment approved by the European Commission.  However, for budgetary purposes, this tranche can be paid this year to a special account and issued from that account when determined by the Minister for Finance after consultation with the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to raise on the Adjournment the matter of disabled person's maintenance allowance and means testing for it.  Responsibility for this allowance is being transferred from the Department of Health to the Department of Social Welfare.  It is more appropriate that the allowance be dealt with under the auspices of the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>I have been concerned about this matter for some time but I raise it in light of two cases I encountered recently where I felt a person on disabled person's maintenance allowance was particularly hard done by.  I am raising the issue because I have been concerned about it for some time, particularly in the light of two cases I came across recently, both of which involve men, one of whom was particularly hard done by with regard to the means test.</P>
      <P>When the spouse of one of the men was offered a community employment scheme place, the family was told that it would lose not just the dependent relative allowance and half the children's allowance but the entire DMPA allowance if she accepted the offer.  There would have been no financial gain if she took the place on the scheme.  This was appealed to the health board.  A letter I received from the board on the matter stated that income from the scheme is not included in the DMPA regulations as a social welfare payment and, accordingly, full account must be taken of this income.  I felt this was particularly harsh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1941" /> In the other case a man has not been able to work and has been receiving disabled person's maintenance allowance for eight years.  He is considering moving in with his girl friend, who is employed.  He was told he would lose the entire amount of the allowance if he did so.</P>
    <P>People on disabled person's maintenance allowance are obviously not available for work because of disability and they almost always do not qualify for social insurance because they would have been unavailable for work for a considerable time and would not have been able to accumulate contributions. Such people are generally almost totally dependent on disabled person's maintenance allowance and it seems unfair that they cannot keep this allowance if their spouses earn even fairly modest incomes.  People can continue to receive other social welfare allowances if they earn modest incomes.  This is an anomaly which should be addressed.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for disabled person's maintenance allowance is in the process of being transferred from the Department of Health to the Department of Social Welfare but I do not know when this will be completed.  The problem should be dealt with by either of these Departments.  I look forward to the Minister's response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg) Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  Disabled persons maintenance allowance is the primary income support operated by the Department of Health for people who, because of their disability, cannot work and are not in a position to maintain themselves in the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 69 of the Health Act, 1970, and the regulations made thereunder, health boards, in assessing eligibility for disabled person's maintenance allowance, are obliged to have regard to the means of both the applicant and his or her spouse.  A disabled person's maintenance allowance recipient is entitled to earn £34.10 in rehabilitative <Col N="1942" /> training or employment without affecting his or her entitlement to disabled person's maintenance allowance.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health is aware of difference between the assessment of means for disabled person's maintenance allowance and for social assistance schemes under the Department of Social Welfare.  Some of these are more favourable to disabled person's maintenance allowance applicants, most notably in the means assessment of people with a disability living at home where the value of board and lodgings is not taken into account.  This is a major benefit to disabled person's maintenance allowance recipients living with their parents or relatives and is designed to encourage their maintenance at home, thereby facilitating their full integration into the community.  In contrast the value of board and lodgings is taken into account in assessing eligibility for unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>However, the spouse of a social welfare recipient on unemployment assistance is entitled to earn up to £55 per week, including travelling expenses of £10 per week, without affecting entitlement to this allowance.  There is no similar provision under the disabled person's maintenance allowance regulations. It is accepted that, at present, this operates to the disadvantage of disabled person's maintenance allowance recipients.  This is the main point made by the Senator.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for the disabled person's maintenance allowance is in the process of being transferred to the Department of Social Welfare.  That Department took over responsibility for the funding of disabled person's maintenance allowance on 1 August 1995 and it is expected that responsibility for the administration of disabled person's maintenance allowance will transfer to it in early 1996 so that it will be responsible for all income maintenance payments.</P>
    <P>The Minister has no plans to change the existing regulations pending this transfer but, in the context of the integration of the disabled person's maintenance <Col N="1943" /> allowance scheme with social welfare allowances generally, it is expected that this and other anomalies will be examined by the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>The Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities is currently examining income support as part of its wide remit covering all aspects of services and supports to people with disabilities. The commission has conducted a nationwide series of &ldquo;listening meetings&rdquo; and has received over 3,000 pages of submissions.  These show clearly the concerns of people with disabilities, their relatives and carers.  Income support was one of the issues identified as requiring improvement.</P>
    <P>The commission is expected to report in April 1996.  Given its wide remit, the commission's recommendations will have a significant bearing on the development of future policy for people with disabilities, including the provision of income support services.  Accordingly, any change in policy in regard to income maintenance for people with disabilities will be a matter for consideration by the Department of Social Welfare in the light of the commission's recommendations.</P>

    <P>Amateur drama is part of the cultural life of rural areas, particularly in Charleville where I went to school.  When I was at school there I went to a play in which my late uncle had a part.

The local group staged its own plays and subsequently it <Col N="1944" /> organised the north Cork drama festival which was successful.</P>
    <P>Arising out of this success, the Shoestring Theatre and Arts Club, now known as the Schoolyard Theatre, was founded in 1984 by Mr. Kevin O'Shea.

In that period the theatre has performed four world amateur premiers and had enormous success reaching all-Ireland finals in Athlone on no fewer than six occasions.  They have won numerous awards for production, acting and set design and I hope the Esso trophy will be given to Charleville in due course.</P>
    <P>A couple of years ago the Shoestring Theatre and Arts Club did not contest the festival circuit due to financial constraints. However, the group was selected by the RTÉ drama department to record a radio play entitled &ldquo;The Greening of Grandad&rdquo;, which was broadcast in 1993.</P>
    <P>Its long term goal was to have a theatre. The building secured by the group is Charleville's former national school which was erected in 1833 and served as a school for both girls and boys for over 150 years.  It is located at the junction of the old and new Limerick roads.  The beautiful cut-stone building is in good structural condition.  It was developed into a theatre which was opened a couple of years ago and it is a credit to the Shoestring Theatre and Arts Club.</P>
    <P>The total expenditure was £124,000.  It stages approximately 20 shows per year and it also broadcast plays on RTÉ.  It is a credit to the town and to those who work in it.  It has already received grants of £4,000 from the Arts Council, £2,900 from Cork County Council and £1,600 from Ballyhoura Fáilte.  However, that is not sufficient when one considers that a theatre group in Longford got £600,000 and another in Thurles got £25,000, although it has no theatre.  Yet the Shoestring Theatre and Arts Club has got little State funding.  Those who do the work should be recognised and get grant aid or the financial assistance due to them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1945" /> People who talk but do not do the work appear to get more, so I would appreciate if the Minister recognises the work done by this very energetic group. It is promoting drama of a kind of which we are very proud, but which is dying. Nevertheless, there is a demand from those involved in promoting drama and in providing facilities.</P>
    <P>This Schoolyard Theatre, which is located on the old Limerick road at Charleville, County Cork, is beautiful.  I hope the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht has seen or will see the work the company has done, including work on the seating and the stage. Everything is first class, a credit to the company and would do justice to any theatre in the country.</P>
    <P>The company has received only £4,000 from the Arts Council, £2,900 from Cork County Council and £1,600 from the Leader group, Ballyhaura Fáilte, which it would not otherwise get but for the existence of this Leader group.  It has a show booked from Dublin in January.  Its work is ongoing, very energetic and is providing entertainment for the people of the town of Charleville and its environs, which includes parts of County Limerick and north County Cork.</P>
    <P>In view of the generous grants and funding to other theatres such as Thurles &mdash; we know, indeed it is obvious, why Thurles recently obtained funding &mdash; Charleville should be recognised and get reasonable funding which would do justice to the work undertaken by the theatre there.</P>

      <P>I know Charleville well.  It is a lovely town and I am glad to hear this part of it is doing well.  I am aware that the committee of the theatre took a 30 year lease on a former national school building in 1993 and converted it into a theatre and arts centre which seats just over 100 people.  I warmly congratulate the theatre committee for advancing this very fine project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1946" /> I also understand that since then, amateur production by the Shoestring Theatre and Arts Club and visiting amateur groups as well as professional one man shows have been staged at the theatre, in addition to the facility being used by RTÉ to record a series or programmes and a number of exhibitions by nationally recognised and local artists being displayed.  I am greatly encouraged by the dedication and enthusiasm of the people concerned in this venture who have given up so much of their time to assist in fundraising activities, and I can well understand their concern at the level of debt still outstanding at the centre.</P>
    <P>This effort by a relatively small group of people, which has carved out an arts and cultural centre for the community, has been carried out on a voluntary basis.  They have managed to preserve a beautiful old building which, but for their initiative, would have been left to ruin.  In addition, they have helped to place the town of Charleville on the cultural map and in the process have created jobs.</P>
    <P>The Senator is aware that the Schoolyard Theatre and Arts Centre has applied for funding under the cultural development incentives scheme which is administered by the Department under the operational programme for Tourism 1994-99.  The scheme is designed primarily to assist the four main categories of the visual arts, performing arts, arts centres, museums, theatres and galleries; 170 applications were launched with the Department by the closing date of 3 February 1995.  The total amount of assistance sought by these applicants amounts to £87 million, which compares to a total of just over £23 million which is available to the Minister over the five years of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The process of assessment of each of the applicants has been ongoing, with concentration initially being given to the designed priority zones and centres of excellence throughout the country, as identified in the &ldquo;Arts Plan 1995-1997&rdquo; which was published by An Comhairle Ealaíon earlier this year.  The Schoolyard <Col N="1947" /> Theatre and Arts Centre is not in one of these designated areas and it has not been assessed in any detail to date. It must be said, however, that as the works to the centre were completed in 1993, in advance of this scheme, it is unlikely that funds can be made available from EU sources on a retrospective basis.  The Minister has asked his officials in his Department to investigate this matter and he will clarify the position for the Senator early in the new year.  I should also add that the scheme provides the only discretionary funding from the Department for arts and cultural infrastructure in the regions.</P>
    <P>An Comhairle Ealaíon is the body which provides funding on a current basis for arts centres throughout the State.  They also have some limited discretion with regard to capital funding. The funding of An Comhairle Ealaíon is entirely a matter for themselves as they hold an independent <Col N="1948" /> statutory position.  However, I am aware that the Schoolyard Theatre and Arts Centre received a grant of £4,000 from An Comhairle Ealaíon in June 1995 towards the cost of equipping the theatre.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the House that I have succeeded in achieving a significant increase in Arts Council funding for 1996 to a level of £18.5 million in 1996 compared to £16.25 million in 1995.  It is, of course, open to the Schoolyard Theatre group to submit a further application to An Comhairle Ealaíon in 1996.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister. There will definitely be a submission from the theatre for further funding. The Minister recognised the great work they have done in converting a beautiful old building.</P>
