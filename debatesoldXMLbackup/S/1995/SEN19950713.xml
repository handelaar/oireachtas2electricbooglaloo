      <P>I have notice from Senator Ormonde and Senator Manning that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, they propose to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to review the policy governing the availability of higher diploma places in Irish universities.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>Before I announce the Order of Business, I wish to thank all the Members who took part in the fine debate on disability yesterday.  I have been in contact with the Centre for Independent Living and they are very pleased with it.  For the information of the House, I intend to forward the full text of the debate to the Minister and Dublin Bus.  I hope a similar debate can be held in the autumn to review progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was asked earlier in the week if I could make time available for a short <Col N="982" /> debate on the French nuclear testing.  If the House agrees, this could be arranged for tomorrow at 1 p.m.; half an hour would be sufficient for Members to make short statements.  If Members still want this debate, we can go ahead with that arrangement.</P>
    <P>Today's Order of Business is item 1 without debate, all Stages of item 2, with not more than 20 minutes for each speaker, and Second Stage of item 3. There will be a sos from 12.30 p.m. until 2 p.m.</P>

      <P>I thank the Leader for arranging today's business to facilitate internal party business on this side of the House.  The Leader mentioned the debate yesterday.  We often criticise the coverage of debates in the House but I compliment the media for its coverage of the debate yesterday, particularly the excellent report in today's <i>The Irish Times</i> on this important issue.</P>
      <P>Is it the Leader's intention to deal with any further legislation before the recess?  If so, perhaps he could inform the House so that Members can be prepared.</P>

      <P>Could the Leader arrange a debate on an urgent matter. My county faces a serious problem and I am not flying a political kite in requesting a debate on the fact that the funds for county road maintenance are exhausted.  I understand other counties are in a similar position.  Could the Leader arrange a short debate on this matter next Wednesday if the Minister for the Environment is available?  It is possible that a solution could be found and we have an obligation to try to resolve this serious crisis in Count Donegal and other counties.</P>

      <P>The demise of the <i>Irish Press</i> group has been mentioned often in recent weeks and many people were concerned that issues of national an international importance would no longer be properly debated.  We see the result of the limiting of debate <Col N="983" /> today's <i>Irish Independent</i> in relation to the French nuclear testing.</P>
      <P>It is unbelievable that the newspaper starts its news analysis with an article entitled &ldquo;Limiting the fallout&rdquo; by its diplomatic correspondent.  This gives a run through of what the Irish Government has done but an article below it starts:</P>
      <P>Science correspondent Roger Highfield explains how France's insistence on nuclear tests in the Pacific may help curb development of third-generation weapons and mini-bombs&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The article's main headline is: &ldquo;Why the French want to nuke the Pacific&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader to bring this matter to the attention of the Taoiseach and the Ministers concerned. The article by the science correspondent, Roger Highfield, states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As a consequence of the tests, it will be much easier for the French to accept a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty,&rdquo; Prof. Simpson said.</P>
      <P>The last line of the article states &ldquo;The result could be the end of testing at Mururoa.&rdquo;  This is followed by: &ldquo;&copy; The Telegraph&rdquo;.  An article on the following page is headlined &ldquo;Seven nuclear tests due as French assess new warhead&rdquo;. Demands have been made in the House and in Ireland to limit&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the question. It may seem to some people to be a matter of no concern, but it is of concern to me.  The <i>Daily Telegraph</i> is on one side of the paper.  The next article is by Adam Sage in Paris and Roger Maynard on board <i>Rainbow Maynard Warrior II.</i>  The article ends: &ldquo;This would be a serious diplomatic move on their part.  (&copy; The Times, London)&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I wish to express appreciation to the Leader of the House for his beautifully judged obituary of the late Senator Fallon in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> last Sunday.  It is a tribute to both the Leader and the late Senator Fallon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Leader urge the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht to place a preservation order on the birthplace of Sir Edward Carson as soon as possible? This matter has been in the public domain for some time.  I was reminded of it by Deputy de Valera's question in the other House recently.  The Minister's response was not unpromising but he did not convey any of the sense of urgency required by what in some respects might seem to be a minor matter but is of symbolic significance.  If the Cathaoirleach will indulge me for a moment, I am raising the matter not because I am peddling any version of revisionist mythology of Irish history but because it is the 50th anniversary of Carson's death, a death which was greeted churlishly and ungraciously in the media of this State at the time.  Any reasonable reading of Irish history will accept that Carson did his best by his light for Ireland.  Although many of us may not subscribe to his interpretation of that, the integrity of his intentions comes across as clearly as it can from any figure in public life.  It would be <Col N="985" /> right at any time and is particularly appropriate now, both in terms of the anniversary and of showing that we in the South are not still prisoners of such primitive passions as we have seen lurking close to the surface elsewhere this week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader of the Opposition raised the question of legislation this session.  We will be completing the Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill, 1995, the Ethics in Public Office Bill, 1994, An Bord Bia (Amendment) Bill, 1995 and the Netting of Financial Contracts Bill, 1995.  It is not proposed to introduce further legislation other than the Powers of Attorney Bill, 1995, but that will not be completed.  That is the arrangement for the session.</P>
      <P>I would like to accommodate Senator McGowan.  We do not have time between now and the end of session, but perhaps the Whips could discuss the matter.  I will not ask Senator Lanigan to repeat his question but I am not clear what point he was making.  However, I will discuss the matter with him later.  I thank Senator Lee for his kind personal comments.  I take his point about Carson's birthplace being preserved.  There is an urgency about it and I will convey his sentiments, which I believe are those of the House, to the Minister.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan) Jimmy Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Cathaoirleach on his appointment.  It is well merited. He has made a great contribution not only to Dáil Éireann but also to Seanad Éireann and I wish him the best of luck in the future.</P>
      <P>This Bill serves a dual purpose: first to increase the membership of the board of An Bord Bia by two and second to provide that one member of the board shall be appointed on the nomination of the Minister for the Marine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary producer must be involved in all aspects of the food industry, including the marketing and promotional aspects.  In the past, the farmer focus has been solely on raw material production.  In my opinion, this does not fulfil the role all primary producers should play in the food industry.  Primary producers have certain fundamental food production obligations that must be met.  The raw materials they <Col N="987" /> produce must satisfy their consumer requirements, namely, those of the processors, with regard to quality, cost, consistency and timing of delivery.  To make these requirements, the link between the producer and the processor must be strengthened and direct representation of farming organisations on the board of An Bord Bia will help to achieve this.</P>
    <P>Farmers already make a substantial levy contribution to An Bord Bia and this is another reason they should be represented on the board.  It is estimated that the levy income paid by farmers to An Bord Bia in 1995 will be in the region of £4.3 million, a substantial figure.  On enactment of this Bill, it is intended that two representatives of farming organisations, one from the IFA and one from the ICMSA, will be appointed to the board of An Bord Bia.</P>
    <P>If An Bord Bia is to be truly successful in marketing Irish food, its remit should include all Irish food, including fish products.  It has been agreed with the Minister for the Marine that BIM and An Bord Bia should co-operate closely in the marketing of fish exports with a view to the ultimate transfer of those functions to An Bord Bia.  Section 9 of the An Bord Bia Act, 1994, allows transfers of this kind to take place.  The appointment of a fisheries representative to one of the existing places on the board will be the first step in ensuring a smooth and efficient transfer of BIM functions to An Bord Bia.</P>
    <P>I envisage the main outcome of these changes will be to assist in the development of a new attitude to the food industry, an attitude of unity of approach which involves both farmers and processors.  This idea of unity of approach is already evident in the recent appointment of Dr. Noel Cawley, managing director of the National Dairy Board to the board of An Bord Bia.  The dairy board is the largest Irish food exporter and is highly representative of the dairy sector.  It is only fitting that such a large sector should have a voice on the Irish Food Board.  These modifications will provide a wealth of knowledge <Col N="988" /> and expertise covering the entire food industry and will allow the board of An Bord Bia address problems and make informed educated strategic judgments in relation to product marketing and promotion for the entire industry.  An Bord Bia will be truly representative of the Irish food industry and can achieve a true unity of approach.</P>
    <P>This unity of approach to which I keep referring is absolutely essential for the success of the Irish food industry. National and international markets are increasingly dynamic environments. Market pressures are constantly changing and we must be able to adapt and respond to these changes.  Two major market pressures affecting food markets are changing consumer demands and European and global policy issues.  Consumer expectations are constantly evolving with factors such as changing lifestyles, environmental issues, economic constraints and food quality and convenience all shaping consumer choice.</P>
    <P>With regard to changing policy issues, the main issues affecting food markets will be the effects of CAP and GATT reforms.  CAP reform has already resulted in major scaling down of intervention availability and a reduction in institutional price levels.  The recent GATT agreement will increase competition for EU producers.</P>
    <P>Another factor that must also be considered is the expansion of the EU.  The Union has recently welcomed three new members and the possibility of further expansion involving central and eastern Europe is very real.  We must be prepared for the effects of these changes, but it is no longer satisfactory to simply defend or even maintain our current position.  We must expand, compete and aggressively sell our food industry and food produce.  In essence, my vision for the Irish food industry in the future is one of a single, strong, cohesive and competitive industry.</P>
    <P>Currently, the Irish food industry provides employment for 200,000 on farms and in processing and related activities. <Col N="989" /> It is Ireland's single biggest industry with an annual output approaching £9 billion.  However, when our food industry is viewed as a single industry it only ranks eighth in the world in terms of size behind the food giants such as Nestle, PepsiCo and Unilever.</P>
    <P>It is clear that we have a long way to go before the industry achieves its full potential, but we have made a start. Earlier this year the first ever National Development Strategy for the Irish Food Industry was launched.  This strategy provides a framework for the growth and development of the industry to the year 2000 and involves a financial investment of £640 million.  Of this, £283 million will be provided from EU and national funds and £357 million will be invested by the industry itself.  In accordance with the concept of &ldquo;unity of approach&rdquo; the National Development Strategy aims to co-ordinate all aspects of the food industry including producers, processors, Departments and all relevant State agencies.  It is a unique and innovative approach to the industry. In addition, a special management unit, under the chairmanship of the Secretary of my Department, has been established to monitor and co-ordinate the progress of the plan.</P>
    <P>Of particular relevance to the Bill before the House is the marketing function of this plan which will be implemented by An Bord Bia.  The board was established in December 1994 with the primary aim of developing and implementing a comprehensive marketing strategy for the Irish food industry.  The board's first five year strategy was launched last month, under which its activities will encompass six key areas: market information, promotion, market development, product innovation, quality assurance support and key policy inputs.</P>
    <P>An Bord Bia's plan specifically targets markets judged to offer the best long term prospects and food sectors with expansion potential.  If targets are realised, we will see exports increase by 5 per cent in the dairy sector, 14 per cent in the meat and livestock sector, 50 <Col N="990" /> per cent in the beverage sector, 55 per cent in the edible horticulture sector and 100 per cent in the prepared consumer food sector.  This may sound ambitious but I think it is realistic &mdash; but only if we follow through with our &ldquo;unity of approach&rdquo;.  The constitution of An Bord Bia will be pivotal to the success of the Irish Food Board.  I believe that strengthening and consolidating the board in the manner proposed will ensure that the board's aims are achieved.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House is a short and uncomplicated one.  Section 1 provides that the minimum number of ordinary members of the board shall be increased from nine to 11 and the maximum number from 11 to 13.  It also provides that one ordinary member shall be appointed on the nomination of the Minister for the Marine as well as for certain consequential changes in the provisions governing the terms of office of the board members.  Section 2 provides for the short title and collective citation of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  The Minister of State stated that An Bord Bia's activities will encompass six key areas &mdash; market information, promotion, market development, product innovation, quality assurance support and key policy inputs.  Agriculture is our key industry and it is important for this board to promote it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent weakness of sterling has caused problems for some of our food producing companies.  The Government has granted no assistance to this sector <Col N="991" /> where Irish manufacturing costs are 5 per cent above those of our United Kingdom competitors.  It is very difficult for Irish companies to compete on the export markets when the Irish punt is trading at or above parity with sterling. The exchange rate between the punt and sterling is a crucial factor in maintaining competitiveness in the Irish food industry, as it affects those competing in the United Kingdom and other European and world markets.  Their competitive edge is compromised as their UK competitors are at an advantage.  This should be addressed to ensure that we are competing on a level playing field.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to increase the minimum membership of the board from nine to 11 members and the maximum from 11 to 13 members.  I hope that will benefit agriculture which is our most important indigenous industry. Foreign computer, pharmaceutical and mechanical industries are attracted here because of our well educated work force and good macro-economic competitive advantages.  However, they can stay or move depending on how well we manage our economy in the meantime.</P>
    <P>While we will always have the competitive advantage of our grasslands in terms of environmentally friendly farming, the industry will not achieve its full potential without a shared vision.  If this key requirement is not met then what we are trying to do in terms of structures will not work to the extent it should.  In the past, there was a lack of co-ordination by the various marketing organisations in their attempts to build structures to meet the needs of a modern food industry.  However, the coordination of these activities may result in our taking our eye off the ball in terms of our need to find a common ground between producers and processors, so that every one knows it is in their interest to produce the food required by consumers in an effort to increase our market share in the European Union, which is the most sophisticated consumer market in the world.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="992" /> There have been weaknesses in the food industry since the foundation of the State, such as the seasonality of our production systems and the failure to avoid a glut at various times in the season, particularly with regard to beef. The slaughtering premium is an attempt to address this but the seasonality problem will remain, especially in dairying and beef production.  The continuing divergence of opinion between farmers and processors on where the real interests of the food industry lie must be overcome.  Until producers and processors find common ground on these issues so that they can be resolved in the long term interest of Irish agriculture, we will continue to have this impediment.</P>
    <P>We have identified the long term market growth strategy as a result of the Culliton and Moriarty reports and the report of our expert group on the food industry.  Previously, we had a commodity based agricultural sector where production levels were irrelevant and price supports were in place.  As a result of the CAP reform we have a more market led agriculture sector which needs to gain access to the market in order to survive.  While the food sector has adapted well to these changes, much more needs to be done and the expert group is pointing the way.</P>
    <P>We know that farmers have great distrust of the processing industry. Examples can be given to show why farmers have good reason to be suspicious of the intentions of processors in terms of price when they go to sell their livestock.  Without naming anyone or being critical, I have had experience of this in my dealings with some processors. Some of them are fair in their dealings with farmers but others are unfair and I would like to see An Bord Bia address this problem.  The processing industry has developed a great deal of sophistication and we now have a more market led agriculture than when we had a price support mechanism under which, regardless of production levels, there was a guaranteed price.  In <Col N="993" /> the absence of a significant live trade, it is always felt by the primary producer that the processing industry takes advantage of this situation and I am sure An Bord Bia will try to address this situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that on the enactment of this Bill, a representative from each of the two farming organisations, the IFA and the ICMSA, should be appointed to the board of An Bord Bia. These organisations have made recommendations as to who should be appointed and I trust that the Minister or the Minister of State will appoint those who have been nominated by the organisations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>The prime purpose of this Bill is to increase the membership of An Bord Bia by two and to provide for the appointment of one member on the nomination of the Minister for the Marine.  This Bill addresses a long running grievance by the farming organisations that they were not represented on the board.  I feel this was an error and I welcome the provision to allow the IFA and the ICMSA to appoint one member each to the board.  This approach is well justified because the farming organisations will contribute approximately £4.3 million in the form of a levy and this justifies them having representation on the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the direct financial contribution to the work of An Bord Bia, the farmers must be described as key players in the food industry.  They provide the raw materials which must meet the requirements of processors on quality, cost and time of delivery.  The commercial partnership between farmers and <Col N="994" /> processors must be fostered.  Processors are already well represented on the board and the Bill provides a linkage between farmers and processors as far as the board is concerned.  The direct representation of the farming organisations will be a further step in developing this partnership.</P>
    <P>If we are to explore fully the potential of the food industry to create additional wealth and, in particular, additional employment, following discussions we should clearly map out the value of agriculture for the entire economy.  The value of the agricultural industry is between £8 billion and £9 billion and it employs approximately 250,000 people. The Minister gave a figure of 200,000, there is a difference of 50,000 between his figure and mine but I think the service industries should also be taken into consideration because some people employed in them could be described as being directly employed in the food industry.</P>
    <P>The import content of Irish food is in the region of 15 per cent whereas the import content of foreign non-food companies is approximately 75 per cent. If we can increase our export food market, this will be of direct benefit not only to the food industry, farmers and processors but to the economy as a whole. Another figure I have never failed to highlight in a debate of this nature is the contribution of food to net exports, which experts argue is between 35 and 40 per cent.  My understanding is that it is approximately 40 per cent.  This is a clear indication of the importance of the industry to the entire economy.</P>
    <P>With regard to the link between the farm gate, processors and the main market, it will be the function of An Bord Bia to establish where markets are and what the requirements will be.  Having established these facts, the next important function is to provide the necessary information to farmers to ensure quality requirements are fulfilled by them.  I am not satisfied with the present situation.  Over the years I have seen a breakdown between farmers, processors and the market which came <Col N="995" /> about because of the elimination of the county committees of agriculture, which were well established bodies representing all interested parties.  There are three elements in any industry, particularly the food industry &mdash; producers, processors and those who market, and they are equally important.</P>
    <P>As a result of the CAP and GATT reforms we now have a more market led agriculture sector which needs to gain access to the market in order to survive. Even from one year to the next changes are needed if we are to gain market share which is fundamental to the whole operation.</P>
    <P>The Culliton report states that the key requirement for the development of the processing industry is a vision shared by producers and processors in the different sectors and this must be supported by Government development agencies.  Probably one of the greatest weaknesses in the food industry until now was that there was no shared vision and little has been done to improve this situation.  Little has been done by producers and processors to establish common ground so that the long term interests of the food industry could be served.</P>
    <P>Over the years farmers have had a great distrust of the processing industry, especially in the meat sector.  Examples can be given to show why farmers have good reason to be suspicious of the intentions of processors with regard to price and why they feel there is a cartel operating when they sell their produce. The processing industry has developed a great deal of sophistication.  We now have a more market led agricultural industry than we had with the price support mechanism under which, regardless of production levels, there was a guaranteed price.  In the absence of a significant live trade it was always felt by primary producers that the processing industry takes advantage of this situation.</P>
    <P>We now have a continuous argument between those in favour of live exports and those opposed.  I have made my <Col N="996" /> position on this clear.  If we do not have a live export market, it will cost farmers between 8p and 10p per pound on their cattle; these are clearly established figures. This has been the approach of processors over the years and, unfortunately, for this reason alone the live industry must stay for the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>The seasonality of our production system and the failure to avoid a glut during various parts of the season, particularly with regard to beef, have been weaknesses of the food industry since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>The continuing divergence of opinion between farmers and processors as to where the real interest of the food industry lies must be overcome.  The Minister and Members can seek to persuade but until producers and processors find common ground on this issue, so that it can be resolved in the long term interests of agriculture, we will continue to have this impediment to the long term strategy of growth in the niche markets we have identified as a result of the Culliton and Moriarty reports and the report of the expert group on the food industry.</P>
    <P>I read these reports carefully and I agree with everything in them.  We know practice is different and that people go back to their vested interest groups and their short term entrenchment positions.  More enlightened practitioners in the food industry have indicated that this practice must be changed and I am glad about this.  The Minister must be mindful that there will be short term political problems in facing up to this but if we have the long term interests of the food industry at heart we will have to address these issues.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely vital that the members of the board do not seek to protect a vested interest, they must seek to bring about the shared vision in the Culliton report.  Key weaknesses can only be overcome if the board considers the overall picture.  Boards set up by the Department must have the shared vision that all interested parties must participate in this exercise and not on <Col N="997" /> an individual basis.  There is a serious educational aspect to the food industry. We must educate each other and take the long term rather than the short term view.  We should never be afraid to say that agriculture is our most important industry.</P>
    <P>I have also read the <i>Market Development Strategy 1995 to 1999</i> drawn up by An Bord Bia.  After reading it carefully, I am dissatisfied with certain areas of it. Page 21 of the report says:</P>
    <P>The <i>buyer-supplier bridge</i> concept is a key tenet of An Bord Bia's strategy. It will involve the provision of a menu of services through which linkages between suppliers and new and existing customers can be built and developed.  To this end, the following mechanisms will be provided:</P>
    <P>The development of close working relationships between An Bord Bia and key buyers in the marketplace based on an indepth understanding of customer needs.</P>
    <P>An on-line <i>information system</i> providing links between buyers and potential Irish suppliers.</P>
    <P>A new company contact system linking buyers and sellers and facilitating the development of business relationships.</P>
    <P>Direct and indirect promotional assistance to support the strengthening of established supply links over time.</P>
    <P>Page 4 of <i>An Introduction to An Bord Bia Services from the Irish Food and Drinks Industry</i> refers to an &ldquo;Expansion of on-farm inspections&rdquo;.  This is what I was searching for in the main document but it was not there.  What does An Bord Bia mean by this statement?</P>
    <P>The link between all elements of the food industry was the county committees of agriculture.  We had intervention schemes at that time which were damaging to our processing industry.  The processing firms used intervention when they should have been processing and marketing our food because it was the <Col N="998" /> handy way out.  Now there is no intervention, I hope our farmers will never again turn to it or the EU.</P>
    <P>I also read <i>Achieving Growth in Horticulture Development Plan for 1994-1999</i> and there is also a failure there to mention the primary producer, the farmer.  The link is not there.  I wish An Bord Bia every success.  It has good people on its board which was not set up by this Government but it is adding to it under the provisions of this Bill and I agree with it.  However, the Minister must create a link between farmers, processors and the market.</P>
    <P>Agricultural systems change from year to year.  The milk area can update itself rapidly, but this cannot be done with the beef and sheep industries; it is a two to three year process.  For that reason, I am worried that the introduction of more milking breeds will damage certain areas of our beef industry.  Fortunately, the establishment of the suckler herds will help, but I am not satisfied with the overload of Holstein blood in the national herd.  Will the Minister take that point on board?</P>
    <P>My last point concerns the overall situation in the processing industry, which has consistently failed to make a deal with the farmer.  Senator Kiely and I have spoken about seasonality.  For many years we tried to persuade the processors that if they wanted to do away with seasonality, they must draw up contracts with their farmers.  A contract means it is binding on both sides. To stop a glut at certain times of the season, it is essential that the farmer has a contract for meat for the slacker times as he will then know exactly where he stands.</P>
    <P>I am a beef producer and have tried on numerous occasions to talk to processors. January, February and March are usually slack months for beef production while there is not sufficient beef for the market in April, May and June. They are watching for a glut in the market to reduce the price.  That has been their policy through the years.  I ask the Minister that as An Bord Bia develops, it tries to draw up contracts between <Col N="999" /> processors and farmers for the slack periods, knowing what is required in the markets.  Everybody else can draw up contracts.  Supermarkets have contracts with their suppliers.  They do not wait for fluctuations and generally know where they stand.  If the farmers knew where they stood on this issue, seasonality and gluts in the market would stop.</P>
    <P>I fully support the Bill and wish the board every success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister but regret that I cannot welcome the Bill.  I urge my colleagues to reject it. This seemingly innocuous Bill is a retrograde step which will undermine An Bord Bia's efforts to develop as a truly market driven organisation rather than one that is just beholden to the producer interests.  I feel strongly on this matter and will do my best to convince the Minister to rethink this measure as it is a retrograde step.</P>
      <P>The Bill increases the number of board members to 14, including the chairman, and also provides one member to be appointed on the nomination of the Minister for Defence and the Marine.  I have no objection to the second part, since I was one of those who argued that An Bord Bia's original remit should have included seafood from the beginning.  The idea of a food production organisational body that does not include seafood is ridiculous.  If having a member appointed by the Minster for Defence and the Marine is a step forward towards bringing seafood within An Bord Bia's remit, well and good, but legislation is not needed to do that.  It can be done informally.  The real issue is whether &mdash; and when &mdash; Bord Iascaigh Mhara will be amalgamated with An Bord Bia and this Bill does nothing about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My real problem with this Bill is the increase in the number of board members, mainly because of what the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry intends to do with this increase.  I read carefully what the Minister said in the Dáil and what the Minister of State <Col N="1000" /> said here.  The Minister said the purpose of this measure is to make room for people representing the IFA and the ICMSA, the producers' interests.  He says he considers their original omission from the board an error.  I strongly agree with Senator D'Arcy that members of this board should not be actively pursuing a vested interest.  With the greatest respect, the Minister is making the same mistake that has bedevilled the development of our food industry for the past 30 years.  His mind-set is one that sees food as nothing more than an outlet for agricultural produce.</P>
    <P>There was an outcry when McDonald's opened in Grafton Street and it was announced that the chips it used, an important element of its menu, were being imported from Holland.  We asked how could a company import chips to Ireland, a country which should be the best at producing potatoes.  McDonald's said it could not get the type of chips it wanted in Ireland and they could only be got in Holland.  We thought it was outrageous that Mc Donald's was being driven by what the customer wanted. However, McDonald's has succeeded and thrived throughout the world by pursuing the customers' interests.  We have adapted to what McDonald's and its customers want and I understand McDonald's now buys its potatoes in Ireland since we now produce the product it wants.  That is what I call the customer being driven by the market.</P>
    <P>However, this is a long way from being driven by agriculture.  Even today the Minister made an error by saying that 200,000 people are employed in the food industry.  Senator D'Arcy added to it by saying the figure was 250,000.  They were talking about the agriculture industry, not the food industry.  Unless we are single-minded in our approach and say these are two different industries &mdash; the agricultural industry which produces products that customers want, and the food industry where jobs will be created in the years ahead &mdash; it is unlikely, no matter how successful the agriculture industry is, that we will produce more jobs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1001" /> This mind-set sees food as no more than an outlet for agricultural products and that has bedevilled our thinking for years.  The reason our food industry is underdeveloped and we need An Bord Bia is that for too long we approached the food industry from the agricultural perspective.  I have argued consistently that we will not develop our food industry properly unless we take a customer driven, not a producer driven approach. We need a food industry driven from the marketplace, not from the farmyard. We also need an approach which recognises that marketing is about producing what the customer wants and not about trying to stuff what it suits us to produce down the customer's throat.</P>
    <P>There is an old-fashioned ring to the Minister's words on this subject.  They reflect a world view which I thought we had begun to move away from with the successful setting up of An Bord Bia last year.  They also bear out my misgivings about putting An Bord Bia under the aegis of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.</P>
    <P>I had the honour to serve on the expert group which recommended the setting up of An Bord Bia and I supported most of what it recommended.  I compiled a minority report dealing with this issue in which I argued that because of its nature the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry could not be fully market driven.  It deals with farming interests, but food, if we view it properly, covers a wider range of interests than farming.</P>
    <P>The objective of the food industry is not to get rid of agricultural products, but to create wealth and jobs from the production and sale of food products which have been designed to meet customers' needs.  Only part of the potential wealth and jobs are in agriculture. The undeveloped nature of our food industry is an illustration of what happens when one lets the tail wag the dog as we have been doing for many years. It is an illustration and an indictment of a failed policy.</P>
    <P>I am a strong supporter of An Bord Bia, even if it is under the wrong</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1002" /> Department.  I want this Bill defeated in order to protect An Bord Bia and to allow it to do the job it has successfully started.  I am impressed by the dynamic, knowledgeable and farseeing board of An Bord Bia.  I understand that the Chairman, Mr. Ned Sullivan, will resign from his position because he has been offered a promotion in London with a highly successful multinational company for which he previously worked.  He will be a great loss.  I hope the Minister, when appointing his successor, will take great care to ensure that this important position is filled by someone from the marketplace we are trying to penetrate and not by a producer.</P>
    <P>Within the past month, An Bord Bia has produced a marketing strategy, to which Senator D'Arcy referred, and a programme for action from 1995 to 1999.  This was like a breath of fresh air compared to previous efforts in this direction.  Its action is firmly based on what the marketplace needs and what our food companies can and cannot do. I am excited about the possibilities which An Bord Bia may open up for us in the years ahead.  It has built up an excellent team in the food area and it is moving in the right direction.  The last thing it needs is to become a hostage to political infighting.</P>
    <P>By rejecting this Bill we will send a message to the Government, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and to An Bord Bia that we wish this new organisation to remain fully market driven.  It is worthwhile to send this message and I hope my colleagues in this House agree with me.</P>
    <P>We cannot prevent the Minister from appointing producer representatives to the board because he already has the power to do that without any further legislation.  There are vacancies on the board because he has, by order, increased the number of ordinary members from nine to 11.  By virtue of that order and this Bill he proposes to increase the number on the board by four to an unwieldy 14, which is too big for any board.  One wonders why it is necessary to increase the size of the <Col N="1003" /> board by 40 per cent when it is working well.</P>
    <P>I fear the reason for this is a change of direction in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry in the past eight months where the emphasis has moved from food.  I only noticed yesterday that we no longer have a Minister for Food.  We had one for the past eight or ten years which recognised that future jobs would be in the food sector as well as the production sector.  This is a sign of the change of direction emphasised in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill is unnecessary and undesirable as far as the food industry is concerned and from the point of view of what An Bord Bia will achieve in the years ahead.  It is important for this House to send a message to the Government. I call on my colleagues to reject this Bill so that An Bord Bia, which was set up last year, will become a healthier organisation.  It is capably and enthusiastically driving the market and thereby creating success, wealth and jobs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I listened with interest to Senator Quinn who gave us food for thought.  I agree with much of what he says but I disagree with his downright condemnation of the Bill.  My analysis of the food industry in Ireland suggests that the level of sophistication which we have achieved is not equal to that achieved in other parts of Europe.  Irish workers are not adding as much value in their day to day work as is happening in other parts of Europe.  Those who have carried out research in the area accept that as fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not good at research and development.  Being late into the game, <Col N="1004" /> we are still learning and are still trying to place the right emphasis on it.  We do not put enough profit back into research and development, which is essential.  We are still not achieving the level of investment there which we should be achieving. It involves a slow build up.  The amount of money we invest compared to that which other countries invest in this area gives an indication of our position. We are not achieving the same added value and as a result this country is not a market leader among food producing countries.  We may be a market leader in some niche markets, such as the fresh mushroom market in England, and in other minor areas, but we are not big players in any food market in the world.  We are not recognised as such, except by ourselves, but we delude ourselves sometimes that we are.  Name recognition of Irish products abroad is minimal and that is where we must start.</P>
    <P>The Government has a lot of work to do.  They are putting more money into research and development and there are announcements for time to time about redirecting finances in a better way. That is happening but there is a huge amount of work to be done before we can be satisfied we are achieving our potential.  Given our climate and unpolluted country, we are not as yet reaping the benefits.</P>
    <P>Even though we are going in the right direction, we should hurry because we could easily be caught by some of the emerging countries in the east.  I have not visited those countries in recent years but I understand they are making great strides and are showing huge potential in the food sector.  We would be wise to be aware of that.</P>
    <P>We must be sensitive to change and be able to change the food industry from top to bottom.  We have not been able to do so to date.  We have not been sensitive enough to lead with new products in the market places of the world. We have not been listening on the ground and if one is not listening, one is unlikely to hear the correct message.</P>
    <P>Since industry must be able to change, the board needs to include <Col N="1005" /> some representatives of the primary producers too.  I disagree with Senator Quinn on this issue because I do not believe two members of a board &mdash; a minority of the board will be appointed from that area &mdash; will be able to sway decisions or dilute the intention of the board.  What will happen is the leaders of the primary producers will get information, which they otherwise would not get.  They will be able to disseminate it throughout the primary producing area and will receive responses more quickly when that is required.</P>
    <P>Senator D'Arcy said the county committees of agriculture were useful from the point of view of getting information across at local level.  They met regularly, there was good debate and the local newspaper carried the message.  Disbanding those committees was a grave error because national newspapers, given their nature, do not print the kind of debates which local ones do.  The debate was led by the county committees of agriculture and it was ongoing.  It dealt with all the important issues of the day and local people had the opportunity to thrash out major questions and understand them a little better.  Messages were received and attitudes were changed but that does not happen now because these committees do not exist.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a good one because we need to be sensitive throughout the food industry.  We need a board which is not lopsided and the addition of two or three producer representatives will not have the effect of which Senator Quinn is afraid.  I appreciate his fears and he is right to voice them.  We should all be afraid if there was a danger of a dilution of the purpose of the board but this will not occur.  The presence of those people on the board will give them an insight, which they would not have otherwise.  It will give us the opportunity to be more sensitive to change and, perhaps, allow us claw our way up the leader board of food production.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister on behalf of the food sector in County Monaghan, particularly the mushroom industry.  We are market leaders in fresh mushroom <Col N="1006" /> production because of Monaghan Mushrooms Limited.  We have taken over almost 40 per cent of the fresh mushroom market in England.  I dare anybody to point out another product which has done the same in any market in which Irish companies are involved. This is good for mushroom producers but it is also good for national morale. It is like Leitrim winning the Connacht Championship.  Monaghan Mushrooms achieving that breakthrough in the English market is like Leitrim and Clare breaking through in football and hurling. We have grabbed a huge slice of that market and to do so we had to be expert.  The people who were part of that achievement are turning their minds in other directions and there are signs they may do the same in other areas.</P>
    <P>While we are market leaders in that area, because of the instability of the English pound there is a grave danger we will fall from that position.  Sterling has been in a mess for a long time.  Not many years ago, the Irish pound was valued at 84 pence sterling.  It subsequently rose to 92 pence sterling and stayed there for some time; it then rose to 98 pence and remained at that point for a period.  Now the Irish pound is valued at £1.02 to £1.03 sterling.  One can imagine the difficulties of people who traded at the 84 pence level and had to rethink their production when the level changed to 92 pence and to 98 pence.  They are now under great pressure and I know the Minister understands the problem because he has spoken to me about it.</P>
    <P>I ask him to pay close attention to the mushroom industry in Monaghan and to our added value industry, which is similar to other such industries around the country.  We have a substantial number of jobs in the food industry but they are under strain and need assistance and understanding.  I appeal to him to keep in touch with us about it and I know he will ensure that anything which can be done will be.  I will be in contact with him about this issue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1007" /> Senator Quinn was wrong to say this Bill points the board in the wrong direction. The Minister has taken a step which will make the food industry more responsive and sensitive.  Irish people will know more about the details of production and marketing because of the changes to the board and I commend the Minister for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and I am delighted to be able to discuss this Bill.  The importance of our food industry to the future development of our economy is vital.  It provides huge opportunity for the job creation we so desperately need, as highlighted by the recent unemployment figures.  To further develop the industry all sectors must be united in their approach and aim to produce a quality product, competitively priced, for the consumer.  All sectors must work in partnership, with no one interest demanding or dictating to the others, if we are ever to realise our food industry's potential.</P>
      <P>An Bord Bia must lead the future development of our food industry and bring together in a co-ordinated way representation from all sectors.  With the appointment of representatives of the IFA and ICMSA, the board will work well.  My only concern is that membership of An Bord Bia may become too large to work successfully. However, the farmers are the key players, who supply the raw material for this industry.</P>
      <P>Quality is essential, as we face a more competitive future because of CAP reform, GATT and competition from central and eastern European countries. To succeed, our products must be of the highest possible quality, delivered at the right time and meet the tastes and eating habits of more demanding consumers. To meet these challenges, careful planning is needed for the future. Research, development and marketing must be of the highest importance to An Bord Bia to achieve success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our clean, green environment and disease free status is vital.  With regard <Col N="1008" /> to the control of farmyard pollution, many farmers had plans at an advanced stage for the building of pollution control facilities when the grants were suddenly suspended.  I urge the Minister to allocate funds to these schemes as great work has already been carried out and much more needs to be done.  This is an issue of great concern to me and to a large number of farmers in Monaghan and Cavan.</P>
    <P>The food industry is a huge employer in my county, Monaghan, particularly the dairy, beef, poultry and mushroom sectors.  The mushroom business has proven hugely successful, employing a large number and providing a great financial boost to many areas of the county.  This is an example of an industry providing a quality food to the consumer. Poultry has also proved successful and the industry continues to expand.</P>
    <P>I urge all involved in the food industry to unite in their approach to the industry.  Farmers' suspicion of the processing industry must be laid to rest and the seasonality of our production system must be addressed, particularly in beef. With the IFA and ICMSA now sitting alongside all the other interests in An Bord Bia, they must aim to guide the industry to develop its full potential, giving the best return to all and providing the maximum number of jobs to cut the ever-increasing dole queues.  I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and wish him well in his portfolio.  He has the interest of agriculture at heart and is working hard for that industry. Notwithstanding that, I do not see the need for this Bill.  Its value is highly questionable in terms of achieving our objective of ensuring our food products are marketed profitably abroad and that the country benefits.  I do not have any principled objection to the IFA or the ICMSA being involved on the board of a marketing company, but from my study of the composition of the board, producer representatives are there <Col N="1009" /> already.  Some of the very best farmers are there including John Duggan the chairman of Avonmore Foods who, I suspect, represents producer interests on the board as well as anybody could. Michael Hanrahan, the chairman of Kerry Group and a director of the ACC Bank is on the board as is Stephen O'Connor, the former chief executive of Waterford Foods plc.  They are people who have a deep knowledge of agriculture. Also on the board is Philip Lynch, the chief executive of IAWS, a company that deals on a day to day basis with farmers.  He understands farmers' needs and also knows how to build successful marketing operations both here and abroad.</P>
      <P>It is a good board on which producer interests are well represented, so why is it necessary to expand it by way of this unnecessary legislation?  Is it some sort of political publicity stunt to ingratiate the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry with the IFA and the ICMSA? Is it being done so that the Minister can visit the Farm Centre and claim to be a wonderful person because he has put representatives from the organisations on the board?  Is this another example of the type of political management whereby a Minister visits Gort and goes out in a boat to convince everybody, via the Six O'Clock news, that he will solve the flood problems?</P>
      <P>What will be the effect and how will this achieve the objective we have established for the food industry?  We do not have to go through this rigmarole about how important the food industry is and how many people are involved in it because that is taken as read.  Also taken as read is that we have to have high quality products, that we must be aggressive in a highly competitive international market and provide what the customer wants in France, Germany or Japan.  There is no need to regurgitate all that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question is how, but there is nothing in the Minister's speech or in the Bill that tells me how.  I accept that the people in An Bord Bia are working on the question of how to do it.  They <Col N="1010" /> have the knowledge.  Let them get on with the job.  Why do we need a 14-member board to regulate An Bord Bia?  I do not understand the need for it given that an order was laid before the Dáil to put two extra members on the board.  I await the Minister's reply to this with interest because it was not replied to in the Dáil.  The chairman, Mr. Ned O'Sullivan, will depart from the board while two others will be appointed by ministerial order, so why do we need the Bill?  The Minister is free, if he so wishes, to appoint the president of the IFA and the president of the ICMSA.</P>
    <P>Senator D'Arcy made several references to the Culliton report and I subscribe to what he says.  It is a pity we do not implement that report given all the things that were said about it in this House and elsewhere when it was published. We are just creating more layers of bureaucracy and administration.  We need people to travel to Japan, Bahrain and France.  We need people with the highest qualifications, with energy and initiative to sell our food in these competitive markets.</P>
    <P>Let us not delude ourselves.  We all accept that we have a wonderful green image, but it will not sell our food for us.  That image is something in our minds which makes us feel good about the food we produce.  It is essential that we produce food of that quality in this competitive market but the green image alone will not sell it.  As somebody who sells food every day of the week, Senator Quinn knows that very well. The green image is part of what sells the food but it is not all of it by any means.</P>
    <P>Senator D'Arcy made the point about vested interests quite convincingly, but what are we doing?  We tell the vested interests that we will concede to them. I do not see the logic of what we are doing.</P>
    <P>Let us talk about the food industry that is so important to our national economy.  What do we do with it?  We institute a tax regime that compels people trying to develop this industry to enable it to compete successfully in <Col N="1011" /> international markets, to go aboard. They take their mobile capital out of this country and the value is added abroad, not here.</P>
    <P>We have a drinks industry in which one would be hard put to find an Irish interest.  Imagine predicting 30 years ago that there would one day be an Irish drinks industry in which there is no Irish control.  That is quite extraordinary yet it reflects how we manage our economy. The Government's responsibility is to create the environment that allows this great industry that we keep talking about to develop, flourish, become competitive internationally, and to survive and prosper.</P>
    <P>Let us get rid of all this unnecessary optical stuff which is leading us down a <i>cul-de-sac.</i>  Talking about our wonderful industry is self-satisfying rhetoric that we regurgitate at regular intervals in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Very little happens, however, other than that the few people trying to survive commercially find it increasingly difficult and frustrating to achieve their objective. Let us get our priorities right.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien is right in saying that the primary producer is important. However, they are all interrelated and interconnected so if we did not have the food processor, the primary producer would be in a pretty sorry state and <i>vice versa.</i>  That is a different issue, however, from trying to sell our ham in competition with ham from Parma, Denmark or Britain.  The issues should not be confused.</P>
    <P>It may be economically advantageous for an Irish food company to invest its capital abroad and to add value abroad rather than at home, but statistics on the matter of added value are questionable. There is an argument which says that what we have added is cost, not value. In other words, if one adds up what it costs to produce processed products it may be, from a national economy point of view, that we have added more cost than value and that there has been a negative equation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1012" /> There is an employment aspect, however, so even if there is a slight negative it may be justified in national global terms because of the employment content which was identified by Culliton, as were the possibilities for the industry.  It is about time we started to implement the Culliton report in the way that Culliton meant his report to be implemented.  On several occasions he had to say &mdash; not in respect of this Administration I should add, but a previous one &mdash; that what we were told he had said was not, in fact, what he had said.</P>
    <P>We are heading towards a global market where products will be able to move under the GATT and, as the Minister outlined, they will be able to move across frontiers without impediment.  Californian and Israeli strawberries will compete with Wexford strawberries.  We should be clear about how we will compete in that hostile and difficult environment.</P>
    <P>We know we should produce quality goods of the highest hygienic standards. How will we do it?  How will we penetrate the markets?  There is a European market of 350 million people which is expanding.  If Ireland plc could get 1 per cent more of that market, it would have many positive consequences for the country.  I guarantee if Unilever, Grand Metropolitan or anybody else was thinking of getting that 1 per cent, they would have a good idea how to do it. That is the strategic thinking we will have to apply to our industry but I see no evidence that this Bill will assist us in doing so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all Senators for their varied contributions.  Some were positive while others were negative in some senses.  The core message and philosophy behind this Bill is unity of approach.  We want interests at all levels and sections of the industry to be represented on An Bord Bia so we can have a focused marketing approach and the core messages will filter back to all <Col N="1013" /> sectors of the industry.  I am confident that, rather than weakening the position of An Bord Bia as indicated by some speakers, this Bill will strengthen its focus, make it more effective and help us to capture some of the market which Senator Dardis mentioned.</P>
      <P>Senator Kiely rightly referred to the currency problem.  We are fully aware of the difficulties experienced by a number of exporters.  We have constant discussions with the industry and the Department is examining ways to help. However, as the Senator probably knows, we cannot give direct subsidisation to the industry as this is illegal under EU law.  We are concerned and will be as supportive as possible.  We are monitoring what is happening very carefully on a day to day basis and, hopefully, the English pound will regain some of its strength.  It is a major problem and, if this trend continues, it will affect the future of many of our exporters.</P>
      <P>Senator Kiely also highlighted the farmers' suspicion of the industry at processing and retail levels.  An Bord Bia plans to address this problem and allay these suspicions.  That is why it is important that farmers are directly represented on the board.  Farmers are also represented on the meat and livestock subsidiary boards and that is important. I will refer to the direct involvement of farmers in my reply to Senator Quinn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator D'Arcy emphasised the need to involve farmers more and to bridge the gap between farmers and retailers and processors.  This attitude and policy bedevilled the industry up to now because farmers were taken out of the equation the minute the food left the farm gate.  After all, the farmer produces the product and the quality. The retailer may package and market it, and do so very skilfully, but it is the product in the package that counts.  If the farmer is not directly involved he cannot do that.  I am confident that the farming representatives on the board will tell the organisations and their members about the need for quality at farm gate level.  It is vitally important. <Col N="1014" /> Farmers will feel they are involved and I hope it will break down that barrier and bridge the gap.</P>
    <P>Senator D'Arcy also mentioned the booklet on market development strategy. The booklet is not a breakdown of the marketing strategy and is currently being updated as it relates to the services of An Bord Bia.  He also mentioned farm visits.  It is part of the philosophy of An Bord Bia to increase farm visits to the primary producer to emphasise their importance in the food chain and in our strategy.  He emphasised repeatedly in his contribution the importance of the link between the farmer and the processor and how the industry suffered in the past because of a breakdown in that link.  I hope the additional members will ensure that link will be developed in the future.</P>
    <P>I appreciate what Senator Quinn said but the matter he mentioned has also bedevilled the industry because farmers do not feel involved.  The insinuation was, if I understood him correctly, that farmers should not be directly represented on An Bord Bia.  I disagree with him because their representation is important.  I know the Senator has direct links with farmers in his business and it is important that they are directly involved and not just made to feel involved.</P>
    <P>I recently attended the Royal Show in England.  I was speaking to the main purchasers from Tesco, Marks and Spencers and Safeway.  I agree that the consumer will determine what they will provide but, having established that, they go back to the farmer to provide it for them.  The consumer and marketing are very important but the individual at the start of the chain is the most important because he can produce the product which the consumer needs.  If we ignore the producer, as we did to some extent in the past, we do so at our peril.</P>
    <P>He who pays the piper should call the tune to some extent.  As the farmers contribute £4.3 million in levies to the running costs of An Bord Bia, they are entitled to a say on the board and to <Col N="1015" /> make their contribution.  If we wish to relate the philosophy of An Bord Bia back to the farmers, there are no better people to do it than the farm organisations. They attend the mass meetings of farmers throughout the winter, give the message and drive the policy.</P>
    <P>At the moment two Ministers in the Department have responsibility for food and the Minister for Agriculture takes a very proactive role in the food industry. As well as my responsibility for An Bord Bia and the food monitoring programme I also take a very active role rather than simply leaving responsibility for this area to a Minister of State. The Minister is aware of the great possibilities for job creation in the food industry.</P>
    <P>It is very important that the Minister, as was not the case in previous regimes, drives the food industry and that full responsibility for this area is not left to a Minister of State.  I have my role to play but the major decisions are made in Brussels and it is important that the Minister at the Council of Ministers promotes our food industry.</P>
    <P>I appreciate Senator Quinn's argument but I do not agree with it.  Putting two farm representatives on An Bord Bia will strengthen the board, reassure farmers that they are part of the process and that their views and the importance of their contribution is fully understood and taken into consideration.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dardis mentioned John Duggan and Michael Hanrahan and they are on the board in their own right.  They <Col N="1016" /> just happen to be farmers but they do not specifically represent farmers. Senator Cotter made a very good contribution and brought up the problems of mushroom exporters.  He outlined how successful the mushroom industry has been in County Monaghan.  I agree with him, we are very much aware of the problems faced by mushroom producers, especially exporters, and we are closely monitoring what is happening.</P>
    <P>I welcome Senator O'Brien's contribution because his first sentence confirmed what I am trying to do in this Bill, which is to emphasise the key role farmers play in the food chain and the quality of our product.  I thank him for confirming what I already said this morning.  The Senator mentioned farmyard pollution and I agree that its control is a very important part of the food chain.  Several aspects of the food chain are important for the production of a quality product and we have the image of an unspoilt environment.  Our great assets are the freshness of our food and the clean environment.  Unfortunately we inherited a budget of £90 million for control of farmyard pollution and we all knew it was not adequate as the money had run out by 28 April.</P>
    <P>The Minister did the right thing in suspending the programme.  However, he is now trying to get money to pay all the people who had applied.  As Senators know, 6,000 applications had been approved before the scheme was suspended.  He is now seeking approvals for those who applied before December; in September I hope he will be in a position to make an announcement that the other 9,000 applications can be approved and that these people can go ahead with work having received conditional approval knowing that they will be paid, maybe not in 1996 but certainly in 1997.  That will solve the problem from the point of view of all those applicants.  Some people did not apply and we will have to examine the overall effectiveness of the programme to include them as well but I agree that the whole issue of control of farmyard pollution <Col N="1017" /> is a very important part of the overall food industry.</P>

      <P>I appeal to the Minister to look at it favourably for 1996 rather than 1997 which is a bit far away.  I know there were applications but at the same time they should be dealt with before 1997, 1996 is the acceptable limit.</P>

Senator Dardis asked why we did not give the two seats that are already there to the farmers.  We filled one by appointing Noel Cawley and the other will be filled by an appointee of the Minister for the Marine.

There is as it will ensure direct farmer representation, send a clear message to the farmers that they are a very important part of the food chain and that they will have some involvement in how their levy will be used.  We will be looking more and more to the farming population in future years to pay for the running costs of An Bord Bia.  It is important, to retain their confidence in the board, that they should be represented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator referred to the Minister taking a boat ride in Galway.  This Bill is pushing out An Bord Bia boat so that <Col N="1018" /> we can take on the world, in particular the New Zealanders, who will be flooding the EU market shortly with a very competitive product.  I have had contact with An Bord Bia over the past six months; it is a very professional organisation, well motivated and going in the right direction.</P>
    <P>The Senator said that there is nothing in my speech about where the industry is going.  I referred to the market development strategy, I did not want to describe it all but it is there.  We are clearly focused on where we are going and the additions to the board will make it more dynamic and inclusive.  I thank all Senators for their contributions and I look forward to Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4B) One ordinary member shall be appointed to represent the views and interests of consumers.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment was tabled when the original 1994 Bill was debated.  It was not pressed because it would indicate other sectoral interests which might be represented.  The amendment seeks direct representation for the views and interests of consumers.  As regards the point made by Senator D'Arcy on Second Stage about sectoral interests, it would seem logical that if the producer interests are represented, as they should be, consumer interests should also be. That is why I tabled this amendment. There would be no difficulty finding the numbers, which could be done quite readily.</P>
      <P>I know from Senator Quinn's experience, which he will tell us about, that he has panels of consumers who give their views on how things should be done in his shops and on the products on the shelves.  That is part of ongoing market research.  The consumer is the most important person in all of this in that he or she pays money to consume the products.  There are consumer organisations with plenty of experience in this area.</P>
      <P>If, as the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Deenihan said on Second Stage, farmers are being levied and are contributing to the marketing exercise, then they have a legitimate expectation to have some input to the policy of the board.  What I am saying is not inconsistent with that.  If those interests are represented, then this interest should also be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1020" /> I would like the Minister to clarify a point he made in his reply on Second Stage about representation from the marine sector.  I understood that a second person would be appointed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be only the person provided for in the Bill.  That clarifies the point.</P>
      <P>The original Bill said the chairman and persons appointed to be ordinary members shall be persons having knowledge or experience of the food industry and of consumer requirements.  That is not the same as what is proposed here. The fact that a person should have knowledge does not give consumer organisations or the consumer, as such, direct representation the board.  There is an important distinction which was debated when we discussed the original Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise with a certain reluctance to speak on this.  As a general policy I am not usually in favour of places on boards being given to representatives of organisations rather than to those who reflect various interests.  The Minister said that the purpose of increasing the number on this board is to ensure that he will give those places to representatives of producer organisations rather than to primary producers.  If that is the Minister's intention, then he is already, to certain extent, tying the hands of the board by saying it will be representative rather than reflecting the views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be impossible to create a market driven food organisation if we exclude representatives of consumers. The freedom is already in the Bill which would enable the Minister to ensure that consumer interests are represented on a wide ranging catholic board.  The Minister has declared that it is his intention to fill gaps with representatives of organisations.  Senator D'Arcy spoke of his concern that they would represent <Col N="1021" /> an interest rather than act in the wider interest.  I also share this concern.</P>
    <P>There is a need to recognise that we will not succeed unless this is consumer driven and driven by the market place. A healthy An Bord Bia was set up last year with that objective.  A strong board of nine members was established, but its hands were not tied by saying it must represent different interests.  I am disappointed by what has happened.  We are increasing this board by changing its tenor and structure.  We are saying that this board should attempt to sell the products which we, as a nation, produce on our farms.  That is the wrong thing to do.  We should ensure that this board finds ways to create the food which the market will buy.  If that means that we must force producers to change what they produce to suit the market, then so be it.</P>
    <P>We have failed miserably to create jobs in the food industry given the opportunities available.  I was delighted to hear the Minister speak about the strength of Irish farm produce, about its freshness and the great image we have in Europe.  Yet we have failed to create jobs in the food industry.  If, for example, somebody went to An Bord Bia with an idea to set up a factory to produce frozen chicken pies to sell in Europe, it would help and encourage that person because it would want to satisfy the European market.  However, if the producer said he planned to buy chickens from Denmark and France because they would be most suitable for his market, An Bord Bia would tell that person to consider Irish chicken producers. In other words, it would not fully encourage him because it would be producer driven.  The market place is so competitive that if we try to please two masters it is unlikely that this organisation will succeed.</P>
    <P>There was a balance with nine members on the board, but we are now increasing it to 14 to ensure fixed places for farming organisation members.  I fear that An Bord Bia will no longer have the strength portrayed in <i>Market Development Strategy 1995-1999</i>, which <Col N="1022" /> should be actively supported and encouraged, and, therefore, I reluctantly support the amendment.  The Minister should also accept it in order to get a better balance onto the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see the logic in the amendment.  It is not possible to draw a comparison between a consumer group on the one hand and a producer group on the other because one is not comparing like with like; they represent two different sets of interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>Consumers are well represented on the board.  They make their case by going into a supermarket and buying a product.  Their message will be heard quickly if one product is inferior to another because the supermarkets are well represented on the board.</P>
      <P>Given the rate of import substitution we must ensure that Irish products are sold on the home market to prevent the rate increasing.  However, I am more interested in the European market and I will speak later at greater length on this and on other aspects of section 1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the composition of the board, the only person who could represent consumer needs and requirements is the managing director of Quinnsworth.  However, he is not a consumer, other than that he buys goods in the same way as other citizens.  I, therefore, disagree with Senator D'Arcy's contention that the consumer's interest is represented.</P>
      <P>Section 15 of An Bord Bia Act, 1994, refers to the CBF portion of the meat and livestock subsidiary.  Section 15(3) states that the ordinary members of the meat and livestock subsidiary board shall consist of:</P>
      <P>(a) five persons who shall represent the producers of livestock...</P>
      <P>(b) four persons who shall represent the meat export trade....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1023" /> (c) one person who shall represent meat traders...</P>
    <P>(d) one person who shall represent the livestock export trade...</P>
    <P>Sectoral interests are, therefore, already embraced in part of the substructure to the board.  We could engage in a lengthy argument over the different layers of structures, but I will not pursue this now.</P>
    <P>I read with interest the remarks by the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Doyle, on Second Stage of the An Bord Bia Bill, 1994, in the Dáil as set out in the Official Report, 11 May 1994, Volume 442, at column 1288 where she said:</P>
    <P>The Bill falls so short of what is required and what Culliton and the reports of expert groups detailed as necessary that it is merely a window dressing exercise and does not deserve support.</P>
    <P>One's perspective changes in Government. However, this was a fundamental statement by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Representatives of the consumer could be taken from groups such as the ICA, the former Irish Housewives Association, and the Consumers Association of Ireland Limited.  Everybody is a consumer and there are far more consumers than there are members of any other sector of the economy.  It is outrageous that not one of the present members of the board represents an association representing any of the consumers' interests.  It would be worthy, worthwhile and efficient if the Minister accepted the amendment because it would strengthen the organisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject the amendment because there is no need for it. Under section 14 (5) of An Bord Bia Act, 1994, there is a specific requirement that all ordinary members &ldquo;... shall be persons having knowledge and experience of the food industry and of consumer requirements&rdquo;.  For example, to suggest that Michael Hanrahan, chairman of one of the most progressive food companies, not only in Ireland but in Europe, and chairman of the biggest food speciality ingredient group in the world, is unaware of what the consumer needs is a contradiction in terms.  There is no need for specific representation in that area.  All of the ordinary members, including Mr. Barry and Mr. Hanrahan are themselves consumers.  We are all consumers.</P>
      <P>An Bord Bia must be consumer and market driven.  If its members are not conscious of the needs of consumers it will fail.  The provision regarding consumer requirements was taken in the Dáil on Committee Stage of the 1994 Act in response to a similar amendment put forward then.  The consumer is also well represented on the consumer food and food ingredients subsidiary board of An Bord Bia.</P>
      <P>With regard to Senator Quinn's remarks, there is no statutory provision for the representation of farmers organisations by right on the board.  It is at the discretion of the Minister.  There is statutory provision for the marine and for tourism, but not for the farmers. There are no fixed places on the board for farmers.</P>

      <P>However, they are not on the board by right.  It is for the Minister to appoint them.  I agree with the Senator that An Bord Bia must be consumer and market driven.  We must provide the food that the market must buy. On the Senator's point regarding chickens, it is in the interests of the economy to ensure that indigenous raw materials are used as much as possible in the food industry.</P>
      <P>There is no need for the amendment. The consumer is already well provided for.  I am happy that the needs of the consumer will be well and adequately looked after within the present framework of the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister has suggested the way out of this situation.  If the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry publicly said that representation would be granted on the board to the farming organisations, as he did, the Minister can now publicly say that the remaining place on the board will be filled by a representative of the consumer associations.  There is then no need for the amendment.  This is the consequence of the Minister's remarks. The Minister, Deputy Yates, could make a public announcement that he will appoint somebody to represent consumers. I presume there is an availability because of the places subject to the ministerial order.</P>

      <P>I may have to press the amendment.</P>
      <P>I did not say any of the eminently qualified people on the board were unaware of consumer interests and I would not suggest that.  The Act says they should have experience of the food industry and of consumer requirements but that is not the same as what is now proposed.  A person who runs Quinnsworth must have a detailed knowledge of consumer requirements. The same applies to anyone who runs a large food company.  However, they are not representative, by definition, of consumer organisations.  If, for example, Mr. Hanrahan can adequately represent the needs of consumers he is eminently qualified to represent the needs of farmers.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to the concerns expressed by Senator Quinn and Senator Dardis and I would like to convince them of the need for two members from the farming organisations.  Senator Quinn made a strong case that An Bord Bia would not be market driven and that the representatives from the two farming organisations would unbalance the board.  However, I disagree.</P>
      <P>In An Bord Bia's market development strategy there is a section dealing with mushrooms.  On page 57 it states:</P>
      <P>The mushroom sector continues to perform well, growing consistently in volume despite pressures on margins and prices in the UK market.  Mushrooms are the most export-orientated of the sub-sectors with over 75 per cent of production being exported to the UK.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1027" /> The mushroom sector is noted for its considerable success, having secured almost 20 per cent of the UK market, with an estimated 45 per cent of the retail multiple trade.</P>
    <P>The scenario outlined is so good because there is a link between the producers, consumers and processors.  Monaghan Mushrooms and Walsh Mushrooms in Wexford, who are the processors, are very successful because the producers are in constant contact with them, and with the market in England which is the main market.</P>
    <P>The contact between the producer, the processor and the markets is important.  The agents from England come to Ireland three or four times a year and visit the farms.  There is ongoing consultation and if there is any reduction in quality the producers are notified immediately.  I know the management of these mushroom firms and they tell me it is fundamental to keep the producer on their side by keeping him informed about production and market requirements.  That is why we are winning market share.</P>
    <P>Another example is milk production where one of the great success stories is Bailey's Irish Cream.  Bailey's is supplied with milk by Premier Dairies in Dublin, which is a liquid milk producer and can guarantee a high quality raw material all year.  There are continuous meetings between Premier Dairies and the producer groups representing each county, including Kildare &mdash; Senator Dardis' county &mdash; Dublin and Wexford &mdash; where I am a member &mdash; which have active liquid milk producer groups. They insist at all times that quality milk is supplied for Bailey's, which is winning market share because it is getting an excellent raw material.  The issues of somatic cell counts, bacteria and antibiotics are all dealt with.  Every producer has four tests a month to ensure there is no reduction in the quality of the product supplied.</P>
    <P>These two examples are not huge areas of production but they are success <Col N="1028" /> stories.  The producers are in constant contact with the processors.  I would like to allay any fears Senator Quinn and Senator Dardis have with regard to the two members from the farming organisations on the board of An Bord Bia. The farming organisations have become sophisticated in their outlook.  The narrowness whereby co-operatives support only their own products must be ended as An Bord Bia cannot tolerate such an approach.  There must be a broad approach for the general good of the industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Doyle argued a different point in the Dáil but I am arguing on behalf of the producers.  When information is needed the people who have it should be on the board so that it can be disseminated to the farmers.  I am ardently in favour of these representatives on the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree with Senator D'Arcy.  However, it is a different issue from the board.  We can produce the highest quality goods in the world but to no avail if we do not sell them.  The milk going into Bailey's Irish Cream must be of the highest quality.  I have heard it said at farmers' meetings over the past 30 years that we produce the best potatoes in the world, yet our potato production has declined.  It is of little use having the best potatoes in the world if we do not sell them.</P>
      <P>I learned a valuable lesson about 20 years ago at a conference in Harrogate from the founder of Rochford's Flowers in England, who had built an internationally successful business.  He said, &ldquo;I know how to grow flowers but I do not know how to sell them.  I get somebody else to sell them for me.&rdquo; That was a telling point that stuck with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope we will not create another case like CIE.  I do think we will as the people on the board and those who will be appointed are eminently qualified. The Minister talked about the agreement of the Minister for the Marine and BIM and that An Bord Bia should cooperate closely in marketing fish exports.  On Committee Stage of the <Col N="1029" /> 1994 Act, I tabled an amendment which stated: &ldquo;On the establishment day, those functions of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara which relate to the export marketing of fish and fish products shall stand transferred to the Board.&rdquo; It was supported by Senator Quinn but it was not accepted.</P>
    <P>That course is now being taken.  Why have a representative of the Department of the Marine on the board before BIM is brought in?  When will BIM come into An Bord Bia and how will that be done?  Is more legislation envisaged? I would be grateful for clarification from the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The point regarding representation on the board was dealt with in the amendment.  We are speaking on section 1 so we are limited to speaking about the size of the board and the length of its term of office.</P>
      <P>The board set up 12 months ago by the Oireachtas comprised nine members.  That number could be increased to 11.  It was a capable, competent size.  It is good management practice to follow the old cliché that &ldquo;small is beautiful&rdquo;.  It was prudent to provide that 9 members could be increased to 11.  The Minister, by order, has already increased the number to 11 and now we are increasing it to 13.  Apart from the fact that it is an unlucky number, it appears to be unwieldly.  It is not in the interest of good management practice. It would be far better to leave the number as it was.  The new board is already performing competently and efficiently and we should leave well enough alone, particularly as it is only 12 months since it was established.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator D'Arcy about the success stories of Baileys and the mushroom industry.  We need hundreds of similar success stories.  The only way we can achieve them is to ensure that we respond to the needs of the market. We will do that with the board that is already established.  If we make the board unwieldly by increasing its size for political considerations, it is unlikely that it will be as efficient as it was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1030" /> I urge the Minister to reconsider this decision and to retain the original size of the board.  That will ensure efficiency and will be more likely to achieve success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to respond to Senator Dardis's comments regarding the nomination by the Minister for the Marine of one member of the board.  As a result of discussions which the Minister, Deputy Yates, had with the Minister for the Marine, it has been agreed that BIM and An Bord Bia should cooperate closely in the marketing of fish exports with a view to the ultimate transfer of those functions to An Bord Bia.  It has been agreed that such a move would strengthen the export marketing of fish products by making the resources of An Bord Bia available for that task. It would also assist An Bord Bia in promoting the distinctiveness of all Irish food products and ultimately to develop some form of Ireland brand for Irish food.</P>
      <P>During the debate on the An Bord Bia Act, 1994, many Deputies were concerned that the marketing of fish products was outside the remit of An Bord Bia.  The discussions the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry had with the Minister for the Marine and the appointment of the latter's nominee to the board of An Bord Bia will ensure that the concerns outlined then will be met as a result of the Minister's action in this case.</P>
      <P>The total inclusion of Bord Iascaigh Mhara within An Bord Bia is not realistic.  Bord Iascaigh Mhara has several other functions besides the sale of fish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">

      <P>That provision was made in section 9 of the 1994 Act which provides for the transfer of fish functions to An Bord Bia by the Minister by way of order.  The Department of the Marine's representative on the board will facilitate early and smooth transfer <Col N="1031" /> of those functions.  This is a welcome departure and I am glad that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the Minister for the Marine agreed to it.  It reflects the good spirit in which we are approaching the issue of An Bord Bia and its effectiveness.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first time I have been in the Seanad since the death of <Col N="1032" /> two Members.  I offer my deepest sympathy on the death of two fine Senators, Senator Gordon Wilson and Senator Seán Fallon.  I offer you, a Chathaoirligh, my best wishes.  I know you will discharge your onerous duties extremely well, as you did in your capacity as Leas-Chathaoirleach.</P>
      <P>The Ethics in Public Office Bill is important legislation in which Members of the Oireachtas have taken a particular interest.  It was keenly debated in the Dáil and I look forward to the debate in the Upper House.  The Bill is about promoting a more open approach to public office by those who serve the public.  At its heart is the provision whereby elected representatives and key public servants will declare their interests.</P>
      <P>People who hold public office &mdash; politicians, Ministers, civil servants, those running our State companies &mdash; are in positions of public trust and are guardians of the public interest.  That is a cornerstone of our administrative and political systems.  We can be proud of the values of public service which have characterised those systems.  In an increasingly complex business and financial environment, the mechanisms to identify and deal with potential conflicts of interest, which this Bill provides, are an important safeguard that those values of public service will continue to prevail.</P>
      <P>The Bill creates the framework where the public can have confidence that those who work in the public's name are working on behalf of the public interest. This Bill will show the public that people in positions of public influence keep their public duties and their personal private interests as separate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides for a register of interests of people in key public positions &mdash; Oireachtas Members and Ministers; the Attorney General; senior civil and public servants; board members and senior executives of State companies; and Ministers' special advisers.  It sets out new rules in relation to acceptance of gifts by office holders.  It introduces greater openness and accountability <Col N="1033" /> into personal appointments by office holders.  It provides for an independent commission to oversee key provisions of the Bill and to investigate complaints.</P>
    <P>The central provisions of the Bill relate to the disclosure of private interests where these could give rise to a conflict of interest for people in key positions in Irish public life.  The Bill provides for two types of disclosure: first, an annual statement of interests and, second, <i>ad hoc</i> declarations where a conflict of interest could directly arise in the performance of one's official duties.</P>
    <P>The model of disclosure has common features for each category covered under the Bill, with certain differences reflecting such factors as Executive <i>versus</i> purely parliamentary duties, the specific or wide remit of the office held and whether the interests are those of a private citizen or someone in public life. Under the Bill, Oireachtas Members must set out annual statements of their interests in a public register.  The interests to be declared in the register are as follows: outside income, shares and directorships, land, but not the family home, gifts other than personal gifts, public contracts and work as a paid lobbyist.</P>
    <P>These interests are similar to those listed in other Parliaments.  Interests below a threshold value do not have to be disclosed, that is, assets or shares worth less than £10,000, income under £2,000 or gifts worth under £500.  In no case is disclosure of the amount of income or the value of the interest required.</P>
    <P>In addition, when speaking or voting in the Houses of the Oireachtas, Members will be required to make a formal declaration if the issue involves a potential conflict of interest for themselves or a connected person, that is, a close relative or business partner.  A simple statement that the Member has an interest is sufficient.</P>
    <P>As people holding Executive positions, Ministers and other office holders are required to make a more comprehensive declaration of interests than <Col N="1034" /> ordinary Members.  In addition to the annual declaration of their own personal interests which, in common with other Members, forms part of the public register, Ministers are required to make an additional private declaration of the interests of their spouses and children which are known to them and which could have a bearing on their public duties.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the independent commission must be informed where a Minister proposes to exercise a function of his or her office which could potentially benefit themselves, their immediate family or business associates, or benefit another Minister.  These provisions are to ensure there is no inside track for people connected to Ministers.</P>
    <P>Senior public servants and members and senior executives of State boards are required to make annual declarations, which are private, in respect of their own interests or interests of which they know of their spouse and children which could have a bearing on their public duties.  They are likewise required to make once-off declarations where a potential conflict of interest, involving themselves or close connections, could arise in the performance of official duties.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, they are generally prohibited, as a term of their conditions of appointment or employment, from performing a function where there is a conflict of interest unless there are compelling reasons for doing so.  In such cases these reasons must be given in writing to the relevant authority and made available to the independent commission. These rules are based on the existing guidelines which operate for senior executives and board members of State companies.</P>
    <P>In relation to where disclosure requirements differ, those in executive positions, such as Ministers, public servants and board members of State companies, are required to make the most comprehensive statements of interests. Their annual declarations shall include those interests of a spouse or children which are known to them which could <Col N="1035" /> have a potential bearing on their public duties.  Ordinary Members of the Oireachtas are not required to make annual statements in respect of the interests of their spouses or children.</P>
    <P>All Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, including office holders, are required to make a public disclosure of their personal interests, as are senior special advisers personally appointed by Ministers.  The public disclosure requirement of Members is fully in line with the requirements of registers of Members' interests abroad.  Those with general remits, such as Ministers and Oireachtas Members, are required to make a comprehensive listing of all their personal interests, while those with a specific remit, for example, those working in a specific Department or State company, are only required to declare those interests in their annual statements which could have a bearing on their duties in that Department or State body.  All other annual statements by groups covered by the Bill will be confidential and overseen by an independent commission.</P>
    <P>The Bill is careful to strike a balance between serving the public interest through disclosure and respecting the legitimate right to personal privacy.  Statements which are made by Ministers, senior public servants or board members in respect of interests of a spouse or child will be confidential.  These statements will be made available to the independent commission.  Any unauthorised disclosure of such information will constitute a criminal offence.</P>
    <P>The Bill is not just about disclosure of interests.  Apart from addressing the separation of public and private interests, the Bill also deals with gifts to office holders and with the appointment of personal advisers and assistants by Ministers.  The Bill provides that any gift worth over £500 given to a Minister, their spouse or child by virtue of that ministerial office becomes the property of the State.</P>
    <P>As regards personal appointments by office holders, for example, personal <Col N="1036" /> assistants or special advisers, the Bill provides that these will be temporary and will cease when the office holder leaves office.  The Government will be precluded from appointing such persons to permanent positions in the Civil Service. This gives legal effect to what is already established practice.  The Bill also provides for publication of details of all such personal appointments.</P>
    <P>An independent commission will oversee key provisions of the Bill in respect of office holders, special advisers, public servants, including civil servants, and senior executives of State boards.  The commission will undertake the investigation of complaints of possible contraventions in respect of these groups.  The commission will comprise the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Ombudsman, the Ceann Comhairle, the Clerk of the Dáil and the Clerk of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Due to the constitutional independence of the Houses of the Oireachtas in regulating their own affairs, the Bill provides for special overseeing arrangements in respect of ordinary Members. Select committees of each House will oversee the provisions of the Bill in relation to ordinary Members of that House and will report to that House. The select committees may recommend a range of sanctions for any Oireachtas Member found in breach of the Bill. The commission and select committees have power to investigate complaints and act on their own initiative, backed up by comprehensive powers to summon witnesses.  They will also issue guidelines on compliance with the provisions of the Bill and may provide advice in individual cases.  Part II of the Bill, which covers the Houses of the Oireachtas, is brought into being in respect of each House by a resolution of the House itself.</P>
    <P>The Bill is comprehensive but fair.  It promotes openness by elected representatives, but respects the privacy of third parties.  It sets out unequivocal requirements to be met where a conflict of interest may arise.  It establishes effective <Col N="1037" /> support and investigative mechanisms.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw the attention of the House to certain minor textual corrections which I seek to have made by the Clerk under the direction of the Cathaoirleach.  The heading PART IV, THE PUBLIC SERVICE on page 23 is in the wrong place.  It should be placed on page 22, that is, before rather than after section 16.  Following the deletion of paragraph (d) in section 22 on Report Stage in the Dáil, we need to remove the reference to that paragraph by correcting subsections (2) and (3) to fully take account of that deletion.  On page 48 in the Second Schedule, for the sake of textual clarity, we need to move the text at line 47 and to the end of the paragraph under the (b) in line 36.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

I have no problem declaring my interests, especially my bank overdraft which proves I will comply with the Bill.</P>
      <P>I recall one occasion when a colleague, who was an Independent at the time but is now a member of Fine Gael, and I were in the bar discussing shares. I and another colleague bought 1,000 shares, a minimal amount.  However, my other colleague subsequently got into trouble about the shares.  Small matters such as this should be overlooked.</P>
      <P>Under this Bill one must declare one's interests.  If there is a conflict of interest, it will be pointed out.  Matters such as the case I outlined should not be highlighted to such an extent as to cause embarrassment to any office holder.  I hope this aspect will be covered by the Bill.</P>

I am certain he will be fair, impartial and diligent in the discharge of his duties.  I wish the Cathaoirleach and his wife and family every happiness during his period in office.</P>
      <P>There has always been a necessity to have the highest possible standards in public office.  In my time in public life, I have been impressed by the level of dedication of people elected to public office.  I have been a member of Offaly County Council for a long time and I am impressed by the honesty and openness of my fellow members representing different political parties.  I have not had any reason to query the honesty of any member of Offaly County Council. Similarly, in my experience in Leinster House, the people I have met have made a genuine effort to be open and fair in doing business.  The people have elected to public office individuals who have been able to discharge their duties in a fair and open manner.</P>
      <P>Politics is a great calling and a noble profession.  We need to have people who have an open approach to their business and the discharge of their duties.  We have been lucky in the people the general public elect.  If the public is uneasy or unhappy with elected representatives or thinks individuals are abusing their office, it can decide not to re-elect them.  If it doubts any person's capacity or honesty, it will not be slow in despatching them from public office.</P>
      <P>I understand some of the reasons why the enactment of this Bill is being sought.  There has been much public concern over some things that happened over the years.  There were conflicts over some semi-State bodies.  We had the beef tribunal and different problems with Greencore plc.  I presume it is because of those difficulties we have this Bill before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the Government to be cautious in setting up committees.  We should be careful that we do not go overboard and set up too many.  Disputes about planning have to be referred to An Bord Pleanála and I understand there will be <Col N="1039" /> a new committee to advise the Government on judicial appointments.  We are setting up commissions in other areas and it is proposed to have new committees of this House.  We have to be careful not to have too many layers of bureaucracy.  In the long term, it is important that we have a certain amount of trust in people.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill and presume it can be of benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the house and congratulate her on grabbing a tortuous Bill and forcing it on the ardent journey to this House.  It must be one of the most discussed Bills in many years; it is the Bill most discussed since I was elected to this House.  Rather than approaching it in a general way, as did many Members in the other House, I prefer to make a few remarks on one perspective of it.</P>
      <P>In scrutinising the Bill, I have mainly been concerned with whether it is likely to discourage anyone in business from seeking public office, such as membership of this House or the Dáil.  There is a clear necessity for our Legislature to reflect a broad range of experience among its Members.  In the past, the experience of successful people who run big businesses has been somewhat under-reflected in these Houses.  This was one of the reasons why I ran for office, not to lobby for business interests but to throw my experience from a business perspective into the melting pot. Since successful business people have something to offer, I wish to see that they are not discouraged from taking the plunge and putting themselves forward for election.  It was precisely from this angle that I looked at the Bill and I will concentrate on this angle on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is there anything in the Bill that would dissuade business people from running for office or from accepting office, if nominated to it, as has happened in this House in the past?  I will give an example of the type of thing that would have that effect.  A person in <Col N="1040" /> business has competitors; that is what business is all about.  Arising from that, there is some information in every business that is commercially sensitive, about which one does not want one's competitors to know because it would put one at a disadvantage.  In some businesses, the amount of turnover can be commercially sensitive as can the amount of profit, but in other businesses those figures are not sensitive and they are publicised quite freely.  In either situation, the desirable thing is to have all competitors on a par &mdash; either everybody knows or nobody knows.  As far as I can see, from examining the Bill and scrutinising its provisions, it does not require any person to divulge commercially sensitive information, so there does not appear to be a problem on that point.</P>
    <P>Another requirement that could be a deterrent would be if a Member was required to disclose the amount of his or her income from private business interests.  Rightly or wrongly, how much one earns is considered to be a purely private matter.  Other societies are different; I gather that in Israel it is one of the first questions one asks a new acquaintance.  That is not the way we do things in Ireland.  It would probably put business people off public office if they had to put their earnings on the public record and subject them to scrutiny.  The Bill does not require that: it specifically excludes declarations of income.  I do not see a problem in that area either.</P>
    <P>A third example of an information requirement that would be a deterrent would be if it were necessary to publish a person's home address.  With the kidnapping and terrorism of more recent times, it would be a major concern to successful business people if they had to do that.  I looked to see if that was in the Bill.  For security reasons many business people do not want their home addresses publicised, which I think is quite reasonable.  In a country as small as Ireland anybody who digs deep enough can easily find that sort of information but giving easy access to it is a <Col N="1041" /> different matter.  The Bill does not require people to list their home addresses as private homes are specifically excluded from the list of registrable interests.</P>
    <P>These three factors would act as a very significant deterrent to business people putting their names forward for membership of either House.  If any of these factors were a requirement I would find it very difficult to support this Bill.</P>
    <P>People will be required to disclose information which would normally be private for those engaged in private business.  They will be required to disclose all sources of income and all significant assets held.  I do not think that this will act as a deterrent because the information required is, as far as I can see, tightly restricted to what is necessary to highlight any conflict of interest. Business people who are tempted to seek public office will readily appreciate that the public has a right to know about any potential conflict of interest.  It appears that the Minister of State has satisfied that potential problem.</P>
    <P>People drawn to public office will probably recognise they are moving into a public arena rather than a private one and that certain matters will, therefore, become a matter of legitimate public interest.  If it meant losing all privacy and supplying information just to satisfy the voyeuristic instincts of curious people, then those who have to submit to it could reasonably object.  However, it is hard to see that anybody could reasonably object to giving information which is necessary to get people's interests into the open &mdash; interests which might have an impact on their role as a public representative.  Anybody who would be deterred by having to give this information is probably not the kind of person whom the public would like to have representing them. It is a benign rather than a malignant deterrent.</P>
    <P>The American example of business people in politics is quite intriguing.  In the United States business people are heavily involved in politics and it seems <Col N="1042" /> unlikely they would succeed in politics there unless they had already made their fortune in a competitive market place.  People do not tend to be elected as public representatives or senior administration officials unless they have already succeeded in business.  There are far more rigorous disclosure requirements in America than we are considering here, which do not seem to deter successful American business people from participating in public office.  One cannot read too much into that because the American and Irish cultures are very different, but we should aspire to that kind of openness. The Minister of State is helping us to move in that direction with this Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome and support the Bill. However, it had a long and ardous passage and, as a result, it will probably be a long time before the Minister, or anybody else, puts a similar Bill forward. I wonder if that is right.  We are moving into new territory here and the Minister of State has grasped a nettle which others failed to do.  It is perhaps too much to ask that the Minister of State will get it 100 per cent right on the first occasion.  We are putting new mechanisms into place and we do not know if they will fulfil their purpose.  I would like to see this issue revisited at regular intervals, perhaps every five years.  In that way, we could make changes and adjust the monetary figures to allow for inflation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I missed that part.  We can add things which may prove necessary in the future and move steadily forward to the more open society towards which the Minister of State is pushing us and which so many people see as desirable. I am aware that amending legislation can be introduced at any stage but my point is that the tortuous passage of this Bill may deter the Minister of State, or any future Minister, from doing so.  It would be better if we could build a regular review process into the Bill so that <Col N="1043" /> the Legislature would be forced to confront this issue on a regular basis.  I am not sure what mechanism we could use to do that but I am interested in hearing the views of the Minister of State.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister of State on tackling this tortuous legislation and steering it through both Houses.  I wish her every success with it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I am very pleased that the Ethics in Public Office Bill, 1994, has come to the Seanad and I hope that it will have an easy passage through this House.  It was, as Senator Quinn said, extensively debated in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>It is very important that there is public confidence in political leaders and the political process and this Bill is an important mechanism for ensuring that confidence.  We have a great deal of power as politicians, particularly those who hold office as Ministers, and the same applies to senior civil servants, senior advisers, members of State boards and so on, who are covered by this Bill.  It is important that the public knows that we exercise that power in a way which does not promote anybody's personal interest but is in the public interest.</P>
      <P>This Bill serves a broad purpose in ensuring public accountability and transparency, which is a word we hear a great deal.  It is important for people to know the rules by which power is exercised on their behalf.  In a democracy office holders are elected by the public to look after their interests and to spend their taxes wisely.  It is essential that there are clear rules and guidelines under which people operate in these high offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a perception that politicians are not in politics for the public good but for personal gain or some hidden agenda.  Anybody who has served at local or national level knows that the vast majority are in politics purely to serve the public good and out of commitment to what they stand for.  The perception is totally at variance with the <Col N="1044" /> reality.  However, we must accept that there is a common perception that all is not quite as clear as it should be.  This Bill is important because it sets out the rules and clarifies the interests of politicians.</P>
    <P>When people say that politicians are in it for what they can get out of it, if they are asked about their local politician they will invariably say that he or she is a great person who works really hard in the interests of the local people. However, while people know that about their local politician, they often have a generalised perception about politicians which is totally unjustified.  It is important to bridge the gap between the perception and the reality and this Bill will be helpful in that regard because it will set down the rules.  It will make clear what a person's private interests are and if it is possible they might conflict with his or her public role.  It achieves the right balance between personal privacy and the public interest.  It is important that these rules are clear and that we know exactly what interests might conflict with a person's public role.</P>
    <P>Office holders must indicate whether they hold directorships or have an involvement in companies.  They do not have to declare the extent of that interest; therefore, they do not have to declare what people may consider to be unnecessary information, which might discourage business people from becoming politicians.  They have to declare not the amount but the existence of the interest.  If they make decisions in the exercise of their offices, it is clear to the public they are not doing so from a hidden agenda.</P>
    <P>The rules are clear and this should be the case in any activity.  As Senator Rory Kiely is heavily involved in sport, he will know that if there are clear rules in sport or anything else, it is much easier to play the game and get on with one's business.  This applies to politics as much as to any other activity.</P>
    <P>The structures set out in the Bill are clear.  A committee will deal with ordinary Members of the Oireachtas and a <Col N="1045" /> commission will deal with others covered by the Bill.  There are clear procedures to examine a person's interests if this is necessary.  The public has a right to know the interests of those who are spending taxpayers' money and exercising the will of the people as elected representatives.  The public will know that no personal agenda is being pursued.  The practice of having a declaration of interests is standard in most democracies and we are simply coming into step with other countries which have similar democratic structures.</P>
    <P>Information on spouses and children of people in high office is confidential and is not made known to the public. This is important because information on people who are not directly involved in public life should not be made public. It is good that the Bill provides that expensive gifts to officeholders should become State property.  The issue of such gifts is raised from time to time and makes media headlines.  This is now dealt with.</P>
    <P>Most Members serve at local as well as national level.  Prior to being elected, many of them may have been critical of politicians.  I am referring in particular to local representatives who are leaders of movements agitating against politicians at local level.  After being elected they begin to understand the difficulties and constraints under which public representatives operate.  Local councillors devote their time to serving the public without remuneration, apart from receiving small sums in expenses.  Those who are the loudest critics begin, after they themselves are elected, to understand the pressures on representatives.</P>
    <P>In schools there is a need for more education on the political process.  A few months ago we spoke about surveys which showed the limited information young people have about who are their public representatives, who are the holders of high office and the work of the Oireachtas.  There is a big role for the education system in this area.</P>
    <P>The media also have a role to play and are influential in how people perceive political office and how people <Col N="1046" /> perform in politics.  It is right that the media highlight and defend the public interest if something is done in a way it should not.  It is important that we have a free press which operates in a perceptive and critical manner and seeks to investigate what is happening in the public arena.  It is also important that it highlights the good work done in the political arena.  The legislative work done in the Oireachtas and in local councils should be given the kind of media attention given to rows, problems and difficulties.  The public wants to read about rows but positive work should also be highlighted.</P>
    <P>This Bill helps to make clear to the public that there are no ways in which a person who is elected to high office can seek to promote a personal agenda instead of the public good.  It makes clear what a person's interests are when he or she holds high office.  It is in our interests as well as in the interests of the public that there be clear guidelines and rules and these are well dealt with in the Bill which balances the public interest with people's rights to personal privacy. I welcome the Bill and hope it will have a swift passage through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no complaints about this Bill but I do not see a great deal new in it.  For years members of Sligo County Council have had to declare their interests.  When my party was in Government Members of the Opposition implied that Members on the Government side had not disclosed their interests.  However, it transpired that many people on the Opposition side had not given an account of what they owned.  We have always declared our interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Outlandish and scurrilous statements were made by people who are now members of the Government about people in Fianna Fáil.  I would like to see a provision in the Bill to protect people from such statements.  It is not good enough for people to have the freedom of the Oireachtas to say what they like; they should have the freedom to say what they know is true and they <Col N="1047" /> should not be free to say what is untrue. A statement was made about a document which was going to rock the Oireachtas and the Catholic Church to their foundations but this never happened. Ethics in this area are important and should be upheld but there is nothing in the Bill to do this.</P>
    <P>For many years we have attacked people who make profits and who run businesses successfully and this is one of the causes of unemployment.  There is an attitude that if people are successful this is because they are operating in an underhand way and are not entitled to any credit.  Profit is a dirty word among some politicians and people in the community. The people who make profits pay taxes, not the people who have nothing.</P>
    <P>We must be careful to achieve a balance if we want to attract good people to politics.  The best people from whom to get advice are those who are successful in their own walks of life.  Advice they give is good because they know what they are talking about.  I am afraid we might discourage such people from entering politics.  We have set up committees, consultancy agencies and task forces over the last few years to inquire into various issues.  These cost the taxpayer a lot of money but eventually come up with nothing.  Is this Bill necessary?</P>
    <P>I think the Bill also asks an officeholder to account for interests held by his family.  I read the Bill but did not see the reference; if it is there, it is not in layman's language.  An officeholder should not be expected to give an account of his families' position.  His offspring may be married or live far away. This is grossly unfair and if it is in the Bill, I ask the Minister to reconsider it as it would be impossible to implement.</P>
    <P>We have a right to privacy but will that be the case if this legislation is carried to its logical conclusion?  Will people be able to keep their home addresses private?  Will they be told this information will only be released to a particular committee?  One only has to <Col N="1048" /> look at what happened in An Bord Pleanála a few years ago.  The officials involved there were supposed to be trustworthy and efficient.  It is not big business people or politicians who commit these transgressions.  As the old saying goes &ldquo;every man has his price&rdquo;&mdash; it might be more politically correct to say &ldquo;everyone&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Although I do not have any problems with this Bill, will we do all that we intend to do with it?  I and most people in this House have been declaring our interests for many years.  I did this the second time I was elected to Sligo County Council and have been doing so ever since.  I also did so when I was elected to this House in 1981.  There is nothing new in this provision but a lot of hype has been generated about it.</P>
    <P>Politicians have a bad name but it is our political colleagues who are giving us this reputation.  It is time that ethics came to the fore in this House and that we spoke in a more suitable manner.  No one could ever accuse me of making outlandish or slanderous statements but there is no point in blaming the press for doing so as we give them the ammunition. I would like to see provisions governing this matter in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be marked reluctance on the part of Members of both Houses to offer any views on legislation of this kind because of the downside risk that if they make their views known and make public statements, they immediately leave themselves open to more severe scrutiny than those who say nothing.  That is not a sufficient reason, much less justification, for not making a contribution on a Bill of this nature.  I want to make some general observations, based particularly on my experience in public life, in and out of Government &mdash; I was initially a Member of this House over 30 years ago &mdash; and the climate in which we want to promote people who are properly motivated for public service to take it on.  The vast majority of those I have known in politics over those 30 <Col N="1049" /> years have been properly motivated and adhered to these high standards.</P>
      <P>I cannot imagine the Seanad of 30 years ago would have seen the need for a Bill of this nature.  Perhaps the world has changed but the reason it would not have seen this need is that the fundamental code of ethics is already in the Constitution and we should pay more attention to it.  This Bill focuses on a single and narrow &mdash; it may be important &mdash; aspect of ethics and does not draw attention to the important elements of political ethics and conduct in political office which are already laid down in the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister publicly disclose the code, procedures and conduct required from Ministers in Government so that Ministers or potential aspirants for office, particularly Executive office in Government, are aware of them?  There is no reason that should be a dark secret from the public, much less than from the Members of the Oireachtas.  It exists and should be laid before the House and the public could then measure the extent to which these requirements are adhered to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also have a reservation about the heading of the Minister's statement, &ldquo;demonstrating that the public interest comes first&rdquo;.  Maybe that is the intention. However, if there is an implication there that this has not been demonstrated by people of honesty and integrity over the years and that we had to wait for this Government to demonstrate that the public interest comes first, I reject and repudiate it.  I hope the Minister can make it clear she accepts that many people have consistently demonstrated by their actions that the public interest not only came first but was the only interest they served, many times to the detriment of their private personal interests and that of their families. I had the privilege to serve in Government and with people in both Houses of the Oireachtas, which contained some of the finest people I have ever met and whose standards were the highest I could ever hope to respect. They demonstrated by their actions, not <Col N="1050" /> just their words, that the public interest came first.</P>
    <P>The old Fianna was not far wrong when it said the motto for clean, honest living was &ldquo;Neart in ár lámha, glainne in ár gcroíthe agus beart de réir ár mbriathar&rdquo;, which means strength in our arms, cleanliness in our hearts, and our actions are as good as our words.  If we proclaim standards in words, we need to ensure there will be no implication that those who did not make that proclamation in words were not regarded as not having them.</P>
    <P>When I was first elected to the Seanad, my salary was around £500 per annum.  In the space of two years, it increased to £750 per annum.  The Dáil salary at the time was around £1,000 per annum and in the space of a few years, increased to £1,250.  Why?  Seán Lemass saw this as being the other extreme.  The founding fathers saw public service as a privilege and an honour, which is why in our Constitution, the term &ldquo;an allowance&rdquo; is used, and not &ldquo;a salary&rdquo;, for Members of the Oireachtas.  In time, we came to recognise that allowance discouraged people from entering public service.  As Senator Quinn said, if that is the price to be paid they will not go into politics for financial return.  We have other responsibilities.</P>
    <P>We should reflect on how we can make the political system better, cleaner and purer.  We should acknowledge the standards of those in public service who did not think of financial reward.  It would not have occurred to many people with whom I served in Government to proclaim that the public interest came first, although their actions each day consistently confirmed that it did. We should, in the interest of the public who are cynical of politicians, vindicate the name, honour and integrity of the vast majority of those in public service. As someone who came into this House 30 years ago, I reject any implication in this debate that we are only now beginning to be pure.</P>
    <P>The concept of ethics does not only relate to financial considerations; it is broader whether in or out of public <Col N="1051" /> office.  It relates to our code of conduct, actions and abilities.  We would do well to reconsider ethics clearly laid down in the Constitution and which do not have any financial implications.  I had great respect for the rugged integrity of the founding fathers of this State who created the independence we are privileged to enjoy.  We should consider ethics at the highest level, collective Cabinet responsibility and confidentiality, without which effective Government cannot operate.  I would be happy to see this legislation focus on that responsibility.</P>
    <P>In recent years Cabinet members have leaked Government decisions to the press to build up a positive image, thereby increasing their promotion prospects.  This would have been anathema to the post-independence generation. The Government should examine this trend.</P>
    <P>I have known people in Government who would not breathe a word of what was said at the Cabinet table to anyone and who were criticised by the press for not having the capacity to give such information.  They did not try to curry favour with the media by giving them inside stories.  We should contrast these people, who were the most honourable men I have been privileged to sit with, with others who could not get off the blocks fast enough to tell their stories. As soon as they left a Cabinet meeting they would talk to someone from the press who knew them and, perhaps, promoted them.</P>
    <P>When the press talks about ethics in Government, can it justify its actions as regards channelling inside information from meetings which are meant to be confidential?  We all have a responsibility, the fourth estate as well, to maintain standards.  I support openness, transparency and accountability, but it should be achieved through established and agreed channels.  This trend did not start with the present Government. However, when one makes a virtue of openness, transparency and accountability, one must at least say what is <Col N="1052" /> meant by that or is it a case that Ministers give the information which suits them?  From my experience, if the press waited for some Ministers to give information, it would be starved because they would not advance their personal interest in Government by feeding stories to the press.  However, that is the other extreme.  Information should be made available.</P>
    <P>It is time to consider the implication that we must watch people in public life in terms of their financial interests as distinct from their constitutional responsibilities.  I would be happy if a review was carried out with regard to feeding information to the press, a trend which did not exist many years ago when an example which one could admire was set by people's words and actions.</P>
    <P>As Senator Farrell said, if, in the course of a debate in this House, a damaging allegation is made under the protection of privilege, it should be vindicated in whatever tribunal this House sets up.  We should adhere to that fundamental ethic.  I referred to some examples of inconsistency.  As Senator Farrell said, if a Member stands up in the House and says that he has information which will rock the State to its foundations, he has, whether in or out of Government, a responsibility under our Constitution to provide such information. To do less undermines the basic code of ethics in our Constitution and the standards we should follow.  The Minister and the Government should address this issue because under the protection of privilege it is too easy to make allegations which increase the public's cynical view of politicians.  We do not want to pursue such a standard of ethics.  Perhaps we should consider its impact in this regard.</P>
    <P>There are other matters in terms of ethics in public life.  The Leader of the Labour Party and current Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, deliberately demanded in the Dáil that the beef tribunal should have power to send for persons and papers so that all the necessary information would be disclosed fully to the tribunal. <Col N="1053" /> We accepted that amendment lest there be an implication in not accepting it that there was something which we were trying to hide.  I recall it well.  To his credit, the current Taoiseach made no such demand and he went before the tribunal, claimed no privilege, disclosed whatever he had to disclose and subjected himself to cross-examination.  I must note the inconsistency of the Tánaiste, who specifically asked for that disclosure and, when it came to the tribunal, claimed privilege.  He was not unique; other Members, some of whom are still in Government, also claimed privilege.  Is that consistent?  Is that ethics in public life?  I only ask the question in terms of the ethical standards we want to promote.  The guidelines are there.  If we are to use privilege to raise fears and apprehensions, we should also be conscious that privilege is not to be treated with any degree of disrespect.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about cynicism regarding people in public office and I agree with what Senator Quinn said.  I hope I will not be misunderstood.  Many people would have been better off financially if they had never come into public life.  If I were engaged elsewhere today with my colleagues at the Bar, I might find myself a lot better off financially. It is a great privilege to serve in public life and it always has been so and that is why I question the implication in the Bill on the financial issue.  Most people I have known in public life would have been much better off financially if they had stayed in their own professions and businesses.  Perhaps it is for that reason that I support and sympathise with the statements made by Senator Quinn.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the public interest in semi-State companies and any further privatisation which the Government may be considering.  If there is something like the sugar quota in what was formerly Súicre Éireann and it is held by a State company on behalf of the public good, that is perfect. It is a monopoly.  When a company is privatised &mdash; as Súicre Éireann was when it became Greencore PLC &mdash; the <Col N="1054" /> public asset is then held privately.  I was the Minister who started these procedures but the conclusion of them left me in some considerable doubt.  There are people in Greencore PLC, which is a privately managed company, in control of a public asset.  Senator Quinn would feel he could manage well if he had a national asset as part of his private domain.  Before we move any step further towards privatisation, the Minister would do well to talk to her colleagues about the consequences of transferring into private ownership and management assets which have hitherto been held in the national interest.  Some people, simply by virtue of privatisation, have become much better off overnight, both in terms of salary and assets.  The fact that they operate a monopoly in the private sector gives them a privileged position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  She has put a great deal of time and energy into this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill will compile a register of interests but will it make people any more ethical than they are?  If people desire to behave in an unethical manner, it is all too easy for them to do so. The Bill may do a lot of good from the point of view of the public perception. It is sad that there is such a cynical view of politicians, in particular.  I do not think this is the case in relation to the Judiciary or members of the Civil Service. If making the register of interests available to the public is a help, so be it.</P>
      <P>The Bill has been well thought out in general.  I sometimes wonder how much of a person's interest needs to be made public and if some of what is to be made public would not have been sufficiently covered were it made known to the commission.  I will return to that later.</P>
      <P>People are entitled to a certain amount of privacy, particularly in view of the fact that the files are to be kept for 15 years after the person may have left public office.  The section on the commission seems to be particularly good and fair.  I commend the Minister on it because it is set out clearly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1055" /> I am anxious about one area in Part IV of the Bill, section 34.  I refer to the situation regarding the declaration of legal or medical services, including psychiatric and psychological services.  It is not clear if this is to be held privately or if it is to be a public register.  Looking at the calibre of people on the commission, I would have thought it was sufficient to have the declaration held privately.  I know there does not seem to be a clear way to identify who the person saw in connection with whatever medical treatment they had or if it was a member of the family who was treated, but this is a small country and seeking that sort of information regarding people's private medical history is going too far.</P>
    <P>In other countries we have seen the dreadful consequence of the medical history of people in public life becoming well known.  Not too long ago, a candidate for the vice-presidency of the United States of America had to withdraw when he lost the support of the presidential candidate because it was discovered that he had availed of psychiatric services.  Sadly, this is a situation where there is still a considerable stigma and that is also the case in relation to psychological services.</P>
    <P>What alarms me about this section of the Bill is that psychiatric and psychological services are extremely expensive. Psychological services are not covered to any great degree under the Health Act.  If the Minister looks at the new regulations being brought forward by the Minister for Health regarding private insurance companies and the coverage of psychiatric illness, she will see that these services have been reduced to a minimal level.  Of course, there can be maximum levels but the Minister may find people have only a minimum amount of coverage for psychiatric care, in particular, because it is an expensive condition to treat.  The Minister may find that they refuse to have treatment in the first place, which would be serious, or cut short whatever treatment they may be having.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1056" /> If this were a case of some member of the general public, it is quite possible that a doctor or institution might feel it would be wiser ethically to go on with treatment if they knew the circumstances were financially serious.  They might tell the patient to forget about the rest of the bill.  Apparently, there have been cases where people have been patients in expensive private institutions and were not charged but I wonder how many such cases there have been.  A large number of people's medical privacy is involved, not only Members of the Oireachtas, the Judiciary, the Civil Service and advisers but also members of their families, who could quite easily be identified &mdash; especially if the family is a small one.  I ask the Minister to look at this area again.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I have misunderstood the Bill and that this area is totally private and confined to the commission.  Knowing the calibre of the people on the commission, I could understand that that might be so.  If the person who received such treatment was behaving in such a manner that a member of the commission felt obliged to tell him that his behaviour in regard to legislation had been noted and to suggest that he should either alter his attitude or make known that he had received free medical treatment, I would feel happier. However, this is a grave intrusion into the doctor-patient relationship and medical privacy.</P>
    <P>I spoke recently on the need to be extraordinarily careful not to stigmatise people medically.  I asked the Minister for Equality and Law Reform to ensure in his legislation on equality in employment that a healthy person with an abnormal gene who may never develop a disease cannot be discriminated against in employment or other sectors. This is close to that situation; people are being asked to give information which may rarely be relevant.  I would be happy if the Minister will assure me this is being held privately by the commission but I would be worried if it was in public.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1057" /> The institution or doctor involved does not have to be named.  It would be terrible if they could be because in some cases it would be all too clear why the person had been in the institution.  If that were intended I would strongly oppose this section but I am glad the Minister has indicated by shaking her head that it is not.  Even so, if this information is public, I am not happy.  It is enough for the commission to know and we can rely on those people to keep us informed if the person is straying outside the bounds.</P>
    <P>Liabilities are not mentioned in the Bill.  I will not start passing around the hat but one would be more likely to have a financial problem rather than a great deal of money stashed away; and one would be far more likely to be swayed in legislation on the banks if they could be induced to behave more kindly to those of us with major liabilities to them.  It is strange that this is not mentioned.  The commission could be informed as a private matter that a Member or his or her company may owe money and this could be taken into consideration when looking at legislation.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that much of the information dealt with by the Bill can be obtained in the companies' register in Dublin Castle.  The former Senator Brendan Ryan discussed this in his book <i>Keeping Us in the Dark</i>, in which he outlined a useful paper trail through which one can find out about people if one wishes.  The Bill will collate the information but I am not sure it will be as effective as the Minister hopes, although I would be delighted if it was.</P>
    <P>I do not know why anyone thinks one can make money by going into politics.  I have met few people who have enriched themselves through it; in most cases it costs them a great deal of time and money.  I keep the day job going for fear of something worse happening in the future.</P>
    <P>Any gifts will be taken into the custody of the State or sold.  I admit this is not likely but if I was given a silver salver <Col N="1058" /> with my name inscribed, for adjudicating at a greyhound meeting for Senator Kiely, not many people would be keen on buying it.  Besides, what use would it be to the State?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I wanted to know, whether the person who had been presented with it could purchase it.  We should take into account that not many people would be interested in having a huge glass bowl with &ldquo;Senator Mary Henry presented the greyhound racing trophy&rdquo; emblazoned on it.  The State should not demand £500 because other people might not pay £10 for it. Perhaps some people would be anxious to have a Senator Henry bowl on their sideboard but I have not yet met them. I hope the monetary value will not be the only thing taken into account, because otherwise Government Buildings will be stuffed full of huge glass bowls with various names on them.  The Minister should fix a token payment for inscribed gifts for the sake of the State.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the section on holidays provides that holidays within the State are exempt.  I am open to offers and I am particularly fond of the west, Donegal, Kerry and west Cork.</P>

The thought of not being able to stand in the rain in Letterfrack on August bank holidays to come was beginning to get me down, so I am delighted the Minister has exempted such holidays.</P>

    <P>I hope companies abroad will note that Members can be taken on tours around this country.  The Minister is to be complimented on supporting home <Col N="1059" /> holidays, which I presume was her intent.  I would also be pleased to visit historic houses.  I hope those who wish to gain influence with us will look carefully at the Bill to see what they can do for us.

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Senator Henry injected some humour into this debate because when the Bill first emerged into the public arena it was greeted with howls of protest and incredulity.  Like many people, I have difficulty with the title.  Why was it called the Ethics in Public Office Bill? It mainly deals with the declaration of interests of one sort or another.  The Minister stated these interests are similar to those listed in other parliaments and my understanding is the titles of those Bills relate to declarations of Members' interests.  I am open to correction but I am not aware of legislation in EU or other democratic countries with the title &ldquo;Ethics in Public Office Act&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I raise this matter because the Labour party was in Government with Fianna Fáil when this Bill was in gestation and much as I regret saying it there was an element of point scoring in putting the legislation together.  Eaten bread is quickly forgotten and we must recall the atmosphere surrounding politics and politicians from 1992 to 1994, during the beef tribunal period, when politicians were at each other's throats.  The newspapers pounced on each infraction, alleged and real, and sent out teams of enthusiastic young reporters, fresh from the college of journalism in Rathmines, wishing to establish a name and reputation for themselves.  They had to get the story, which usually involved getting the politician &mdash; more accurately, the Fianna Fáil politician.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that atmosphere this legislation was introduced.  It was initiated by the Labour partners as part of the Programme for Government and, unfortunately, <Col N="1060" /> that was done not so much to make Fianna Fáil feel defensive and inferior but to promote the perception that Labour members were models of integrity bordering on sainthood.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Never sainthood, that is going too far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, Senator, perception is everything in politics although I wish it were otherwise.  One has only to think back to the environment in which the Cork by-elections were held and during which both our parties shared office.  I am sure my former colleagues in Government agree that the issues debated during those by-elections had little to do with real politics but with perceptions about Government Ministers flying around the world or allegedly abusing their office.  I am firmly convinced that the results of those elections, which were a bitter disappointment to the Government parties of the time &mdash; more so for Labour than for Fianna Fáil &mdash; were based on a perception that politicians were not to be trusted, that their activities were questionable, and that if they were given all the privileges of power they would abuse them.  The perception was fuelled by people who had very short term advantages in mind, but it backfired because the public in Cork and Wicklow wished a plague on all our houses because they felt we are all the same. They did not vote for parties but for individuals who are not entrapped by this system and who, like knights of old in shining armour, will cut a swathe through the corrupt power elite in this country.</P>
      <P>It is important to remember the context in which this legislation was introduced. In her speech, the Minister said: &ldquo;we can be proud of the values of public service which have characterised our administrative and political systems&rdquo;. Of course we can be proud.  Since the foundation of the State, those who have served in successive Administrations have done so for the highest ideals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1061" /> The Minister also spoke of &ldquo;a Bill that creates the framework where the public can have confidence that those who work in the public's name are working in the public interest&rdquo;.  The Minister is emphatic that this Bill is about &ldquo;demonstrating that the public interest comes first&rdquo;.  We have all been living long enough on this planet to know that when you set yourself up as a plaster saint you can be knocked down very quickly.  I am disappointed by the manner in which this Bill was introduced as well as the decision to call it the Ethics in Public Office Bill because that demeans all of us by implying that this system is corrupt and needs to be reformed.  The Bill is saying: &ldquo;Are we not wonderful people because we are reforming ourselves?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Looking at the evidence since the foundation of the State, one will find few examples of corruption, or even the whiff of it, among elected politicians, or any evidence or suggestion that they abused their positions.</P>
    <P>It is salutary to refer to our European partners who came out of the great European liberal tradition about which we are often lectured, not only in this House but in general through the media.  In France the Prime Minister may have to resign, and a couple of Ministers from the last administration were forced to resign amid allegations of corruption, while in Belgium the prime minister is also under pressure.  In Italy the <i>tangentopoli</i>&ldquo;clean hands&rdquo; investigation brought an entire political system crashing down around their ears. It is ironic that the former Italian foreign minister &mdash; who was lionised by the European media, and to a certain degree by our own media &mdash; is facing ten years in jail for siphoning off money from public contracts.</P>
    <P>In Spain, corruption allegations and sleaze charges have overshadowed the achievements of Prime Minister Gonzalez's government in the last couple of years.  The corruption allegations involved Senor Gonzalez's brother-in-law and the sleaze charges involved the former governor of the Bank of Spain <Col N="1062" /> who spent two weeks in prison.  Two other heroes of the Gonzalez years of economic bounty in the late 1980s include a former chairman of Benesto as well as the architect of a multi-million dollar investment in Spain by the Kuwaiti investment office, both of whom are in prison facing fraud charges.</P>
    <P>Last May, the former head of the 70,000-strong <i>Guardia Civil</i>&mdash; the paramilitary force which forms the backbone of Spain's domestic security services &mdash; became a fugitive from justice after being accused of illegally enriching himself.</P>
    <P>Those are our European partners, but I will now come a little closer to home, to the mother of parliaments, that bastion of democracy, the institution which has taught the rest of the democratic world how to go about its business, the British Parliament.  Mr. Tim Yeo, a junior Minister, resigned after fathering an illegitimate child with a Tory councillor in east London.  It later emerged that this was Mr. Yeo's second illegitimate child.  Another Tory MP admitted sharing a double bed with a gentleman doctor friend while on holiday, claiming he did it to save money during their &ldquo;gastronomic tour of France&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Last year Edwina Currie, a former Minister who is now a prominent backbencher, added to a long list of soft porn on our bookshelves by writing about her experiences in Westminster in a book which, to date, has sold over 50,000 copies. Many of the extracts quoted in this article would have us blushing in private let alone in the institutions of State.</P>
    <P>In the same month we learned of the Pergau scandal which involved the British Government spending millions of pounds in foreign aid on an unnecessary dam in Malaysia as a bribe to make the Malaysian Government buy British weapons.  This was condoned by the British Government.  At the time, William Waldegrave was, among other things, the Minister for open government.</P>
    <P>We have not yet created a Department or Minister for open government <Col N="1063" /> here so, in the absence of that formal title, the Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, will have to do for the purposes of this debate.  However, Mr, Waldegrave declared that under certain circumstances it was all right for a Minister to lie to the House of Commons.</P>
    <P>It was also revealed that the head of the joint chiefs of staff, the top military man in Britain, had had an affair with the wife of another MP, and he too had to resign.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>According to Mr. Hoggart, the British Minister for the Disabled, Nicholas Scott, used underhand tactics to kill off a Bill which would have helped the disabled. Then he fibbed to the Commons about his involvement.  In July last year it was revealed that two Tory MPs had agreed to accept £1,000 each to table a <Col N="1064" /> parliamentary question.  They were exposed by a journalist posing as a businessman.  Mr. Hoggart says that other MPs were quick to condemn the outrageous behaviour, not of the two Tory MPs but of the newspaper that ran the story.  Two Ministers resigned when <i>The Guardian</i> newspaper in Britain revealed that they had accepted hospitality from the owner of Harrods in the Ritz Hotel in Paris.  Other Tory MPs were quick to condemn the outrageous behaviour, not of the Ministers concerned but of the newspaper that revealed the story.</P>
    <P>I have not quoted those at length to make us look morally superior to our European partners.  The Minister may be surprised to learn that I agree with most of the provisions in the Bill but I wish to point out that with the best will in the world and the best of intentions, one cannot impose the morality or ethics in public office that this Bill sets out to impose.  I concede that the Bill creates a framework.  I may be arguing against myself in referring to the sleaze factor in European politics.  There is a need for some legislative framework which people can use as a benchmark. They can then see that the system does not work on a nod and wink; laws exist which can be implemented if one transgresses.</P>
    <P>I want to take up Senator Henry's point about the gifts, not that I have received any gifts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am the third member of my family to be involved in politics at local and national level and I am aware of the environment in which Ministers operate.  Gifts are a normal part of overseas travel.  It is part of the culture in the Middle East to exchange gifts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was curious about the £500 limit. The point is well made by Senator Henry that in a number of cases the recipient would be named on the gift along with the circumstances and context in which they received it.  This <Col N="1065" /> devalues the gift in commercial terms.  I have dabbled in stamp collecting all my life.  There is greater commercial value attached to a first day cover &mdash; where the stamp is cancelled by the post office on the day on which it is issued &mdash; if it is not addressed and did not physically go through the mail.  Where it is not possible to go to the post office to get the cancellation mark, labels are used and these can be removed when the card or letter arrives.</P>
    <P>The approach to the collection of items is to remove any reference to the individual because that enhances their value.  The name and address of a person devalues it substantially.  Why was it decided that the limit would be £500?  Is it based on past experience, representing the average value of donations to Irish Ministers over the last 60 or 70 years?  I am curious and believe it was not fully thought out, but I accept the Minister's reasons for including it. There had to be some value placed on the gifts.</P>
    <P>Section 19 relates to special advisers, who have been in the news recently.  As we were pilloried for special advisers, I confess I am indulging in tit for tat politics. Some £200,000 seems an enormous amount of taxpayers' money to advise the Taoiseach of the day.  I am interested in subsection (4) (c) which provides that an office holder shall, in respect of a person who acts or acted as a special adviser to him or her, lay specified documents before each House of the Oireachtas.  Paragraph (c) requires a statement as to whether the person is a relative of the office holder. While on the face of it that is a very noble aspiration, what is the point? Does it infer that one cannot appoint a relative or that a relative cannot act in an independent manner?  Does it suggest that a relative is somehow a lesser person?  At what level does it apply?</P>
    <P>There was a contretemps concerning a Government Minister in the Fianna Fáil-Labour Administration, also a member of the current Government, who employed her daughter as her constituency secretary.  I thought that was <Col N="1066" /> an admirable decision which I would defend.  Why should somebody be denied because they are a relative?  Are we going to create a situation where, because somebody is a relative, one ignores other merits, attributes, abilities and a high level of education?  Is this just a matter of transparency so we will know a person is a relative, but are defending the person's right to employ them?</P>
    <P>Does the Bill cover appointments to State boards?  I am not against the practice. I do not wish my remarks to be misinterpreted because I am sure the person concerned is admirable but I was surprised to read that a civil servant who has been promoted to Assistant Secretary &mdash; it was a woman so I am delighted &mdash; is also a member of two State boards.  Is this normal practice throughout the Civil Service?  I know civil servants are involved in boards which relate specifically to their Department but in this instance it did not strike me that the two boards in question were so related.  Are they paid an emolument or expenses in the same way as other members of State and semi-State boards?  Are they getting extra money over and above their Civil Service salary?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for an excellent and thoughtful debate.  The key questions raised were why we need this Bill and why it is important.  To some extent Senator Mooney answered that question when he detailed a series of problems that have occurred in other democracies.</P>
      <P>It is important for our democracy that we are able to show that those in public life, senior public servants and senior officers on State boards are about the public's business and not about their own private business.  It is also important that we are able to maintain public trust, not only in our democracy but also in our public service and in all those who serve the public interest.  A formal system of registration of interests and formal mechanisms for dealing with conflicts of interest are important protections so that this democracy does not go the way of others.</P>
      <P>We have been very well served by our public representatives and I agree with all that has been said about the huge amount of hard work that is done.  In no sense is this Bill an anti-politics measure, it is an important defence for people in public life and for people entrusted with public office at a senior level.  The public can be assured that there are mechanisms in place to address potential conflicts of interest and that those elected to public office and people in senior positions in the public service and semi-State bodies acting on the public's behalf, are doing that.  Giving that reassurance to the public is an important strengthening of the institutions of Government, it is not in any sense an attack on those institutions, nor is it an attack on the democratic process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In enacting this Bill we will be able to dispel some of the cynicism and muttering that sometimes goes on about whether we are really about the public's business; to show we are transparent in our dealings is an important reassurance to the public.  It is extremely important that we are able to offer that assurance <Col N="1068" /> because cynicism about politics and public life can undermine the process of democracy itself.  The public choose the Government and can remove our right to hold representative office.  This Bill is about strengthening the foundations of our democracy.  It is important that we are able to say with our hands on our hearts that reasonable mechanisms are in place, that we are avoiding conflicts of interest and are open about potential conflicts of interest.  We can say that none of us is working to hidden agendas.  The public are entitled to that important reassurance.</P>
    <P>The contributions to the debate have been extremely thoughtful on all sides. Senator Kiely asked about a Member who might, through oversight, neglect to declare a minor interest and mentioned the potential for public embarrassment. We have set thresholds for disclosure in the Bill.  The whole purpose both in the gifts provisions and the general declarations provision, is to set a £500 declaration limit for Members in the Bill. They are set at a level to recognise that <i>de minimis non curat lex.</i>  People do not have to put every £100 they receive on the public record if they do not choose to do so but there is a voluntary mechanism if they do.</P>
    <P>We provide mechanisms to look at interests of a reasonable scale where potential conflicts could arise.  If somebody has an interest above this threshold level it must be declared.  Any inquiry, whether conducted by the Houses of the Oireachtas in relation to a Member or the commission in relation to office holders or public servants must say in its findings under the Bill whether the contravention of the Bill was negligent, inadvertent or deliberate so that somebody who does not declare an interest simply through oversight is protected. By Statute that will be part of the finding so there is that protection for people who because of an oversight, do not declare something.  The discipline of filling out a register will help people but we have reasonable provisions to address that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1069" /> Senator Enright asked whether we have too many committees.  I know the Bill is quite complex in its different parts as applying to different categories of people, but we have tried to make the procedures as simple and relevant as possible at each level.  For example, public and civil servants make their declarations to a relevant authority, who will be the Secretary of the Department in the case of ordinary civil servants. The commission will have a right to see those declarations so that if in any case there was a golden circle an outside body can break it.  We will not clog up the commission with declarations from everybody; people will declare to their relevant authority.  The same will apply in relation to semi-State companies and in this case the relevant authority will be the overseeing Department which ought to know if there are potential conflicts of interest in regard to the board members it appoints.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn made a very interesting and thoughtful contribution in relation to the whole area of business people in public life.  Senator O'Kennedy and Senator Farrell also strongly emphasised the importance of having people with business experience in public life.  I value the qualities and insight that Senator Quinn, as one of our leading business people, brings to debates, whether about consumer affairs or An Bord Bia.  The Senator asked whether we would have a review mechanism. Such a mechanism for the thresholds is built into the Bill.  The Minister for Finance, as the designated Minister under the Bill, can raise any of the thresholds in the Bill in relation to the consumer price index.</P>
    <P>I agree with the point the Senator makes about review.  Legislation like this is innovative and we have drawn from models overseas but we have nothing quite like it to draw from at home so it is important to keep the operation of the Bill under review.  If new circumstances or new kinds of interests emerge, if difficulties arise in the operation, my office will monitor the situation.  If there is any need for <Col N="1070" /> further legislation to fine tune this Bill and make sure it is achieving its objectives I will be very happy to put such legislation in place.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell raised the question of family interests.  If anybody who is required to declare interests of their family does not know about those interests or could not reasonably be expected to know about them, or if the family's interests are not relevant to their public duties, they are under no obligation to declare them or to seek them out.  However, the purpose of including family interests is to ensure that there is no inside track for close family or business partners of people who are charged with making decisions on the public's behalf.  That is a reasonable precaution and reflects what is already in the guidelines which operate at the moment for senior executives and board members of semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy asked that we would publish the Government procedure instructions which are the guidelines for things like submission of memoranda to Government and for the conduct of Ministers in relation to their public duties.  There is a commitment in the Government programme to publish those instructions.  We have to do a little more polishing and fine tuning of the instructions to dovetail with the procedures of this Bill when it is passed and as soon as that has been done we will publish the Government procedure instructions.  I accept the point he has made.  Senator O'Kennedy asked whether we need the Bill and whether, when we talk about demonstrating that the public interest comes first, it is intended as a slur.  It is not intended as a slur on people in public life as I fully accept that they put the public interest first but it is important for public trust in our political system that no suspicion of hidden conflict of interest should arise.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry raised a number of points.  She is welcome to join me on holidays in west Cork.  With regard to medical, psychological and legal services, late in the course of guiding this <Col N="1071" /> Bill through the Dáil it was discovered that, under its provisions, people might potentially be required to disclose details of gifts they received of such services. A provision has been inserted which states that no identifying details of such gifts need be disclosed.  People need not disclose that they attended Dr. Henry about a problem with varicose veins or that they attended a psychiatrist. The purpose of the section is to ensure that no identifying material need be supplied.</P>

      <P>The question of liabilities was considered in the course of the Bill's preparation but it was not included in the list for various reasons.  Very few jurisdictions list liabilities.  Anyone who has liabilities of a compromising nature &mdash; as distinct from ordinary liabilities, such as mortgages or overdrafts &mdash; can make a voluntary statement under section 30 of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry also raised the issue of the value of gifts which may be inscribed.  The provision of £500 mirrors that for the declaration of gifts by Members.  It is not intended to be a guideline that we should receive a gift worth £499 from an Arab potentate each time we travel to the Middle East. The Government Secretariat thought it fit to provide a cut-off figure to distinguish between gifts of serious and minor value.  The gift I most often receive is a bunch of flowers and that gives me great pleasure.  Most gifts received in the course of ministerial duties are relatively small.  It should not be signalled that anybody expects gifts of greater value.  Inquiries are made through diplomatic channels regarding the value of foreign gifts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1072" /> Senator Mooney inquired about the valuation of inscribed gifts.  The Bill provides that ministerial gifts will be valued by the Secretary to the Government who will take the commercial value into account.  If I received a piece of inscribed Waterford glass at a FÁS function, the value would be significantly less than a piece that was not inscribed.  We are talking about a common sense regime in this regard.  A Select Committee on Members' interests will deal with any worries Members may have in relation to particular gifts and provide guidelines for gifts it considers declarable.  I do not believe that inscribed pieces of Waterford Glass or silver spoons will be declarable under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney also raised the question of disclosure in relation to advisers. It is important to have openness with regard to personal appointments made by Ministers which are not made through normal Civil Service recruitment procedures.  This is a novel feature in the Bill.  It is normal practice for a Minister, on taking office, to appoint their Dáil secretary to the post of ministerial secretary on the departmental payroll.  Such appointments are covered by this mechanism.  The Bill provides that advisers, responsible for providing senior policy advice, make a public declaration of their interests and be subject to the same regime as senior civil servants. It is also proposed that they place details of their qualifications on the record.  Therefore, the public can be assured that people employed from public funds can provide the high quality advice for which they are paid.  It would also be in the interests of transparency to declare if such appointees are related to the relevant Minister. This has been a matter of controversy and should be addressed in an open manner.</P>
    <P>The legislation also applies to State companies where people are often entrusted with large amounts of public money.  The guidelines drawn up by the previous Government, in the wake of some disturbing events in State companies, <Col N="1073" /> are being put on a statutory footing. That is the basis for the provisions in Part IV of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their contributions. I look forward to the Committee Stage debate where some of the points raised today can be teased out in more detail.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I have raised the matter of higher diploma places because of concerns raised by my constituents. Senator Daly also raised it on the Order of Business earlier in the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Graduates who have completed their primary degree are discovering that they cannot get a place under this allocation for the simple reason the Higher Education Authority has decided to impose a limit on the number of places available.  I want to ask the Minister if autonomy has been taken away from the universities in this regard.  I understand that the Higher Education Authority, the Department of Education and the universities reached agreement but the Higher Education Authority initiated a limit on the number of places. This has created great concern for graduates in particular and a sense of panic has set in.  Graduates now apply whether they want to pursue a career in teaching.  They do, however, want to pursue a Higher Diploma in Education. Will the Minister review this matter because the allocation for this year is only 170 places while there are over 1,000 applicants for the higher diploma <Col N="1074" /> course?  The university may see it in a different light and may be able to allocate more places.  Why 170 places? What are the criteria for assessing the number of places?</P>
    <P>The university should have more autonomy in assessing the number of places.  It is not good enough for the Higher Education Authority to decide that everyone who pursues the higher education diploma will automatically enter the teaching profession.  Many graduates find it a rewarding and interesting course which they do not necessarily consider a foundation for the teaching profession.  It is a fine postgraduate course.  It is high handed of the Higher Education Authority to impose an arbitrary number of places and to dictate the terms to the universities.  I ask the Minister to review this policy and re-enter into discussions with the Higher Education Authority and the universities to see how best they can devise a suitable system.  Young graduates have panicked and they continue to apply for places, although some do not necessarily want to teach.  We should put these young graduates at ease as regards future policy on the allocation of places for the higher diploma in education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>While I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, to the House, I am angry that no Minister from the Department of Education is here.  The Minister can only read what she has been given; she has no responsibility for this matter and can only relay the views expressed.  When I was on the other side of the House, I was angry when Ministers were sent in simply to read scripts.  A Minister with functional responsibility should be here.  However, that is no reflection on this Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Senator Ormonde, I believe the situation is unsatisfactory.  She outlined <Col N="1075" /> the issues at stake and I do not intend to repeat them.  We have all had representations in recent weeks from people who have had to apply to all the universities.  They feel their future is being determined at random with no educational criterion as a deciding factor as to whether they will get a place on the higher diploma in education course.  Many are highly qualified, some have masters degrees or degrees in commerce or science, and want to make teaching their profession.</P>
    <P>The key question is, what is the rationale behind this policy?  I imagine it would be possible for the education departments in the universities to take in more people.  To the best of my knowledge, the higher diploma in education is not an overly expensive course. For the most part, it is a chalk and talk type course.  There are expenses as regards travel and supervision but, nonetheless, it is not inordinately expensive. Perhaps the reason for this is the shortage of teaching places for students in schools or that the Higher Education Authority or some group therein has decided that supply should be in accordance with demand and that it would be wrong to flood the market with teachers who will not get jobs.  There may be good reasons for this and it will be good to hear them.  I suspect the issue could be revised.</P>
    <P>As regards the way in which the present system is administered, it is illogical that all other third level places are administered through the Central Applications Office while in this case people apply to the universities.  Anomalies arise as some universities may give preference to their graduates while others may decide that this amounts to discrimination and may not do so.  This imposes an enormous workload on the universities and it would be sensible and rational, even if the present policy is maintained, for applications to be made to the CAO, which has transparent, open and acceptable policies as regards allocating places.  I am not saying that the universities are less than honest in <Col N="1076" /> what they are doing.  However, it is an enormous burden on them.  It also means that people must apply to three or four universities, which results in extra costs and worry for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Ormonde and the Leader of the House for affording me the opportunity to speak.  I raised this issue last year when a similar situation arose, which caused anxiety not only for those who wished to pursue the course but for their parents and families.  As a result of intervention the situation was eased.  I am disappointed the situation has arisen again this year. There is organised chaos in this area.</P>
      <P>The point at issue is that people who wish to pursue the higher diploma in education course to enable them to teach are denied the opportunity to do so, while others who are offered places are, in some cases, doing the course to get a further qualification and using it as a stepping stone to qualify for other positions outside the teaching profession.</P>
      <P>Last year the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, said it was not realistic and sensible to spend taxpayers' money providing places on the higher diploma in education course when, as Senator Manning said, there were few vacancies and, because of the decline in the number of opportunities in the teaching profession, those with the qualification would seek positions which were not available.  That is not the situation.  Many people can get temporary teaching opportunities provided they have the qualification, but this limits their opportunities overseas where they may wish to teach for a year or two before trying to get back into the system here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most frustrating thing is that last year &mdash; I believe it is also the case this year &mdash; places were allocated on a lottery basis.  It is like going to a bingo session; if you get the right numbers, you get a place.  Applicants are not interviewed. That system must be changed. Regardless of whether additional places are made available, applicants should be <Col N="1077" /> interviewed.  Senator Manning put forward an excellent idea &mdash; that this should be dealt with by the CAO where there would be a points system.  The matter would be dealt with fairly and above board and it would not be a question of potluck as regards getting a place.  Many of the young graduates who contacted me still hope to get a place if there are cancellations.  I ask the Minister to intervene with the colleges to do something to resolve this impasse because it is causing frustration and annoyance for students and parents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise to the House that I am not the Minister for Education. The Minister of State at the Department of Education asked me to reply on his behalf.  I sympathise with points made by Members, particularly the one about the CAO, which makes a lot of sense.  I will relay the points to the Minister for Education.</P>
      <P>The situation for the 1995-96 academic year is under review and decisions will be announced shortly. The Minister's objectives are to ensure an adequate supply of teachers and to maintain a reasonable balance between the supply and demand of teachers.  She wants to avoid a situation where there is an over-supply of secondary teachers which would result in public outcry about the number of teachers who cannot get employment, as happened not so long ago.  I am sure that is something which Senator Ormonde, who is involved in career guidance, would appreciate.  Training people for vacancies which do not exist is putting people to a lot of expense and causes a lot of frustration.  It makes sense to have a reasonable balance between supply and demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The exact forecasting of teacher requirements is a difficult exercise but from the enrolment projections and other information available to the Minister and the Department, it appears that the quota of higher diploma in education students enrolled for the 1994-95 <Col N="1078" /> academic year will be adequate to fill the vacancies available.</P>
    <P>As regards the higher diploma in education intake for 1995-96, the Minister is re-examining the position and she will take into account such factors as enrolment projections, the estimated teacher numbers required and other statistical information.  Other features which will have a bearing on the question are wastage and retirement of teachers, transition year take-up and the likely additional posts to be approved for schools for 1996-97.  These issues will be balanced against the total teacher supply, the output from specialist teacher training colleges, such as home economics, physical education and technology, and from higher diploma courses.  It is, therefore, a complex exercise to put it all together.</P>
    <P>In attempting to make projections, it is impossible to guess how some schools will attempt to fill their vacancies, for example, how they will redeploy existing staff and what subject mix they will seek in advertising the vacant post. Another problem is that there are perceived shortages of teachers of certain subjects.  The mobility of teachers comes into play here, and the location of the school may well have a bearing on the ease with which a specific vacant post can be filled.  The output from higher diploma in education courses does not ensure any specific mix of basic degrees.</P>
    <P>According to the most recent data available, the Higher Education Authority's report on the first destination of award recipients in higher education, only 5 per cent of those who got their higher diploma in 1993 secured a permanent teaching post.  I recognise the point made by Senator Daly that some people perhaps get temporary places before they are appointed to a permanent position.  However, we are considering this issue against a background where we will shortly have a very sharply falling cohort of students going into second level education.  Those born at the peak of our birth rate are aged 15 years and working their way through the system.</P>

      <P>All these factors must be taken into account.  It is frustrating to train people if there are no vacancies, which is why there must be some balance.  There is an ongoing review in the light of the factors I have outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister expects to make a decision shortly on the number of places on higher diploma courses for the 1995-96 academic year.  I will take back to her the concerns expressed by the Senators <Col N="1080" /> on this matter.  I know how frustrating it is for young graduates trying to get on a course and not knowing where they stand.  Whatever limit is put on the numbers, there is much scope for improving the way it is organised.  In this respect a CAO or some kind of points system may be considered.  For example, if there is a shortage of science teachers, why should all French graduates get places on higher diploma courses? There is room to consider the whole system.</P>
