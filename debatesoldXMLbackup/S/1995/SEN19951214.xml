      <P>I have notice from Senator Cotter that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to increase substantially the rate support grant notified to Castleblaney Urban District Council for 1996.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Neville on the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to allow trade union dues as a tax expense similar to allowances given for employers for contributions to their professional bodies.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take items 1, 2 and 3.  Item 1 will be taken until 3 p.m. and item 3, Committee Stage of the Harbours Bill, will be taken <Col N="1426" /> from 3 p.m. until 5 p.m.  This may conclude and I hope that will be the case. If item 1 has not concluded by 3 p.m., it will recommence at 5 p.m. and continue until it is concluded.  Item 2 will be taken at the conclusion of item 1 and there will be a sos from 1 p.m. until 2 p.m.</P>

      <P>I have experience of the difficulties and pressures faced by the Leader and, in the interest of the wellbeing of the House, we will play our part to ensure the legislation before the House is dealt with today.</P>
      <P>It would be remiss not to mention the Irish soccer team today and the great success and joy everybody has experienced over the last ten years.  Well done to all concerned.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister of State at the Department of Health what is being done about children begging on the street in this cold weather?  The situation is a disgrace. Many pieces of legislation were introduced to put an end to it and to ensure children could be taken into care.  The children do not beg from necessity; it is a racket.  The money is collected by their parents for drink or drugs.  It is scandalous that somebody cannot go to O'Connell Bridge and take those children into care.  If this was happening in Bosnia or elsewhere, the House would discuss it. Those children are shivering with the cold.  It was pitiful to see them sitting there yesterday.  It is obvious they are afraid to move.  The Minister should be asked to do something about it.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Leader could arrange a debate about the report on the abuse of prisoners.  There is much discussion about this matter, and correctly so. However, is there a body which could investigate the abuse handed out by criminals to their victims?  Photographs of such victims, two old men, were featured in the newspapers recently.  How can it be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Justice the reason for the long delay in the publication of the Council of Europe report on the treatment of detainees in prison and Garda stations in Ireland?  I realise the Department must be given time to make a response.  However, 18 months is a long time.</P>
      <P>I join Senator Wright in thanking the Irish soccer team for the great entertainment they provided last night.  Players such as Aldridge, Townsend, McGrath, Babb and Cascarino are old friends and perhaps this is part of the problem. However, they have given a great deal of pleasure and it is pity the team is out of the competition.</P>

      <P>When is it intended to take item 12, motion 23 on the Order Paper?  This calls on the Government, as a matter of urgency, to formulate a policy to counteract the growing trends where satellite television channels demand exclusive rights to sporting events.  I raised this matter previously. For example, people in Ireland had the right to watch the Irish team's performance last night, but Irish people in North America had to pay exorbitant fees to do so.  It involves a type of scam where a signal is taken from RTE and beamed in from Canada.  Remuneration is demanded by some smart individual in Canada and Irish people living in North America must pay exorbitant fees to enjoy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Irish soccer team might have achieved a better result last night if it included a few of the County Clare hurlers.</P>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Agency is carrying out a study on the state of the environment which I understand was supposed to be published before the end of this year.  The last study was done over ten years ago, around 1985, by An Foras Forbartha. There is a quite a lot of interest in the results of the new study.  Can the Leader raise with the Minister for the Environment what the present state of the study is and when we are likely to see it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Leader arrange a debate on various aspects of European funding?  I have been asking the Leader for a long time to try to arrange such a debate.  We are reaching a crisis situation, although it is not my intention to sensationalise the request <Col N="1429" /> for a debate.  The Taoiseach was in Donegal on 27 October 1995 and stated that there would be no additionality to the funding available under the INTERREG scheme.  However, when the Minister for Finance was in Monaghan last Friday he said there would be additionality.  He was speaking in the presence of the European Commissioner for Regional Development, Monika Wulf-Mathies.</P>
      <P>There is confusion because we have 70 organisations concerned with funding at the moment.  There is a task force controlled from the Taoiseach's Office to supervise all 70 of them.  In view of the alarming statement the Taoiseach made in Donegal that there would be no additionality, I believe this House should have a debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Leader would also welcome the opportunity to have this matter discussed.  We can help to clarify the problem for anyone contemplating putting a small business together.  Such people do not know where to turn at the present time.  There is organised confusion and internal difficulties. It would appear to the general public that there is a serious difference between the Taoiseach's Office and the Office of the Minister for Finance.</P>

I join with him, Senator Henry and others in thanking the Irish football team for ten great years.  Nobody is writing them off at this stage.  We are into a stage of renewal and we all hope that the next ten years will be equally if not more successful and enjoyable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Farrell raised a number of questions about children.  It could well <Col N="1430" /> be an item for debate later in the next session.</P>
    <P>I will inquire on Senator Henry's behalf from the Minister for Justice why there was a delay in publishing that report.</P>
    <P>Senator Kiely will have an opportunity on the first Wednesday of the next session when Fianna Fáil has Private Members' time.  I am sure he could have a word with his Chief Whip and his leader.  If need be he will certainly have an opportunity to have that motion debated then.  I have promised a debate on broadcasting in the new session which will cover many of these issues.</P>
    <P>On behalf of Senator Daly, I will ask the Minister for the Environment about the state of that Environment Protection Agency report and will come back to him on that.</P>
    <P>As regards Senator McGowan's point, I gave an assurance to Senator Wright that there will be a debate early in the next session on cross-Border funding.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 7, before section 7, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;7.&mdash;As and from the coming into operation of this Act, a judge sitting in any Court shall be addressed as `A Bhreitheamh' or `Judge&rdquo;'.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment has just arrived.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Mulcahy might like to elaborate on the purpose of the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>My apologies, a Chathaoirligh.  This is a very obvious amendment.  A similar section was inserted into the 1991 Courts Act in that judges of the District Court are now individually called a judge.  Of course, the Irish for a judge is a bhreitheamh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to the Minister in the Dáil and she said it would be a matter for the rules committee of the superior courts or for judges who are involved in the administration of justice to decide what judges should be called.  Why should it be in statute that a District Court judge is called &ldquo;judge&rdquo;, yet there is no appellation for judges in this Bill?  The commonly used term for a judge of the Circuit <Col N="1432" /> Court, the High Court or the Supreme Court is &ldquo;my Lord&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Or &ldquo;my God&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an anachronistic and archaic term and is a relic of a bygone era, of former colonial days. This is a young, modern, democratic and pluralist republic.  We believe in the equality of all people.  It behoves us in all our statues to use forms of address which show equality of treatment.  When one must address a judge of the superior courts as &ldquo;my Lord&rdquo;, it is not in keeping with that spirit.</P>
      <P>I am not trying to do something new. In 1991 the Oireachtas decided in its wisdom &mdash; perhaps the Minister will correct me if I am wrong &mdash; that judges of the District Court would be called &ldquo;judge&rdquo;, not Justice or Mr. Justice. Some of the amendments to this Bill try to bring equality of treatment to the various courts in terms of their status. Later amendments will require that District Court judges should not be required to retire at 65 years, but at 70 years.  Why should we address a District Court judge in a different form of appellation to a Circuit Court, High Court or Supreme Court judge?  Will we show less respect to District Court judge?</P>
      <P>For the first time solicitors will be able to become judges of the District Court and Circuit Court and, after four years' experience there, of the High Court and the Supreme Court.  We are trying to bring equality to all the courts. I hope that over time that equality would pertain to courthouses.  We all know about the disgraceful condition of some of the District Courts.  On many occasions judges have refused to sit in the District Courts because they believed it was contrary to respect for the law that people should be required to go to such premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a strong and unarguable case to accept this amendment.  The precedent already exists that judges of any of the courts should be called &ldquo;judge&rdquo; or &ldquo;a bhreitheamh&rdquo;.  This point was made by the Fianna Fáil Justice spokesman, <Col N="1433" /> Deputy O'Donoghue, in the Dáil. I do not know whether the Minister is aware that in the 1991 Act District Court judges have been called &ldquo;judge&rdquo;. I ask my colleagues and the Minister, in the positive spirit she outlined yesterday, to make this radical change to bring our courts into a young, modern, pluralist and egalitarian Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with sympathy to some of the points made by the Senator, particularly in relation to the antiquated and colonial term &ldquo;my Lord&rdquo;.  If we were in the House of Lords, I would refer to the Senator as the &ldquo;Noble Lord&rdquo;.  Thankfully, we are not there.  The Senator said he listened to the Minister, so he will be aware of the likely reply which I will make.  Having listened to the points made, he will hardly be surprised to find I am not convinced that this is the appropriate way to deal with this matter in that it should not be in primary legislation.</P>
      <P>It is a matter of practice and procedure which comes within the responsibility of the rules committees of the various courts.  These committees are made up of judges and others &mdash; for example, the superior courts rules committee includes the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court, the Master of the High Court, two practising barristers and two practising solicitors.  The rules made by the different committees provide for the modes of address of judges in the superior courts, the Circuit Court and the District Court.  I am satisfied that if judges wish to change the way they are addressed they could bring suitable proposals to the appropriate rules committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised that the change in the 1991 Act to which Senator Mulcahy referred was that &ldquo;Justice&rdquo; was changed to &ldquo;judge&rdquo;.  It was not an attempt to tell lawyers how to address a District Judge. I do not believe it was as fundamental a change as the Senator suggested.  It is not appropriate that this House should involve itself in how judges should be addressed in court.  I understand the <Col N="1434" /> Senator has a professional interest in this matter but I am not sure it is one which should concern the House.  I am confident that if the Judiciary wishes to be addressed in a particular way, it would not regard itself as being bound by any custom or practice which operated in the past or which might have been common prior to the foundation of the State.  This is a matter at which the working group on the courts commission which we have established might look.  If the Senator is anxious to take the matter further, I suggest he raise it with the working group, which would be a more appropriate forum than the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>If this amendment was accepted, we would send a clear message that we want to modernise things in the courts as we have done in other areas.  Before the foundation of the State, I would probably have been referring to Senator Mulcahy as my right honourable colleague from the southwest. That kind of rubbish is gone and it is time we eliminated the intimidation that the jargon, wigs and gowns have led to in the courts over the years.  We should send a clear and strong signal that we are modernising the practice and procedure in the courts as we would anywhere else.  I support the amendment and the Minister of State would be wise to accept it.  It would send a clear message that this is a reforming Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support Senator Mulcahy's amendment.  I am not convinced that we should not take the initiative because it is not included in the Bill or is a matter regulated by the Judiciary itself.  There is a slight suggestion in the Minister's reply that we will allow judges to decide this matter for themselves because we do not want to ruffle their feathers or their wigs.  The removal of the ban on wigs applies only to barristers while the Judiciary is to retain that particular item of apparel.  I have a preference for the Irish version, &ldquo;breitheamh&rdquo;.  I said yesterday <Col N="1435" /> in the context of discussions about wigs and gowns, that this is snobbery. The use of the phrase &ldquo;my lord&rdquo; must be the highest form of snobbery if it is not directed to the Lord Almighty. I fully support this amendment and I do not believe the Government should have any reservations about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not find the Minister's reply satisfactory.  He agreed that there was a precedent for the Oireachtas dictating &mdash; it is a bad but accurate word &mdash; to one section of the Judiciary how they are to be addressed by members of the public.  The Minister did not deny that precedent exists.  What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.  If it is good enough for a District Court judge to be called judge and to be told by the Oireachtas that he will be called judge, why can the same not be done for other judges?  There is no logical reason for it.  I agree with my colleagues, Senator Daly and Senator McGennis.  We want to try and rid the courts of all this anachronistic behaviour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister of State will not accept this moderate amendment.  We are not looking for any drastic change in the Bill.  It is a common sense move for which there is statutory precedent.  I am sorry that the Minister has not seen fit, in line with his Christmas generosity, to take on this first amendment, which I thought would signal the acceptance of many more amendments this morning.  Under those <Col N="1436" /> circumstances this matter will have to be pressed because it will mark a line of division between those in this Oireachtas who are prepared to intervene to make the running of the courts more modern and egalitarian.

      <P>I am surprised at the point Senator Daly was making.  After 70 years of a democracy and a republic, this should not be the touchstone against which we judge how democratic and republican we are.  I would have thought that our democracy and republic was sufficiently self confident not to be bothered by trivialities of this nature.  In the context in which Senator Daly was speaking, this really is a triviality.</P>
      <P>I note the point that Senator Mulcahy made about precedent, but he knows that there is relevant and irrelevant precedent. In my view, this is in the latter category.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (1), line 34, to delete &ldquo;informing&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;advising&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates the provision, in Part IV of the Bill, for a Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  I hope I am not misinforming the Minister of State or this House by stating that during the debate on this matter in the Lower House the Minister for Justice strongly stressed the notion that the board will be an advisory one.  It is, therefore, open to the Minister for Justice and the Government to ignore the recommendations of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, having first given them due consideration.</P>
      <P>Section 13 (1) of the Bill states that the board will be established:</P>
      <P>For the purposes of identifying persons and informing the Government of the suitability of those persons for appointment....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment proposes to substitute &ldquo;advising&rdquo; for &ldquo;informing&rdquo; in this subsection. When someone states the they are &ldquo;informing&rdquo; they are speaking in relation to certain knowledge.  If they state that they are &ldquo;advising&rdquo; this represents an indication of expert or considerable knowledge or opinion.  A difference exists between the two.  It should not be open to the advisory board to make absolute stipulations. From the use of the word &ldquo;informing&rdquo;, I am of the opinion that the board will be able to do so.  It would be more in keeping with the spirit of the board being of an advisory nature, and would not remove any of the weight of the subsection, to substitute &ldquo;advising&rdquo; for &ldquo;informing&rdquo;.  The use of the word &ldquo;informing&rdquo; is too strong and confers a <Col N="1439" /> status on the advisory board which the Minister for Justice did not intend.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of section 13 is to establish a Judicial Appointments Advisory Board to identify and inform the Government of the suitability of persons for appointment to judicial office.  The amendment tabled by Senator Mulcahy seeks to substitute the word &ldquo;advising&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;informing&rdquo;.  This is essentially a drafting matter.  I am satisfied that the wording of section 13 (1) makes it clear that an advisory function is involved.  I do not believe that anyone could possibly be in any doubt in this regard.  Section 13 (1) states that the function of the board is:</P>
      <P>For the purposes of identifying persons and informing the Government of the suitability of those persons for appointment to judicial office, there shall be established a body to be known as the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board (in this part referred to as &ldquo;the Board&rdquo;).</P>
      <P>A person would have to be very dim to not understand the purpose of that section.  Another interpretation of it would not be permissible.  Senator Mulcahy, wearing his lawyer's hat, may consider that no other interpretation is permissible because the Government is constitutionally required to decide upon on judicial appointments.  I believe that the Senator will withdraw the amendment following due consideration.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1440" /> In page 9, line 3, to delete subparagraph (v) and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(v) the President, for the time being, of the Law Reform Commission.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am not sure that my contribution with regard to this amendment will be as brief as those in relation to the first two amendments because we are approaching the substance of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 13 (5) seeks to appoint the Attorney General as a member of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board. The Attorney General is the legal adviser to the Government.  It has been accepted in recent years that the Attorney General also has a role to play as the public's watchdog in relation to law.  Primarily, however, he or she is the legal adviser to the Government.  The position of Attorney General is a constitutional one.  The person who fills that office is appointed by Government.  The Constitution does not stipulate that he or she must possess any legal qualification. However, it is usual that they do. The Attorney General is normally a barrister, but in my opinion no barrier exists to prevent a solicitor holding the office.  The fact remains, however, that the Attorney General is the legal adviser to the Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware that a threefold division of powers exists in this country between the Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary.  Certain wags might express the opinion that a Fourth Estate exists which is more powerful than the three to which I have referred. However, those three represent the basic constitutional arms of the State. Not only are these three distinct, but they are intended to be independent in their function.  In that context I cannot understand how the chief legal adviser to the Government can also, with any constitutional credibility, possess a role in the appointment of judges.  The Minister of State cannot tell me that the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board will not have a role in appointing judges.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and they were fine comments to the effect that if it is not broken, do not fix it &mdash; nor will I repeat the fact that Ministers have failed to provide one whit or shred of rationale as to why there should be a Judicial Appointments Advisory Board in the first place.  They have not said there was one bad judicial appointment and they have not said there ever was a problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House may feel I am digressing slightly and trying to re-enter the debate on Second Stage, which of course I am not, but I will not be taken from this point quickly because I regard it as a point of the gravest concern that the Executive arm of Government would seek to impose its will on the judicial arm of Government.  In this regard the Government's proposals are wrong, unlawful and, I am almost sure, unconstitutional. What is the more regrettable is that this subsection shows up the reality of the farce of this part of the Bill in that the Government has now sought to weight and have effective control of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board by having three representatives and the Attorney General appointed. <Col N="1442" /> The Government will have a minimum of 40 per cent of the board; so they do not just want to control the Government, they want to control the body which will make the shortlist of judges.</P>
    <P>A further question arises from this subsection; it is a point of my later amendment and it is a most serious one. I can be corrected by the transcripts if I am wrong, but I read the proofs of Minister Owen's contribution in Dáil Éireann and she said that the Attorney General will inform the Government of what went on at the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  She said he would be the messenger boy.  She did not use the words &ldquo;messenger boy&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;will not be successful. Why does the Government insist the Attorney General be a member of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board?  Is there an implication that there is not enough expertise on the board with the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court, the President of the Circuit Court and the other persons to suitably advise the Government on the appointment of judges?  Will the Attorney General bring some extra special expertise to this board, such that will not be there available?  Does the Minister agree, even if everything I said were not the case and my arguments are wrong, this still has the appearance of connection between the Executive and the judicial functions?  Does the Minister <Col N="1443" /> agree that at every stage and in every act of the Oireachtas Governments must bend over backwards when framing legislation to ensure there is no ambiguity on this point and that there never is a connection?  It is all very well. These things can happen with the slip of a pen and they can go through in a debate which has not been as comprehensive as it should be but we are, and I say this with all seriousness, talking about the most fundamental principles of our democratic Constitution.  I am not saying the Government would in any way attempt to subvert those principles, let me be clear about that, but I am trying to warn the Government.  In reality or appearance, there will be a crossover between these two arms of Government.</P>
      <P>In that regard the proposed change recommended by the Fianna Fáil Party is remarkably sensible and easy.  It would bring &mdash; I see the Minister nodding and I am delighted &mdash; to the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board&mdash;&mdash;</P>

As I understand it, past presidents of the Law Reform Commission consisted normally of judges of the High Court, but perhaps also of the Supreme Court. These people are suited eminently to being on the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  If I am not mistaken, former chairmen of the Law Reform Commission include Judge Brian Walsh and Judge Anthony Hederman.  Is the Minister suggesting for a moment that people of this calibre are not suited to the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board?</P>

      <P>I am sorry.  I was only trying to give an example, so let me put it in general terms.  To my knowledge, in all past cases the president of the Law Reform Commission has been a person of eminent status and standing.  There would be no fear, if this amendment was accepted, of any crossover between the Executive and judicial functions.  I strongly urge the Minister to accept this amendment and, by doing so, get rid of the fear that this Bill might be open to constitutional challenge.</P>
      <P>On the Attorney General's membership of the advisory board, I would also like clarified whether it will be the role of the Attorney General to communicate its proceedings to the Government? If so, to what extent will he be bound by the later confidentiality provisions contained in the Bill?  Subject to that and to my right of reply, which may be of equal length depending on the Minister's answer, I strongly urge the Minister to take Government politics out of this board and to put in an independent person.</P>
      <P>Any Attorney General &mdash; this is not a personal attack &mdash; is not an independent person.  The Attorney General is the legal adviser to the Government.  If I am a lawyer for a company, I would not be asked by a third party to adjudicate on an issue affecting that company.  Nor can the Attorney General, who is the legal adviser to the Government, be asked to adjudicate independently on any issue affecting that Government.  He is on the Government side; he is its legal adviser.  Although certain parties sought to undermine the integrity of the relationship between the Attorney General and the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will not be making as lengthy a contribution as Senator Mulcahy, who has a more in-depth knowledge of the business of law than I.  In what I described yesterday as the Baldonnel Bill No. 1, I understand it was the president of the Law Reform Commission and not the Attorney General who was intended to be a member of this advisory board.  If that is the case, why has the Government decided that the Attorney General is more appropriate to be a member?  While I do not <Col N="1446" /> question his ability or impartiality, the Office of the Attorney General, as we discovered 12 months ago, was inundated with work with which it could not cope, although substantial changes have been made to that Office.  It is also inappropriate that the Attorney General could be considered to be a member &mdash; he is certainly not a messenger boy &mdash; of an interview board for this purpose.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning stated in his contribution yesterday that this was important, radical and reforming legislation. If this is the case, it appears this amendment is appropriate.  The president of the Law Reform Commission seems to be the person best suited to being a part of what the Government side has called a most important reforming legislation.</P>

      <P>Senator Mulcahy spoke for a considerable length of time.  He essentially said the adviser to the Government should not advise it and the adviser on legal issues, the Attorney General, should not be involved in any advisory body.  I am not a lawyer.  I cannot talk for an hour on a small amendment; it may be an important amendment in Senator Mulcahy's eyes.  The Senator is saying that the Government adviser should not advise and communicate information to it from an advisory committee but that another adviser appointed by the Government, the president of the Law Reform Commission, which is an advisory body, should do so. It is one of the key advisory bodies to which we have referred in my involvement in the justice area.  Therefore, I see a contradiction here.  I do not see any difficulty with the legal adviser to the Government being involved in a body advising the Government on judicial appointments and with the Attorney General, as adviser, communicating that information to the Government.</P>

      <P>While I have reservations regarding the role of the Attorney General on the board, the argument that there is a breach of the separation of powers is unfounded. Article 35 of the Constitution makes it an Executive power.  That has been delegated to some extent by the Government in the form of the advisory board but there is no breach of the separation of powers.  Therefore, there is no constitutional argument here at all.  The president of the Law Reform Commission is also a Government appointee and on that basis I see nothing to be gained by him replacing the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>As Senator Mulcahy said, the president of the Law Reform Commission is more than likely a former judge and on that basis he is being asked to select among colleagues.  That suggestion is not workable or good.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to appointments provided for in section 23 of the 1994 Bill, and in this Bill, few of those specified to be involved in the appointments process are in touch with barristers in a serving capacity.  However, the Attorney General is a practising barrister, he attends his office and advises the Government, but he also conducts cases on behalf of the State.  It is now a full time position.  It is important that somebody involved in these procedures sees barristers at work and can assess their suitability for appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those specified under the provisions of the section include the Chief Justice, somebody in whom we have the utmost faith, the President of the Circuit Court, the President of the District Court and, <Col N="1448" /> now, the Attorney General.  Somebody is required who is involved, who has occasion to brief barristers, sees how they perform, whether they are efficient in the discharge of their duties and are conscientious in looking after their briefs on behalf of the State, and, having seen them practise, will then be in a position to know whether that person has the wisdom, understanding and ability to be appointed a judge.  It is, therefore, a sensible proposal to include the Attorney General here, because he will understand, from a practical viewpoint, the qualities that are available and the people that are available with talent for appointment.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General has been long recognised as the leader of the Bar. Government's choose Attorneys General carefully and those normally appointed have come through the legal system and shown their ability.  It is on ability and their legal experience that Governments appoint them.  It would be wrong not to have somebody like the Attorney General on the board.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy suggested that there will be many judges on the board.  It is good that somebody will be included who is not a judge; therefore it is right to appoint the Attorney General to this position.  I support the proposal.</P>

This is not the case.  There will be one or two vacancies a year and the number of meetings would be very few.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not referring to the Senator.  She made a short, relevant speech.  The 1994 Bill provided that all the members of the board would be either judges or lawyers.  In reviewing the 1994 Bill, the Minister concluded that it was important that the board should be broadly based and should not be exclusively made up of judges and <Col N="1450" /> members of the legal profession.  This was a fundamental flaw in the 1994 Bill. The president of the Law Reform Commission is a judge, and it was felt that the board was sufficiently representative of the Judiciary.  Senator Mulcahy quoted the Minister out of context.  The Minister said, &ldquo;I have decided that I would like to have the Attorney General on the board for precisely the reason Deputy O'Donoghue has highlighted&rdquo;. She was agreeing with the Deputy.  The Minister went on: &ldquo;The Attorney General will bring the information back to the Cabinet when it is considering the recommendations of the advisory board&rdquo;.  The Senator should not take this out of context because it is clear, when one looks at section 16, that it is the board who will make the recommendation to the Minister.</P>
      <P>It is very appropriate that the Attorney General should be a member of the board.  As Senator Enright has pointed out, he is long recognised as the leader of the Bar, and he or she will have experience as a practitioner in dealing with barristers and solicitors. Who is better qualified to make an assessment of barristers than one who has such an intimate knowledge of them?  In addition, in his role in defending the Constitution, the Attorney General has regular contact with and experience of both branches of the profession.  Indeed, the Attorney General is uniquely suited to be a member of the board whose function it is to advise on appointments to judicial office.  This is a section of the Bill where we have gained considerably from the experience of the 1994 Bill, and it is a section I strongly support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister brought them up in his contribution and I have a right to reply.  The Minister also quoted correctly from the contribution of the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, in the Dáil.  She said, and the Minister can correct me if I am wrong: &ldquo;The Attorney General will be the person who will bring the information back to the Cabinet when they are considering the recommendations of the advisory board&rdquo;.  That is not in the Bill.  In this statement to the Dáil the Minister for Justice has let the cat out of the bag. This Government envisages the Attorney General acting as its eyes and ears on the board.  The Government wants it both ways.  It wants the Attorney General on the board deciding on the shortlist and it wants him in the Government advising the Government on making the final decisions.</P>
      <P>Either the Minister for Justice corrects this statement or a serious situation will emerge.  The Bill does not provide for the Attorney General communicating such information to the Government.  It is a gross impertinence &mdash; and I choose those words carefully &mdash; to suggest that anybody other than the chairperson of the board will communicate the findings and the recommendations of that board to the Government. If that is the case there will be two people communicating to the Government &mdash; the Attorney General by the back door and the chairperson of the advisory board, the Chief Justice, through the official channel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that the Minister's statement be amended.  In fact, her statement that the Attorney General would communicate the findings of the board is contrary to the confidentiality provisions of the Bill.  I hope the Leas-Chathaoirleach does not think I am straying, but the two matters are connected. The Minister has put it on record that the Attorney General will relay these messages; yet in another section of the Bill there is a confidentiality clause.  This issue must be clarified. Perhaps we would take the Minister's word if she were to come to the <Col N="1454" /> House and clarify the position.  Did she really mean that the Attorney General will communicate back to the Government, or will she withdraw that comment? Will she accept that the Chief Justice, as chairperson of the board, through his or her secretary or office will communicate with the Government? The Minister's statement about the Attorney General has the effect of undermining the position of the chairperson of the board.  It is a matter of gravity with regard to whether or not the Attorney General should be on the board.  I did not find the Minister's arguments convincing and he did not find mine convincing.  That is life.</P>

      <P>I am putting on record my objection and the objection of my party to the Attorney General being a member of this board.  It is wrong and looks wrong.  It sends the wrong signals. It is probably unlawful and is almost certainly unconstitutional.  I ask the Minister, first, to clarify the Minister for Justice's statement regarding communications by the Attorney General and, second, for the sake of maintaining the division of powers enshrined in the Constitution, to accept what everyone would agree is an eminently sensible suggestion. Nobody could rationally disagree with the chairman for the time being of the Law Reform Commission taking the Attorney General's place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>My points relate to this amendment, because if it is carried it will deal with problems which may <Col N="1455" /> arise later.  Senator Mulcahy made the case for not having the Attorney General as a member of the board.  This case is also made in section 18.  Subsection (1) of that section states that &ldquo;The Board may recommend the Attorney General for appointment to judicial office&rdquo; and subsection (2) states:</P>
      <P>Where the Attorney General wishes to be considered for appointment to judicial office, he or she shall withdraw from any deliberations of the Board concerning his or her suitability for judicial office.</P>
      <P>It seems to me to be a waste of time establishing a board, a member of which may have to absent himself or herself in the event of being considered for appointment as a judge.</P>
      <P>This section makes the case for the Attorney General not being a member of the board.  It specifically mentions the Attorney General but it does not mention the barrister and the solicitor who are to be members and the three persons to be nominated by the Minister. There is potential for a conflict of interest here.  Such a conflict arose after the appointment of the present Attorney General, which he immediately disclosed.  The Bill will place him in an invidious position in that he may have to absent himself from the board if it is considering him for appointment as a judge.  I cannot talk about the legality and the constitutionality of this because I am the only Senator present who is not a lawyer or a solicitor.</P>

      <P>Senator Mulcahy and Senator O'Kennedy both said that &ldquo;If it ain't broke don't fix it&rdquo;.  In the past the Attorney General made recommendations to the Government on judicial appointments because of his experience in the legal field.  People on all sides of the House will agree that judicial appointments have been eminently satisfactory and our Judiciary is the <Col N="1456" /> envy of democracies throughout the world.  Our democratic system, and in particular our Judiciary, are of a high standard.  The honesty and integrity of those appointed have never been called into question.  In the main, appointments have been made by Governments on the recommendations of the Attorney General.  Because he is a practising barrister, his views should be expressed at meetings of the board and we should take account of them.  His words should be listened to with attention and they will be of considerable benefit to the board.</P>
      <P>All of the members of the board proposed in the original Bill would have been based in Dublin.  Membership of the board proposed in this Bill will allow for membership of persons other than solicitors or barristers.</P>

However, he is only one member of the board and it is the board which will make recommendations to the Government.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 9, paragraph (b) (i), line 4, to delete &ldquo;a practising barrister who shall be nominated by&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister may breathe a sigh of relief as I do not intend to spend as much time on these amendments as the previous amendment.  However, this is not to say I can be rushed on sections of this importance.</P>
      <P>The amendments relate to the composition of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  It is proposed that the chairman for the time being of the Council of the Bar of Ireland and the president for the time being of the Law Society of Ireland will each have the power to nominate an individual to the board.  However, the only specification is that the individuals have a legal qualification and are either practising barristers or solicitors.  My problem is that the provision is undemocratic and there is no sense of control regarding the appointments.</P>
      <P>The effect of my amendments is that the president for the time being of the Law Society and the chairman for the time being of the Bar Council would sit on the board.  The Minister may accept, by way of judicial notice or common knowledge, that the chairman of the Bar Council is invariably a practising barrister. It is also the case that the president of the Law Society is invariably a practising solicitor.  They were democratically elected by their peers and colleagues as people of ability and integrity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister would have no difficulty with the presence of these people on the board and I do not suggest otherwise. However, I am sure he understands my point.  There is no governmental control over the nominee of either person and it <Col N="1459" /> is possible the person appointed by the chairman of the Bar Council or president of the Law Society would not be of calibre and may be unsuitable.  The position is unclear because there is no sense of control.  It is unlikely that will be the case but why not go for the best? Why not opt for the person in the Law Society or Bar Council who was elected by their peers?  They have a democratic mandate and there is no stronger weight in their favour.  It makes sense and I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support the amendment for the reasons outlined by Senator Mulcahy.  The chairman of the Bar Council and the president of Law Society were elected by their peers and are the obvious people to appoint to the advisory board.  Will it not be difficult for the chairman of the Bar Council or the president of the Law Society to identify a solicitor and a barrister who does not want to be a judge?  There will be practical problems in identifying people who want to sit on the board but who do not want to be considered for judicial appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>It is normal for chairmen or chief executives to nominate people to various boards, such as the advisory board.  I was nominated in that manner to the Employment Appeals Tribunal by the head of IBEC and appointed by the Minister.  There is nothing unusual about this approach.  It is long standing practice.  I have every confidence that the chairman of the Bar Council and the president of the Law Society will choose people of proper calibre.  They would not be at that level if they did not have the ability and expertise to select suitable people for posts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to the Senator explain the reasons behind his amendments. However, on balance, it is better the two nominating bodies have as wide a discretion as possible.  It may prove to be the case that the chairman for the time being of the Bar Council or the <Col N="1460" /> president for the time being of the Law Society would be unable to carry out their functions under the Bill because of other duties.  Paragraph (2) states the persons nominated by the Bar Council and the Law Society shall hold office for three years.  This is an important provision to ensure there is some continuity on the advisory board.</P>
      <P>As I understand the position, the president of the Law Society holds office for only one year; this also applies to the chairman of the Bar Council.  The effect, therefore, of the Senator's amendment would be that the representatives of the Bar Council and the Law Society would have to change every time a new chairman of the Bar Council or president of the Law Society was appointed.</P>
      <P>A further problem could arise under the provisions of section 18 which prohibits the board from recommending for appointment to judicial office any of its own members.  For example, if the chairman for the time being of the Bar Council wished to be considered for appointment as a judge, he or she could not be considered by the board for as long as he or she was chairman of the Bar Council.  On balance, therefore, it is best to leave some flexibility in this area.  We can safely leave it to the chairman of the Bar Council and the president of the Law Society to nominate persons as they see fit.  Nothing in the section would, for example, prevent the president for the time being of the Law Society nominating himself or herself. This would also apply to the chairman for the time being of the Bar Council.  I hope, following due cogitation, that the amendments will be withdrawn.</P>

      <P>In a previous reply to a question I raised about the Attorney General the Minister said he accepted my point, but he was happy the Attorney General's workload would not increase substantially as there would be two meetings or vacancies a year.  Is the Minister saying the workload of the chairman of the Bar Council and the president of the Law Society would exceed that of the Attorney General? Without dealing in detail with the purpose of the section, it is clear the advisory board will not be capable of functioning. It will not work.  As I said earlier, the Attorney General is on the board and may absent himself if he wishes to be promoted.  However, the Minister said the chairman of the Bar Council and the president of the Law Society may wish to be considered.  The situation does not add up.</P>
      <P>The Minister is a man whom I totally respect because of his political involvement both inside and outside this Republic.  He knows in his heart of hearts that this is nonsense.  Senator Mulcahy's worry is that this advisory board might be taking away some of the powers of the particular arm of Government. I am convinced that this Judicial Appointments Advisory Board is a sham.  It will do nothing.  We will come to it when we deal with its composition. Of the members of this board, one, as Senator Mulcahy said, will be the law officer to the Government and the other three will be appointed by the Minister. It will be a sham and it will not work. The Minister's reply in relation to these amendments utterly contradicts his reply on the exact same question about the Attorney General.  So the Minister knows that it will not work.</P>

      <P>Whatever the board is, it is certainly not a sham.  We can take that for granted.  I would take the point Senator McGennis was making in relation to my previous remarks about the Attorney General if we were talking only in terms of the workload.  However, there may be other reasons personal to the two people concerned why they <Col N="1462" /> would not want to be on this board.  We are effectively saying to them you must be on this advisory board.  The only point I am making is that they may not wish to be.</P>
      <P>If we are seriously concerned about improving the Bill rather than going through the motions, you should seriously consider the point I made about the president of the Law Society and the chairman of the Bar Council holding office for one year.  That is an important point and I hope on that basis that we will not put the burden on your colleagues in other parts of this building to come back once again to vote.</P>

That is correct and I think the Minister will agree that that is not a problem in their appointment.  It may be an appointment for the last six months, 18 months or two years of their reign.

      <P>Correct me if I am wrong, but in most nominating situations, Senator, you are nominated on the election of a body.  I think the Minister would have to agree that it would be very democratic and seen to be involving both professions if the practising barrister or solicitor were nominated by the governing body of each of their professions.

      <P>If the Minister's interpretation of Senator Mulcahy's amendment is correct &mdash; in that he is saying it is unworkable to have Marion McGennis, who happened to be president of the Bar Council, nominated to this board for three years because she would only be president of the Bar Council for a year &mdash; may I ask the Minister to explain that?  Take the example of the President of the High Court.  We referred to the Attorney General and I do not wish in any way to politicise this issue.  Harry Whelehan was appointed President of the High Court and, as you know, he subsequently resigned; but had this advisory board been <i>in situ</i> at the time, would he not then have been a member of this advisory board for three years?  That is a crisis scenario.</P>
      <P>I know there is provision in the Bill to appoint people on the death of members, but are the Chief Justice and the other members of the board, if their term of office expires within one year of that, not entitled to continue on for the three year period?  More particularly, in view of the crisis situation that prevailed in relation to the President of the High Court, is he not entitled to retain his position on this advisory board as the appointment is for three years?</P>

      <P>Senator McGennis has highlighted a very important point. There are specific retirement and replacement provisions in section 15, subsections (2), (3) and (4), for the presidents of the three courts, but there are no retirement and replacement provisions in the Bill for the Attorney General. The Minister need not put his eyes up to heaven.  We are only going by what is in the Bill and trying to make sense of it.  Unfortunately, no flexibility has been shown, even though we were assured by the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, yesterday that if good suggestions were made they would be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point concerns the president &ldquo;for the time being&rdquo; of the Law Society.  It is frequently a term in a contract that in the event of a dispute, the matter will be referred to the president of the Law Society of Ireland.  If that matter is referred on 1 January, whoever is president of the Law Society takes seisin of that case.  Even if they retire on 2 January, they still have seisin of that case and arbitration could last for 25 years.  The Minister must agree that election by one's peers is democratic, but I am offering a second possibility <Col N="1466" /> which is even more democratic and has the safeguard of the control of the professional organisation.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, I have not tabled an amendment to this effect.  During Committee Stage of the Criminal Law (Incest Proceedings) (No. 2) Bill, 1995, the Minister accepted the spirit of an amendment but said she would formulate another.  I will withdraw my amendment if the Minister accepts that the two people would be nominated by the two governing bodies, which is a sensible suggestion.</P>
    <P>We are here to make good law and to protect the public.  However, if the chairman of the Bar Council or the president of the Law Society of Ireland wants to become a judge, they can nominate a crony to the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board on the understanding that they will argue cogently and strongly in support their colleague who wishes to become a judge.  The Minister cannot say that will never happen. I propose that the governing bodies of the two professions nominate somebody. This would ensure the independence of that person and would guarantee integrity and democracy.</P>
    <P>My legal colleague, Senator Gallagher, would agree that the council of the Law Society of Ireland is responsible and so too is the general council of the Bar of Ireland.  Surely, they are more appropriate to make such a nomination. I plead with the Minister to consider this.</P>

      <P>I am surprised to the extent of annoyance that the Minister does not seem to have taken proper consultation on this relatively modest proposed change.  Can he not see the good sense in having a democratic mandate, either by way of selection by the Bar Council or the Law Society or by having the chairperson of either body on the board?  It eliminates all the dangers.</P>
      <P>I want this debate to proceed in as expeditious and good mannered a way as possible but we are dealing with some of the most sensitive issues affecting the administration of justice.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing I am saying here today is by way of a filibuster.  I do not believe in filibusters.  This is a good amendment.  It is worthy of consideration and a chance for the Government to show its bona fides in respect of this board and of this Bill and I would hope it can see its way to accepting it.</P>
      <P>In order to discuss this amendment properly we have to remember exactly what is the purpose of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board: it is supposed to give the Government independent and competent advice in the shortlisting of candidates for the Judiciary.  It has been totally accepted that it is the constitutional prerogative of the President on the advice of the Government to appoint judges.  This body is to advise on the shortlisting of candidates aside from that process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has made it very clear that in no way is she or the Government seeking to control this advisory body. However, she will be able to do so because the Minister appoints three persons <Col N="1475" /> to the board, the Attorney General, who is appointed by the Government, is also a member &mdash; there are, therefore, four direct Government appointees &mdash; and then, of course, there are judges who may have been appointed by the Government.  There will, in effect, be a Government appointed majority on this board.  That is not to suggest that any person, especially from the judicial side, would be anything other than fair, impartial and objective in their deliberations and advice.  I am not suggesting that that would be otherwise.  However, let us think about how this will appear to the public.  The Government has the Attorney General and three other appointees on this board; that is four out of ten or 40 per cent of the vote. That is close enough to a majority for people to be able to say that the advisory board is Government controlled, not independent as it is supposed to be.</P>
    <P>My amendment would deliver some degree of control on the pool of persons the Minister would have in his or her discretion to appoint to the board. Nobody here needs reminding of the type of vocational bodies I am talking about.  The Minister will be aware that, under our Constitution, for candidates to go forward in a Seanad election they must either be nominated by a parliamentary party or by certain vocational bodies which have this nominating ability by operation of law.  It would be an excellent idea and in a sense mirroring the intention of the Minister in the form of words that she has used in the provision which talks about the knowledge or experience that the Minister considers appropriate of commerce, finance or administration.  It is almost a paraphrase for the type of bodies that one would find on the nominating panels for Seanad Éireann &mdash; the Licensed Vintners Association, the National Youth Council of Ireland, etc.</P>
    <P>It would be an excellent idea and it would send out the right signals if the Minister were to commit herself to appointing as these three people the <Col N="1476" /> head or heads of three of these vocational organisations.  It could be said that it might not include certain bodies who are not members of vocational panels.  Yesterday she gave some examples.  She specifically listed Women's Aid, Women's Refuge, people who go into court assisting the victims of crime, etc.  The Minister said these were the types of people she might be appointing.  If so, those bodies could also apply, and there is an application process to become nominating bodies for Seanad elections.  Correct me if I am wrong, but the correct procedure is that these bodies apply under law to the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad for such status.  I ask the Minister to give us a signal that the three people she will appoint to this board will be from that type of background and will not be chosen totally at random.  Subject to that, there is no need for me to go over the wording of my amendment, but if there is any flexibility being shown by the Minister, this could well be considered in a positive light.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Mulcahy's amendment.  I am pleased with paragraph (c) in that it allows for participation of outside bodies or people on this advisory board.  That is in marked contrast to the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995, to which I and other Members submitted amendments which would have given the same effect as the Government's proposal, which would have allowed for consumers of the service to form part of that board, but in that instance the Minister, Deputy Taylor, refused absolutely to allow those kinds of people to participate on that board.  He said it was inappropriate and that the board should be composed of barristers and solicitors and people who were <i>au fait</i> with the working of the law.</P>
      <P>I welcome the acknowledgement that consumers of the service should be included on this board which I still feel is a sham.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I disagree with what is proposed in the section because the Minister will <Col N="1477" /> have responsibility to appoint these three people to the board.  The amendment proposed by Senator Mulcahy attempts to depoliticise that process and remove the responsibility for making such appointments from the Minister of the day.  That would strengthen the specific intent of the section.</P>
    <P>In addition to the Minister's entitlement to appoint three additional persons, the Attorney General will also serve on the board.  This means that Government will control 40 per cent of the board.  That is not the way to deal with this situation.  It will not provide the kind of strength and independence to judicial appointments that the Minister intended.</P>
    <P>Section 13(3) states that &ldquo;The Board may act notwithstanding a vacancy in its membership.&rdquo;  If the board must make a decision, does the Bill state how many of its members need be in attendance in order to make a recommendation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>A quorum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mean a quorum for the purpose of convening a meeting.  How many members need be present to make a recommendation?  It may happen that the Chief Justice or the Presidents of the High, District and Circuit Courts might not be in a position to attend as a result of their workload.  The three members nominated by the Minister and the Attorney General could, as a result, make specific recommendations to the Minister.  Perhaps this situation is dealt with under the Bill, but I am not aware of it.  The subsection merely states that the board may act notwithstanding a vacancy.  What is the situation in relation to members who are unable to attend?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intention behind section 13 (2) (c) is good and is similar to the intent I proposed in relation to the Civil Legal Aid Act.  However, in the interests of ensuring balance and independence, the Minister should not be permitted to nominate the three additional members to the board.  When the names of candidates are put forward, it will ultimately <Col N="1478" /> be the Minister's decision to approve their appointment.  The amendment might help broaden the scope of the list of names of those suitable to hold judicial posts.  The Minister for Justice and both Ministers of State, Deputies Burton and Currie, have referred to the independence and impartiality of the board.  In that context, it is imperative that the Minister of State amend section 13(2)(c) and take on board Senator Mulcahy's recommendation.</P>

      <P>The Board may adopt such procedures as it thinks fit to carry out its functions under this Act and may establish subcommittees of the Board to assist it.</P>
      <P>The board must agree its own procedures. The legislation does not impose any particular procedures on the board.</P>

      <P>The Board may adopt such procedures as it thinks fit to carry out its functions under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have noted the points made by Senator Mulcahy.  Subsection (2)(c) provides that the Minister may appoint three persons who must be engaged in, or have knowledge or experience of, commerce, finance, administration or persons who have experience as consumers of the services provided by the courts, that the Minister considers <Col N="1479" /> appropriate.  This gives the Minister discretion to appoint persons from the private and public sectors who would bring to the board suitable experience and knowledge.  The Minister would be required, under the provisions of the section, to satisfy herself that the person she appointed had appropriate knowledge or experience.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the section will allow the Minister to introduce a wide range of experience into the advisory board's process, including persons who can represent people who rely on the courts on a daily basis.  Representatives of victims of crime, women's groups and other bodies could bring an invaluable and new perspective to the consideration of the suitability of candidates for judicial appointment.  The provision, as it stands, allows for the appointment of suitably experienced persons to the board.  I hope that the Deputy will withdraw his amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am extremely disappointed with the calibre of the Minister of State's contribution to what is a decent and considered proposal.  When I say &ldquo;calibre&rdquo;, I do not mean it in a personal sense.  However, the Government has obviously decided not to invest its time, effort and energy in a consideration of the proposals we have put forward.  My suspicion &mdash; that the Government is determined to grimly retain control of 40 per cent of the membership of the board &mdash; has been confirmed.  This is what is being done. The Minister cannot dispute the fact that his reply made no mention of the merits of the amendment which I tabled.  The Minister merely quoted from the section and stated that the provisions are adequate.  He did not state <Col N="1480" /> why the three nominating bodies to the Seanad would not be suitable.  That is not good enough.</P>
      <P>A proposal has been put forward to remove, from the Minister for Justice and the Government, the obloquy they might be under if they were seen to &ldquo;pack&rdquo; the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  This is similar to the case of the Attorney General, where the Minister of State could not inform the House whether that officer should retire.  The Minister has stated now that he does not know if a quorum is required.  As Senator McGennis discovered, we could be faced with a situation where the attendance of one member of the board constituted a quorum.</P>
      <P>I do not mean this in a personal sense, but it would have been better to have had the same Minister of State, Deputy Burton, present again today in the interests of continuity.  I stress to the Minister of State that I do not mean this in a personal sense.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister of State did not pay us the courtesy of informing us why the amendment is not suitable.  It has a clear <Col N="1481" /> advantage over the Bill, as it stands, in that in nominating three chairpersons from nominating bodies to the Seanad, one traverses the hurdle of accusations of bias and &ldquo;packing&rdquo; in relation to the board.  I urge the Minister of State to show a degree of flexibility which has heretofore not been shown.</P>

      <P>I will be brief.  With regard to the amendment, Senator Mulcahy is sincere in what he proposes.  I believe that the section is somewhat vague in terms of the possible scope of appointees.  Be that as it may, the section attempts to ensure that the three ministerial appointees possess some experience in the areas of commerce, administration or as consumers of the system.</P>
      <P>I have a problem with regard to the proposed amendment in that it would be very difficult to select three from the 100 nominating bodies.  I would have grave concern if the chairman of the Irish Kidney Association, for example, were nominated.  I intend no disrespect to any of the associations but their members would not necessarily have any experience in relation to what is required of them as members of the advisory board.  I do not believe the amendment achieves anything in practical terms and those are the reasons for my objection to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be an inconsistency in the Government's approach to section 13 (1) (b) and 13 (1) (c).  Maybe we are right on one issue and wrong on the other because in section 13 (2) (b) it is the chairman of the Bar Council of Ireland or the president of the Law Society of Ireland who will appoint someone from their respective organisations.  We have not been told the reason because, as Senator Mulcahy says, we have not been told there is a problem with his amendment.  If it is the chairmen of these associations who will recommend the persons to the Minister under the Bill, I cannot see why there would be any problem.  For example, if the National Women's Council was a <Col N="1482" /> nominating body &mdash; and I do not know if it is but, as Senator Mulcahy said, it is open to them to apply &mdash; would it be acceptable to the Government that its chairperson recommend a person as a member of the board?  Apparently the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, said yesterday in this House that she wanted to see ordinary people represented on this advisory board, so there is an inconsistency here.  Why, when we are dealing with barristers and solicitors will the Minister not make the direct appointment? If there was consistency throughout this section the Minister would nominate the barrister and solicitor because it would not be considered appropriate that the group or organisation make the nomination.  However, when it comes to the &ldquo;ordinary people&rdquo; who were discussed yesterday &mdash; the users, consumers and the people with the expertise &mdash; it is not good enough or appropriate that the bodies they represent should make the nomination and it is only the Minister who should appoint these people.</P>
      <P>Either there is something wrong with section 13 (2) (b) or section 13 (2) (c) or we will bring consistency to bear and agree, where outside bodies are concerned specifically, that it should be the body which should nominate the persons concerned.  Amendment No. 6 is a huge improvement to the Bill.  It would strengthen it and give the board the desired independence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of serious flaws in this amendment.  First, using the vocational bodies introduces an element of restriction into who it is possible to appoint.  These bodies are fairly wide in scope but they do not include all aspects of Irish life and there are some serious omissions.  There are also some odd or strange bodies which are good in their own way but are almost closed shops; anybody who has ever looked for a nomination will know the extent to which many of these bodies are effectively closed shops.  To that extent, if the Minister must pick from among these bodies, it probably <Col N="1483" /> excludes people who might well make the sort of contribution Senators are talking about.</P>
      <P>Second, by concentrating on the chairman or president of those bodies, it may well exclude people, even on those bodies, who might be worthy of consideration. The chairman or president may not always be the more appropriate person as sometimes people are elected to the chair or presidency because they have given long service, it is their turn, etc.</P>
      <P>Third, how does one choose between 100 different bodies?  For example, how does the Minister choose between the Society of the Irish Motor Industry, the Irish Kidney Association and the Congress of Trade Unions?</P>
      <P>Finally, if the Minister wished to pack the board in a political way &mdash; a danger which the Senator pointed out and must always be there &mdash; he would accept this amendment because one can easily find two or three organisations out of the 100 which are controlled by political parties.  We all know there are certain bodies which will nominate a candidate from one party over another.  It is a fact of life.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 9, subsection 2 (c), line 33, after &ldquo;Board&rdquo; to add &ldquo;with the prior approval of the applicant&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 14 provides that the board can make its own procedures and undertake certain activities, such as advertising and processing of application forms, consult persons and invite persons to submit their names for consideration by the board.</P>
      <P>Subsection 2 (c) provides that the board may consult persons concerning the suitability of applicants to the board. I am not sure how familiar the drafters of the Bill or the Minister are with the current procedure regarding judicial appointments.  However, the unquestionable fact is that, in the past, a watertight confidentiality existed with regard to judicial appointments.  I have been a practising member of the Bar since 1985 and, almost without exception, whenever anybody was appointed a judge of any court it came as a great surprise to me and to the vast majority of members of the Bar.  It also probably came as a surprise to the vast majority of practising solicitors.</P>
      <P>If the appointment was not made in secret, it was certainly done confidentially. This does not mean there were not consultations.  As I understand it, the process was that, informally, people would submit their names in writing to the Department of Justice requesting that they be considered for the position of judge of this or that court whenever a vacancy arose.  The Minister would then have a list of interested names so that when a vacancy in a specific court arose, he or she would consult with the Attorney General who, in turn, could consult with one or two judges.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Senator O'Kennedy, will have an added insight into this because he has been on both sides of the fence, having been a Minister and a practising member of the Bar.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another matter. One of the reasons this process has been conducted confidentially is that there is a perception at the Bar that, if it became known that one was in the running for or interested in judicial appointment, it could have an effect on one's practice, certainly as a barrister.  Say, for example, a solicitor is thinking of briefing a barrister in a major case that is to go on for several years, as many cases do and the solicitor finds out that the proposed barrister is interested in being a judge, he will rightly think that the barrister may be a judge in six months time and decide not to brief him and give him work that may last for six or seven years.  We spoke yesterday about the length of cases, delays and one or two cases are being heard in the High Court for over one year, and it has probably <Col N="1487" /> been three, four, five, six and seven years since the issuing of proceedings.</P>
      <P>There are many other reasons people could find this compromising, embarrassing or detrimental to their careers.  I am sure Senator Enright will enlighten us how, if word got out that a solicitor were to be appointed a judge, it could affect his practice, especially in rural communities where word would spread.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The wording of the amendment is careful, and states: &ldquo;... with the prior approval of the applicant&rdquo;. There is to be no consultation with anybody except with the approval of the applicant.</P>
      <P>The Minister may say this approach is hopeless and that if consultations cannot take place, the applicant does not have a chance.  However, this is for the applicant to decide.  If the applicant is a barrister, he or she will be known by some of the judges and probably by the Attorney General and, if a solicitor, will almost certainly known by the person nominated by the Law Society.</P>
      <P>The applicant will not, therefore, be a stranger.  It is fair enough if the Chief Justice advises applicants that if they do not allow the board consult with other people it may not be able to recommend them.  Perhaps the applicants will not be on the recommended list, but at least they will have the satisfaction of knowing that nobody has been consulted without their approval.</P>
      <P>By contrast, the applicants could give their approval to consulting a certain person.  For example, they may agree to a request from the Chief Justice to consult person A and C, but not person B. There is, therefore, a degree of control. Applicants can ensure that those consulted will be restricted to a class of people who will treat the matter as confidential and who will not gossip about the fact that they have applied for judicial office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1488" /> It is proposed that the board will comprise ten members.  They may consult with many people as the Bill appears to give them wide discretion to consult here, there and everywhere on the suitability of an applicant.  The applicant then becomes the topic of public conversation.</P>
    <P>The Minister must agree that much of what I have to say on this issue makes sense.  The legal community, either at the Bar or in the solicitor profession, is very small.  It would take only one or two people to start gossip.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 32, subsection (1) (a) (i), line 3, after &ldquo;master&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;who shall have the right to attend Board meetings and enter into discussions but shall not have the right to vote&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel strongly about this amendment because I have practical experience in this area.  The amendment provides that a harbour master will have the right to attend board meetings and enter into discussions but will not have the right to vote.  In every organisation a legal adviser would probably attend board meetings.  In this particular case, however, the harbour master is responsible not just for implementing the Harbours Bill but also for implementing other legislation such as the pollution <Col N="1489" /> Acts and so forth.  He must be up to date on all relevant legislation.  No member of the board could possibly be as up to date as the harbour master.  He is the person to whom I turn every day in running our little harbour in Dingle and that is only a small harbour.  The harbours that will be administered under this Bill are huge and millions of pound will be involved.  It is a mistake to omit the harbour master.</P>
    <P>The Minister will probably say there is nothing to prevent a harbour master from attending a meeting and that harbour masters at present attend meetings in some cases, but look at the problems that can occur if the harbour master is not at a board meeting.  A decision might be made by the board in all sincerity and honesty which might contravene some Act or law.  The harbour master is the legal adviser to the board to a certain extent.  Jurisdiction of the harbour is under his control &mdash; the property, piers and so forth.  He must protect the harbour company from making errors and he is responsible for the ships in his jurisdiction, their size, cargo and so forth.  If there is an accident the harbour master looks into it.  He is the person to whom one turns 24 hours a day.</P>
    <P>In the case of Dingle, the harbour master is paid to do a week's work on a 9.30 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. basis.  However, he is on call 24 hours a day, every day of the week.  On Christmas Day the board members are at home but the harbour master is there doing his job.  He is also responsible for the public when they enter the company's property.  He is the person we cannot do without.  How could the Government run its business without the Attorney General attending Cabinet meetings?  The Minister offered the example of the aviation officer not coming to Aer Rianta board meetings.  I could name other situations where people equivalent to the harbour master attend meetings.</P>
    <P>I want the right of the harbour master to attend meetings to be recognised.  If the harbour master in Dingle rang me <Col N="1490" /> to say he could not attend our meeting on Saturday I would almost cancel the meeting because his advice on everything is so important.  The Cathaoirleach in running the Seanad, for example, from time to time needs the advice of the Clerk and the Clerk Assistant of the Seanad.  I hope the Minister will accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to seriously consider looking at this amendment on Report Stage.  Senator Fitzgerald and I have had similar experience &mdash; both of us have sat on harbour boards for many years, I for ten years and Senator Fitzgerald probably for longer than that.  The Senator makes a cogent point.</P>
      <P>The role of the harbour master is unique on a harbour board.  His appointment is covered by statute and he is responsible for the safe running of the port.  He is the central person around whom the commercial decisions as well as the safety decisions of the port are made.  He is the operations manager of the port; he is in charge.  His role is both commercial in ensuring the efficiency of the port and statutory in the context of implementing legislation. As Senator Fitzgerald said the harbour master has specific statutory responsibilities under the Harbours Act, 1946, the Dangerous Substances (Amendment) Act, 1979 &mdash; which places a heavy responsibility on him &mdash; the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, the Sea Pollution Act, 1991, and the Merchant Shipping (Wreck and Salvage) Act, 1993.  He must comply with a recent EU directive which impinges on his duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He is responsible for the control of dangerous substances brought into the harbour; he controls the mooring and discharge of all cargo; he is in total control; everybody else has an executive function, his role is operational; he controls pilotage, which encompasses the pilotage master and the superintendent in charge of craft; he is in charge of the safe moorage and transfer of ships in the harbour and he licences the jetty <Col N="1491" /> and advises the board on the granting of licences for the installation operation. The harbour master is the pollution officer and the control of and response to pollution in the harbour rests with him.  There have been worrying incidents of pollution over the years which caused enormous concern.  These are his statutory responsibilities.</P>
    <P>He also has a commercial responsibility. He is the commercial operations manager and is responsible for the cost effectiveness of the harbour.  Whether the harbour makes or loses money depends a great deal on the decisions he makes.  The <i>raison d'être</i> of this Bill is to ensure the commercial survival and success of harbours.</P>
    <P>Because he has such a high level of responsibility it is felt that he should automatically attend harbour board meetings.  However, this is not the case. I know of a harbour where the harbour master has not been present at meetings and where it was the policy of the board that he should not attend.  I will not name the harbour but I can inform the Minister of it later &mdash; it is on the east coast.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I know of a harbour master who was asked to leave a meeting even though he had direct responsibility for the issue being discussed.  However, because some members of the board said they would leave the meeting if he had to leave, he was allowed stay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look seriously at this issue before Report Stage and to ensure that a harbour master can be present at board meetings.  He should be present for both the statutory and commercial areas for which he is responsible. I am asking not that he must be present but that he should have the right to attend.  I have no problem with a harbour master deciding whether he should or should not be present.  If he sees from the agenda of a meeting that he does not have to be present, this should be catered for, and the board <Col N="1492" /> should be able to conduct its duties without him and decisions made in his absence should not be null and void. The same would apply if he was on holidays.  We do not want to tie things up too much.  From ten years experience on a harbour board, I feel harbour masters should have the right to attend meetings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is essential that the harbour master be an <i>ex officio</i> member of the company.  Under section 36, the chief executive, who has a somewhat similar role, is an <i>ex officio</i> member.  In most cases the harbour master would be the technical and professional adviser to the board of directors on various matters. From time to time there will be some tensions within a board.  I am worried about the power of a board of directors to remove a chief executive.  I have had the experience of dealing with a chief executive who was constantly harassed by a board of directors and his job was almost impossible to do.  Votes of the board determined whether he held his job from one year to the next and this led to terrible confusion and dismay.  Senator Fitzgerald and I will try to amend the Bill on Report Stage to prevent this type of situation.  It is vital that harbour masters attend board meetings.  It would be bad for companies and for the management and development of ports if tensions resulted in harbour masters not attending meetings.  There is an unanswerable case for the amendment and I urge the Minister to accept it.</P>

      <P>Both sides of the House have argued that it is imperative that harbour masters attend all board meetings. From my experience of 17 years membership of a harbour board, I know that harbour masters' opinions are asked for numerous times during meetings and their expertise is brought into play.  The docking and unloading of cargo is their main responsibility.  Harbour masters must deal with accidents and with vessels entering ports which do not meet the required standards.  It is <Col N="1493" /> important that this amendment is agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue was debated at length in the Dáil and amendments similar to the one proposed by Senator Fitzgerald were not accepted.  At the same time, I am anxious that none of us should take up fixed positions on this issue, regardless of the merits of the alternative cases and the objectives we all share with regard to the smooth functioning of boards and their giving due recognition to safety of navigation concerns.  While I am open to persuasion on this issue, I have serious reservations about the amendment which seems to go far beyond the objective which I understand he has in mind.</P>
      <P>At this point I wish to summarise the arguments which have been made on this issue.  This Bill establishes commercial semi-State companies.  They are not public or local authorities; their directors have a clear commercial mandate. We must have confidence in the boards of these companies to carry out in a dutiful fashion all their functions, including meeting their responsibilities in respect of safety and navigation matters.</P>
      <P>For the Legislature to lay down rights to attend board meetings for one servant of the board would be an unwarranted interference by the State into how a board conducts its business.  It would, in essence, reflect a basic lack of trust in a board's competence and professionalism. It would give the harbour master a special position far beyond other servants of the board, such as the accountant or engineer, and would create confusion as to the role of the chief executive <i>vis-à-vis</i> the harbour master.  It would imply that the harbour master was accountable directly to the board and not to and through the chief executive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no precedent of which I am aware for such a provision in any other legislation.  Senator Fitzgerald referred to the example I gave previously of the Irish Aviation Authority which is <Col N="1494" /> responsible for all air traffic control where there are enormous safety requirements.  The chief air traffic control officer is not a board member and does not have the statutory right to attend board meetings.  He is, of course, requested to attend such meetings as required for the purpose of giving technical advice.</P>
    <P>It is common practice for public bodies and boards to have their senior professional staff present at their meetings. A local authority would, as a matter of course, have its county engineer present at most of its meetings but this is not provided for in legislation.  There are several examples where it is the normal practice that chief professional or technical servants of bodies are present at appropriate meetings without this being provided for in the legislation establishing those bodies.  I would expect port companies to act responsibility in this regard and to take due account of any technical advice given by harbour masters as part of their normal deliberations.</P>
    <P>Harbour masters do not have a statutory right to attend board meetings under the Harbours Act, 1946, that is, the existing legislative framework.  In practice, however, I understand that they do attend and I see no reason that practice should or would be discontinued in so far as it is necessary.</P>
    <P>There are some difficulties with Senator Fitzgerald's amendment.  It gives the harbour master a statutory right to attend board meetings and to enter all discussions and it seems to give him or her the status of a director, except the right to vote.  This gives an extraordinary status and right to the harbour master over and above all other servants of the board.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, the Senator's objective is to ensure that the board receives the advice of the harbour master while the harbour master has responsibilities or competencies specifically relating to safety of navigation.  If that is the case, why should the harbour master have the unique statutory right to be present for all the business of the <Col N="1495" /> board and to enter into all discussions? Even in matters relating to safety of navigation the board might, for example, wish to take independent advice from other experts.  It might wish to meet these in the absence of the harbour master so that there could be a full and frank discussion.  The Senator's amendment would rule this out.  Similarly, the board might wish to discuss these matters with the chief executive without the presence of the harbour master, but this would also be ruled out. Another situation which could arise is that the board might wish to discuss the performance of the harbour master or other senior staff.  If Senator Fitzgerald's amendment is accepted in its present form, the harbour master would have the unique right to attend discussions relating to his performance and to his employment conditions and circumstances.</P>
    <P>Should the harbour master, for example, have the right to attend all subcommittees of the board?  Senator Fitzgerald knows that much of the business of these companies may be delegated to subcommittees.  If the harbour master has the right to attend all the meetings of the board, does he also have the right to attend all the meetings of the subcommittees?  What would be the legal status of decisions taken by the board if the harbour master was absent? Some boards, depending on their size, may have a lot of meetings if one includes those of the board and the subcommittees. The question arises as to whether the interests of the safety of navigation in a particular harbour might be better served if the harbour master was at his desk controlling the safety and navigational issues for which he is charged, or if he attended all the meetings of the board and subcommittees which, by implication, he would be entitled to attend if the Senator's amendment is passed.</P>
    <P>The amendment as tabled would complicate and constrain the normal functioning of the board by giving one servant of the board unique rights which <Col N="1496" /> go far beyond his responsibilities and competencies.  In my opinion, the arguments for maintaining the <i>status quo</i> are compelling and the amendment is unnecessary.  Even if one felt that some safeguard should be included in the Bill to place a statutory right on the board to pay particular attention to safety of navigation and to the views of the harbour master in that regard, Senator Fitzgerald's amendment goes far beyond that objective.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, I am open to debate and persuasion on this issue but they must be based on its merits.  Senators must accept that I have been open and flexible in my approach to all aspects of this Bill and I ask them to adopt a similar disposition when pursuing this issue. I will try to meet Senator Fitzgerald's concerns.</P>
    <P>I recently met representatives of the harbour masters and I listened carefully to their views on this matter.  I outlined to them the reasons I did not accept similar Dáil amendments as that proposed by Senator Fitzgerald.  I have since received a submission from the harbour masters which I am considering. I have been asked here to give further consideration to the issue before Report Stage, and that I am prepared to do.</P>
    <P>I ask Members to consider the implications of a straightforward amendment such as that proposed by Senator Fitzgerald. There are two options in this regard.  One is where the harbour master shall attend all board meetings, which means a board meeting cannot be held without the harbour master.  The second option is where the harbour master has the right to attend but he can exercise discretion to attend or not. Members must think through the implications of this for the harbour board, which might want to discuss the competence and employment conditions of the harbour master or get a second opinion in addition to that of its harbour master, or require the presence of the harbour master at a meeting to consider and decide issues but, because he can exercise discretion to attend or not, he <Col N="1497" /> might, as the amendment is phrased, exercise his right not to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with many of the Minister's arguments.  I do not accept that if the harbour master was not available for a meeting it would have to be cancelled.  The Minister has already accepted that harbour masters attend most board meetings; therefore, there is no reason that cannot continue. As Senator Neville said, certain boards do not allow the harbour master to attend.  If the Minister is satisfied that harbour masters attend meetings and will do so in the future, surely he could table an amendment on Report Stage to satisfy them.</P>
      <P>Harbour masters should attend in an advisory capacity but they should not interfere.  My harbour master does not interfere; he speaks when he is spoken to and I assume most harbours masters do likewise.  Sometimes decisions can be made by the board, but it is not always up-to-date with legislation or with how to run a harbour.  Perhaps this is a straightforward amendment but it could be phrased differently and included in the Bill.  Harbour masters should be allowed to attend meetings.</P>
      <P>We should not look at what other boards do.  Perhaps it would be better to allow the aviation officer, for example, to attend meetings of the aviation board.  Perhaps it is wrong to exclude the aviation officer from that board.  We do not know the problems faced by that board.  Meetings may have to be cancelled until the aviation officer is able to attend and explain the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will back down if the Minister gives me a commitment that he will introduce an amendment on Report Stage which will satisfy the harbour masters.  They are great people and I have much respect for them.  They are due great credit for the way harbours are run, given that up to now most harbours have been accident free.  We should keep it that way.  The harbour masters are doing their jobs well and I ask the Minister to accept the principle of the <Col N="1498" /> amendment.  I will hold fire if he introduces an amendment on Report Stage.</P>

I am not suggesting that, if a harbour master goes away for a couple of days, he tells his wife to look after the place. However, I am unhappy that he could transfer his functions to any member of staff.  These people do not have the necessary qualifications and have little knowledge of the Bill and other legislation.</P>
    <P>Does the Bill cover the qualifications required by harbour masters?  The qualifications required by pilots, including the class of certificate they must hold, are clearly outlined.

      <P>It was brought to my attention that the question as to whether section 41 of the Bill as currently drafted covered persons already retired and in receipt of pensions from harbour authorities was unclear.  I was of the view that existing harbour authority pensioners were protected by a combination of section 96 and section 12 (1) (a) (i).  However, I accepted this combination of sections was vague and unsatisfactory and I undertook to have the matter clarified and put beyond doubt.</P>

      <P>The two Senators involved in those ports are in the House. I am sure they will ask why other ports face such huge debts.  Sums of £25 million and £30 million have been mentioned; the situation is ludicrous.  I will not labour the point but does the Minister have any figures regarding the ports and how far behind they are lagging? What is the level of debt with regard to pension funds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not harp on this point as I mentioned it on Second Stage. The Minister is aware of my views on the Bill and I am happy with the way matters have progressed.  Following discussions with the Minister, I hope by the time the Bill is passed, that those who put their houses in order will receive some recognition.  The situation involves the Minister for Finance and there is a danger that those who need assistance will be given recognition and that no recognition will be given to those who rationalised their operations to an extent with which I did not agree.  For example, I am a member of the Cork Port Authority and it rationalised several times to eliminate part of the workforce and bring about a situation where the port was a viable proposition.  I see <Col N="1502" /> no reason we should not be doing that. At the end of the day it proved to be right because over the last seven to ten years the port has made an annual profit. Half the profits, however, were put into a substantial superannuation scheme to cover the remaining workforce.</P>
      <P>We put in more than we should.  As I said on Second Stage, we might have been better off putting the money into port infrastructure to improve it against competition from other ports that were not putting their house in order.  They were probably putting their money into other priority areas like infrastructure.</P>
      <P>I do not want to hold up the Bill.  The Minister has been very fair and he is certainly on top of his brief.  I congratulate him for that.  On another day I would ask the Minister &mdash; and I have already given him a note on this &mdash; to recognise the credibility of those who were prepared to put their house in order.  If any moneys are being paid out to ports that did not put themselves in proper order, then that recognition should also be given to ports that did put themselves in order.  That would only be fair.  How does one go about that?  I am not bright enough to think that there is a way through legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>However, there is always abuse.  We must be fair to those who were prepared to rationalise.  When I say rationalise I am talking about eliminating parts of the workforce.  It does not go down well with me to think that the physical workforce has to go.  People who have made a lot of money now say they are making more money from the port of Cork and other ports.  The danger is that a certain group will make it all.  I do not want to harp on that any longer because we had it out fairly strongly the other day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the next Stage of the Bill we should discuss what can be done by way of assistance.  If money is being paid it should be paid out <i>pro rata</i> to all the ports rather than to a few of them. <Col N="1503" /> There is no reason why that should not be done.  The problem is that we are dealing with the Minister for Finance. These people can bring it about in such a way that some people can get it all and others get nothing.  The Minister should consider that point which we can bring up on the final Stages of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I was asked to provide certain information and I am happy to do so.  Pension arrangements vary from port to port.  As Senator Cregan said, some ports established pension funds and put money into them, and I compliment them on having done that.  I recognise that they made prudent provision for their employees and for their pensioners. Other ports operated on a pay as you go basis.  In other words, they paid their pension liabilities out of their current moneys on a year by year basis and did not establish a pension fund.  Of course, at that time they were not required to do so.  It is only since the Pensions Act came into force that employers have been required to establish pension funds.</P>
      <P>In some of the smaller ports where employee numbers are small there are insurance type pension funds.  Under the legislation insurance type schemes, whose benefits are to the public service norm, can continue in existence because the number of employees is small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because these new companies were being established and because time limits are set down in the pensions legislation within which time pension funds have to be established, there was a concern that pension entitlements of pensioners or of existing employees might be at risk.  In order to put that beyond doubt the Government decided that provision would be made in this legislation so that whatever doomsday scenario might occur the pensions of employees and pensioners would continue to be paid.  I want to make it clear, as I did in the Dáil, that there is no question of the Minister for the Marine or the Minister for Finance writing a <Col N="1504" /> cheque for the pension funds of the port authorities concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The port authorities concerned will have to establish those pension funds themselves from their own resources and assets.  We have undertaken a study of the financial position of all the port companies, looking in detail at their borrowings, liabilities and assets with a view to assisting them to find a way to make provision for pension funds.  There is no question, however, of a cheque being put in the post to them.</P>
      <P>The present position is as follows. Cork has a pension fund which amounts at present to about £13.6 million.  That needs to be built up to about £18.9 million. Dublin port does not have a pension fund and we estimate that it requires a pension fund of approximately £50 million.  Limerick has a pension fund of £1.3 million, which needs to be built up to about £2 million.  Waterford has no fund and it needs a fund in the order of £4 million.</P>
      <P>In the case of Dún Laoghaire the existing staff are employed by the Department of the Marine and are paid under a normal public service formula. A pension fund will have to be established and there is separate provision for that in the legislation.  In the case of the other ports there are mainly insurance-type pension schemes in existence for the small numbers of employees involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>During the course of my Second Stage speech the Minister may have misinterpreted me.  I said that a harbour authority should be able to grant licences to small boats plying for hire in its harbour, which could come under a by-law.  Section 53 of the 1946 Harbours Act states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A harbour authority may, at their discretion, issue to the owner of a lighter, ferry-boat or other small boat which such owner proposes to use or ply for hire habitually in the harbour of the harbour authority a licence <Col N="1506" /> authorising such use or plying for hire.</P>
    <P>There are great merits in that.  In Dingle boats regularly ply for hire to bring people to see the dolphin.  I have no problem with the Department of the Marine granting the licences.  The Department's view is that if a person's boat reaches a certain standard they get a licence.  We found that too many licences were being granted by the Department and that it interfered with safety and traffic in and out of the harbour. We received several letters from tourists who used these boats saying that what was going on at the mouth of the harbour was crazy.</P>
    <P>We brought in our own by-law in accordance with the 1946 Act.  Nobody can ply for hire in our harbour without permission and a licence which costs £10.  It is a great idea that a harbour should have a type of secondary licence. The Department looks after safety and the number allowed on a boat, but the local harbour authority issues a licence for a small fee of £10.</P>
    <P>The Department grants a licence for one year but there is no regular inspection of boats.  However, the harbour master in our harbour checks boats almost weekly and if there is something wrong with a boat it is not allowed leave the harbour until it is repaired, until lifejackets are provided or whatever. That is the purpose of our £10 licence. Is it worthwhile including this provision in the 1946 Act in this legislation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested to hear about these by-laws which have been made in Dingle.  All by-laws made by harbour authorities under the Harbours Act, 1946, are subject to approval by the Minister under section 60 of that Act.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>They may have been approved but there is no collective recollection of the Dingle by-laws. However, we will make inquiries to see <Col N="1507" /> if they have been blessed with the Minister's approval.  If not, Senator Fitzgerald and I may have other matters to discuss.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with passenger boats. In the Merchant Shipping Act, 1992, there is a requirement on all passenger boats carrying passengers to hold a current and valid passenger boat licence.  A passenger boat is any boat used to carry not more than 12 passengers for hire or reward in any capacity, including island transport, transport on rivers, carrying people to and from the Dingle dolphin. A passenger boat licence may only be granted by the Minister for the Marine after a vessel has been inspected by a departmental marine surveyor and is found to be suitable.</P>
      <P>All passenger boats if they are to be licensed must comply with minimum standards of safety and seaworthiness. A licence may be granted for a period not exceeding two years and is subject to such limitations or restrictions as may be imposed.  Section 53 of the Harbours Act, 1946, has been superseded by the Merchant Shipping Act, 1992, in so far as the licensing of passenger boats is concerned.</P>

      <P>It is obvious that no order can be made unless there is agreement between both authorities or bodies to make the changes proposed.  In many cases that may mean that little may be done.  If one authority has a minor objection to putting arrangements in place, the order cannot be made.  I suggest that the Minister provide a mechanism for arbitration.</P>
      <P>In the event of an authority raising a minor objection which would prohibit the making of an order, there should be a mechanism which would allow for arbitration.  Perhaps the Minister might arbitrate to find a solution to the problem. We may find that for a minor technical reason a desirable arrangement may not be provided for because of the necessity to have agreement between both parties.  Will the provision in section 43 which applies to the transfer of functions from one company to another also apply to the transfer of functions from one subsidiary company to another?</P>

      <P>The purpose of this section is to empower the Minister to amalgamate ports if he or she is of the opinion that for sound business reasons the ports concerned should be amalgamated. However, an order under this section can only be made with the consent of each of the companies to which the order relates.  It would not be possible under this section to do as Senator Dan Kiely suggested and set up a separate new port authority.  This section relates only to the port companies being established under this legislation.  It anticipates a stage in the future when two of the port companies may want to amalgamate.  This can be done by order but only if the port companies concerned agree to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of arbitration would not arise because it is not a matter that can be arbitrated.  The companies either agree or they do not.  If one company withholds agreement, as it will have the right to do, the only way in which the port companies could be amalgamated <Col N="1509" /> would be through the introduction of new legislation.  It is not intended to cover subsidiaries but the port companies themselves.  For example, at some stage in the future Dún Laoghaire and Dublin, Foynes and Limerick, New Ross and Waterford, Arklow and Wicklow might want to amalgamate and form single port authorities.  This could be done by order if the port companies concerned agree to it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 27:</P>
      <P>In page 44, subsection (1) (a), line 10, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In a way amendments Nos. 27 and 28 are related.  I propose that the provision should read &ldquo;shall refuse entry&rdquo;.  I want any boat carrying nuclear waste which arrives at a port to be refused entry into the harbour.  There should be no ifs or buts about it.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is very weak and I would like it to read &ldquo;shall refuse entry&rdquo;.  I would be interested to hear what the Minister has to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>As I mentioned on Second Stage, I share Senator Fitzgerald's concern and I am also anxious to <Col N="1511" /> prohibit the entry into Irish commercial seaports of nuclear material and nuclear powered ships and other conveyances. However, were I to accept the Senator's amendment as proposed it could mean that harbour masters would be statutorily required to refuse entry into their harbours of all sorts of dangerous goods.</P>
      <P>For example, a ship carrying acrylo-nitrile, which is classified as a dangerous substance, calls to Dublin port about once a month.  Approximately 2,000 tonnes of acrylo-nitrile is unloaded and transported by rail under strict control and safety measures to the Asahi plant in County Mayo.  The amendment, if accepted, could mean that this cargo could no longer be unloaded at Dublin port and the jobs of the Asahi employees could be put at risk.</P>
      <P>With a view to catering for cargoes such as this and prohibiting entry of nuclear materials into Irish ports, I propose to split section 52 (1) (a) into two separate paragraphs.  The first would empower the harbour master to refuse entry into the harbour of dangerous goods, as classified in the INDG code, which in his or her opinion would be likely to endanger persons or property. The other would statutorily require the harbour master to refuse entry into the harbour of a ship or vehicle or other conveyance that is powered by or carrying nuclear material.  Exemptions will have to be granted under this proposed new section in respect of certain medical supplies and materials involving background radiation levels.  It is proposed that these exemptions will be set out in a ministerial order to be made under the section and following consultations with the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland.  If the Senator is agreeable, I will have amendments along those lines ready for circulation on Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no problem with the Minister's proposal.  I am happy and proud that I have brought this to the attention of both the Minister and his Department.  Over the years we have <Col N="1512" /> complained about Sellafield, THORP and nuclear testing in the South Pacific. However, successive Governments, regardless of their composition, have just paid lip service to it.  This is a chance to say that we will prevent all nuclear powered ships or submarines from coming into our ports.  We will also ensure that, as the Minister outlined, nuclear substances will not enter our ports.</P>
      <P>In a way it is a pity that we could not go a lot further in this regard.  I am even considering introducing a small Private Members' Bill to declare all our coastal waters to be a nuclear free zone.  I do not mean as far out as the Porcupine bank, but that a three, five, nine or 12 mile limit would be set, inside which would be a nuclear free zone.  If there is no speed limit in a town, people can drive through it at 40, 50 or 60 miles an hour.  As soon as a speed limit of, say, 30 miles has been set, people driving at higher speeds are breaking the law.  We can never accuse England or Sellafield or THORP of breaking any law, because there is no law to break. However, if we declare our coastal waters to be a nuclear free zone, and others then break our laws by polluting our sea which we have declared to be a nuclear free zone, we can then take them to the highest court in the land or to the European court.  I could be wrong about this but I checked it out and that was what I was told.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the way the Minister and the Members of both Houses feel about nuclear power and Chernobyl, the diseases it has caused and the damage it has done.  Of all the amendments, I hope Members will forgive me, this is the one that makes me happiest.  It is a step in the right direction and for accepting it the Minister has a special place in history because it is the first time as far as I know that any Government Minister has put into writing that nuclear powered ships and nuclear waste will not come into our country or be allowed into our ports.  There is a small difficulty which the Minister will probably tidy up later on.  The Bill only <Col N="1513" /> covers the 12 ports referred to.  There are many other ports.  I doubt if we will ever get a submarine into Dingle&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">

It is a submarine which is rusting away and which cannot be controlled.  The nuclear reactor inside it is going out of control.  It is ready to explode and do the same damage as Chernobyl.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very little to say, but on Part IV of the Bill, which covers pilotage, perhaps the Minister should have considered introducing two separate Bills.  This Bill covers many areas and one could get confused.  My interest is mainly in the harbours but I am interested in the pilots as well and provisions for both are contained here.</P>
      <P>Somewhere in the Bill there is the use of the word &ldquo;regular&rdquo;.  Where ships regularly use a harbour, they will get the exemption certificates.  What does &ldquo;regular&rdquo; mean to the Minister?  I go on holidays regularly, once a year.  If a master comes up the Shannon, for example, once a year, does that mean that he is a regular visitor and that he or his company can obtain an exemption certificate? This is the beginning of the end for pilots.  The provisions in regard to pilotage are far too loose altogether. The Minister is giving plenty of power to ship owners, agents and all the rest of them.  I do not know whether I am in order but I am generally raising the whole issue of pilotage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>You are raising them under section 56, so you are in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should curtail a lot of this.  It takes me about five hours to drive from Dingle to Dublin. I would love to hand over to somebody else when I get as far as Newlands Cross and let that person drive through the city.  The master of a ship comes across the oceans of the world and arrives at the mouth of the Shannon. Regardless of whether he is a regular visitor, after his journey, in the course of which he has often endured storms and bad weather, he breathes a sigh of relief and hands over to the pilot.  The currents of the river will change and unless he goes up there almost every week, he will not know the currents of the river or how strong the tide is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A tide can be strong even though there is a new moon or a full moon and one would not know it.  The Shannon is different to all the other estuaries, <Col N="1515" /> because there is a dam on the river upstream.  If a lot of water is released there is an unnatural flood of water coming down the Shannon and anyone going up and down the Shannon without a pilot would have to be doing so on a regular basis, say at least once a month. The pilots have served us well and should continue to serve us.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to look at the exemptions again because ship owners and agents want to get out of all this as cheaply as possible.  The cheaper they can bring in their cargo the better. Many of the ships come from third world countries.  On one ship which berthed in Dingle, crew were paid £9 per week.  They do not have the same knowledge as locals.  Other countries totally flout the law of the sea.  Their laws in relation to their ships, masters and qualifications and so on are very poor.</P>
    <P>I would hate to see the pilots disappear but this Bill will make them disappear very quickly.  They serve a very good purpose.  Their presence assures the port authority that while they are there, there will be no accidents and that things are all right.  For example, a harbour master will worry a lot when he finds out that a particular master of a ship has received an exemption order to come up the Shannon without a pilot.</P>
    <P>The harbour master is responsible for a harbour to the extent of its limits.  The harbour masters and pilots enjoy a good relationship.  I believe the harbour masters would prefer that the pilots remain. It is a different matter when a ship enters Waterford harbour with the same master on board each week.  I would like the Minister to define the term &ldquo;regular&rdquo; because its meaning is ambiguous.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>These sections of the Bill do not spell the end of pilotage.  Pilotage will continue.  Some of the sections in this part of the Bill make it clear that pilotage will continue to be compulsory in certain waters.  Section 72 provides for the issue of pilotage exemption certificates in certain limited cases.  The decision as to when a pilotage <Col N="1516" /> certificate will be issued will be made by the port company.  Harbour masters have extensive responsibilities for navigation, etc, and I cannot envisage a situation where a port company would issue a pilotage exemption certificate if the harbour master stated that one should not be issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the harbour master have the power to recommend that an exemption should not be granted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, he would.  If a harbour master recommends that a pilotage exemption certificate should not be issued, I cannot imagine that the port company would decide against such advice.  The circumstances and rules governing the issue of pilotage exemption certificates will be covered by regulations to be made following the passage of this legislation.</P>
      <P>With regard to what is a regular visit to a port, this will depend to some extent on the circumstances involved. The term &ldquo;regular&rdquo; means that a ship would have to make 12 visits per year to a particular port.  The situation to which Senator Fitzgerald referred, where a ship visits a port once a year and its master possesses limited knowledge of the area, will not arise.  A ship sailing under a flag of convenience, with a master and crew from God knows where, would not be issued a pilotage exemption certificate.  The legislation sets out that such certificates may be issued only to Irish and EU citizens and people from countries with a reciprocal arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are also a number of conditions which must be complied with before a pilotage exemption certificate is issued. They deal with the cognisance which must be taken in relation to dangerous cargo.  The issuing of pilotage exemption certificates will ultimately amount to matters of judgment.  In situations where ships visit ports on a regular basis, the port company, having taken account of the harbour master's opinion, may decide that such ships can enter the port <Col N="1517" /> without the assistance of a pilot.  In such circumstances pilotage exemption certificates can be issued.  However, this will happen on a limited basis and applications will be carefully assessed.  The duration of a certificate is one year only. It must be renewed thereafter.  A regular visitor to a port will not be issued with a certificate and never have to apply for one again.  This area of the legislation is very heavily supervised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned that a change is proposed in relation to piloting. A situation may arise where a ship must travel through the jurisdiction of one harbour to reach another harbour. The pilot of the first harbour must be put on board the ship in that case.  In my own locality of Limerick and Foynes, the Limerick harbour master must ensure that pilotage is provided to ships travelling through his jurisdiction on their way to Foynes.  If a pilot is not available, the ship may be delayed.  This may happen as a result of the negligence of the harbour master involved.  The harbour with which the ship intends to trade has no control over the situation. This would interfere with the commercial viability of the second harbour.  I am sure it does not occur, but a situation might arise where two harbour authorities experienced difficulties in their dealings with each other.  In such circumstances one harbour authority might interfere with the passage of ships to the harbour in which they intend to dock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>To localise the answer, the Shannon Estuary Ports Company <Col N="1518" /> will be the pilotage authority for the Shannon Estuary.  This matter must be put in perspective.  I have no reason to believe that the pilotage authority in the Shannon Estuary will not carry out its duties in a fair and professional manner. I also have no reason to believe that it could be used in pursuit of some agenda other than providing safe navigation in the estuary.  I am not aware of any occasion where such circumstances have arisen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>At present, if the harbour master cannot provide a pilot, the ship can proceed into the harbour of its destination.  However, under the legislation, if the harbour master is negligent and fails to provide a pilot, the ship may be delayed.  Changes are involved under the section and I am querying whether new restrictions will be placed on harbours in such circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I draw the Senator's attention to section 60 (3) (a) which states:</P>
      <P>If the master of a ship cannot comply with paragraph (a) of subsection (1) because the services of appropriately qualified pilots are, for whatever reason, unavailable he or she may, notwithstanding that subsection, navigate the ship in the pilotage district provided the harbour master for the pilotage district, being satisfied that it is safe in all the circumstances for the ship to be so navigated, authorises such navigation.</P>
      <P>It will continue to be possible for the ship to proceed to the port of destination provided the harbour master of the pilotage district &mdash; in this case it would be the Shannon Estuary harbour master &mdash; is satisfied it is safe to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision is made.  It is a material change in that at present the ship can proceed if the pilot is not available.  The harbour master of the jurisdiction must give the decision to allow that ship through now and that is <Col N="1519" /> a material change about which some concern has been expressed.</P>

      <P>It is only an enabling section which could make Dingle a fishery harbour centre.  Indeed, I was speaking with Senator O'Toole the other day and he said we must warn the Minister that motions will be put down if Dingle does not become a fishery harbour centre. I felt it was a pity two or three years ago that the Government of the day did not publish a short Bill to deal with that.</P>
      <P>The Minister knows I speak the truth. Dingle is a success story.  The money invested there has created over 300 extra jobs, about which there is no doubt, and the marina and the fishing boats get along well together.</P>
      <P>The job is not finished, and I might as well say that in the presence of the Minister, as it would take about £600,000 to complete the end of Dingle pier.  The Government must have a few pounds somewhere which could be used to complete the job.</P>
      <P>It is a strange world.  I thank Senator Brendan Daly, who signed the agreement. He remembers the day well.  I do not think he ever meant the end of the pier to be left unfinished and we may find out in a moment whether that is the kind of job he wanted.  From our point of view, it is quite dangerous and I hope some day to have the honour of showing the Minister around the harbour so that he might see the difficulties.</P>

      <P>He has probably.  The pier is quite dangerous.  There are two foul berths in Dingle &mdash; a foul berth is where you cannot berth the boat.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that all the harbour authorities were consulted, but they never came near us in Dingle.  We would have a great contribution to make to this Bill and we are constructive.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to declare Dingle a fishery harbour centre as soon as possible. I do not agree with what is going on in other harbours and with this review group, but fishery harbour centres are a good development.</P>
      <P>I lay the blame for harbours which are not generating enough income to clear their debts on the Minister's Department, because other harbours which have been completed for years have been trading and their charges are clearly not sufficient compared to the amount of money coming into those harbours.  If they charged a percentage of the total landings of any port, it would be a huge amount of money.  This is what is being done in Northern Ireland, as far as I know.  If Dingle, for example, where £5 million worth of fish is landed every year, received 2 or 3 per cent of that figure, it would only be a small amount of money.</P>
      <P>I know my head will be blown off for saying this, but we must make ends meet.  The Minister should take this matter in hand and increase the boats' charges.  Irrespective of the harbour, I pay more in parking fines every year than a 60 foot boat pays tied to the pier. The sum of £800 for a 60 foot boat in this day and age is not a lot when it includes the use of all the harbour facilities.</P>
      <P>There is definitely a problem in Dingle with regard to making ends meet. According to the fishermen, only when the harbour is finished and the same level of facilities are provided as are available in all the other fishery ports will they agree to increased charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This has nothing to do with the Harbours Bill, 1995, but I want to see the <Col N="1522" /> job finished.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware of the Minister's former position as a member of Dublin County Council and I know he has met at least one delegation from my area in regard to this matter.  I do not believe the delegation the Minister met was acting in the best interests of our area.  The Minister asked why certain people were not present on the day <Col N="1524" /> and I respect that, but I am not sure the individual who sought and secured that meeting did the best job on behalf of the area; at least that is what has been said in the area.</P>
      <P>I have no problem with the fact that Balbriggan and Skerries harbours will come back under the responsibility of Fingal County Council.  However, at last Monday night's meeting of the council, a motion was carried by all parties. Deputy Ryan was to call the leader of the Labour group, Senator O'Sullivan, Sheila Terry would telephone the PD's and Ann Devlin would telephone the various members of Fine Gael to ensure they understood the importance of this amendment.</P>
      <P>Since 1972 not one shilling has been passed to the Balbriggan and Skerries fishing ports.  In the last week the Minister's Department, perhaps because of my tabling this amendment, decided to give £60,000 to them and ask the Dublin Port and Docks Board to add to that amount.  This total, amounting to £120,000, was called a sop by all parties in Fingal County Council.  These two areas have been robbed of any chance of development over the last 20 years.</P>
      <P>The two areas in question have suffered because of the policy of ensuring that Howth was the primary fishing port in the area, and I have no problem with that.  However, if this is the policy, everywhere else should not fall by the wayside.  I know the role Skerries and Balbriggan harbours play in our fishing industry.  We do not expect to be given millions of pounds but some recognition of the fact that Skerries plays a major part in the east coast shellfish and white fish industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from a political decision by a Fianna Fáil Government to allocate some money to the ports, not one penny has been given to either of them since 1972.  Both ports are falling into the sea. Now the Minister and his colleagues are asking me, as a representative of that area, to accept that under this section both ports will come under the financial constraints of Fingal County Council. Our council currently has problems with <Col N="1525" /> surviving at the moment &mdash; I will not refer to the question of local authority funding.  The Minister is asking us to take both Skerries and Balbriggan ports on board with only a £60,000 allocation from the Department, £60,000 from the Dublin Port and Docks Board and £20,000 to clear two wrecks from Skerries harbour when the basic facilities for any harbour, or fishing port are not there.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly had the foresight to appoint me to Bord Iascaigh Mhara; some may say otherwise.  In my ten years on that board, Skerries became an important port to the east coast fishing fleet.  However, apart from one political decision made by a Fianna Fáil Government to give some money, it was totally neglected.  Words like &ldquo;robbed&rdquo; and &ldquo;an absolute sop&rdquo; were used last Monday by all party councillors from the region.</P>
    <P>However, many of those who spoke at the council meeting last Monday never opened their mouths in the Dáil. Yet when the motion was agreed by an all party group, I was asked to represent that view and to ask the Minister, as a member of the former Dublin County Council, to recognise that he is asking the impossible from us.  The Minister is asking us to take over two important fishing ports on the basis of £120,000. While I welcome this amount, we should take it from there.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest the Minister has never been to Skerries.  However, if he has, he should have recognised that the basic facilities for a port are missing. There are no lights, electrical points or safety measures in the port itself.  Basic facilities needed for any fishing port are not available.</P>
    <P>Our county manager, when sending this £120,000 letter back to the Minister, said that he would not take that amount. He also made it clear to both the Department and the Dublin Port and Docks Board that this was only a start. I ask the Minister, if he was in my position, how will we finance those ports. How can fishing families that have been part and parcel of Balbriggan and Skerries <Col N="1526" /> for the last 100 years survive when Fingal County Council itself is finding it hard to survive?  It is only doing so because of a charge that was introduced in the last two years.  How then can we put the capital investment necessary into Balbriggan and Skerries?</P>
    <P>The chairman of the council has written to the Minister asking him to meet an all party group from the area so that he could understand what he is asking us to agree to in this section is not on. He is being unfair to the two areas in question.</P>
    <P>Skerries won a national award last year from the Department of the Environment as being the tidiest town in Ireland.  However, the one area that cannot even be walked on is the harbour. The Minister is making impossible the opportunity to bring a marina to Skerries by asking us to take the two ports on board on the basis of a provision of £20,000 to remove two wrecks. There is a need for dredging, the fishermen can only get in an out of the ports at certain times because of the tidal situation and the issue of the prawning industry, which is based in Skerries, needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>I do not argue against the proposition that Howth should be the main port, but this should not be at the expense of every other port along the coast.  The Minister's philosophy on this issue is flawed in this respect.  The two ports have been dumped onto Fingal County Council by the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  I am informed that not one penny has been allocated to these two ports since 1972 by the authority looking after them.  However, to ensure that we accept section 88, the Minister's Department has decided to give £60,000, with the port giving another £60,000.</P>
    <P>It would be impossible for Fingal County Council to accept this situation, given that it is starved of resources and given that no capital expenditure is possible within the budget it has at present.  The Minister would have a similar problem in Dún Laoghaire.  No capital investment can take place on <Col N="1527" /> these ports within our present budgets. We have introduced a charge as a matter of survival to ensure that we can drive up and down the roads and cut grass.</P>
    <P>If the Minister has the records from BIM he will realise that at one stage, as former Minister, Senator Daly will be aware, Skerries and Balbriggan would be a black mark with regard to investment and repayments to BIM. However, this has long since changed. They are among the best ports on the coast in respect of repayments to BIM. The people involved realise they must get themselves organised and that if investment is to take place in the area they must play their part, which they are doing by repaying the loans for their boats.</P>
    <P>While the amendment may be out of order, the all party motion, passed unanimously, makes clear that unless a proper investment structure is in place, there is no way in which the two harbours of Skerries and Balbriggan can return to County Fingal.  They will not return in the context of what the Minister seeks to do under section 88. Rather, it is in the interests of the two ports to do so once the Minister gives us a chance by providing a reasonable amount of capital to bring the harbours up to the kind of condition that we, as a council with limited resources, could maintain on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>At present the two ports are falling into the sea.  Safety measures in the area need to be addressed in case anything were to happen.  There is no way that those who represent the area, including members of Fine Gael, Labour, my own party, independents and the individual whom the Minister met recently &mdash; which meeting, I understand, did more damage than good &mdash; can accept the present situation.  The Minister must give some kind of commitment.  It cannot be accepted that the two ports can be handed over in their current state and that the Minister can walk away with a payment of £60,000.</P>
    <P>I will ask my colleagues to oppose <Col N="1528" /> section 88, even though I do not object to the section in principle.  If the two ports were given proper capital investment they would benefit from the attention of the local authority to which I and others belong.  I ask the Minister to respond in a positive way.</P>

      <P>Given the difficulties I have with Foynes and Limerick, it is with some trepidation that I enter into the business of Skerries and Balbriggan. I have had some discussions with my party colleagues on Fingal County Council and they are genuinely concerned with the financial obligations facing Fingal County Council regarding the transfer of two harbours.  Senator Wright has outlined the difficulties very well.  Will the Minister look again at the situation and reassess the amount of money that is under consideration with regard to this transfer in view of the difficulties that Fingal County Council envisage?  I understand there have been some discussions with officials and with others in this regard.</P>

      <P>Section 11 set out the objectives of the Bill, including what is anticipated to be the activities of the new companies.  In this section we are left with the remains of what has not been done and what needs to be done. A kind of limbo situation exists as a result of the section.  Some harbours have been transferred to local authorities, others have not.  The whole section must be looked at closely by the Minister in the spirit in which he has addressed the other sections this afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is no more satisfied than we are with what he described yesterday as the options facing some of the smaller harbours.  I strongly support the views expressed by Senator Wright.  As Minister for the Marine, I had occasions to visit Skerries and Balbriggan and was appalled with what I saw.  The harbours were in a derelict state.  Indeed, we had to make urgent representations to the ports authority that had jurisdiction to do <Col N="1529" /> something to take the dereliction away from what are two of the most attractive towns on the east coast.  It was beyond comprehension that the areas had been allowed fall into the state of neglect in which they were in.  It arose to some extent because of anticipation over the years of legislation that would be introduced but that never materialised.</P>
    <P>The same situation applies to some of the smaller harbours in the Shannon Estuary.  Senator Dan Kiely was anxious to put forward an amendment that would have Tarbert, surrounding jetties and installations, and adjacent areas such as Ballylongford, which have been excluded from the authority of Foynes under the Bill, to be vested in Kerry County Council.</P>
    <P>Before any areas would be transferred to local authorities there is a responsibility on the Minister and the Department to put them in a decent state of repair, because most of the authorities do not have the finances to deal with them.  If a situation arises, as illustrated by Senator Wright with regard to Skerries and Balbriggan, where an amount of remedial work needs to be done, it should be undertaken before the ports are handed over to another authority.  This would be similar to situations where local authorities dispose of council house to tenants. Under the tenant purchase schemes local authorities put the houses in a decent state of repair before handing them over to tenants.  Similarly, with regard to this situation, the Minister should clearly indicate how investment can be made to deal effectively with the difficulties facing local authorities which will not have budgeted for them, will not have the financial resources to deal with the problems and will not be in a position <i>vis-á-vis</i> planning or other arrangements to deal effectively with the difficulties these will create for the authorities when they are handed over. If they are not handed over they will decay further and the problem will have to be faced at some stage.</P>
    <P>These are unique areas which have their own special attractions and features. <Col N="1530" /> They all have possibilities for development to create more employment in tourism and related industries. They should not be forgotten.  We are passing new legislation to set up new port companies and we are offering much goodwill and support to those companies to get the job done.  At the same time we are leaving a very important sector in no-man's-land where they do not know what their future prospects are.</P>
    <P>The Minister should rewrite section 88 before Report Stage in a way that would ensure a future for smaller harbours and ports which are outside the jurisdiction of the larger ports.  The Minister has clarified that fact very precisely rather than repeat the options theory he put forward yesterday afternoon.  I wish to draw the attention of the new ports authorities on the estuary in both Foynes and Limerick to the huge potential that still remains untapped in areas which will be outside their jurisdiction. I am referring to places such as Kilrush port and Cappagh pier which was utilised by the ESB during the construction of Moneypoint.  It was found to be a suitable place for doing business and there has been a constructive approach on the part of the harbour authority, Kilrush UDC.  Carrigaholt has been genuinely concerned that in the event of new authorities being set up in Foynes and Limerick the focus of attention will be on those areas and, to some extent, Kilrush and the lower Shannon areas as far as Carrigaholt and Kilbaha will remain neglected.</P>
    <P>We should send a message to the new Foynes and Limerick ports authorities that we never again expect to see a situation where, due to lack of investment or lack of action, places such as Kilbaha and Carrigaholt are allowed to decay to such as extent that their piers have almost fallen into the sea.  This is not acceptable and the new authorities with their new powers must keep in mind that there are areas outside the furthest extremes of their jurisdictions to which they also have a responsibility.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1531" /> The people living along estuaries suffer from the by-products of pollution. There has not been major oil pollution in the Shannon Estuary but there has been much pollution by refuse from boats and ships.  The west coast of Clare along the Shannon Estuary had many problems not so long ago as a result of the dumping of waste oil from ships leaving the estuary.  Clare and Kerry County Councils had to take urgent remedial action to clear the waste oil before the start of the tourist season.</P>
    <P>People living in the most attractive and scenic areas of these estuaries suffer as a result of development that takes place upstream.  The new authorities will have a responsibility in that regard and we will call on them to fulfil their responsibilities so that these areas, which are most attractive and where there is very little economic activity and prosperity, would not be neglected to such an extent that their piers have almost fallen into the sea.</P>

      <P>I will first explain why section 88 has been included in the Bill.  Four small harbours &mdash; Skerries, Balbriggan, Bulloch and Sandycove &mdash; have been under the jurisdiction of the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  In 1990 Dublin County Council, as it was then called, requested that Skerries and Balbriggan be transferred to the county council, a view which has been upheld by Fingal County Council which succeeded Dublin County Council. A similar request was made by the former Dún Laoghaire Corporation which is now Dún Laoghaire/Rathdown County Council in respect of Bulloch and Sandycove.  Section 88 of the Bill enables those harbours to be transferred from the Dublin Port and Docks Board to the respective county councils.  This was requested by the county councils. The section was not dreamed up by me; it was a response to a written request by the two county councils to transfer those harbours to them.</P>

      <P>I am giving the Senator the history.  The county councils made that request, the provision is included in the Bill and the transfer can be carried out by way of a transfer order which will involve consultation with the Department of the Environment, the Port and Docks Board and the county council before being laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We are quite far away from the point where they will actually be transferred.  The Bill enables the harbours to be transferred.  That is the legislative aspect which I understood was the wish of both county councils.  If Senator Wright is telling me that it is no longer the wish of Fingal County council that Skerries and Balbriggan be transferred to the county council, let him make that case.  However, it would be news to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The section is providing for the transfer of the harbours to the county councils, as was requested by those county councils.</P>
      <P>I will now deal with question of the condition of the harbours.  I do not dispute that Skerries and Balbriggan are in poor condition.  Senator Wright has said that since 1972 the harbours have been neglected.  I am not taking responsibility for what previous Governments failed to do about Skerries and Balbriggan.  It is quite ironic that it is when a Government decides to do something about Skerries and Balbriggan that Senator Wright is in the Chamber to make great complaint about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1533" /> He has described the £120,000 as a sop. Fishery harbours all over the country which have made applications for funding so that works could be carried out on their harbours would be very glad of the £120,000 being allocated to Skerries and Balbriggan and they would not regard it as a sop.  It might not do all the work Senator Wright would like to have carried out on Skerries and Balbriggan, but it is being made available at a time when funding for harbours works is quite scarce.  The moneys will do some work in Skerries and Balbriggan.</P>
    <P>It is £120,000 more than the last Government invested in those harbours or the Government before that or any of the Governments since 1972 with which Senator Wright had much closer contact than I did.  It is remarkable that it is only when funding is being provided that we are seeing all-party motions and the hyperbole to which Senator Wright treated us this afternoon.  If the Senator does not want the £120,000 spent in Skerries and Balbriggan, he should say so.  Is the Senator making the case that we should not spend the money on them? Where were the all-party motions since 1972?  The Senator said, as a representative of the area, it is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>What has the Senator been doing since 1972?  The condition of Skerries and Balbriggan harbours did not deteriorate dramatically since this day 12 months ago when the present Government took office.  We are responding in two ways, by providing in this Bill for the transfer of these harbours to the county councils which requested them in the first place and by providing resources, albeit limited, for making a start on work which is long overdue, and I do not intend to take responsibility for this neglect.</P>

      <P>Great credit is due to the Minister for the way he has handled the <Col N="1534" /> Bill.  Even though the Bill has gone through the Dáil and a committee, he has had the foresight to listen to Senators and to accept some of their amendments.  If I have hit a nerve with regard to money, we should argue about this.  However, he personalised some of his comments, which I did not do.  When he reads what I said, he will know that I did not mention him in any way.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he is not responsible for the situation, but I did not say he is.  However, I am well aware of the Department's policy that Howth should be the number one fishing port on the east coast.  At no stage did I oppose section 88.  I have no problem about the two harbours coming back under the control of Fingal County Council and I believe that this will be in the long-term interests of Skerries and Balbriggan. When the Minister reads what I said he will realise that what he said was not balanced.</P>
      <P>Resources were poured into Howth and the other two harbours were totally neglected.  Dublin Port and Docks Board were given charge of the harbours. Not one shilling has been invested in them and they have been robbed of every opportunity of developing as ports.  The Minister for the Marine rightly speaks about how important it is for local ports to develop in terms of the local economy, employment, and fisheries.  I have supported this philosophy from the time Senator Daly was Minister for the Marine.  This does not mean that millions of pounds must be poured into an area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said he has a letter from a county manager to the effect that these harbours should be returned to the county council.  These ports should not be dumped, on the basis of this letter, back to a council which is starved of resources.  When these ports fall into the sea we will know who is at fault.  I have no problem with the ports being returned to Fingal County Council. However, the Minister is asking my colleagues and myself to support this without providing any resources for bringing them up to the level at which they <Col N="1535" /> should be.  As a former member of Dublin County Council, he knows we would not be able to find £1 million for Balbriggan and Skerries; we can barely keep tar on the road.  If the Minister was a Senator, would he accept this from a Fianna Fáil Minister on the basis of a letter from a county manager?  He would not.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why there should not be a marina in Skerries.  It is a superb location but there is no chance of it having a marina or of its fishing fleet being developed because of what the Minister is doing.  He is asking us to accept that a council which is starved of resources should take on board another liability.  These harbours were robbed, not by the Minister, but by the Dublin Port and Docks Board, which has not given them a shilling since 1972.</P>
    <P>I welcome what Senator O'Sullivan said.  I know how strong feelings on the ground are about this issue.  The Minister was not responsible for the situation for the last 20 years, but he is responsible for this Bill.  These areas have been robbed of any chance of development because of neglect.  We all see the influence of Democratic Left at the Cabinet table.  The word is that if people want money they should go to the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Marine recently stated that it is important that local ports be developed in the interests of their areas and of employment.  I ask the Minister to consider this and not ask me to accept £120,000 for these ports.  The Department must not be able to say that two ports are taken off the list.  Previous Ministers would not bring forward this legislation, which has been on the Department's files for 20 years.  The view of the Department is that little towns like Skerries and Balbriggan must be taken off its map and all resources must be invested in Howth.  I support the development of Howth, but this must not be at the neglect of these two areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he knows these areas and how much they are worth, but he went on to say they are lucky to be given <Col N="1536" /> £120,000.  Should I say to the people of Skerries that the Minister says they are extremely lucky to get this amount and that if they do not want it they should not take it?  I do not believe this is good legislation.  I reiterate that in my initial comments I did not oppose this section and I did not mention the Minister.  I am aware that the proposals in this Bill have been around for 20 years.  The Minister is asking us to accept £120,000 and to consider that he and his civil servants have done a good job.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil had difficulty participating in two party Governments and the concept of a three party Government is beyond the comprehension of Senator Wright and his party. This probably explains his bizarre view of the way in which decisions are made on public finances.</P>
      <P>The Senator used two terms with which I take issue.  He said that Skerries and Balbriggan are being dumped on Fingal County Council.  That is not the case.  The Bill will provide for the transfer of those harbours to Fingal County Council after a process of consultation between the Department, the Dublin Port and Docks Board, the county council and the Department of the Environment. The draft order will soon be before the Houses and Senator Wright will have an opportunity to speak on it if he is not happy with its content.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Wright seemed to infer that I or the Department has formed a view that Skerries and Balbriggan are only worth £120,000 and that this is an inducement to get them under the administration of Fingal County Council. The £120,000 is a recognition of the problems.  He asked me to recognise there was a problem in these two areas. It is easy to say I recognise there is a problem there, but I do.  I recognise that these two harbours have been neglected. If I said that, Senator Wright would be entitled to ask me to put my money where my mouth is.  We are making scarce resources available &mdash; Senator Wright has chosen to describe it as a sop &mdash; for works which need to <Col N="1537" /> be done in Skerries and Balbriggan. This must be the first occasion after a quarter of a century of neglect when some attempt is being made to address the problem by providing finance.  This is being regarded as a sop and it is not being recognised as an attempt &mdash; I acknowledge it is a limited attempt &mdash; to address some of the problems in Skerries and Balbriggan.</P>
    <P>I regret that Senator Wright has taken this approach.  Discussions must take place between the Department, Dublin Port and Docks Board, the county council and the Department of the Environment before any transfer order is made.  I have no doubt Senator Wright will express his views at that stage.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, there is no member of the Minister's party on Fingal County Council.  These are not only my views, but those of the 24 councillors who represent those areas. Senator Manning's party led the motion and Senator O'Sullivan has made her views known through those who represent that area.  I accept the money the Minister is spending in this regard.  Will financial arrangements be part of the discussions which will take place before any regulations are passed?  The only reason the £120,000 was mentioned is that the Minister is trying to push this legislation through the House.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister saying this Bill has nothing to do with the fact that £120,000 was announced, particularly when we were given nothing for 20 years?  If this section is passed through both Houses of the Oireachtas we will be left with two areas which are starved of resources and we will not have money in the future to do anything for them.

      <P>I would be surprised if they are not part of the discussions.  If the view the Senator has expressed is the view of Fingal County Council, I assume it will put it forward at the discussions. As I said a number of times, the arrangements dealing with the transfer, before any transfer order is made, will involve consultation between all the parties, including Fingal County Council. The moneys being made available now for works to be carried out on Skerries and Balbriggan arise from a request which was conveyed to me by officers of Fingal County Council at a meeting arranged by an Oireachtas colleague of Senator Wright.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The request was considered by me, by the Minister and by the Department and we responded positively. The response may not have been as good as everyone would have liked, but we made arrangements for some moneys to be spent in 1995.  I am not suggesting that the limited moneys to be spent in 1995 will solve all the problems in Skerries and Balbriggan, but it is a tangible and practical response.  There is no point in acknowledging the problem when money is required to fix it.  We are spending some money in 1995 between moneys put up by the Department, for which there is considerable competition from ports and harbours throughout the country, and matching moneys from Dublin Port and Docks Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1539" /> I am disappointed at the way Senator Wright and the members of Fingal County Council have interpreted our efforts to make a start on works at Skerries and Balbriggan.  I expected that when such money was being made available there would have been a recognition of the problem, an acknowledgement that it can only be resolved by the provision of finance and some appreciation of the fact &mdash; I do not mean this in the sense that if one does not want it, one does not have to take it &mdash; that harbours all over the country are applying for funding for works to piers, landing places, etc.</P>
    <P>We responded quite quickly to the request from Fingal County Council. Senator Wright seems to think this was because we wanted to allocate money before the Bill came before the House. We were conscious that, arising from the Bill, those harbours would be transferred to the respective county councils. However, the Bill has been before the Oireachtas since last July and there was no pressure or obligation to allocate money before it was before the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I regret that the genuine attempt to resolve the problems of Skerries and Balbriggan, through legislation in the first instance and by putting money where our mouth is in the second instance &mdash; perhaps not in the quantity Senator Wright would wish but at least it is being done &mdash; is met with the type of language used by Senator Wright.  He said they are being dumped on the county council, that it is a sop and that it is only being done because the legislation has been introduced.  I regret his response.</P>

      <P>I am pleased the Minister outlined that the £60,000 from the Department is a start.  All the representatives from the area will be pleased the Minister stated the money is a start. However, it is extraordinary that the Minister is so sensitive.  He is talking about £60,000 and he wants to make something special of that.  We welcome the sum, but it was on the agenda from <Col N="1540" /> day one.  Nevertheless, I am glad he said the £60,000 is a start.</P>

      <P>Foreshore in the State is deemed to be State owned unless it can be proved otherwise.  Dublin Port and Docks Board has already proved ownership of some foreshore within its area of jurisdiction.  A strict interpretation of section 96 (2) could mean that after vesting day the foreshore at present in the ownership of Dublin Port and Docks Board would vest in the State.  This was not the intention of the section and to avoid any doubt it was considered prudent to delete the reference to the Foreshore Act in the section.  The State's interest in foreshore is protected by the 1933 Act.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;7. Limits consisting of the Harbour Works and the land vested in Foynes Port Company from time to time together with the waters of the sea and River Shannon bounded on the east by an imaginary straight line drawn from Durnish Point to Gammarel Point, and bounded on the west by a line drawn from Battery Point in a direction of 264º from true north for 4.0 Cables, and thence in a direction 225º from true north for 6.6 Cables, and thence to a Point 2.8 Cables due north of Mount Trenchard Point, and thence to a Point north of Loghill which point is 7.4 Cables south of the County Clare coast on the meridian 9º12' west of Greenwich, and thence due south through the mouth of the White River at Loghill.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is similar to Government amendment No. 37a which extends the jurisdiction of Foynes.  This is welcome and we appreciate the Minister's amendment, which recognises the success of Foynes.  The amendment is vital because Foynes needs this area of jurisdiction.

It recognises the role and contribution of the Foynes authorities over the years, which is not confined to the immediate Foynes area.  It extends to other parts of the region in which I live and represent.  It is proper <Col N="1542" /> the development capacity consistently demonstrated by the authorities over the years has been recognised in the amendment.  I express my appreciation to the authorities in the Foynes area and to the Minister for his positive approach.</P>

      <P>As Senators are aware, my colleague, the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Barrett, appointed Mr. Patrick J. Murphy to act as independent mediator between Limerick Harbour Commissioners and Foynes Harbour Trustees in the matter of an application from Foynes for an extension of their area of jurisdiction.  The mediation process commenced in October and the mediator's report and recommendation was received on 16 November 1995.</P>
      <P>Subsequent to receipt of the mediator's report, issues were raised by Limerick Harbour Commissioners, River Shannon pilots and Senator Jan O'Sullivan.  Notwithstanding the mediator's report, a serious view was taken of these concerns and I confirm the matters raised were thoroughly examined.  Departmental officials, including a technical representative, met with the harbour masters from both Foynes and Limerick on Thursday, 7 December 1995.</P>
      <P>Following this meeting a report on the matter was prepared by the chief marine surveyor who concluded that the mediator's recommendation is a reasonable compromise, that there is no compelling reason to alter any of the limits set out by the mediator and, that with goodwill, commonsense and professional co-operation between Limerick and Foynes, there is no basis for any concern from a safety perspective with the limits suggested by the mediator.  In these circumstances I am happy to commend my amendment, which provides for a redefinition of the limits of Foynes harbour to the House.  I ask Senator Kiely to withdraw his amendment in favour of the Government amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">

      <P>I thank the Minister for examining the situation and for his <Col N="1543" /> courtesy in meeting with people from Foynes over the past four months.  I thank him for taking on board the mediator's report.  While the Foynes Harbour Trustees did not get what they originally sought, they committed themselves to accepting the mediator's advice.</P>
      <P>Foynes Harbour is now happy with the opportunity to develop in the way it wants to.  Foynes should not have been obliged to lobby for the extension in the way it did.  It is in the spirit of the Bill that the commercial development of harbours should be accommodated.  It is wrong that Foynes has had to fight every inch of the way to obtain an opportunity that responds to the future development of shipping.</P>
      <P>The future will be in Panamax and Cape sized vessels.  It is important that the pace of development which has taken place over the past 30 years in Foynes is maintained.  It is also important that the momentum of job creation over that time from 60 to some 400 people should be maintained.</P>

      <P>It is also important that Foynes should have the opportunity to develop.  Taking a logical look at the situation, Foynes should own from where it is down to the Shannon.  It makes sense that Panamax type ships and 36,000 tonners should only come through Foynes waters.  It is daft that a jetty in the parish of Foynes pays dues to Limerick Harbour 20 miles away.</P>
      <P>In future the new board, which I will not be on, should look at the situation logically and talk to the Minister with a view to owning the water from where the port is or from the parish of Foynes to the estuary.  That is a reasonable way of putting it.  Finally, I thank the Minister for 4.5 of the 130 miles of estuary that Foynes now has.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to be brief but Senator Neville has provoked me to <Col N="1544" /> speak for a bit longer.  He is being disingenuous about Foynes' need to fight. We are talking about two ports both with an economic and safety interest in the Shannon Estuary and each port has every right to put its case.  Foynes put its case with a strong lobby, which is their right.  Limerick port also has rights.  It is the port for the estuary, apart from the section that is controlled by Foynes.  It has the interests of the estuary at heart.</P>
      <P>I raised concerns on Second Stage and I thank the Minister for his response and for obtaining technical advice on the safety interests that I was genuinely concerned about.  It is not as if Foynes is some little harbour that is being put upon by some big bad harbour on the other side.  Limerick harbour &mdash; or the Shannon Estuary Harbour as it will be when this legislation passes &mdash; has every right to put its case. It has economic and safety interests that need to be pursued.  I raised those issues and I thank the Minister for taking them seriously.  He obtained the relevant technical expertise that I had sought on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>My concerns related particularly to the large Panamax vessels that are coming up through the channel.  I have no problem with the extension of the east west boundary, but I was concerned about the northern boundary.  With the extension of the Foynes boundaries in that regard I was concerned that these large vessels may transverse waters controlled by two different authorities.  That concern was raised by me and the pilots who have to direct the boats, and I thank the Minister for having taken it seriously.  Perhaps the Minister can respond in a little more detail to the issue of ships having to transverse boundaries controlled by two different authorities.  I realise that the pilotage is the same for both authorities, but it is a matter of concern.</P>

      <P>These two amendments are being tabled at the request of the Office of Public Works and of Limerick Harbour Commissioners.  The ultimate effect of these amendments is to hand over a small amount of the city limits jurisdiction of Limerick Harbour Commissioners to the Office of Public Works.  It has long been recognised that navigation between Killaloe and Limerick city is very problematic.  Given the extent of the difficulties involved in this stretch of water, it is remarkable that some 100 boats make this passage annually.</P>
      <P>Recently, investigation into the technical potential of improving the channel and increasing the tidal window in the area has proved positive and it is expected that the design of a scheme will commence in the immediate future. Before any works can commence it will be necessary to extend the statutory limit of Shannon Navigation.  The Office of Public Works can do this by by-law under section 3 of the Shannon Navigation Act, 1990.  The new proposals will impinge on the jurisdiction of the Limerick Harbour Commissioners and consequently it is proposed to have the limits of the jurisdiction shortened somewhat from Sarsfield Bridge to Mallow Street Bridge.  The commissioners are more than willing to oblige in this matter.  The works to be carried out by the Office of Public Works will mean that trouble free inland waterway travel will be possible from the North of Ireland down through the midlands and as far as the sea at the Shannon Estuary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I note what the Leader of the House said and comments made by his colleagues earlier that there will be no attempt to rush through the provisions of this Bill, for which I am thankful. Although every Bill is important, this is particularly so as it relates to the administration of justice and it may not be amended for some time.  There have only been three or four Courts Acts in the history of the State.  Although it is an unseasonal time of the year, it behoves us to give the closest attention to each section and it is our duty as Members of the Oireachtas to do so.</P>
      <P>My amendment relates to the ability and the right of the board to consult persons concerning the suitability of applicants to the board.  The number of ways in which this type of consultation could prejudice the career, position or standing of a person are infinite.  If a solicitor who is a partner in a firm of solicitors applies to the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board to become a judge and the board in its wisdom decides to consult with one or more members of that firm, such consultation would alter the relationship between that partner and his fellow partners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If my amendment was accepted, the approval of the applicant would need to be obtained.  In such a situation the applicant could say that he did not want his partners to be consulted or that certain partners but not others could be consulted.  If this amendment is not accepted, the confidentiality aspect of this application will be breached.  As I said to a colleague, one could become the object of discussion and, indeed, gossip.  As I said earlier, the board will lose nothing as a consequence of my amendment.  It could say to the applicant that unless it can consult with certain people, then their application has no chance of succeeding.  I believe that the choice as regards consultation <Col N="1550" /> should rest with the applicant and not with the board.</P>

      <P>Section 14 (2) (c), which the Senator seeks to amend, enables the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board to consult persons concerning the suitability of applicants for appointment to the board.  The Senator's amendment would allow such consultation only with the prior approval of the applicant.  I believe that qualification of what is merely a permissive power to consult is unnecessary. We can rely on a board made up of such eminent jurists to act in a fair way to all persons who apply to the board.</P>
      <P>Senator Mulcahy referred to confidentiality. We all are concerned about confidentiality in cases of this nature.  I draw his attention to section 20, which states: &ldquo;All proceedings of the Board and all communications to the Board shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed except for the purpose of this Act.&rdquo;  I am satisfied that these provisions requiring confidentiality in relation to the proceedings and deliberations of the board will ensure that the utmost caution will be exercised as regards consultations with persons about applicants.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 14 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second Stage I stated my objections to the Bill, and particularly to this consultation with this board.  Those objections remain as very strong reservations on my part.  I wish to make it quite clear that in making my contribution at this point I am not implying that the Minister here, or any of the three or four Ministers we have had here in the course of this debate, has any ulterior motive in including this. I have given my reasons why I have strong reservations about the genesis of this bad Bill.  My reservations have nothing to do with the Minister's party <Col N="1551" /> but have a good deal to do with representatives of my party in Government in consultation with the Labour Party initially.  I take it that my views will be seen as objective and based on strong legal and constitutional reservations.</P>
      <P>When the type of consultation envisaged in section 14 (1) is introduced, one is running the risk not only of undermining the independence of the Judiciary, the status and quality of those who would apply, but also the risk of constitutional action which would not serve the purpose either of the Government or the Judiciary.  Let me give some examples of what I mean by this.  Under this, the board, to which I strongly object in principle, may among other things consult persons concerning the suitability of applicants to the board. Let me continue for a moment in view of the unprecedented nature of these arrangements.  The board may consult persons without any distinction, limitation or definition as to who those persons might be.</P>
      <P>When we pass legislation here we have to stand over the terms of the laws that we pass.  We are enabling this board to consult persons &mdash; any persons &mdash; about the suitability of the applicants for appointment to the Judiciary.  Take that in conjunction with the provisions of section 16 (7) where the board must satisfy itself that a person is suitable on grounds of character and temperament. This infringes one of the most fundamental rights enshrined in our Constitution as well as rights which are antecedent to the rights stated in the Constitution.  That any persons can be consulted by a board about the suitability of character and temperament of people who may be considered for judicial appointment is in my view an outrageous instrusion in the right of each citizen to have his or her character protected at all times against any unnecessary or unlawful intrusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Bill stands, anybody can be consulted.  The board may simply tell the person they are consulting that Mr. <Col N="1552" /> O'Kennedy, for example, or Mr. Mulcahy has applied for appointment and ask that person's view as to his suitability and character.  Did we ever have this before in the Oireachtas?  I cannot remember if we ever did, and I have 30 years experience here now.  I do not recall anything of this nature coming before us as a result of an ill thought out notion that emerged some time back in hasty conclusions in some airport at some stage.  This is reprehensible.  I have good reason to believe that I am not alone in my view.  A number of members of both professions who have made their views known to me, as well as members of the Judiciary who will not be affected by this, have very strong reservations about it.</P>
    <P>Before this, an application for appointment as a judge was a matter of total confidentiality.  It was discussed in Government.  Views may have been expressed around Government tables under the seal of collective Cabinet confidentiality. I may have taken part in some of those discussions, but that is where they stayed.  It was the function, and in my view it always is and should be, of Government and Government alone to determine the suitability of applicants.  Can the Minister tell me on what basis these decisions will be made? There is no point in telling me in this context that the intention of the legislation is to do such and such, in practice it will be so, in common sense it will be thus, that we all know that there is no such evil intention.  This is of no consequence because the law will now allow this group to consult persons concerning the suitability of applicants.</P>
    <P>Let me take it a stage further.  The same section enables the board to invite persons identified by the board to submit their applications to the board, in addition to the fact that people can apply themselves under the procedures already laid down.  That they can invite people to apply is reasonable enough; but they can invite people to apply and then, having taken action to activate an application, go out and consult other persons, not just those on the board, as <Col N="1553" /> to the suitability of character and temperament of the person they have invited to submit an application.  It is outrageous.  No proper thought has been given to it and it is a natural consequence of a procedure that I wish had never been introduced.  The Minister and the Government need to re-examine this.  The Minister is breaking onto ground which in my view is unprecedented in any legislation we have passed here.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned eminent jurists in the course of a response he made. There may be eminent jurists.  People might describe me as an eminent jurist; I hope it would not give me a false impression of just how eminent or less than eminent I am.  Of course there will be lists of distinguished jurists, the presidents of the various courts will be involved, but the Minister is now introducing power to nominate three other people to the board in respect of whose qualifications there is no definition in this Bill.  I will no doubt be told by the Government that it will not invite just anybody, that it will be somebody representative of this or that interest, responsible, respectable people and so on.  They will be accepted as being responsible and respectable, but whoever they may be, they will be adjudicating not just on the respectability but on the character and temperament of people who have been invited to have their character analysed, scrutinised and, perhaps, rejected by people who have no qualification at all in the legal area and may have less qualification in terms of judging character and temperament.</P>
    <P>Has anyone thought out the consequences of this?  In my view they are very serious.  I do not see any reason if this were challenged it would not be seen as being a gross intrusion in the fundamental right of each citizen to have their character protected as distinct from inviting unnamed, anonymous persons to offer views as to the suitability and character of applicants. <Col N="1554" /> This is very serious.  It is in a sense a natural consequence of setting up this kind of procedure, for which there is no precedent elsewhere as far as I am aware.  There is certainly no precedent for it here and I see no reason we should go down this road at this point.  It illustrates the natural consequence of what is a very misguided, albeit well-intentioned, approach.  The Minister of State indicated during yesterday's debate that the Irish Judiciary was of a pre-eminent standard in all things.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister of State present this evening can provide satisfactory replies to the queries I have already raised.  The media will probably avoid reporting this debate.  That is fine with me because it is too late to do so. We will not be recorded as having said anything of great significance.  However, the fundamental points I have raised should be entered into the record of this House.  Will the Minister explain how the Government intends to guarantee that there will be no unnecessary or unlawful breach of the right of each individual to the vindication of their character?</P>
    <P>With regard to the phrases used in legislation, the parliamentary draftsman will always return to precedent.  Section 14 (2) (f) states that the board may &ldquo;do such other things as the Board considers necessary to enable it to discharge its functions under this Act.&rdquo;.  I am aware that such a board should be competent, capable and able to discharge its functions. However, this provision is too wide-ranging.  It is the function of the existing courts to ensure that legislation enacted by the Oireachtas does not breach constitutional propriety.  I believe that the courts will have grave reservations in relation to such provisions. They are vague, unlimited and confer authority upon a board that goes beyond what is necessary for the proper discharge of its responsibilities.  I regret the fact that we did not have an opportunity to discuss this matter privately, not to score political points, but in order that we might be seen to have really <Col N="1555" /> examined the consequences of this provision.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Burton, stated yesterday that Irish judges are of a standard which is second to none.  I endorse those comments.  I was called to the Bar in 1961 and have practised law for 34 years.  I have been a Senior Counsel since 1974.  During that period I have gained considerable experience of how the courts operate and I acknowledge that there is need for improvement.  However, I am very concerned in relation to these provisions. Will the Minister inform me why the Government is proposing to change utterly procedures which have been seen to be good, confidential and have given Ireland a Judiciary of which any country would be proud?  I would ask the same question if my own party was in Government.  I ask again &ldquo;Why this nonsense?&rdquo;.  Can someone provide me with some rationale for such this action?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with great interest to the contribution of my learned friend, Senator O'Kennedy. However, I disagree profoundly with him.  As I listened to his contribution, I became aware of the extent to which the legal profession has taken over from the priesthood with regard to the sacred ties which bind its members together, irrespective of political allegiances.  I married a lawyer.  Senator Gallagher, who is seated beside me, is also a lawyer.  I am very conscious that we live in a world where lawyers have great traditions and are becoming ever present in many activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to procedures, I believe Senator O'Kennedy stated that he finds it offensive, possibly unconstitutional, that other opinions should be canvassed with regard to a person's suitability for office.  Surely that happens on a daily basis in relation to every other profession. If I were to seek a position in a university, I would be obliged to submit myself to seminars where I would be judged by my peers.  It would also be necessary for me <Col N="1556" /> to submit the names of a number of referees to assess my character.  I hope that they would say good things about me and I would choose them with that in mind.  I have partaken in many interview boards and read referees' reports, which are generally good.  However, such reports might contain information which might question the suitability of the interviewee.  It is better to discover such information now, rather than six months later when a completely unsuitable person is in office.</P>
    <P>Referee's reports are requested when anyone is seeking appointment to a senior professional post.  It is normal practice.  Such reports are treated in confidence.  I have never known a referee's report to be disclosed or enter the public arena.  I am quite sure that the procedures and practices of the body under discussion would be of the highest professional standard.  Given the nature of our legal profession and the board itself, it is a small world and people will express views.  Lawyers tend to speak of each other in cold and clinical terms. Senator O'Kennedy would not describe someone as a good lawyer for the simple reason that they share the Senator's political beliefs.  He will apply cold professional standards in relation to the competence and integrity, which is usually taken for granted, of a lawyer.  The members of the board will apply similar standards.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that the legal profession finds it so repulsive that a referee might be called upon to provide a professional view in relation to a candidate's suitability for office when this has long been a norm and has proven to be a useful aid in choosing the best candidates in all other professions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to section 14 (1), I raised the point on the previous section with regard to a quorum required for a meeting of the board. Could the Minister of State ensure that the Minister for Justice directs the board in a particular way in this regard? Perhaps there could be at least six members present in order for a meeting to commence.  If the Minister does not <Col N="1557" /> make such a stipulation, one person could decide to recommend a shortlist of candidates without due consultation.</P>
      <P>Section 14 (2) states that without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1) of this section, the board may do specific things.  I am not that experienced in terms of the law, but from other discussions which have taken place in the House I understand that the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; places an obligation on a body to carry out some action.  The term &ldquo;may&rdquo; is more discretionary.  Can the Minister of State indicate that this does not place an onus on the board to do so?</P>
      <P>I may be wrong but if so, there is some conflict between section 14, where the board is given discretion, and section 16 (7) which states that the board &ldquo;shall not recommend the name of a person to the Minister unless, in the opinion of the Board, the person has displayed in his or her practice as a barrister or solicitor&rdquo; a degree of competence etc.  If the board has discretion under section 14 in that it &ldquo;may&rdquo; advertise and consult etc., as the Bill does not oblige it to advertise, how does it fulfil the requirements under section 16 to inform the Minister of its recommendation and that in the board's opinion the person concerned has displayed ability as a barrister, for example, and is suitable on grounds of character or otherwise?</P>
      <P>Part IV is not clear and Senator Gallagher also said that.  It does not give the kind of clarity one expects from legislation. It all hinges on what I referred to originally as the &ldquo;Baldonnel One&rdquo; Bill. It was not thought out.  It was cobbled together in order to come up with a solution to try to hold a Government together.</P>

      <P>I do not disagree with some of the Senator Manning's points or with the requirement that the applicant should be of sound character or temperament.  It is important that a judge have a good temperament.  On <Col N="1558" /> Second Stage, Senator Henry said one particular judge in domestic violence cases used to send people home to have a cup of tea or a meal.  That is not suitable when dealing with domestic violence cases.  I am not trying to score points and I understand practitioners have a particular view, but section 14 is probably unimplementable and seems to conflict with section 16.</P>

      <P>I have found the discussion so far extremely interesting but I am sorry I am not able to accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Kennedy objected to this as a matter of principle.  He was candid enough to admit his objections related to the proposals of a previous administration he and his party supported.  He asked me to explain the necessity for this board and for this legislation.  When my colleague, Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Deputy Joan Burton, spoke on Second Stage yesterday, she said:</P>
      <P>I would like to briefly put these new arrangements in perspective.  The procedure for appointing judges is governed by the Constitution.  Article 35 provides that the judges of the Supreme Court, the High Court and all other courts shall be appointed by the President.  That power is exercisable and performable on the advice of the Government.  That fundamental arrangement is, of course, unaffected by this Bill.  I need hardly say that our Judiciary is widely respected for its fairness, integrity and independence. The focus of these measures is, however, on the Government's role in the judicial appointments process. Because of the Government's central role in the appointment of judges, there should be guarantees to ensure that procedures to appoint judges are not only appropriate but are seen to be so.</P>
      <P>That is the reason for this proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy also told us of his experience in Government when judges were being appointed.  I am quite sure <Col N="1559" /> there was some consultation with outside people with regard to the character of candidates for judicial office.  As Senator McGennis said when appointing judges, we must be careful in relation to their integrity, character and temperament.  These people can put the Senator and me away for a considerable time if they decide to do so.  I would like to think that if I appeared before a judge as, indeed, I have in the past&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>On a number of occasions, I nearly did time.  On one occasion when I was sentenced to six months imprisonment for participating in a banned march in Newry after Bloody Sunday in 1971 I was greateful to hear the judge suspend the sentence for 12 months.  I was glad Judge McBirney was of good temperament and I am sorry to say he was murdered by the IRA a short time later.  I was glad to have him on the bench that day and to know he was a judge of integrity and good temperament.  It is important.  If a person is in the dock awaiting judgement, it is nice to know that some inquiries have been made as to the judge's temperament, integrity, etc. and that someone has satisfied himself or herself of it. Otherwise, we would be in serious difficulty. I assume discreet inquiries have been made in the past and discreet inquiries will be made under this proposed legislation &mdash; and it is important the inquiries be discreet.</P>
      <P>I find it difficult to accept some of the reservations were expressed by Senator Mulcahy.  He seemed to suggest he would restrict the number of people who could be asked about a candidate to those likely to be in favour of him or her.</P>

      <P>In general, I found Senator O'Kennedy's view extremely conservative.  One finds this more and more among people who have been in a certain profession for many years.  Senator O'Kennedy said he has been a practising barrister since 1961.  I am not only critical of barristers in this respect.

      <P>The Senator was a barrister in 1961 and a politician in 1965.  We tend to get conservative when we serve <Col N="1561" /> a long period of time in politics. However, I fail to understand what is so special about barristers that they strongly object to people inquiring as to their integrity and temperament that does not apply to people in other professions, like doctors, for example, or others who apply for certain jobs?  Why does this also not apply to politicians? Presumably our temperament and the way in which we are likely to respond to cases that arise is considered by the electorate when they decide whether to vote for us or not.  It would certainly be considered by a Taoiseach when appointing people to public office.  Why should barristers be put on a pedestal?</P>
      <P>We are not making it compulsory for barristers to apply to be judges.  There was no intention in the divorce amendment to make divorce compulsory.  It is also not compulsory for barristers to apply to be judges, but if they decide to apply, there is a procedure they will have to go through which will be the same as that for people applying for other jobs and for less reason in most cases.  We do not appoint people in other cases to positions where they can deprive us of our liberty for a considerable period of time.</P>

      <P>While the Minister gave us anecdotal experience relative to his experience and attitude to the judge who imposed a sentence on him, it is of <Col N="1562" /> no consequence to the issues I raised. I invited the Minister to make precise responses to precise points, but he has not addressed them at all.  I also invited him to indicate to me what in this subsection would clearly define the limits on the persons, whoever they may be, to be consulted?  What is there in this section that would enable the Minister to say that it will not allow this board and its members, individually or collectively, to ask anyone?  I asked that question precisely and the Minister has not even addressed it, much less answered it and I do not propose to comment any further on it.  Much of what I wanted to say in terms of the procedures we are putting through is a matter of record.</P>
      <P>I will not engage in this general observation as to who is conservative and who is not; it is totally irrelevant.  What politicians think about lawyers and <i>vice versa</i> is the kind of thing we would say in casual conversation in the corridors. I am damned in that I wear both hats and neither profession may be of the highest standing from time to time. Other than that, many of the views and opinions I express are not of any relevance or consequence.  I do not intend to comment on whether people are conservative or not or whether barristers are special.  It is not my purpose to say how special barristers are.  They are not special nor have they any right to be regarded as such and this would also apply to solicitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked the Minister to show if there was precedent in any legislation that has come through the Oireachtas since the foundation of the State for this specific provision in respect of appointments?  I am not saying that barristers or solicitors should be privileged when they apply for appointments to the Bench. Can the Minister point this out, even in respect of appointing chairmen to semi-State bodies or members to the various statutory agencies?  Is it is in a section of any legislation, apart from something as important as appointments to an independent constitutional function?  I am not concerned about barristers but about the independent constitutional <Col N="1563" /> function of the courts, which made my life uncomfortable from time to time when I was a Minister.  However, I endorse that independence.  This measure, which will grossly risk undermining that independent function because of these kind of inquiries in respect of people discharging that function, not only greatly worries me but also leaves me alarmed.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that from time to time people will have some consultations under the existing procedures where the Government has made appointments; I cannot say he is not correct in saying that.  However, one does not have to be a lawyer but only be aware of constitutional rights to know there is a real distinction in the Constitution between discussions conducted under the bond and pledge of collective confidentiality &mdash; unless and until the Government changes it, and I hope it does not &mdash; and discussions that will take place on a board with responsible individuals.  They are not on the same scale at all and the Minister must know that.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with courts and court officers, and the functioning of the system. This is apparent in the short title which refers to amending and extending the powers and providing for all of the functions of the courts and court officers.  The Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Deputy Burton, said yesterday: &ldquo;I need hardly say that our Judiciary is widely respected for its fairness, integrity and independence&rdquo; on this Bill, which is intended to be directed at making the courts more effective and efficient.  The Minister quoted Deputy Burton and went on:</P>
    <P>The focus of these measures is, however, on the Government's role in the judicial appointments process. Because of the Government's central role in the appointment of judges, there should be guarantees to ensure that procedures to appoint judges are not only appropriate but are seen to be appropriate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1564" /> This is all about focusing on the Government's role, somehow conveying a notion to the public that the Government is really what we want to vindicate here.  If the Minister will tell me there has been even one example &mdash; I am not sure whether it would be permissible for him to do so &mdash; of the need to reform the Government's role following its failure to discharge its function properly in the appointment of judges or if he would tell me there was evidence at any time over the years of this role being abused I will accept there is a case for this.</P>
    <P>However, the statement by Deputy Burton, which the Minister quoted, has nothing to do with vindicating or enhancing the status of the Judiciary, its role or its function.  It is about something different altogether, which is how this nonsense started.

I have not heard any argument to impugn the people appointed nor have I heard anything against the system, which has worked so well over the years, and has discomfited many of us in Government from time to time, having regard to the <Col N="1565" /> independence of the judgments made by the people some of us appointed.</P>

      <P>That is correct, however, I will not make any further observations on this, because it risks being something of an <i>argumentum ad hominum,</i> which I do not like to indulge in, having regard to two colleagues for whom I have regard and who have, in recent months, been appointed to the Bench.  If it is right now, one would have to say why was it not right then?  There has been no attempt to explain, much less justify this change in procedure.</P>
      <P>I know Senator Manning will not take offence if in response to his reasonable view informed by his experience in terms of university appointments and such matters I am more concerned to hear the ministerial justification, as distinct from the observations of Senator Manning.  I do not question the bona fides, nor the accuracy of what he has said but we are speaking of appointing people to what must under the Constitution be an independent function.  This is of a totally different dimension from any academic appointment, and the two are not comparable.  I make no distinction between barristers and university lecturers.  I am concerned with the function to be discharged.  Senator Manning knows well that the position of a judge when appointed under the Constitution is very different from the position of the most distinguished academic who is appointed by a governing body after consultation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Manning spoke about supplying references of one form or another. The Minister may disabuse me on this point, but there is nothing regarding this in the Bill.  It is standard practice when applying for many jobs to supply a reference and a curriculum vitae.  This happens at university level and elsewhere, and properly so.  If this were merely a matter of checking referees, I would consider that reasonable protection was <Col N="1566" /> provided.  However, this is not the issue. There is nothing in the Bill to this effect.</P>
    <P>I find the procedure set out here objectionable.  It seriously risks breaching constitutional rights.  There is no comparison between this and the case of anybody applying even to a distinguished university for appointment to a chair and who supplies references that can be queried.  I have not heard a response from the Minister to any of the issues I have addressed.  If he will not respond I will have to leave it at that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that the consultations will be discreet.  How do we know they will be discreet?  There is nothing in the Bill to say that they will be discreet.  I am somewhat surprised by Senator Manning's contribution.  He obviously has never read or seen advertisements for positions in the newspapers which state: &ldquo;Replies will be strictly confidential&rdquo; or &ldquo;Replies treated in strictest confidence&rdquo;.  That only underscores the point made by myself and Senator O'Kennedy.  The reason such advertisements state that replies will be strictly private and confidential is to ensure that the person to whom one is applying for a job will not <Col N="1567" /> go back to one's colleagues and tell them one is applying for the position. That is a matter of common sense and I am sorry Senator Manning did not refer to it.  That is the basis for my belief that many of the subsections are repugnant.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy rightly said that there is no power for the applicant to bring forward other persons who might support the application.  In other words, the board may consult with persons who are negative towards the applicant and there is no power for the applicant to give evidence, either by letter or oral testimony, that the applicant is suitable for judicial appointment.  The Minister might address that issue.</P>
    <P>When the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, said that this procedure had to be seen to be fair, she let the cat out of the bag in terms of the rationale for this Bill.  It is not about appointing judges in a fair way and it is not about making sure our judges are of the highest calibre; we already have these things.  It is typical Labour Party cosmetics.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1569" /> The other point is that there are many eminent barristers and solicitors who will not want to go through this process, will not want to be interviewed, will not want to have their good names and character references discussed and will not want people inquiring about them from their friends and so forth.  This will have the effect of discouraging top calibre lawyers from applying for judicial appointment.  Perhaps the Government wants to secure politically, morally, ethically correct and perfect specimens of human beings who have never misbehaved and who must provide character references from the age of ten &mdash; perfect people who never had a row, an argument or an enemy &mdash; to fill the places on the Bench.  Is that what we are down to?  That is the effect of this provision. Some people who aspire to be judges might say: &ldquo;If I do not behave myself in a perfect way all the time, I may never be a judge&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We do not know what this section will allow in terms of background.  It has been known for a judge to be found with a little excess drink taken.  Would it be the case that if such a fact were known before the judge was appointed, he would not have been appointed?  If this is what the Government is saying it should be spelt out.  The Minister has failed to articulate the parameters within which this board will be able to operate with regard to looking at people's backgrounds and consulting with persons unknown and of unknown qualifications.  The better way &mdash; although the amendment was defeated &mdash; would have been to restrict consultations to those which have the consent of the applicant.  This section is abhorrent.</P>
    <P>I reiterate the point made by my colleague, Senator O'Kennedy.  The Minister made several judicial appointments this year and did not appear to be troubled by the absence of a Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  She did not appear to be troubled that the interviews, advertisements and consultations were not available to her.  As many of <Col N="1570" /> us have said: if it is not broken, why fix it?  What is the reason?  Would the Minister not have preferred to postpone those appointments until after she had the benefit of the wisdom of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board?  These questions remain unanswered.</P>
    <P>It is a sorry day that the Seanad will enact these sections.  They will have the effect of reducing the calibre of people presenting themselves for positions as judges in this country.  This Government will take full responsibility for that over time.</P>

      <P>Senator Mulcahy's argument that the board will be a source of information which will lead to gossip, scandal mongering and the maligning of the characters of those who apply is beneath contempt.  He is saying that a board which has among its membership the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the Attorney General will behave with less professional competence than a board appointed by a county council to fill vacancies or a university assessment board, where basic normal procedures ensure that matters which are confidential will remain so. He is doing a terrible disservice to his own profession by suggesting that the Chief Justice and the other board members would even be party to procedures which would have the results he suggests.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Kennedy stressed the constitutional nature of these positions.  It is for this reason that we must get the procedures right.  It might have been the case when we were a smaller State with far less litigation that the Government had a much greater knowledge of the people they appointed.  When UCD appoints professors it is virtually impossible to remove them, because these posts are statutory.  It would almost require an Act of Parliament to do so even though these persons may not perform their jobs properly or discharge their responsibilities to their students.  It is even more difficult to remove judges, given the protection they have under the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Both Houses of the Oireachtas must be involved in the removal of a judge.  I have the height of respect for Senator O'Kennedy's views and I accept his sincerity. I have discussed this issue with him privately as well as publicly. However, we will have to have a fundamental disagreement on this.  I believe that because constitutional protection is so important, we must get the procedures as right as is humanly possible. On this point Senator O'Kennedy and I will have to part ways.</P>

      <P>If I said this, it was not my intention.  I am trying to be helpful, but this does not seem to be working. I asked the Minister about the use of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in an effort to defuse the argument we had for about an hour but he did not respond.  The suitability of applicants is causing problems.  Section 16 refers to &ldquo;suitable on grounds of character and temperament&rdquo; but it also refers to &ldquo;otherwise suitable&rdquo;.  Senator Mulcahy <Col N="1572" /> raised the analogy of being drunk before being appointed as opposed to after this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>The board might decide that this is a reason somebody should not be appointed.  Could the board, because of its composition, its collective experience and the input of its outside members, decide that members of political parties should not be deemed eligible for appointment to the Bench?  The board is being given discretion to do what it considers suitable. Members of the public might believe that anybody who has been a member of a political party should not be considered for appointment to the Bench and the board might think is reasonable.</P>
      <P>I asked the Minister about the use of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in relation to giving discretion to the board but he did not reply.  I am now expanding my question to ask about the kind of discretion it is being given.  The Minister did not expand on how the board may come to the conclusion that a person is suitable to be a judge.  There are certainly drafting defects in this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with the section.  Certain matters have been raised which are way over the top. Senator O'Kennedy insisted that the Government show what precedent there is for this type of action.  This is not a court of law and the Government is not bound by precedent and does not have to show any.  We are introducing new legislation which we are entitled to do. We are debating a Bill which is novel, but this should not be forward on because it is the nature of our job as legislators.</P>
      <P>Judges are appointed to serve in this capacity up to the age of 70 and they have serious powers, such as the right to detain people for life.  Therefore, we must be sure that we appoint the right people.  It is long overdue that we look at how we do this and this Bill is attempting to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the constitutionality argument of whether the board is entitled to make telephone calls or consult people about the suitability of applicants, there is no legislation of a similar nature to protect ordinary people who apply for ordinary jobs.  Anybody can phone the Garda Síochána to inquire about somebody and there is no protection <Col N="1574" /> against this type of inquiry.  Why should the law be any different in this instance?  Section 20 guarantees that all proceedings and correspondence of the board shall be confidential.  I do not know what better protection the Bill could give the individuals concerned and I think concerns on this point are unwarranted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of points have been raised by the three Senators on the opposite side of the House, some of which have already been answered by Senators Manning and Gallagher.  I do not intend to repeat the points they made because there has already been too much repetition.  I do not expect to have a meeting of minds with Senator O'Kennedy or with the other members of the same party on this matter.  He has made it perfectly clear where he stands on the principles of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Kennedy knows from experience that we cannot legislate for all eventualities.  That is true no matter who is responsible for the legislation. The board will include respectable people of great integrity.  We must rely on them to do the right thing.  I am confident they will, otherwise they should not be in the positions they currently hold.  As regards the three extra people who will be appointed to the board, they will be selected on the basis of the calibre of those already on the board.  It would be wrong for any Minister to appoint people to a board, which includes such people as the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the Attorney General, who would not have the same integrity, stature, knowledge and experience.  This board will be a responsible one and will not behave in the way some have suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot answer the questions relating to precedence.  I am not aware of any precedent but I am sure if there was one, Senator O'Kennedy would find it, particularly if it was a bad one.  I would like to think, whether this precedent is enshrined in legislation, that a Minister or Government when making the appointment would be careful to vet <Col N="1575" /> applicants to ensure they were suitable on grounds of character and temperament.</P>
    <P>Senator McGennis and Senator Mulcahy mentioned judges who might imbibe too much in a public place, as one judge did recently.  That is a matter for consideration.  If an applicant or a candidate for a position on the Bench has a drink problem, that is a valid consideration for his or her appointment.  I would like to think that even without the requirement of legislation this was considered in the past.  Senator O'Kennedy described my anecdotal experience as irrelevant.  However, if I had thought that judge had a serious drink problem, I would not have been happy standing in the dock on that Monday morning.</P>

      <P>Section 20 states that &ldquo;All proceedings of the Board and all communications to the Board shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed except for the purposes of this Act.&rdquo; The Senator was talking about gossip, tittle tattle and the fact that everyone would talk about the characters of applicants to the Bench.  This section covers the matters to which the Senator referred.</P>
      <P>Senator McGennis made a point that members of political parties may not be appointed by the board.  Over the years some of the most distinguished members of the Judiciary were former active members of political parties. Senator McGennis's point betrays a misunderstanding of this matter.  She is wrong.  The board does not have the right to appoint members of the Judiciary; the Government has the right to do so.  The board will consult, but it does not have the right to appoint people.</P>

      <P>The Senator said &ldquo;appoint&rdquo;.  It would be unconstitutional if we gave the board the right to appoint people because it would be contrary to Article 35 of the Constitution.  For the benefit of Senator Mulcahy and Senator McGennis, I reiterate that the board can adopt its own procedures.  The board has that right and a person who applies to it will know, on the basis of the Bill, that the board may consult other persons. The power to consult is enabling, not mandatory.  It may be that, in a particular case, the board will not wish to consult.  It may not wish to consult on any case.  If an applicant does not want the board to consult, he or she can tell the board that they do not wish such consultations to take place.  This will <Col N="1577" /> limit the options of the board because in those circumstances it will be precluded from making what it considers necessary inquiries to particular sources to make a judgment.  This reflects reality.</P>

      <P>This is the time to tease out such matters.  I expressed reservations and I will not repeat them. However, the record of the debate will be available to people later and they can reach their conclusions.  Time will demonstrate and experience will show whether the points are valid.</P>
      <P>A number of my professional colleagues indicated to me that under no circumstances will they allow their names, characters or standing to be subjected to the type of scrutiny envisaged under the Bill.  These people &mdash; not confined to one party &mdash; are generally regarded as well suited, competent and respected members of the profession. Experience will show that where a range of choice existed previously, a number of people who might have applied will not do so now as a result of these procedures. They do not wish to have their characters and suitability denigrated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said the Minister and the Government should have information regarding the character and suitability of applicants.  I agree and I wholeheartedly endorse that point.  In the past consideration of the suitability of characters and temperament was carried out by Government under a constitutional obligation of confidentiality.  It is very different from the type of consideration the body which will be established <Col N="1578" /> will carry out.  People will be invited to express views on the character and suitability of applicants and are not bound by constitutional confidentiality. They are not part of Government and will not have that responsibility.  This is the distinction and I have experience of both professions</P>
    <P>If I were to talk in my sleep or suffer an aberration I would repeat things said in Government from time to time about individuals which should never have been disclosed.  However, as long as I do not suffer that aberration, it will never happen.  I am concerned that while that protection existed for every character in the past, it does not exist now.  The Bench and the quality of those who apply for it will be diminished and I greatly regret that.  Time alone will prove whether my reservations are well founded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfair and incorrect of the Minister to suggest that I displayed a misunderstanding of the purpose of the section and perhaps of the Bill.  I understand the section in particular and many other sections of the Bill. I read precisely from the Bill when I said the board shall not recommend the names.  I asked the Minister a question and he did not answer it.  Perhaps the fact that I am not a lawyer explains why it appears many of my questions are not being answered, although Senator O'Kennedy also said he was not receiving replies to questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Manning nodded when I asked a question in relation to suitability and the Minister went to great lengths to discuss whether somebody with a drink problem would be rendered unsuitable.  I asked whether, under section 16, membership of a political party would render a person unsuitable to be recommended.  Does the board have that discretion?  The Minister dismissed the question as a misunderstanding of the Bill.  I do not think I suggested at any point that the board could appoint people.  However, if I did so, it was probably because of the lateness of the hour.  I am aware the Minister will <Col N="1579" /> make the appointments on the basis of names forwarded to her.  Perhaps this clarifies my point and that I understand the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator understands it I should not have to make the point that the board will advise on the suitability of particular candidates.  The appointment will be made by the Government.  I was asked whether the board could recommend that politicians should not be appointed to the Bench. It is an independent board and, presumably it could do that, but the appointment is made by the Government which comprises politicians.  I can imagine the attitude if such a recommendation was made seriously.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Kennedy said, as a result of the unwillingness of barristers to accept these procedures, that some will not apply for positions.  That is unfortunate and regrettable but it is their choice.</P>

      <P>This came up accidentally with a previous amendment when it was pointed out that provision has been made in this section for the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and all these other people to be replaced on the board in the event of their retirement or death.  There is no reference at all in this section to the position of the Attorney General.  I presume the Minister would say that when the Government collapses the Attorney General retires.  However, we might have a situation such as Senator Manning referred to where people can go mad.  It is very difficult to dismiss judges in particular.  In the event of a Chief Justice or any of these people named being dismissed, there is no provision in this section for them to be replaced.  It simply says that on the death or retirement of these specific people they are to be replaced.  In order to protect future Governments, the Minister might consider tabling an amendment on Report Stage to incorporate the dismissal of these high officers of the land.</P>
      <P>It might be necessary to insert something to cater for or cope with the position of the Attorney General as well in relation to a change of Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator McGennis made an excellent suggestion that this matter might be addressed on Report Stage.  In most Bills where appointments are dealt with, there normally is a casual vacancy clause.  Section 15 refers to &ldquo;death or retirement&rdquo; and I suppose that an impeachment pursuant to the Constitution could be a retirement in one sense.  Even if we feel that judicial appointments to the board are covered well enough, there is a question mark. For example, if during his or her three year term such a person retired from practice as a barrister or solicitor it would seem that they would have little place on the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also had the question earlier, which the Minister answered to a fair degree, that if the Attorney General ceased to be Attorney General he or <Col N="1582" /> she would have to resign from the board.  That was implied.</P>
    <P>I hope I do not detect any rush on the part of the Government to get this Bill through quickly, because these matters should be properly addressed on Report Stage so there can be no room for ambiguity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Mulcahy and I thought I had answered the question in relation to the Attorney General.  He holds his position on the board because of the office of Attorney General which he holds.  Therefore, when he ceases to be Attorney General he would cease to be on the board. Article 30.5.4º of the Constitution states:</P>
      <P>The Attorney General shall retire from the office upon the resignation of the Taoiseach, but may continue to carry on his duties until the successor to the Taoiseach shall have been appointed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is talking about judges on the Bench.  The Constitution is quite specific about how judges can be removed and we are certainly not proposing to change that.  If he or she ceases to be a judge then he or she <Col N="1583" /> would cease to be a member of the board.</P>

There is another possible scenario.  If the Minister reckons it is covered that is satisfactory, but I feel that it may not be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not replied.  I specifically mentioned the situation where if a barrister or solicitor ceased to practise during their three year tenure on the board, we would have a situation where a non-practising barrister or solicitor remained on the board.  There does not appear to be a casual vacancy clause which covers such a situation.  The only mention of such a situation is in an earlier section 13 (4) which states that &ldquo;the board may act notwithstanding a vacancy in its membership&rdquo;. It would be simple for the parliamentary draftsman to come back to us with a casual vacancy clause that clarifies this matter properly.  I get the impression that the Government is under some kind of pressure or that it is in some kind of rush to bring this matter to a head.  It is quite unique.</P>
      <P>I have been critical of the Minister today.  No matter what we have proposed he has seen merit in none of our suggestions.  He has not once said that he will go back to the parliamentary draftsmen or to the Minister to see if our views can be incorporated.  This is the first Minister who has come in here with that type of inflexibility.  I want my specific question answered as to whether or not a non-practising barrister or solicitor can remain on the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other question concerns the three persons appointed by the Minister.  The Minister said these people will have <Col N="1584" /> positions on the board by virtue of their office.  If, for example, the Minister appointed the chairperson of Women's Aid, it is not clearly stated in the Bill that if that person ceases to be chairperson of that organisation they would be required to resign from the board.  I would like an answer to those meaningful queries.  Is the Minister under pressure to force this Bill through tonight without taking time to come back with proper amendments to clarify these situations?</P>

I challenge anyone to produce proof that we are trying to do so.  The Senator asked me to reply to his meaningful points, which I have done.  The points to which I did not reply were not meaningful.</P>
      <P>The Senator asked about a practising barrister or solicitor who would cease to be such over the three years.  I thought the answer to that question was made clear at an earlier stage.  Those people can be replaced if they cease to be a practising barristers or solicitors &mdash; a point which has been made clear.</P>

The Minister will agree that there is a vacancy clause for four of the appointees, although he may not believe it is meaningful for me to say so but I will not trade insults with <Col N="1585" /> him.  However, there is no vacancy clause for any of the other appointees. Will the Minister not include a vacancy clause in respect of the other people?</P>

Senator Enright rightly said that in the event of a vacancy the board may proceed.  However, I cannot see where it refers the filling of vacancies in the case of practising barristers or solicitors during the three years.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 10, subsection (2), line 22, after &ldquo;shall&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;through its Chairperson&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Earlier we discussed the role of the Attorney General.  In a statement to the Dáil two days ago the Minister said that the Attorney General will be the person who will bring the information back to the Cabinet when it considers the recommendations of the advisory board. The Attorney General will bring the shortlist of seven or more names to the Cabinet.  The Minister will agree that this is not in the Bill.  Section 16(2) states that the board shall &ldquo;submit to the Minister the name of each person who has informed the Board of his or her wish to be considered for appointment&rdquo;. Section 16 (3) states: &ldquo;The Board shall provide the Minister with particulars of the education, professional qualifications, experience and character of the persons whom it recommends under this section&rdquo;.  It does not say the Attorney General will submit to the Minister or inform or advise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked if this statement by the Minister that the Attorney General will bring the information to the Cabinet when it is considering the recommendations of the advisory board was Government policy.  If it is, why has it not been included in the Bill?  If not, will the statement be withdrawn?  This statement on communications between the board and the Government is contrary to an earlier section in the Bill.  As the Minister pointed out at great length, the board is entitled to adopt its own procedures. What would happen if the board adopted the procedure which I propose, that is, that it shall be the duty of the chairperson of the board who will, to use the Minister's words, bring the information back to the Cabinet <Col N="1587" /> when it is considering the recommendations of the advisory board?</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister envisages two sets of communications &mdash; a formal recommendation from the board, while the Attorney General will bring back different information.  This pertains to our general reservations about including the Attorney General on the board in the first place.  The Minister will agree that the amendment proposed by Fianna Fáil would make it very clear, although I am sure he will think up some elaborate reason for disagreeing with the words &ldquo;through its chairperson&rdquo;. However, it would make eminent sense that the chairperson of that board, the Chief Justice, or through his office the person in charge of this board, would be charged with the responsibility of communicating the recommendations of the board back to the Government. Perhaps I am mistaken; perhaps my amendment is not needed, but if I am mistaken, then we are entitled to an official withdrawal of the remarks of the Minister for Justice to the effect that the Attorney General will bring the information back to Cabinet when they are considering the recommendations of the advisory board.  The Minister may not think these comments are meaningful but I would like a meaningful reply, either to the Minister's comments or to our proposal.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 16 (2), which the Senator seeks to amend, provides that the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board shall submit to the Minister the name of each applicant for judicial appointment and recommend at least seven persons <Col N="1588" /> for appointment.  The Senator's amendment would stipulate that the submission and recommendation of persons by the board would be made through its chairperson, whom, as section 13 (3) provides, shall be the Chief Justice.  That is unnecessary.  Section 16 is framed in such a way that the board will be responsible for the submission and recommendation of persons.  It will act in this matter as a body.  The Attorney General's role in this matter will be the same as that of every other board member. The board as a body will be responsible under section 16 for submitting and recommending persons to the Minister for appointment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of amendment No. 9 is that as I understand it &mdash; the Minister will <Col N="1589" /> correct me if I am wrong &mdash; there are two situations in which the board communicates a recommended list of people to the Government.  One is where at least seven people have applied and the other is in circumstances where fewer than seven people have applied.  In circumstances where seven people have applied, there is no obligation on the board to give to the Minister the list of names of everybody who has applied, but when fewer than seven have applied, there is an obligation on the Minister or the board to give the list of everybody who applied to the Minister. I cannot see why there should be a difference. It is quite obvious that the Minister should be entitled to know the name of everybody who has applied, regardless of whether they are recommended.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 10, subsection (3), line 30, to delete &ldquo;character&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;general suitability&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The legislation mentions the professional qualifications, experience and character of the persons the board is to recommend under the section and the words &ldquo;character&rdquo; and &ldquo;temperament&rdquo; are used.  The effect of these two proposed amendments is to take out the word &ldquo;character&rdquo; and leave in the concept of general suitability which I think is capable of including the notion of character although I am not saying that character is irrelevant.  I will go further; in many ways character is an essential ingredient, but it is wrong and lacking in taste, if I can put it as finely as that, to include the notion of character checks on anybody, especially in a Bill. It is over the top, lacking in finesse, and it leaves open the possibility that there could be fairly petty discussions on what could be minor peccadilloes or aspects of people's personalities, so in general I find the inclusion of that word slightly offensive, draconian and over the top. The concept of general suitability would adequately cover the requirements of the Bill in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand this. I understood that it was a matter of principle that there should be no inquiries. The discussion we had earlier, particularly when Senator O'Kennedy was here, showed the Senators' strong objection to inquiries in relation to suitability on grounds of character and temperament. Now we are being asked to substitute &ldquo;general suitability&rdquo; because the other phrase is lacking in taste and finesse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1591" /> The purpose of these amendments is to remove the requirement of the board to recommend the name of a person to the Minister only if that person is, among other matters, suitable on grounds of character and temperament. I do not believe this is an unreasonable requirement.  This board is charged with a very important function, to advise the Government in relation to the suitability of persons for appointment to judicial office which is one of the most important positions a person can hold.</P>
    <P>Judges have great responsibilities and perform functions which affect the daily lives of individual citizens and the population as a whole.  It is not unreasonable to require that the board satisfies itself as to a person's character and temperament before recommending him or her for judicial office.  The section obliges the board to form an opinion on a person's character and temperament.  The board is specifically empowered, under subsection (1), to request the person concerned to provide it with such information as it may require about that person, including information relating to their character.  On balance, I prefer to have this requirement included in the Bill and I regret I cannot accept the Senator's amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1592" /> In page 11, before section 17, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;17.&mdash;(1)  The Minister shall, in appointing persons to the Board pursuant to section 13, subsection (2) (c), ensure that not fewer than one of the persons so appointed is a woman and not fewer than one of the persons so appointed is a man.</P>
    <P>(2) In recommending to the Minister the names of persons for appointment to judicial office pursuant to section 16, the Board shall ensure that not fewer than one of the persons whose names are so submitted is a woman and not fewer than one of the persons whose names are so submitted is a man.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I move this amendment on behalf of Senator Honan.  The Government is committed to gender equity wherever possible in relation to the membership of boards.  I do not expect the Government to appoint the Judiciary on a gender basis but I suggest that a gender basis is taken into account when the board is established.  I hope Senator Honan will be permitted to reintroduce the amendment on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>While I strongly support the objective the Senator is attempting to achieve, I cannot agree with the means adopted to do so.  The difficulty I have with the first part of the amendment is that the Minister would be required to ensure that one of her three nominees is a man or a woman.  I am concerned about this because five of the <i>ex officio</i> members of the present board are males, the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court, the President of the Circuit Court, the President of the District Court and the Attorney General.  The Law Society and the Bar Council will also be entitled to nominate a practising solicitor and practising barrister, respectively, for appointment to the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1593" /> The Minister already stated in the Lower House that she will request that these bodies have regard to the Government's policy in relation to gender balance when selecting their nominees. The Senator's amendment would limit the Minister's discretion when it came to making her appointments to the board.  Given that so many members of the board will be males, it is important that the Minister should have as wide a discretion as possible when nominating members so that the board reflects a proper gender balance.</P>
    <P>With regard to subsection (2) of the amendment, the inclusion of a man or a woman in the list of recommended names submitted to the Minister would depend, not upon their suitability for appointment &mdash; based, for example, on their experience, qualifications or competence &mdash; but would be made on grounds of sex alone.  This is a complex legal area which raises constitutional questions, particularly in regard to a person's constitutional right to be treated equally.  I understand there are doubts in relation to providing for a quota in employment based on sex.  I also understand that the Minister for Equality and Law Reform is reviewing the employment equality legislation with a view to introducing proposals for changes in this area.  I further understand the European Court of Justice handed down a recent judgment relating to the area of employment equality. This judgment only became available in recent weeks and its implications are still under consideration.</P>
    <P>There are also a number of further difficulties with the amendment.  Subsection (4) deals with cases where fewer than ten persons, now seven, inform the board of their wish to be appointed or where the board is unable to recommend at least seven persons for appointment. In such a case the board is required to recommend the name of each person who has informed the board of their wish to be appointed.  If <Col N="1594" /> there were only three such persons, who were either all males or females, the board would be prohibited from making any recommendation.  I hope the spirit of my reply will provide the Senator with the assurance she requires.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Like J.K. Galbraith I often talk about &ldquo;the slow conversion of the human heart&rdquo;, which sometimes must be given an impetus.  I believe that Senator Honan was attempting to introduce a pacemaker to the debate.  The judgment of the European Court of Justice in relation to positive discrimination must be taken into account.  However, I believe that Senator Honan tabled the amendment to place some emphasis on the issue of gender balance.  It would not be desirable if people without merit were put forward for appointment.  As a former President of the National Women's Talent Bank, I assure the Minister that we can supply the names of many eminently suitable law graduates for these positions.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the Minister will accept the spirit of the suggestion, which is most important.  The Minister for Education has, after all, put forward similar objectives within the university Bill.  I am sure that all Government Ministers are working in the same spirit.</P>

      <P>In page 11, lines 46 and 47, to delete &ldquo;for the purposes of this Act&rdquo;, and substitute &ldquo;to the Government&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have, at last, reached the confidentiality provision.  I believe Members will agree this is very important in ensuring that people's names and reputations do not become the subject of discussion <Col N="1595" /> among the general public and the legal fraternity when they offer themselves for judicial office.  Section 20 (1), except for the purposes of this Act, is vague.  The earlier sections permit consultations with third parties, etc.  The board has authority under this legislation to do so.  However, where people are permitted to disclose confidential information, for the purposes of the Act, in a general way, I believe that too large a licence is being created.</P>
    <P>The only rationale for the publication of the proceedings of the board is in providing advice to the Government. The Minister of State indicated that the board itself will decide and organise the communication of such information to the Government.  He refused to clarify the remark that the Minister for Justice made in the Dáil in relation to the Attorney General, that the Attorney General will be responsible for communicating information to the Cabinet when it is considering the recommendations of the advisory board.  Is that for the purposes of this Act?  I submit that it is not.  The Minister of State indicated it is the board's function to organise such communication.  Accordingly, the Attorney General has no role in communicating that information to the Government.  It is the responsibility of the board.</P>
    <P>It would be better and tighter if the Government was the only body to which information on the proceedings of the board could be disclosed and that such information would consist of the submission of names to the Minister.  In that regard, I am not sure what the Minister meant when she said &ldquo;the information&rdquo;. I must take note of her contribution on Second Stage because I do not know what she meant by it.  She seemed to be implying it meant information which was outside the ambit of the recommendations of the board.  Maybe I am weighing too heavily on it.  I do not know.  Unfortunately, the Minister is not <Col N="1596" /> here to enlighten me but she said that the Attorney General will be the person who will bring the information back to the Cabinet when &ldquo;they&rdquo;, and I do not know who &ldquo;they&rdquo; refers to but I presume it is the Cabinet, are considering the recommendations of the advisory board.</P>
    <P>Unless the Minister has a strong objection, it would be tighter and more confidential if the Bill specified that the proceedings of the board and their communications can be disclosed only to the Government.  If the Minister was not happy with my wording, instead of deleting &ldquo;for the purposes of this Act&rdquo; he could use the words &ldquo;for the purposes of this Act, to the Government&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator denied this morning he was filibustering.  If he is not filibustering, he keeps repeating points which have been made already, which I thought were resolved and which, as far as this Bill is concerned, have already been decided.</P>
      <P>Section 20 of the Bill provides that all proceedings of the board and all communications to the board shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed except for the purposes of this Act.  The Senator's amendment would seek to change that wording to provide that communications shall not be disclosed except to the Government.  I can appreciate what the Senator is trying to achieve but his amendment might widen the number of persons to whom the board would have to disclose information. He talked about too large a licence but he would be contributing also to that too large a licence.  It occurs to me that the effect of the Senator's amendment might be to require the board to disclose details of its proceedings and communications received by it to the Government.  I do not believe the provision needs to be as wide as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill gives powers to the board in section 14 to adopt such procedures as <Col N="1597" /> it thinks fit to carry out its functions and the Senator's amendment may be somewhat inconsistent with that section.  In addition, section 16 requires the board to provide the Minister with particulars as to the education, professional qualification, experience and character of the persons whom it recommends for judicial appointment.  However, the board is not required to disclose its proceedings to the Government under the provisions of section 20 and I do not think it should be required to do so.  We are establishing a body separate from the Government to give advice to the Government on judicial appointments.  I believe it should be free to settle its own procedures and, given the membership of the board, I think we can safely rely on it to carry out its proceedings in a proper and fair manner.</P>
    <P>From that, the Senator will gather I am convinced his amendment is inappropriate and, for the reasons given, I ask him to withdraw it.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  I am prepared to concede that my amendment might have the opposite effect in that extraneous material might have to be disclosed to the Government but I am sorry the Minister is showing such inflexibility.  The other way to achieve a better result is to add, after the words &ldquo;for the purposes of this Act&rdquo;, the words &ldquo;to the Government&rdquo;. In other words, the only communication of material which could be made to the Government would be material which the board had considered for the purposes of the Act but it would only be to the Government.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 11, after line 47, to add a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) A person who is in breach of this section shall be guilty of an offence under the Official Secrets Act, 1963, and shall be liable accordingly.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is important that people observe the confidentiality provisions of this Bill, and we do not have to restate the reasons for that, but the Bill has failed to provide a sanction for those who might breach those confidentiality provisions. There are, of course, some possibilities that there might be a duty of care that members of this board would have to people who came before it.  They are probably not liable in negligence. They are certainly not liable in contract so we are in a position where there is no liability or sanction attaching to a person who breaches the confidentiality provisions of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to safeguard the confidentiality provisions of the Bill, it should be made an offence contrary to the Official Secrets Act, 1963 to be in breach of those same confidentiality provisions. The amendment speaks for itself and, other than the Minister having a good reason for not introducing a sanction, I <Col N="1599" /> do not see why this amendment should not be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened carefully to what the Senator had to say but I do not think it necessary to go as far as he suggests.  What we are doing is establishing a board which will include some of our most eminent and respected judges and also the Attorney General. This is a board charged with the important function of identifying persons who are suitable for appointment to judicial office and making recommendations to the Government in that regard.</P>
      <P>Section 14 provides that the board may adopt such procedures as it thinks fit to carry out its functions.  I think it is better to leave it to the board to make its own arrangements in relation to its procedures, including matters relating to confidentiality of communications. The Bill makes it clear that the proceedings and communications of the board shall be confidential and may only be used for the purposes of the Bill.  I am not convinced that we need go so far as to provide that persons who breach the provisions of section 20 shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
      <P>Of course, a member of the board who breached a confidence which resulted in an applicant to the board suffering loss or damage would leave himself or herself open to an action in civil law and the payment of damages. This, I believe, will also act as an additional deterrent to any member of the board who might be tempted to breach a confidence.</P>
      <P>Apart from these matters, I am advised there are some technical difficulties with the amendment.  For example, there are a number of offences provided for in the Official Secrets Act, 1963 and I think the amendment would have to indicate which offence was committed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1600" /> I would also be concerned that the scope of the amendment is too wide.  It would seem to prevent an applicant to the board from making available information, which he or she had willingly and voluntarily made to the board in support of his or her application, to another person &mdash; and I am sure that is not intended.  It would be a poor reflection on the <i>ex officio</i> members of the board, which will be chaired by the Chief Justice of the day, if the Oireachtas had to provide for an offence under this section.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances, I ask the Senator to withdraw the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a number of observations on the Minister's comments about which I am unhappy.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that if there was a breach of the confidentiality clause, an aggrieved person would have an action in law for damages against the person who had breached the clause.  Has specific legal advice been taken on that matter? Has the Office of the Attorney General advised that this is the case?</P>
      <P>The reason I find that approach disappointing is because it puts the onus on the aggrieved person to take a civil case. The State, to a certain extent, is washing its hands of the problem and seems to be saying that while there may have been a breach of this legislation, the aggrieved person must look after it themselves.  Surely there is an obligation on the State to enforce rules and procedures on boards it has set up if there is the possibility of confidential information etc. being leaked?  Should there not be some obligation on the State to protect these people?  The best way to do that is by including some form of sanction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree there could be some legal and technical difficulties with the sanctions proposed by invoking the provisions of the Official Secrets Act.  If the Minister's principle was overcome and he <Col N="1601" /> accepted that the Government should provide a sanction for breach of confidentiality, could he not draft such a provision so as to satisfy the requirements of the Official Secrets Act?  If the Minister's answer is no, then is he rushing this Bill through for a particular purpose.</P>

      <P>In his amendment, Senator Mulcahy does not differentiate between the <i>ex officio</i> and other members.  These sanctions are to apply to all members of the board.  The Senator made a second point about the three members appointed by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I have already explained the qualities the Minister will take into consideration when making these three appointments. It would be very difficult to envisage that the Minister would appoint people who would not be of approximately the same calibre, integrity, etc., as the eminent members already on the board.  We are speaking of people such as the Chief Justice, the President of the Bar Council and the Attorney General.  It may be taken for granted that, when appointing these three people, the Minister will take into consideration, not only the job they will have to do, but who will serve on the board with them.</P>
      <P>It is contradictory that the Senator is now emphasising the importance, integrity and character of these three people, whereas earlier he was arguing that such matters as character and temperament should not be taken into consideration. At the very least, it is inconsistent.  It is not my intention to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I can see much work being put on the shoulders of the Master of the High Court.  Most motions are taken on a Monday morning, and it is frequently the case that the list is so large it is divided between two High Court judges, which means that two judges are hearing uncontested and one sided motions, in addition to contested motions, especially motions for judgment by consent or in default of an appearance, but of the type now being transferred to the Master of the High Court.  There will, therefore, be an enormous amount of work for the master.</P>

    <P>There appears to be an oversight in the section, and if the Minister is not rushing the Bill through he may amend the Bill, if necessary.  Section 25 (1) <Col N="1605" /> states: &ldquo;... in all such applications ... for judgement by consent or in default of appearance of defence ...&rdquo;. However, motions to dismiss for want of prosecution are uncontested on many occasions.  These are cases where one writes letters to the other side of the proceedings asking them to bring on their proceedings as they have been left in abeyance.  The frequent result is an uncontested motion before the High Court.  Will the Minister consider it appropriate that a motion to dismiss for want of prosecution should be added to the list of new powers to the Master of the High Court pursuant to section 25 (1)?</P>

    <P>There is a mistake in the wording of the amendment.  The intention is to bring the age of retirement for all judges into line at 70.  As I understand the proposals contained in the Bill, the age of retirement for Supreme Court, High Court and Circuit Court judges will be 70, but for District Court judges it will be 65, although they will be able to apply for extensions,</P>
    <P>Why should a District Court judge have to retire five years earlier than a judge of the Circuit, High or Supreme Courts?  Surely it is time that there was equality of treatment between all judges, no matter which court they are on?  There can be no rationale for distinguishing between District Court judges and other judges in terms of retirement.  Senator Honan is not here to move her amendment but she informed me that several people had asked her to voice this concern.  If the Minister agrees with the principle perhaps he could provide a suitable amendment to the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment would provide for a uniform retirement age of 70 for all judges appointed after the passing of the Act.  The retirement age for District Court judges is 65 but there is provision for extension up to the age of 70.  There has probably been only one instance of such an extension being denied so, effectively, the retirement age is 70.  We prefer to leave the situation as it is.  Under the Act judges appointed to the Supreme Court and the High Court will be required to retire at 70 years of age.  This is consistent with the position in the Circuit Court where all judges retire at 70 years of age. Under section 2 of the Courts Act, 1949, a judge of the District Court may obtain annual extensions of retirement age from 65 to 70.</P>

      <P>Perhaps when future judicial provisions are being introduced this situation could be looked at.  It seems invidious that District Court judges are in a different situation from other judges.  I can understand why the Minister does not want to do anything about it at present.  However, there is a large body of opinion that the legal age for retirement should be reduced.  This cannot be done immediately because people who might consider going forward for judicial appointments are cognisant of the fact that if they went for such an appointment now they would not have 15 years service before they would retire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the next few years the Supreme Court, the High Court and other courts could be brought into line gradually so that if it is deemed reasonable that the age for retirement for all judges should <Col N="1609" /> be reduced to 69 or to 68, for example, this could be done under the various Bills introduced from time to time.  It is invidious that District Court judges should have to go before some form of scrutiny, although this is invoked very rarely.  However, if 20 per cent of the Supreme Court is deemed to be incapable of fulfilling their positions properly that means it applies to only one judge whereas 20 per cent of the District Court would mean ten judges. This is a serious situation and I would be grateful if the Minister could say that it will be looked at in the future and there will be an effort to get all judicial appointments into line.  Reducing the retirement age for the Judiciary would require that due notice is given because barristers and solicitors will have to have sufficient service for pension rights and so forth.</P>

      <P>I welcome the compromise the Minister was able to accept with regard to wearing wigs.  The Minister originally intended to ban the wearing of wigs heretofore worn or any other wig of a ceremonial type.  She acceded to an amendment which has the effect of making the wearing of wigs in court voluntary.  Under this section any barrister or solicitor appearing in court will be entitled to wear or not to wear a wig as he or she chooses.</P>
      <P>I support the various position papers adopted by the Bar Council on the wearing of wigs.  The Council supported the amendment relating to wigs for the following reasons.

      <P>In the hospital in which I work, a policy has developed of not wearing white coats unless this is necessary for certain procedures or for the safety of patients and doctors themselves.  This policy applies more to consultants than to junior doctors because the latter are more involved in the day-to-day practical application of treatment.  This policy has had the good effect of changing the &ldquo;them and us&rdquo; situation.  In clinics we conduct, if practical procedures are not carried out, many of my colleagues and I do not wear white coats.  We do not feel any lack of status or respect as a result.  Few doctors would say they feel they are in a more authoritarian position if they wear white coats.  Most doctors feel that it is their professional competence and not the wearing of white coats which is important.</P>
      <P>I am delighted that the Acting Chairman does not need to wear a wig. Future speakers of the House of Commons will find it difficult to wear wigs because of the control exercised by the present Speaker, Ms Betty Boothroyd of the long flowing locks.

Senator Henry referred to Betty Boothroyd and speculated whether future Speakers of the House of Commons will go back to wearing wigs.  It would depend on how concerned some of them might be about the lack of flowing locks, as wigs would cover the baldness.  Senator Lydon suggested that the wigs were used to cover dirty hair and fleas.  I do not mind that, as long as they keep their fleas to themselves. Section 49 states that a barrister or a solicitor when appearing in any court shall not be required to wear a wig.  They do not have to wear a wig if they do not want to.</P>

      <P>I welcome this section because it enables the Master of the High Court to award interest pursuant to the Courts Act, 1981.  As practitioners are aware, this is a great improvement.  Frequently, when one obtained a judgment for a liquidated sum in the master's court or in the office of the High Court, one could not be awarded interest because it was a judicial function which had to be awarded by a judge.  This makes it possible for somebody who is trying to recover a debt or a liquidated sum to get an award for the principal sum and an award of interest pursuant to the Courts Act, 1981, in the one proceeding.  This is a great advance. People always had trouble seeking to recover debts or liquidated sums, but now they will be able to get their money and their interest back.</P>

      <P>The Bill contains some good elements and some important things will occur as a result of its enactment.  However it could have been much improved but for the Christmas rush or whatever the reason for the urgency.  When we were on the Government side, the leader of the Opposition repeatedly said Bills should not be rushed through the House before recesses.  It does not make for good legislation.  Opposition Members of both Houses put forward constructive amendments which would have strengthened the Bill.</P>
      <P>I raised queries about aspects which may cause problems and it is a shame my suggestions were not taken on board.  The appointment of additional judges to try to deal with the backlog of cases is welcome, as is the proposal for training judges.  I spoke against my colleague's amendment regarding the temperament and suitability of candidates for judicial appointment.  The Bill is flawed and probably will not stand the test of time.</P>

If any deficiencies are <Col N="1618" /> found I hope they will be rectified in future legislation relating to the courts.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, is also taking this debate and I will be brief.  The Minister has had a long day and I do not wish to <Col N="1620" /> overly prolong it.  However, I make a case for Castleblaney Urban District Council.  Senator Gallagher is not in the House but she would be interested in associating herself with this debate.  This also applies to the public representatives from County Monaghan.  We held a meeting last week with the members of Castleblaney UDC and Dr. Collins and they put a strong case forward.</P>
      <P>They are aggrieved that the amount of the rates support grant notified to the council for next year is approximately £42,000.  The highest figure the council ever received was £74,000 in 1985.  If one considers the time span of ten years, that figure was almost twice the amount notified for next year.  This indicates why the members are aggrieved.  Various reasons were put forward as to why the figure is so low, one of which is that since 1985 the figures decreased on an annual basis up to a couple of years ago. Increases now are small and the council has difficulty maintaining services and modernising the town.</P>
      <P>Castleblaney is a small town with a population of approximately 2,000.  The Acting Chairman and the Minister of State are familiar with Castleblaney as they pass through it when driving to County Donegal and the North.  You, Sir, probably stop at the Glencarn.  You make it known that you are a Donegal man and get many people from that area calling in when they are passing through.</P>
      <P>Castleblaney is a small town which has suffered incredible job losses since the 1970s.  There was a bookbinding plant there in 1974 which lasted for a couple of years before folding.  There was also a furniture plant opposite the Glencarn which was a big employer, but it closed down in the 1980s.  No substantial industries have come to the town in the meantime and therefore the wage base is very low.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Castleblaney is situated just two and a half miles from the Border and three miles from Culloville in County Armagh. <Col N="1621" /> In the 1980s Castleblaney's business community suffered when townspeople wisely went North to buy their goods because price differentials were so great.  In the meantime the town has managed to scrape together £100,000 to match IFI funding for phase 1 of an urban renewal project on the main street.  It is now faced with trying to find funds to match phase 2 of the development, but there is truly no way they can come up with that money.  The case has been made as to why Castleblaney should have an increase in the rate support grant.  Castleblaney Urban District Council was meeting today to try to strike a rate for the third time in recent weeks.  They have a choice of putting a very big burden on the ratepayers in the form of charges or they can budget for a deficit, but they are very responsible people and do not want to do that.</P>
    <P>The Minister should give members of Castleblaney UDC and the townspeople some hope that the very small rate support grant, which is about half what it was ten years ago, will be substantially increased.  The townspeople should have an opportunity to use all the possibilities that have opened up to try and develop Castleblaney into a thriving town again. It will need a lot of work to achieve that. I look forward to the Minister's response.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Cotter for raising the matter and for affording me an opportunity to respond to it.  In the current year, total spending by all local authorities is estimated to amount to £1.86 billion.  This is divided between current spending of £1.2 billion and capital spending of £660 million. This is a very significant level of public expenditure by local authorities which is indicative of the wide range of services they provide to the public at large. There have been many calls for increased funds to be made available for local authority services and the Minister <Col N="1622" /> accepts there is a national desire to improve and expand the range of services. We must, however, be realistic about what can be accomplished within the resources available for these purposes.</P>
      <P>Current expenditure by local authorities of £1.2 billion is funded by way of £500 million in Exchequer grants and £700 million which is raised at local level through a variety of income sources, including rates and charges for services.  Many of the Government grants fund specific services such as provision of local authority housing and improvement and maintenance of non-national roads.  There is, in addition, the rate support grant, which amounts to £189 million this year.  This is a general purpose grant which local authorities can use at their discretion anywhere within their estimates.</P>
      <P>This year's rate support grant shows an increase of 2.5 per cent on the 1994 provision.  In so far as 1996 is concerned, a further increase of approximately 2.4 per cent was obtained and this has been passed on to all local authorities, including Castleblaney Urban District Council, which was notified of its allocation for next year on 1 December.  I should make the point that the level of the grant in recent years has generally increased at least in line with the annual rate of inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, I am sure, can understand the genuine demands for additional allocations to individual local authorities such as Castleblaney Urban District Council.  Equally, I am sure local authorities will appreciate that the Government has to strike a balance between expenditure and taxation, and the option to either take funds away from other services or to increase taxation. The Government's aim and policy is to achieve a fair allocation of the overall resources available and at the same time not to increase the overall level of taxation.  In present circumstances local authorities are receiving a <Col N="1623" /> fair and equitable share of available resources.</P>
    <P>In so far as Castleblaney Urban District Council is concerned, the Minister for the Environment is aware of the difficulties they are experiencing in keeping a tight rein on their finances.  We know that they are doing, and will continue to do, their utmost to manage and control their expenditure and at the same time maximise their efforts to increase their level of income.  We believe that the council is capable of managing its affairs in the context of the 1996 estimate which it has just today adopted, and within the resources that are available.  This may call for hard decisions on some issues which will have to be faced.  I regret that it is not possible for the Minister for the Environment to increase the council's allocation beyond the £42,400 already notified.</P>
    <P>On the question of local authority financing generally, I can assure this House that the Government is fully committed to working towards a solution to this difficult issue which has been with us for many years.  You will be aware that in line with a commitment given in the policy agreement <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> consultants have been engaged to undertake a professional study of local authority financing to establish how a fair, equitable and reasonable system of funding might be introduced.  This study commenced in July last and stage 1 is due to be completed within a month.  The study is considering existing and potential sources of income together with expenditure demands on local authorities.  This stage of the study will bring forward funding options to be examined in depth in stage 2, which, in turn, will be followed by a period of consultation with interested bodies.  Stage 2 will get underway as quickly as possible in 1996.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister and the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to put forward this motion:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to allow trade union dues as a tax expense similar to allowances given for employers for contributions to their professional bodies.</P>
      <P>This is a proposal that endeavours to establish equity between employers and employees.  Employers, rightly, have their contributions sent to IBEC as an expense allowance but their employees' contributions to their representative organisations or trade unions do not have the same allowance available to them.  This motion was recently adopted as the policy of the Irish Conference of Professional and Service Associations at its annual general meeting.</P>
      <P>It is a reasonable motion which I would ask the Government to consider seriously.  The people concerned are all PAYE workers who are worst hit for tax and have little control over their tax situation.  They never see the money they pay in tax, although they have received a considerable alleviation from this Government.</P>
      <P>This move would cost the Government very little and would ensure equity between trade union members and their employers in the area of contributions to their representative organisations.  It would also, in a small way, relieve the heavily burdened PAYE people from their tax burden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Currie) Austin Currie">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators will be aware that over the past numbers of years, Governments have been undertaking a programme of tax reform with a view to increasing competitiveness and growth, and thereby contributing to the maintenance and creation of sustainable employment.  The main concern has been to redistribute the burden of <Col N="1625" /> taxation between the different factors of production more in favour of labour. The primary focus has been on reducing the level of income tax while implementing base-broadening measures, especially in the areas of corporation, capital and indirect taxation, and also through restricting or limiting the availability of allowances and reliefs in the income tax area.</P>
      <P>Through this policy considerable progress has been made in improving the income tax system.  The top rate of income tax has been reduced from 58 per cent to 48 per cent, and the standard rate from 35 per cent to 27 per cent, thus reducing significantly the marginal tax rates for the majority of taxpayers. There has also been significant improvements in personal allowances and exemption limits, and in widening the standard band.  This policy, which has involved the restriction of discretionary allowances and reliefs, has been of benefit to all taxpayers, including trade union members.  A continuation of this approach is the appropriate method for achieving further improvements in income tax, rather than by introducing new allowances of reliefs for expenditures specific to individual groups.</P>
      <P>The Senator's suggestion relates primarily to the different rules applying to allowable expenses for tax purposes as between PAYE and self-employed or firms.  In summary, under the existing tax code in the case of schedule E taxpayers, mainly PAYE workers, expenses are deductible for tax purposes where the expense is &ldquo;wholly, exclusively and necessarily&rdquo; incurred &ldquo;in the performance of the duties of his/her office or employment&rdquo;.  In the case of schedule D taxpayers, that is the self-employed, and for corporation tax, expenses are usually deductible for tax purposes where the expenditure is &ldquo;laid out wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the trade or profession&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consequently, in the case of schedule E taxpayers, normal trade union dues <Col N="1626" /> are not tax deductible.  However, membership fees to certain professional associations could be tax deductible, but only where membership or affiliation is a requirement to practice in the profession or where it can be shown that the services provided by the association, extending beyond representation, are necessary for the person to perform the duties of their office or employment. Fees to such associations do not, in general, qualify for tax relief.  Making trade union dues tax deductible would, therefore, require a new provision in the income tax code.</P>
    <P>In the case of traders, both corporate and unincorporated, a subscription or levy paid to a trade protection or other trade association is, under case law, only a deductible expense to the payer if, and to the extent that, the trade association applies the contributions for the purpose which would permit the deduction if incurred by the contributing trader.  In practice, however, a trade association may sign an agreement with the Revenue Commissioners to pay tax on the excess of its receipts over allowable expenses.  Where an association signs such an agreement the whole of the subscriptions or levies paid by its members are treated as deductible expenses in the members' accounts.</P>
    <P>There are reckoned to be around 0.5 million trade union members in the country.  The processing of a relief for this number of taxpayers would add to the administrative workload in the tax system.  Furthermore, while the value of tax relief per individual would be small, as trade union dues are relatively low, the overall cost to the Exchequer would be substantial.  It should be borne in mind that the PAYE allowance, currently £800, was introduced in 1980 to compensate PAYE taxpayers from among other things, the more rigorous expenses rule applied to them as compared to the self-employed and employers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1627" /> It would also be difficult to introduce a tax relief restricted to trade unions as commonly understood.  Such a measure would undoubtedly give rise to demands from other taxpayers for similar type treatment, especially membership fees to other interest groups, which in equity would be hard to resist and which would further increase the cost to the Exchequer.  This loss of revenue would have to be found elsewhere if existing services are to be maintained.</P>
    <P>The extension of tax relief to individual items, such as trade union dues, introduces additional expenditure specific tax reliefs which is undesirable from a tax reform perspective.  For tax reform to be pursued on a consistent basis, it is necessary to maintain and extend the tax base and to focus resources on measures of general relief to taxpayers.</P>
    <P>This is what the Government is doing. It is the Government's policy to continue, within responsible budgetary parameters, the process of tax reform as an important element in overall strategy. <Col N="1628" /> The policy agreement for renewal sets out the Government's commitment to tax reform.  This policy is on the lines of the tax policy contained in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> The programme of renewal states that the Government will accelerate the reform of the tax system, in particular to relieve the tax and PRSI burden on those with low incomes and especially those with families.  Tax reform will favour the incentive to work, tackle the poverty trap, aim to reduce the tax wedge and encourage enterprise development and growth.  In the 1995 budget significant progress was made towards this goal, especially through increases in the personal allowances and exemption limits, widening the standard band and in introducing the new £50 per week PRSI-free allowance.  The Government hopes to consolidate and build on the 1995 budget in the next two.</P>
