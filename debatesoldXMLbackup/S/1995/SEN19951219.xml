      <P>I have notice from Senator McGennis that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to acquire the designated site in Blanchardstown for a regional technical college, in view of the Higher Education Authority recommendation that Blanchardstown be considered for a regional technical college and also the fact that the option on the site expires in June 1996.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Farrelly of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to consider the possibility of increasing the number of permanent gardaí in the Meath coastal area.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Cotter of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to examine the possibility of increasing the grant aided financial assistance which is made available to post-graduate students involved in research programmes in the various <Col N="1630" /> higher education colleges and universities.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator O'Sullivan of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health to reassess the means testing for disabled person's maintenance allowance payments, particularly where the spouse or partner is employed on a community employment scheme.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Social Welfare to change the eligibility criteria for payment of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance to non-regular dockers in Foynes Harbour, County Limerick.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senators McGennis's and Farrellys' matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take items 1, 2, 4 and 5.  The House will deal with the Second Stage of item 1 and, by agreement, there will be 20 minutes for the first speaker and ten minutes for each speaker thereafter.  Only the Second Stage of item 2 will be dealt with and again, by agreement, there will be 20 minutes for the first speaker and ten minutes for each speaker thereafter.  All Stages of item 4 will be taken and the debate will be open ended.  Item 5 will be taken without debate.</P>

      <P>In the light of yesterday's publication of crime statistics and the recent statement by the Garda Commissioner, I cannot understand why the Estimates do not provide for extra prison places. Will the Leader ensure that this House will have an opportunity, at the earliest date in the New Year, to debate the crime figures and the Estimates?  I know we will have a chance to debate them on Second Stage of the Appropriation Bill, 1995, tomorrow but this warrants more of a debate.  I know the Leader is concerned, but this is probably the first time ever that a Fine Gael-led Government could be described as being soft on crime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Leader happy with the Order of Business for today and tomorrow?  I presume he provided us with this timetable.  It seems that every Government does this coming up to Christmas: suddenly we get a rush of legislation that is rammed through.  I complained about this when Fianna Fáil was in Government, so &mdash; to use the good Fianna Fáil expression &mdash; in fairness &mdash; now I should complain about this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today we are dealing with the Commissioners of Public Works (Functions and Powers) Bill, 1995, Second Stage; the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1995, Second Stage; and the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, 1995, all stages. Tomorrow, however, we have the Harbours Bill, 1995, Report Stage; the Milk (Regulation of Supply) (Amendment) Bill, 1995, all Stages; the Appropriation Bill, 1995; the Commissioners of Public Works (Functions and Powers) Bill, 1995, remaining Stages; the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1995, remaining Stages and the morning's business if it is not concluded.  That is an enormous amount of work if we are to take it seriously, which we will not.  I will not take it seriously because this is such a rush; I will do my Christmas shopping <Col N="1632" /> tomorrow.  We should be more serious in the way we order the business of the House.  There are days when we do little then suddenly there is a glut of legislation at the last minute during Christmas week.  This is daft.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be grateful if the Leader would clarify the figure because there seems to be a lot of confusion on the matter.</P>
      <P>I was not in favour of debating Northern Ireland after the Taoiseach visited Downing Street and reached the agreement. However, in the light of subsequent events, it would be appropriate to debate that matter immediately after Christmas.  As regards what happened yesterday, it was notable that a politician of the standing of Dr. Joe Hendron should point the finger directly at the Provisional IRA as being the culprit to what can only be described as an execution.  We all hoped when the ceasefires were declared that we would never need to condemn a killing in this House.  It might be helpful from the point of view of the international body on decommissioning if the Seanad debated Northern Ireland because it might give it some ideas.  For those reasons, I ask the Leader for a debate on Northern Ireland immediately after Christmas.</P>

      <P>I am sure that the representations and work done by Senator Bohan and other Senators will be recognised when the debate takes place tonight.  We will have a debate on crime and justice early in the new session.  I gave that commitment and it will be honoured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not happy with the way business is being ordered for these two days.  At this time every year Departments suddenly discover technical and small pieces of legislation which they want passed before Christmas and we try to facilitate them.  It happened in the last régime.  I have made clear to the particular <Col N="1635" /> Departments my displeasure at what we are being asked to do and I will try to ensure it does not happen again. Some of the business for today and tomorrow is of a technical nature but we could have dealt with it three or four weeks ago.  Some Departments are particularly bad offenders in this regard. I am not happy and I agree with Senator Norris.</P>
    <P>It would be helpful to have a debate on Northern Ireland early in the new session.  I am sure everybody joins with Senator Dardis in total and outright condemnation and abhorrence of the execution style killing carried out in Belfast last night.  We all hoped that we would not have to stand in this House again to condemn any killings or murders in Northern Ireland.  The spate of punishment shootings must be condemned out of hand.</P>
    <P>I noted Senator Mullooly's point which ties in with Senator Wright's.  I do not know the details of the tribunal mentioned by Senator Henry.  However, I imagine that any rank ordering would be on the basis of the seriousness of the person concerned.  I will get the information for the Senator.  Senator Mulcahy raised the question of crime; I have already mentioned that there will be a debate on broadcasting early in the new session.  The question of piracy is serious; I do not have any proposals to debate it.</P>

    <Title>Commissioners of Public Works (Functions and Powers) Bill, 1995: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney) Avril Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the opportunity to come before you today to introduce this short Bill to provide a sound statutory basis for certain powers and functions traditionally exercised by the Commissioners of Public <Col N="1636" /> Works.  Senators will be aware that some of these have been called into question since the High Court judgment in the Howard <i>v</i>.  The Commissioners of Public Works case and about which I will speak further shortly.</P>
      <P>The other major issue covered by the Bill is the provision of the necessary power for the commissioners to give effect to a scheme to offer humanitarian assistance to a small number of people whose houses have been damaged beyond repair at reasonable cost or who have suffered long duration flooding during the exceptionally high floods of late 1994 and earlier this year.</P>
      <P>On the first issue the Attorney General has advised that the opportunity should now be taken to establish the general powers which the Commissioners of Public Works require in order to carry out their functions.  The commissioners are a statutory corporation, the kind of body which suffers from the drawback that it has no functions, powers or duties other than those which the statute or statutes setting it up confers upon it.  This problem is compounded by the fact that the commissioners did not come into existence for any one purpose and their functions have never been comprehensively set out.  They were simply given extra functions over the years as various Governments required them to carry out a variety of tasks.  The assumption always was that the commissioners had sufficient legal powers to carry out these functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the Attorney General advises that this has serious legal and practical consequences.  The practical consequence is that to discover whether the commissioners have power to carry out a specific task it is necessary to go through almost 200 statutes, the earliest of which is 150 years old.  The legal drawback is that powers conferred in one statute may be exercisable only for the purposes listed in that statute and the fact that several statutes give similar powers may not necessarily mean that the commissioners have any general power to act in a particular way.  To put <Col N="1637" /> it simply the problem is that the full range of functions which the Government requires the commissioners to perform have not been set out in legislation and the powers which it needs to carry out these functions have not been conferred.</P>
    <P>This difficulty was highlighted in the recent case of Howard <i>v</i>.  The Commissioners of Public Works which arose from the Mullaghmore visitor centre controversy.  The House will recall that the High Court found that the Commissioners of Public Works had no general powers to carry out construction works.  The net effect of this judgment was that they did not have powers to carry out the general building, construction, maintenance and supplies functions which had been such a large part of their work for decades.  This immediate problem was resolved with the passing of the State Authorities (Development and Management) Act, 1993.</P>
    <P>The strict interpretation of the powers by the High Court in the Howard case and problems which have arisen with other specific cases since then have led the Attorney General to advise that the only way to avoid further legal problems is to set out in legislation the functions of the commissioners and the powers which are required to carry them out.  This is the only way to achieve certainty and to avoid doubt over their legal powers to carry out their work. That is why we are now taking the opportunity to do so in the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>It is important that the House should know that it is not the case that nothing was being done to clear up these legal doubts.  The commissioners and the Attorney General's Office had, in fact, been working over the past several months to see how these legal uncertainties could best be tackled.  Both had finally concluded that new legislation would be necessary and work on this had already begun.  Obviously it now makes sense to combine this with the emergency legislation which is necessary <Col N="1638" /> in any case to allow the humanitarian relief scheme to be implemented. I would like to make absolutely clear to the House that this Bill does not give any expanded authority to the commissioners with the exception of that for the administration of the humanitarian scheme.  It merely lists the functions of the commissioners and removes any doubt in relation to powers to carry these out.  There are many areas where there is no doubt with regard to the commissioners' powers.  For example, the Shannon Navigation Act, the Canals Act, the State Property Act and many other enactments provide specific powers in specific areas.  The Bill before the House does not interfere with, or substitute for, any of these specific provisions but merely removes doubt in areas which are not specifically covered at present.  The Bill also requires that the commissioners can act in the exercise of these powers only with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  Thus, there is no question of their being given powers and allowed to do as they wish as free agents.  They can only exercise their powers with the consent of the Minister for Finance and subject to the provision of funds in the Vote for the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>Before discussing the main provisions in the Bill, I would like to take the opportunity to speak on the general issue of flooding and the efforts of the Government to deal with the matter during the past year.  Members will be aware that I had already agreed to a request from the Leader of the House to make a statement on that matter and the time seems appropriate, as one of the main aims of the Bill is to legalise the administration of the humanitarian aid scheme which arises as a direct result of flooding.  Members will also recall that, at the end of last year and in the early part of this year, many areas were subject to exceptionally severe flooding.  This was the subject of extensive debate in both Houses on a number of occasions during the year.  In the worst affected areas, the flood waters rose with very little warning and <Col N="1639" /> remained at a high level in some places for long periods &mdash; several months in the most extreme areas.  Consequently, there are a number of home owners who have been so severely traumatised by their experience that they simply cannot face the prospect of a recurrence.</P>
    <P>It is hardly necessary for me to restate the position that the immediate cause of the flooding in the periods in question was the cumulative effect of the exceptionally heavy rainfall which occurred in the preceding months.  In some areas, rainfall was more than twice the normal level for the period.  The flooding and the problems associated with it were extensively reported on, not least in this House.  The exceptional problems in the south Galway area were the main focus of publicity but severe conditions were also experienced in many other parts of the country, specifically in Counties Clare, Limerick, Tipperary, Carlow, Kilkenny, Cork, Kerry, Laois, Offaly, Roscommon, Wicklow and Wexford.</P>
    <P>As previously stated, the Government's response to the problem was both sympathetic and comprehensive.  It included the following measures, some of which I will elaborate on with particular reference to the progress made as they have a direct bearing on the reason behind the introduction of this legislation.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental committee was established, to be chaired by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance with responsibilities in the Office of Public Works, to co-ordinate the Government's response to the effects of bad weather and consider the response in future, similar, situations.</P>
    <P>A sum of £2 million was made available through the agricultural compensation scheme to assist farmers for losses of fodder, stock, etc. and farmyard relocation arising from the flooding. A further £4 million was made available for the repair of county roads. A sum of £750,000 was made available by way of humanitarian aid to be distributed by the Irish Red Cross Society to alleviate the hardship of flood victims. <Col N="1640" /> This was in addition to £398,000 which the EU had provided by way of humanitarian aid, which had also been distributed by the Irish Red Cross Society.  The latter was made available, in no small measure, due to the intervention of my predecessor, Deputy Jim Higgins.</P>
    <P>The Arterial Drainage (Amendment) Act, 1995 &mdash; initiated in this House &mdash; was passed, expanding the powers of the Commissioners of Public Works contained in the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  This enabled the commissioners to carry out relief schemes for the alleviation of localised flooding in addition to their powers to carry out major arterial schemes which dealt with problems in river catchment areas as a whole.</P>
    <P>Permission was also given to undertake a major multi-disciplinary investigation into the causes of flooding in the Gort-Ardrahan area of south Galway and parts of north Clare, which is currently ongoing and which, it is hoped, will make recommendations as to means of dealing with these problems in the future.</P>
    <P>The Army, Air Corps, the fire service, other local authority services and health boards provided considerable emergency assistance to distressed persons in the flooded areas.  The Commissioners of Public Works established an emergency co-ordination centre or one-stop shop in Gort which was staffed by representatives of the Western Health Board, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Galway County Council, the Irish Red Cross Society and the Office of Public Works itself.  More than 500 callers to this facility were assisted in relation to claims for compensation, rehousing and humanitarian aid.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, I would now like to comment on progress made under some of the principal items to which I have just alluded.  First, the outcome of the Red Cross Society's distribution of the humanitarian aid justifies fully the decision taken earlier to route the funds in question through that organisation. The criteria used by the society to determine <Col N="1641" /> the most appropriate apportionment of the funds available were death, personal injury, damage to houses and loss of income.  Each applicant was assessed on an individual basis taking into account their financial circumstances prior to the flooding, their situation as a result of it and their overall ability to help themselves in overcoming the effects of the crisis.  Where necessary, officers of the society or experienced Red Cross volunteers checked details of the claims by visiting applicants in their homes.  The society was also in a position to ascertain information in relation to the insurance status in respect of a considerable number of claims.</P>
    <P>I should point out that the society rightly regards the precise details of individual claims as confidential between them and the applicants.  I would also like to stress that while the original EU aid made available through the society made a valuable contribution, it did not reflect in full the hardship and distress suffered by many applicants.  It was decided, in the circumstances, that the interdepartmental committee should examine and report, as a matter of urgency, on the possibility of Exchequer funding being made available this year to provide additional humanitarian relief, taking account of the need to ensure that relief through the Red Cross Society, from the EU, and through the supplementary welfare allowance system were elements in a coherent and cost effective programme involving acceptable Exchequer cost. The Government further decided that the extent and scale of that funding should be assessed.</P>
    <P>It was against this background that, in conjunction with the Minister for Finance, I reported to Government in July 1995 that an additional £750,000 should be made available.  This followed extensive consultation with the society and officials of the Office of Public Works and the invitation through the press and local radio stations for the submission of applications for assistance.  This amount was considered by the society to be <Col N="1642" /> adequate to enable them to put those who applied to them for assistance reasonably close to the situation they were in before flooding occurred and the amounts to be paid would take into account assistance which was available from other sources such as insurance.</P>
    <P>The funding proposed would enable the society to make payments to a number of people who sought assistance under the earlier EU package but could not be assisted because of the limited funds available; to pay additional amounts to applicants who received payment which fell far short of their real losses and to deal with a number of claims which were received after the deadline for application for EU aid and were ruled technically ineligible.  Most of these late claims were forwarded to the society through third parties such as Departments and public representatives and, while there may be some dissatisfaction still among some victims that the aid will not compensate them adequately under headings such as devaluation of property, I believe it is seen as reasonable by most claimants and independent observers.</P>
    <P>The second item on which I would like to elaborate is the works proposed under the Arterial Drainage (Amendment) Act, 1995.  The House will appreciate that there must be coupled with the various relief and humanitarian aid schemes a programme of physical works designed to combat the recurrence in the future of the extensive flooding which has occurred all too frequently in Ireland.  During the debate on the Arterial Drainage (Amendment) Bill, 1995, which took place earlier this year and resulted in its passage into law in July last, many references were made to the extensive programme of works already completed by the Commissioners of Public Works under earlier legislation and their immediate plans for a programme of localised flood relief words in a number of selected priority areas.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the major investigation being undertaken into the possibility of ameliorating conditions in the <Col N="1643" /> Gort-Ardrahan area of south Galway and parts of north Clare.  This investigation, costing £750,000, is well under way and the consultants have submitted a preliminary report.  The report has been discussed at a public meeting in Gort and with the IFA and the South Galway Flooded Victims Action Group as well as being studied in detail by the technical officials in my Department. These bodies have also received copies of the report.  The report outlines some conceptual approaches to solving the problem and work will continue during 1996 to develop these solutions further. A final report is expected in early 1997.</P>
    <P>A scheme of works has already been undertaken in the Belclare area of Tuam, County Galway.  A start has also been made on the preparation of proposals for schemes in no fewer than eight other areas.  I will deal with them in alphabetical order.  In the case of Carlow, the preliminary design and report of the consultants has just been received.  Cost benefit analysis and environmental impact statements have also been commissioned and these reports should be available in mid 1996. Remedial works are expected to commence later in 1996.  Environmental impact statements appear to take a lot of time but they cannot be completed until after the spring period because of matters such flora, fauna, birds and so forth.  We must await the completion of the reports and it is mandatory that they be carried out.  I am anxious to get on with the work but the reports are mandatory requirements.  The current status of Cappamore and Newport, County Tipperary, is somewhat similar to that of Carlow.</P>
    <P>In Duleek, County Meath, a preliminary design has been completed and cost benefit analysis and environmental impact statements should also be available in 1996.  In Dunmanway, County Cork, a number of options or alternatives are under consideration and will continue to be in the context of the environmental impact statement which is expected in 1996.  The report on the <Col N="1644" /> cost benefit analysis of the various options is expected also in 1996. The design of a scheme for the relief of flooding in Gort town, County Galway, has been completed.  This is being considered separately from the overall study of the Gort-Ardrahan area of the south of the county.  The results of the cost benefit analysis of the scheme are due shortly while the environmental impact statement should be available early in the new year.  A scheme for Six-milebridge, County Clare, has also been prepared while the report on the cost benefit analysis and the environmental impact statement are expected to be available this week.  This is the most advanced scheme, other than Belclare, and is expected to commence in the spring of 1996.</P>
    <P>The preliminary report on the proposals for Kilkenny city is due in February 1996.  The cost benefit report and environmental impact statement will take some time longer to complete.  At Williamstown, County Galway, a number of options for flood relief are being considered in the context of the environmental implications of each.  A cost benefit analysis is also being carried out and the results are due shortly.</P>
    <P>Every effort is being made to ensure the early completion of the design process in each of the areas listed so that the necessary sanctions can be sought to initiate the next stages, that is, public exhibition and the preparation of contract documentation should schemes evolve which meet the necessary economic and environmental considerations. Until such time as this stage is reached, I cannot say precisely when works will commence.  I hope that all qualifying schemes will be in progress during 1996.</P>
    <P>In my preceding remarks I have dealt solely with the priority programme.  I am aware from all that has been said on this subject in the past that there are many other areas which will require consideration and action.  In this connection it is the intention as soon as all the relevant data have been collected to review the situation in relation to some of these.  This should enable the setting <Col N="1645" /> up of a national priority programme with a view to carrying out future schemes in the light of conditions prevailing from time to time and in the context of the resources available for works of this nature.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the provisions of the Bill, I turn now to the second element of the humanitarian aid scheme, that relating to home relocation. On 26 July Dáil Éireann passed a Vote, designated Vote 46, to provide for expenditure to defray the costs of various flood relief measures, including the allocation of £750,000 for home relocation assistance.  This, too, we have just recently been advised, requires the passage of legislation to give a statutory footing to the scheme since devised.  At this stage I would like to outline in general terms the main provisions of the scheme under which, following extensive investigation and consultation with public representatives and with representative bodies such as the IFA and South Galway Flooded Victims Action Group, the Commissioners of Public Works are now ready, subject to the passage of this Bill, to deal individually with applications received for assistance.</P>
    <P>The scheme itself is simple and straightforward.  Anyone who can show to the satisfaction of the commissioners that the house in which they resided was damaged beyond repair at reasonable cost by flooding at the end of 1994 and early 1995 or suffered flooding for an extended period, that is, in excess of three weeks, will be eligible for assistance, provided no flood relief scheme that would protect the property has been undertaken or is planned within a reasonable period, approximately 12 months.</P>
    <P>Householders who are eligible for assistance will have the option of having a house constructed on a site to be provided by them, the cost of both to a reasonable level will be borne by the State, construction would be by the local authority acting as agent of the Commissioners of Public Works or <Col N="1646" /> receiving financial assistance to enable them to relocate themselves.</P>
    <P>Under both options it will normally be a condition that benefiting householders demolish their existing house, and any insurance compensation received, less reasonable loss adjusters' fees, in respect of structural damage to the property will be offset against any financial assistance payable.  The scheme is being offered in a humanitarian context and the intention is that beneficiaries will be owner/occupiers who fulfil the qualifying criteria.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that householders will be required to covenant with the commissioners to demolish the existing house to the latter's satisfaction within a reasonable period, failing which the commissioners would have a legal right to undertake the demolition.  Some of the amount payable would be retained to ensure fulfilment of this condition. The householder will be permitted to retain the site and any salvage recovered.</P>
    <P>Applicants for assistance under the scheme will be required to sign a form authorising insurance companies to furnish the commissioners with any information they possess in relation to the insurance position in respect of their properties.</P>
    <P>An appropriate monetary value based on local authority housing which, together with appropriate allowances for purchase of site and fees, will form the basis of any offers of assistance to those applicants who seek that option. It is anticipated that most applicants will choose the financial option.  It is expected that applicants will incur legal fees in connection with the purchase of a site, completion of contracts, etc. and other professional fees in respect of the design and construction of their new houses.  They will also incur costs associated with the demolition of their existing houses and site clearance.  An allowance will be included in the scheme in respect of all such costs.  It is not proposed to seek recovery of any costs incurred by the State arising from the implementation of the scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1647" /> I now turn to the specific provisions of the Commissioners of Public Works (Functions and Powers) Bill, 1995, which are drafted to give a sound statutory basis to those matters referred to which do not already have an existing statutory authority.  Section 1 deals with the interpretation of some of the terms used in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 2 describes one of the main functions which the Commissioners of Public Works are required to carry out, specifically the purchasing, building, leasing and maintaining of accommodation and properties of all kinds, real and personal, for all Departments of State and other public bodies.  It also provides for the addition of a new function to which I have alluded in some depth in my earlier remarks, with particular reference to the administration of the humanitarian aid scheme, which we are advised requires specific statutory provision.</P>
    <P>Section 3 gives the commissioners the power to undertake its functions where such power is not already prescribed by statute.  This is the kernel of the problem highlighted by the Attorney General that while the commissioners have individual powers under specific enactments, these do not confer general powers to deal in property outside the scope of those enactments.</P>
    <P>Section 4 enables the commissioners to exercise its functions and powers for the provision of living accommodation under the humanitarian aid scheme by arrangement with a housing authority which would act as their agent.</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals further with the interpretation of the Bill, specifically in relation to references to land which have particular meaning defined in local government legislation.  Section 6 is a general provision in relation to the funding of the functions carried out under the earlier sections.  Section 7 contains the short title.</P>
    <P>I will be introducing a number of largely technical amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage.  The amendments will correct a number of omissions from <Col N="1648" /> the Bill as printed.  The Bill has been drafted, printed and brought to this House in a short period and I regret that, in the process, some amendments and redrafting to the text of the Bill by the parliamentary draftsman were omitted from the text which was sent to the printers.  I hope in the circumstances the House will understand the difficulties that arose and will accommodate the amendments on Committee Stage.  As I will deal with these amendments in some detail on Committee Stage, I will now outline what they are.</P>
    <P>I will be proposing that a definition of development be added to section 1.  The definition will be the same as that in the State Authorities (Development and Management) Act, 1993.  I will also be proposing to add the words &ldquo;and be deemed always to have had&rdquo; in a number of sections.  As I explained earlier, this Bill is intended to give legal certainty to what exactly are the powers of the Commissioners of Public Works.  It underpins the powers which the commissioners have traditionally exercised. The effect of this proposed amendment would be to validate actions taken by the commissioners in good faith over the years.</P>
    <P>Section 3 recites what the powers of the commissioners shall be on passing of this legislation.  The parliamentary draftsman has advised on reflection that the wording of the section should be recast.  The change does not, however, materially alter the extent of the powers as already outlined.</P>
    <P>I thank the House for its speedy response to the urgency in having this important legislation introduced.  I look forward to the co-operation of all in facilitating its early passage into law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Minister of our co-operation in dealing with this issue as speedily and efficiently as possible.  This is the first time I have heard a Minister admit that the Bill needs to be amended before it is debated on Second Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The failure of the Government to respond adequately to the floods crisis which devastated many homes and families <Col N="1649" /> and flooded thousands of acres at the end of 1994 and earlier this year is inexplicable.  The Government's ineptitude has resulted in continuing hardship and misery for many families who have been subjected to unsettling experiences over the past year.  The Government has shown complete disregard for the plight of many families who have been devastated, financially and otherwise, by the floods.</P>
    <P>On 1 March last year I introduced a Bill which tried to deal with this situation. I clearly pointed out the necessity to include a provision whereby compensation could be paid.  It was my party's view and that of many people in the House that in order for the commissioners to pay adequate compensation through humanitarian efforts, it would be necessary to include that in the legislation.  That is why section 5 of the Bill provided a mechanism by which compensation could be paid.  The Minister's predecessor, Deputy Jim Higgins, described that provision as inadequate. He stated it was unnecessary to include it in the legislation as the commissioners already had adequate powers and sufficient authority to deal with situations which might arise.  When he subsequently introduced his Bill around 16 May, we again pointed out on Second and Committee Stages that it was necessary to include a provision whereby the commissioners would be in a position to pay compensation.  We sought to amend the legislation but the former Minister did not accept the proposal.</P>
    <P>He did not accept the original Bill or the amendments put down to his Bill but, a year later, the Minister of State is in the House &mdash; he is welcome and I wish him well &mdash; introducing further legislation.  It is most frustrating for Members but particularly frustrating for those who suffered the hardship and misery of flooded homes and land for a long period, to find that despite all the discussion which took place&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The deficiencies in the legislation mean that people continue to suffer hardship.  The Minister of State confused me with the figures he mentioned regarding humanitarian aid from the Irish Red Cross Society and aid from the EU and the Departments of the Environment and Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  In his reply, perhaps the Minister of State could indicate actual expenditure under the various subheads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I presume the Department of the Environment provided grants to local <Col N="1651" /> authorities to deal with the problems caused to roads.  The total figure is £4 million; perhaps the Minister of State could provide a breakdown in terms of the amounts counties received and whether all the money has been spent. There is still criticism in local areas that some of the damage to the road structure caused by the flooding has not yet been remedied.  This is particularly the case in areas of north County Glare, such as the Carran area, where some of the roads damaged by the floods were left in a derelict state.  Up to recently, some of the roads which suffered major damage had not been repaired.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Some have been substantially repaired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Some were repaired and I compliment the county council for the speedy way in which it dealt with some of the problems.  However, some major problems have not been addressed and a large amount of money is required to deal with them.  I ask the Minister of State to indicate how the money was expended and in which counties.  I am not certain how the funding from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry was spent and perhaps the Minister of State could indicate the position in that regard.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Irish Red Cross Society, its chairperson, Ms Una McGurk, and Mr. Des Kavanagh who were responsible for dealing with issues in the Galway area.  They dealt with a serious problem in a most humanitarian way.  While they would have done a better job if more finance had been at their disposal, there was general satisfaction that the amount of money available was dispensed fairly.  I am not aware of any problems in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The major deficiency of this Bill is that while the Minister of State has taken some powers to pay compensation to deal with the issues which arose when we discussed these matters previously, there is no mechanism to appeal decisions in that regard.  Where <Col N="1652" /> there was disagreement between the individual and the Commissioners of Public Works there should have been a mechanism whereby an appeal might be lodged so that the matter could be dealt with by a process of arbitration, as may occur with the acquisition of land by the commissioners, local authorities or harbour authorities.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has already indicated that the Bill is in need of technical adjustments.  In making those technical adjustments he might avail of the opportunity to consider putting in place a system to deal with grievances that could not be resolved between the commissioners and the persons involved. This would be particularly relevant where dwellings are beyond repair and disagreement may arise about relocation and what was to become of the building being vacated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Complications may arise where the Commissioners of Public <Col N="1653" /> Works would compulsorily acquire the properties from which persons were to be relocated.  It might not be advantageous to have the buildings demolished and in such cases, it might be difficult to get agreement between the persons to be relocated and the commissioners.</P>
      <P>We should put in place a mechanism whereby such disagreements can be dealt with, such as a tribunal or other independent body.  If the Minister of State has any ideas we would be prepared to examine them.  However, the issue must be dealt with.  If there is a disagreement there should be an independent body to consider the situation with a view to resolving it.</P>
      <P>Is the provision in this legislation to apply to dwelling houses only?  Families may have to be relocated from their homes and farms.  Are there sufficient powers to deal with properties and buildings other than domestic dwellings? It appears the commissioners would have certain powers in relation to local authorities and the provision of housing but, to my mind, the provision does not cover farm outhouses or slatted houses in the vicinity of the dwelling-house. Neither am I certain that this would include the Commissioners of Public Works becoming involved with private house owners in joint ventures to provide housing for people who would be relocated or finding houses for themselves.  It seems that the provision of accommodation will involve the commissioners working through the local authorities.  It may be necessary to have additional amendments to enable a private individual to negotiate with the commissioners for the provision of their private accommodation, excluding the local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities already have sufficient difficulty meeting their financial responsibilities in the matter of housing and this will be a further burden on them.  Perhaps the Minister of State would provide clarification about the financial mechanisms which will underpin the proposals in this legislation.  Will additional finances be provided to local <Col N="1654" /> authorities to deal with housing matters or is it envisaged that they will deal with these matters from their current housing allocations?  As the Minister will be aware, every local authority is under pressure to provide housing to meet their set down housing lists and this would be an additional burden which should be specifically covered in this Bill.</P>
    <P>We will not oppose the legislation, we will try to amend it to the best of our ability and co-operate with the Minister of State in finally coming to grips with this problem.  However, the whole episode has been badly handled up to now by the Government whose ineptitude has been appalling.  The result is that those who have suffered the misery and hardship of flooding for over a year still do not know where they stand.  This legislation has yet to go to the other House, which is in recess until well into the New Year.</P>
    <P>The most appalling aspect concerns the Minister of State's list of several projects which are at design stage, where environmental impact assessments are taking place or where further studies are to be undertaken.  We did not receive one firm date for the commencement of any project other than that in Sixmilebridge which we hope will begin in early spring.  I ask the Minister to give more specific dates for when projects will start and when it is hoped they will be completed so that we can at least say when the legislation is passed that there is some prospect in the near future of having these projects dealt with to the satisfaction of the people who have been upset about what has happened in the last year.</P>
    <P>At the start of this episode.  Ministers and Ministers of State made many visits to the constituencies to discuss these issues at local level.  I can assure the Minister of State that further ministerial visits in the north Glare and south Galway areas will not be welcome.  More definite action must be taken soon to pay people what has been promised to them for nearly a year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to Senator Daly one wonders where he was for the past five years.  From 1990 to 1994 serious flooding occurred in many places and Governments during that time did very little.  The Senator referred to ministerial visits to Glare and south Galway but, unfortunately, for the previous four years there were no ministerial visits, no Government response or Government reaction to a disastrous situation.  There has been flooding since 1990 but previous Governments failed abysmally to take any responsibility for it.  Senator Daly should jog his memory and reflect on the inaction of previous Administrations.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which will enable the Office of Public Works to do works and take specific action on relocation and the provision of humanitarian assistance to the victims of flooding.  He and his Department have acted promptly and comprehensively.  I compliment his predecessors, Deputy Hogan and Deputy Jim Higgins, on their response when they held office. The current Minister came from another Department but immediately grasped the nettle and quickly took on the problem.  The officials within the Office of Public Works have shown the ability to take positive and well thought out action in a crisis and good judgment in the priorities they have listed.  One wonders how any Senator could be critical of the work done, given the record of the previous Administration which did not respond to the crises of previous years.</P>

      <P>Works have been done on a number of roads in north Glare and many people are quite satisfied, contrary to what Senator Daly said. Many are also considering the option of relocation &mdash; some have made applications and others are contemplating that course of action.  They know this Government is responding to their problem and that they now have options which they did not have prior to 12 months ago when this Government came into office.</P>
      <P>Many people have faced serious and disastrous problems: they lost their homes and their livelihood was seriously impaired but the Government acted responsibly.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry immediately set up a scheme to provide fodder and assistance to help farmers feed their livestock which were in places to which they could not gain access.  In addition over £750,000 in humanitarian aid was provided, administered by the Red Cross.  I have yet to hear anyone who was compensated complaining about the level of compensation received.</P>
      <P>The Minister then introduced the arterial drainage scheme which gave the Office of Public Works the power to respond quickly to problems which arose.  I am pleased the Minister has chosen the Ogarney river in Sixmilebridge as one of the areas to receive immediate priority action.  I compliment him on setting down a schedule for that river and thank him and his officers in the Office of Public Works for the manner in which they have stayed with the schedule.  I hope that at about the beginning of March there will be machines in the Ogarney river and that the major problem in the river will be alleviated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a unique problem in the north Clare-Gort-south Galway area, with which the Minister is familiar, because of the topographical nature of its territory.  With the limestone topography it is especially difficult to establish <Col N="1657" /> the real cause of the flooding and the problems relating to it.  It is a unique situation and the response to it must be different.  That is why this Bill, which empowers the Minister to relocate people, will have specific significance to that area.  In that instance, I do not think it is within the scientific knowledge of the Office of Public Works to establish the real detail of locating the source of the flooding and it will take a considered and detailed study to find it.  I am delighted a study is being conducted, supported by the EU, to establish the source of that flooding.</P>

      <P>All that is wrong with Senator Daly is that he realises the people on the ground recognise that this Government has responded to this crisis while the previous Government closed its eyes and turned a deaf ear to their plight between 1990 and 1994.  It is now in Senator Daly's political interest to stir up discontent, if possible.  However, he is finding this difficult because the people realise this Government has acted in good faith and in an effective <Col N="1658" /> fashion, possibly too effective for Senator Daly and members of his party. I am delighted the House is dealing with this Bill before Christmas.  When all Stages are passed in this House, it will go to the Dáil and early in the new year, the Minister and his Department will be able to effect the type of works they require.  Officials have already undertaken some of the preliminary work in advance of the powers provided for them in this Bill.  They have already investigated many of the applications for relocation submitted to them.  In effect, they will be able to take immediate action when this Bill is passed, and that is extremely commendable.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that assistance will apply &ldquo;to people whose houses have been damaged beyond repair at reasonable cost or who have suffered long duration flooding during the exceptionally high floods of late 1994 and earlier this year&rdquo;.  I hope that when the Department examines those applications, everything will be taken into consideration.  The overall situation and the compensation already paid should be taken into account and applications made only because money was available should be treated in the manner they deserve.</P>
      <P>We must ensure those who are seriously affected and who have suffered the most serious long-term damage will get priority.  I know of people in some areas who applied for, and got, compensation and I am delighted for them.  However, I also know of people whose property may not have been as seriously damaged by the flooding but were nevertheless affected, who deliberately chose not to submit applications for compensation because they thought it might hinder or reduce the level of compensation their more seriously affected neighbours might secure.  All those matters should be considered when the applications are being examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has been extremely generous, sympathetic and understanding in its approach to date.  I hope detailed examination will be conducted of each case for relocation and priority <Col N="1659" /> given to the most serious.  Some houses in parts of north Glare and south Galway are unhabitable and these areas must be given priority.  It would be unwise to examine an application without having an overview of the type of compensation that has already been given to certain individuals by the Red Cross and I hope the Minister and his Department will take that into account when processing relocation applications.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Arterial Drainage Bill has been passed and at the way officials on the ground have responded. They have done a lot of the preliminary work and they will be ready to start early in the new year.  This response involved much work, commitment and operating beyond the normal call of duty for the staff in the Office of Public Works.  If that had not been done, we would not now be able to proceed with works on a number of schemes nor would we have been able to help the Red Cross to compensate people.</P>
    <P>I join with Senator Daly in complimenting the Red Cross, its chairman and Des Kavanagh, who operated its Gort office, for their work and the efficient and effective way in which they administered the funds available to them.  When there was surplus funding, they re-examined some of the more needy cases and provided additional compensation.  Everything done was above board and a sympathetic and understanding approach was adopted.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for the manner in which he met his commitments. He stuck to his guns and stood by his word.  To date, he and his Department have delivered effectively on every commitment they made, which is unusual in political and departmental life.  That can only happen when there is a will between a Minister and his officials to be effective and to respond positively.  We have evidenced that commitment over the past year and the people affected appreciate it.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister and his staff every success with their good work.  I am delighted this Bill which will ensure that <Col N="1660" /> no legal difficulties will arise on future work.  At a time when the Office of Public Works is under close scrutiny and some of its actions have been contested in the courts, it is wise to bring this Bill forward which will ensure that anything the Office of Public Works does in regard to this relocation package and humanitarian assistance cannot be contested legally.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister every success.  I thank him and his officials for the level of co-operation we in County Glare have received from his Department at all levels.  We appreciate the response and I want to convey that to the Minister and his Department.</P>

      <P>Like Senator Norris, I am sorry that Bills such as this come before the House so late, just before Christmas and that we have so little time to discuss them.  No Bill which involves the functions and powers of the Commissioners of Public Works could be considered trivial because these are the people who look after our architectural heritage.  I tried to find what changes there have been in the functions and powers of the Commissioners since the 1993 Bill; they do not seem to be great but perhaps I am not a suspicious person.</P>
      <P>This is a good day for a Bill dealing with the Office of Public Works to come before the Seanad.  Last night's RTÉ television programme, &ldquo;The Brightest Jewel&rdquo;, featured the magnificent work the Office of Public Works has done on Richard Turner's famous 19th century glasshouse curvilinear range in the Botanic Gardens.  The Office of Public Works certainly pushed the boat out there and must be commended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years an enormous effort has been put into taking care of our heritage and those responsible in the Office of Public Works must be praised <Col N="1661" /> for doing so.  I sometimes wonder how they manage to set their priorities in deciding what shall be acquired and which projects shall receive most funds. There is so much work to be done that it must be exceedingly difficult.  Most of the work the Office of Public Works has undertaken over the last few years has been of an exceptionally high standard. They have shown great courage in taking over some very important properties. So often it is only the Office of Public Works's faults that we point out, not their great successes.</P>
    <P>While I approve of repainting the gate of Leinster House, I was more than anxious about the stonework.  I do not know if it is because of the rain or if the stone has mellowed, but I cannot now find the bits that irritated me during the summer.  Obviously the Office of Public Works officials were right when they said the whole facade would blend in eventually.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works has done splendid work in places like Doneraile Court, Limerick Courthouse and Emo Court which was taken over recently.  I hope the refurbishment of courthouses around the country will be carefully supervised by the Office of Public Works.  The Minister for Justice has spent a considerable amount of money to improve facilities for those who work in the courts and those who have to appear before them.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works, however, has an extraordinarily difficult task trying to maintain the historical importance of buildings as well as incorporating modern facilities in them.  I dread to think how they will manage with Long-ford courthouse, which is a dilapidated Queen Anne period building.  It will have to be restored because it is very important; such buildings present a great challenge to the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>Sometimes it is hard to know what the Office of Public Works is going to do until the work is half way through. While I realise that the Office of Public Works's architects have great expertise and many have a great knowledge of <Col N="1662" /> history, the Office of Public Works has not yet employed an architectural historian. I know advice can be bought in but with such a lot of work to do it might be as well to recruit an architectural historian.  It is a pity this did not happen last week before the clamp down on recruiting new members to the Civil Service, but what harm?  Perhaps the Minister could apply for just one to give advice.</P>
    <P>Does the Office of Public Works ever discuss its plans with the architectural committee of the new Heritage Council? If that were done the Office of Public Works could avoid later criticism. They could at least say they tried to make public what they were doing so that people could comment on projects before they got under way.</P>
    <P>I visit Kilmainham and Dublin Castle quite a lot at the moment between the various forums.  Kilmainham was looked at from an historical perspective initially and a tremendous job was done there. The Office of Public Works had a really difficult job in Dublin Castle where great efforts were made to install a modern conference centre.  I have read Dr. Edward McParland's report on the work done in Dublin Castle which appeared in the <i>Irish Architect</i> of May/June 1989.  I find it difficult to follow why the additional gate was put in because I have never seen it open. There is a bridge into the upper courtyard which I was told was put there for access by fire engines.  However, I sincerely hope that if a fire breaks out, people in Dublin Castle will not depend on a fire engine entering at that point because it would be difficult to turn in the narrow street at that entrance.  If work on the Ship Street entrance had started earlier it might not have been necessary to place another entrance there, although it may have been done for a very good reason.</P>
    <P>Within the last few weeks splendid work has been done on laying cobblestones in the upper courtyard.  I am sure it was not done just because of President Clinton's visit since it had been planned long in advance of that.  All <Col N="1663" /> these efforts have left us with an area of well restored buildings in that part of Dublin.</P>
    <P>In general, Dr. McParland's criticisms concern constraints caused by trying to fit modern conference equipment into an old building while at the same time retaining its character.  Some of his criticisms of building work around arches and chipped stonework should be examined. It is essential that this work should be of the highest standard.</P>
    <P>Work is also continuing on Collins Barracks, although we know very little about what is happening to this important building.  The National Museum will be housed there and will be visited by an enormous number of Irish people and tourists.  Whatever is done there must be top class.  I realise there are financial constraints but other things should be looked at.  I may be wrong but coming along the quays the other day I had a horrible suspicion that I could see lift shafts coming out of the top of Collins Barracks.  This could end up being as great an irritation to me and to others as the lift shaft at the top of Dublin Corporation's offices behind Christchurch Cathedral.</P>
    <P>If one goes down from the Adelaide Hospital, where I work, towards Christ-church, one sees the bunker like building with a pillbox sticking out of it.  The bunker like building annoyed many people but I am sure that the architect, Sam Stephenson, felt it was the most appropriate type of building to put there at the time.  Having this water tower or pillbox on top of it is extremely irritating however.  I would not like to go along the quays and see lift shafts at the top of Collins Barracks.</P>
    <P>People should be careful with the appearance of these buildings, not just close up but also from a distance.  The more people can see building plans in advance of work commencing, the less trouble Office of Public Works architects will have later.  They will be able to say that people had time to look at the plans when they were sent to the Heritage Council's architectural committee <Col N="1664" /> and if they did not object at that time, that is not the Office of Public Works's problem.</P>
    <P>I also wish to speak about the Office of Public Works's work on ancient monuments.  This is an enormous area because we are well endowed with ancient monuments.  Sometimes I wonder how the Department decides how to allocate resources.  I have seen some areas where a great deal of money was spent.  A considerable amount of excavation work was done on a cemetery in Kells, County Kilkenny, approximately ten years ago but now the place is overgrown with weeds.  I am sure there are good reasons this happened because not every site can be maintained.  Perhaps it was felt that all that could be gained from an archaeological point of view had been achieved and it was decided to leave it.</P>
    <P>I sometimes wonder if European funds direct us; we spend money on large projects, which are important, but we should be careful that smaller projects are not forgotten and that we look at where our resources are going.  The Office of Public Works has built many visitors' centres, some of which were criticised.  Not a great deal of money is spent on archaeological or historical research.  Education is important, but is the Office of Public Works depending on the Department of Education or on local literary and historical bodies in this regard?</P>
    <P>It must be an enormous task to decide which monuments should be taken into State care.  I do not know who makes these policy decisions.  However, once buildings are taken into State care, there is an onus on us to see they are maintained because they are there not only for us to enjoy, but for posterity.  I have a criticism as regards decisions on whether to conserve or to restore ancient monuments.  Who makes these decisions?  The level of maintenance of a restored building is considerably higher than that of a conserved building.  A roof was put on Portumna Castle; everyone knows that the cost of maintaining <Col N="1665" /> a building once there is a roof on it &mdash; even if it is only a semi-detached house &mdash; is considerable.  Perhaps the castle ruin should have been left.  I do not believe we need to restore every ruined castle.  The restoration of Barryscourt is going ahead but it was not as much a ruin as some of the tower house type buildings which have been restored.</P>
    <P>We must accept that over the years considerable alterations have been made to these buildings and it is not essential to restore them to their original state.  Money is finite and we must be careful that vast amounts are not spent on high profile projects when others, less visible, could be kept going with just routine conservation work.</P>
    <P>If we decide to carry out restoration work great care is needed.  I am not an expert in this field but criticisms have been made about work on Ardfert Cathedral.  It has a 12th century facade with delicate Romanesque carvings, yet the sandstone has been repaired with white mortar.  I gather this is undesirable and that the white mortar will not weather in the same way as the stone on the facade of Leinster House.  Normally, the mortar is adjusted to blend in with the stone.  I visited cathedrals abroad and I noticed that if mortar is missing, it is filled in with lead rather than white mortar.  Our cathedrals are as good as those on the continent and we should treat them equally.  There is no architectural historian in the Office of Public Works and it is important that we get expert advice when undertaking such important work, although that is not to say that the office has been careless.</P>
    <P>It is nice to commend work done by the Office of Public Works because every mistake it makes is commented on.  The only visitors' centres we heard about were those which people did not like rather than the majority which blended into the background.  Castle-town House was handed over to the State but I gather that the proceedings for its acquisition have not taken place. We must be careful about this because the maintenance of such a building might fall between the previous and <Col N="1666" /> present owners.  If we decide to acquire a building, we must ensure that the bureaucracy is kept to the minimum so that maintenance may continue.</P>
    <P>It is good that the Office of Public Works is taking an interest in gardens. The work being done on the garden in the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, is very fine and the fountain is working.  There was hardly a fountain in this country up to 20 years ago.  They are important to streetscapes, particularly if we continue to have wonderful summers, and to gracious gardens which are being restored. The work which has been done on the little garden at the back of Dublin Castle looks very well.  The painting on the back of Dublin Castle has been criticised. However, if people do not like the colour of the paint because it does not fade after a certain length of time, it can easily be rectified.</P>
    <P>However, I am troubled by more permanent things, such as unsympathetic restoration or the demolition of a building without sufficient thought and care, perhaps because not enough money was available.  Such buildings should be made safe so that when more money is available at some future date work could be done on them.  Once we knock something down or dig something up, no more work can be done.</P>
    <P>It would be unkind if I did not refer to flooding which is a serious part of this Bill.  There was very serious flooding in certain areas.  I do not envy the Office of Public Works having to find out what caused it.  Although there was a considerable amount of rain, I am sure those turloughs filled and emptied before after similar amounts of rain. Senator Daly and Senator Taylor-Quinn spoke about a study on the hydrology of the area.  A serious question has arisen as to whether underground drains have been blocked by plastic used for silage and hay in the past couple of years.  If this is the case, this matter should be urgently addressed because it involves farm management.</P>
    <P>As a member of the Irish Red Cross, I was glad to hear that the distribution of aid to those seriously affected by the <Col N="1667" /> flooding was successful.  Like Senator Daly and Senator Taylor-Quinn, I would like to praise those involved in this hands on effort.  While money is given to the Red Cross, people must go out and assess the situation.  It is nice that a voluntary organised should be highly praised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimTownsend" hpid="Mr. Townsend Mr. Townsend">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Townsend</NameTxt>
      <P>I am from one of the areas worst affected by the flooding in late 1994 and early 1995.  I thank the Minister, Deputy Jim Higgins and former Minister of State, Deputy Hogan, for the speedy way they responded to the serious flooding in Carlow in late 1994 and early 1995 when the River Barrow overflowed.  They came to Carlow, saw the problem at first hand and promised assistance.  People often promise assistance but do not deliver.  While they might not have delivered, the present Minister has and I thank him for that.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Irish Red Cross for the speedy and efficient way they dealt with the applications for humanitarian aid.  In Carlow, 37 applicants received a total of £139,000.  While it went some way towards compensating them for the damage, I can tell the Minister that the people of Carlow are not looking for compensation.  They are looking to the long term and want works carried out to put an end to the flooding.  I support Senator Taylor-Quinn's remarks about the Red Cross.  I have not had a single complaint from the public about the way they were treated when they applied for humanitarian aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We often criticise the Office of Public Works and other public bodies but most of them have done a wonderful job. During the year the Office of Public Works carried out much needed repairs and other works on the canal, which is part of the Barrow system, at Webster's Lock, Lanigan's Lock and Milford Lock; they repaired the sluice gates at Milford.  The standard and quality of the stonework at Milford Lock adds to the general appearance of the area and I <Col N="1668" /> was delighted that was done during the past year.</P>
    <P>While we in Carlow are anxious that work should start as soon as possible, the last thing we want is a transference of a problem further down river to Leighlinbridge, Bagnelstown or Borris. In that respect we were glad consultants were appointed to examine the situation and report back and that was done without delay.  I am delighted to hear the report is now ready.</P>
    <P>He also said that there will have to be an environmental impact study and that will take some time to complete.  I understand the anxiety felt by the commissioners. After recent happenings in other places, they do not want to get into trouble but I do not want to see any unnecessary delays.  In light of the urgency of the situation, I ask the Minister to ensure that the cost analysis study takes place at the same time as the environmental impact study.</P>
    <P>While much progress has been made, the people of Carlow are getting anxious.  There is talk and there are reports in local newspapers about a postponement of work which might not now be done for generations.  It is all talk.  I was delighted to hear the Minister's speech today and I will have it circulated in Carlow as soon as possible. He said that a start has been made on the preparation of proposals for schemes in a number of areas.  He went on to say:</P>
    <P>In the case of Carlow, the preliminary design and report of the consultants has just been received.  Cost benefit analysis and environmental impact statements have also been commissioned and these reports should be available in mid 1996. Remedial works are expected to commence later in 1996.</P>
    <P>If the Minister was prepared to substitute &ldquo;will&rdquo; for &ldquo;are expected to&rdquo; I would be very happy.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to support the Bill and I hope the Minister of State will pursue this matter with the same urgency as his <Col N="1669" /> predecessors, Deputies Hogan and Higgins.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the last three or four weeks, I have again been raising the matter of flooding and asking the Leader of the House for the Government's response to the serious flooding problems experienced throughout 1995. I must have misunderstood him because I thought we would have some announcement for our local authorities and a response to the flooding problem this week.  Instead we are dealing with an amendment to legislation which in its passage through the House last summer this side of the House said was defective.</P>
      <P>This is the third occasion on which we have attempted to get this right.  If we are to go by the Minister's statement, we will have a fourth attempt.  He said the parliamentary draftsman's office still has some matters to clarify and he will introduce many amendments on Committee Stage.  Last March, following the worst flooding ever, Senator Daly introduced a Bill to address the flooding problems and amend the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  On 1 March 1995 the Minister said:</P>
      <P>The proposed provisions are unnecessary since there are already adequate provisions and mechanisms in existence for paying compensation where that is appropriate.</P>
      <P>In May 1995, when the Minister introduced his own Bill, my party proposed an amendment to deal with compensation. At that time the Minister and the Independents voted down the amendment. We are back today with an amendment to that Act.  This is the amendment which should have been accepted by the Minister in May.  We are attempting to redress a problem which was pointed out at that time. However, we will co-operate and do the best we can to get this legislation through the House in order to deal with the matters involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The flooding crisis started about this time last year and continued right into <Col N="1670" /> the spring.  There were many debates and the issue was raised here on many occasions during that period.  I am disappointed that there has been no response to deal with the main issue that came up during those debates, that is, the houses, villages and farms which were cut off during the flooding.  Not one pound of Government money has been allocated to Roscommon County Council to put one shovel of gravel or stone on any road to raise it.</P>
    <P>Roscommon County Council is at a serious financial loss having conducted major surveys and sent the reports to the Department of the Environment and the Government seeking funds.  We would have been far better off if we had spent the money trying to raise a few of the roads.  The Government has not responded and no money has come to Roscommon County Council to raise any road in 1995.  It was specifically provided that an allocation of money which came late in the year was to be used on stretches of road that had not been flooded.  The people in the valley of the Suck and the Shannon have had no response from this Government.  Those areas have always flooded to some extent through the years; they were cut off from anything from three to six weeks in many cases in spring of this year.  Farms were reduced from 30 acres to three or four acres.  In one area a 100 acre farm was reduced to between 70 and 80 acres.  I put this on the record last spring.  There has been no response to those situations.  The Minister visited an area called Bushfield earlier in the year but that area has received no money and has not been included in the list of schemes the Minister is talking about.</P>
    <P>Perhaps there is something wrong with Roscommon.  Perhaps our problem is that no Minister comes from the constituency. County Roscommon is the poor relation when the Government is addressing the flooding problems.  The people of Roscommon are up in arms. When they read the Official Report they will be taken aback that we are now dealing with a technical matter <Col N="1671" /> which was pointed out to the then Minister in March and again in May of 1995. Here we are, a few days before Christmas, trying to address an issue that should have been dealt with at that time.</P>
    <P>The area from Shannonbridge through the Clonown area, into the Taughmaconnell, Curraghboy, Dysart, Castleplunket and Castlerea areas was flooded right through the spring.  Whole villages and groups of villages were cut off.  Now, some 12 months later a further Bill is being proposed.  We do not, however, have any money.  No area of County Roscommon is included in any scheme for drainage purposes nor have we any money to address any flooded road in the county in 1995. Those are the hard facts the people in my area want addressed.  We want to see this Bill passed; obviously we want to see it brought to a conclusion, but the people in my county and adjoining counties are up in arms because no money has been provided to deal with the roads which were badly flooded in the spring of this year and the people suffered severe hardship.</P>
    <P>When cases were being made here by Senator Daly, Senator Fahey and myself, the difficult circumstances under which people in rural areas were living were not appreciated.  I could speak for a long time on this matter, but my time is nearly up.  I ask the Minister if areas of County Roscommon will be included under the amended Act.  Will areas be included for investigation and drainage? I mention in particular the areas of Bushfield-Brackloon and Castlerea-Castleplunket. I mention also the areas of Curraghboy, Dysart, and Taughmaconnell where very severe flooding has occurred and villages have been cut off. Where lack of maintenance causes flooding will maintenance be carried out in those areas of the Shannon and the Suck under the jurisdiction of the Office of Public Works?</P>
    <P>The other issue on which I would like some response from the Minister is whether we are going to get money to <Col N="1672" /> enable us to deal with roads that have been flooded.  Will money be provided by the Government to raise those roads?  The Minister stated that £4 million was provided for county roads. None of it came to my county.  I would like to know where it went and whether County Roscommon will get any funding in 1995.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been flooding for many years.  This is a technical Bill.  In 1973, when I was a relatively young fellow, I remember going to an after Mass meeting in Annaghduff in County Leitrim.  My father was speaking there; he was a candidate in that election as was the late Brian Lenihan.  They had a good debate outside the church. Annaghduff church is on a hill overlooking the Shannon.  Brian Lenihan said that day that if Fianna Fáil were returned to Government, the Shannon would be drained within the next couple of years.</P>
      <P>I have listened to Senator Finneran and I know the hardships and difficulties in parts of South Roscommon because of the Shannon basin and the difficulties there caused by flooding each year.  Unfortunately, no money has been provided since 1973 for works which need to be carried out.  This may be the start, and rather than being critical of the Government we should accept that funds are limited and that a genuine effort has been made to provide help for people in very great need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all remember last year when people had to move out of their homes because of flooding; the fact that the Government has made a financial commitment to try to alleviate those problems is to be welcomed.  Those problems will not be solved overnight but this is a start.  There are a number of difficulties to be tackled and when you take into consideration that people's livelihood and homes are in jeopardy because of flooding, the whole thing must be prioritised. The amount of financial assistance it would take to solve the flooding problem in the country is immense.  No Government, regardless of what political <Col N="1673" /> party is in power, would be able to provide the finances to do this work even over a number of years.  When Senator Daly was Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works he visited County Leitrim where we had flooding problems and he was up to his oxters in water.  The water is still there, unfortunately.</P>
    <P>This Government has made a start and a start is all we can thank them for. Funding for flooding should be ongoing. We prioritise areas where people's livelihood and houses are at risk due to flooding.  I can understand why certain areas have been prioritised in the Bill. If we in County Leitrim knew what to do with water we might be one of the wealthiest counties rather than one of the poorest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>We bottled some of it but Ballygowan got there before us.  The Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal was a tremendous development.  Some £35 million was spent to make the Shannon and Erne navigable through the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal, but due to the extension of the canal, a number of farmers are unable to farm for nine or ten months of the year.  When the Shannon navigation legislation was introduced, the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell drainage committee was abolished and since then nobody has taken responsibility for drainage works.  I do not know if this work comes under the auspices of the Office of Public Works or the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry; I assume it is the responsibility of the Office of Public Works and a statutory body must be established to tackle these difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week, I received a deputation of seven farmers who met the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, when he visited County Leitrim. They are concerned that they cannot gain access to their lands for nine to ten months of the year.  They are losing perhaps 70 to 80 per cent of their farming land due to flooding.  What criteria are <Col N="1674" /> laid down for their inclusion under this scheme?  I am not asking that this happen immediately, but as soon as possible. The situation is similar along the banks of the Shannon and other large rivers.  There is a need for a policy on flooding.  The Minister might state his Department's view on this matter.</P>
    <P>My main reason for contributing to the debate is to highlight the situation in my own county.  If a plan of action is initiated over a number of years, the difficulties experienced by many of the worst affected areas may be alleviated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  It is the first opportunity I have had to do so.  I congratulate him on the introduction of the legislation.</P>
      <P>This is the third Bill on arterial drainage to come before the House in the past year.  If this Bill does not alleviate the situation, we will all drown.  The first Bill was introduced by Senator Daly and section 5 contained provisions similar to those in the Bill before the House today.  I welcome the introduction of such measures.  During the debate on Senator Daly's Bill, Senator Quinn asked:</P>
      <P>What should the House do in the light of the Government's unwillingness to adopt this Bill?  Should we shelve the Bill and wait for the Government's Bill or should we pass the Bill in defiance of the Government knowing that the victory would be pretty empty in terms of getting something done about the problem?</P>
      <P>The Senator went on to state:</P>
      <P>It comes down to speed.  I went to the Minister today and put it to him how important I felt this matter was. He has told me the heads of the Bill went to the Cabinet yesterday, and were approved, and to the Parliamentary Draftsman today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinn also stated that the Minister gave a commitment that the Bill would be introduced before 31 May. The Bill was actually introduced in June and later passed.  The Arterial Drainage <Col N="1675" /> (Amendment) Act, 1995, contains deficiencies which necessitate the introduction of the Commissioners of Public of Works (Functions and Powers) Bill. Senator Daly's Bill made provisions which are included in the present legislation.</P>
    <P>Any debate in this House tends to become parochial.  The Minister stated that:</P>
    <P>A scheme of works has already been undertaken in the Belclare area of Tuam, County Galway.  A start has also been made on the preparation of proposals for schemes in no fewer than eight other areas.</P>
    <P>He referred to Carlow and stated that the current status of Cappamore and Newport, County Tipperary, is similar to that of Carlow.  Cappamore and Newport are situated in the Mulcair catchment area.  I received a communication from the Mulcair Drainage Society Limited in October which states:</P>
    <P>Our Committee is extremely annoyed at the patchwork that is being done on the Mulcair and what we hear is being planned as flood relief for the area &mdash; building banks and raising roads.  We hear that this was done in Galway and worsened the flooding for others so much so that the real job had to be done in the end.</P>
    <P>There is only one way to do the Mulcair and that is to start at the mouth of the river and work up lowering the water table as one goes.  The money would be well spent and the job would last forever.</P>
    <P>We have located the ideal machine to do this work and it could be done quickly and economically.</P>
    <P>We have calculated the saving on Dairying using Co-ops, Moorepark estimates and statistics to help in the calculation and found it to be an annual saving of £4,118,398.</P>
    <P>I have now fully calculated the stores, beef and other cattle losses based on figures of increased costs <Col N="1676" /> due to flooding by Teagasc grange. The total saving in this sector amounts to £1,598,376.</P>
    <P>This makes a total of £5,716,774 per year SAVING if the Mulcair Flood Relief Scheme were to go ahead and give us farmers a water outlet.</P>
    <P>This is only the monetary saving but we must add the following:</P>
    <P>1.  The human misery suffered by the people of the area due to near drownings, flooded houses, roads and business premises and maybe worse the terror and threat of a bank burst.</P>
    <P>2.  Acceleration of the flight from the land.</P>
    <P>3.  Prevention of small industry development so essential to rural development.</P>
    <P>4.  The reduction of house valuation.</P>
    <P>5.  CIE can't carry out their safety plans for the area due to the threat of Mulcair floods.  This is surely a human right.</P>
    <P>6.  The increase in human health problems due to damp conditions.</P>
    <P>A saving of over £5.7 million per year makes the Mulcair Flood Relief Scheme extremely viable from a monetary, rural development and human health and suffering point of view. We ask you to help us to get the job done economically and efficiently and stop the patchwork which will only make matters worse in the long term and be a total waste of money.</P>
    <P>What is against doing the Flood Relief Scheme?  If it was done straight after the Maigue as promised it would have cost less, rejuvenated the rural area and eliminated the intolerable suffering that is being experienced.</P>
    <P>What are the Minister's plans for the Mulcair and other areas under the flood relief programme?  The purpose of the Bill is to introduce the flood relief programme and provide compensation.  The situation in the catchment area of the <Col N="1677" /> Mulcair &mdash; east Limerick and west Tipperary &mdash; is intolerable.  The area is neglected and I appeal to the Minister to ensure that it will be one of his priorities under the flood relief programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not obstruct or delay the passage of the Bill.  Most of the issues under discussion today formed part of the debate on the Arterial Drainage (Amendment) Act, 1995, earlier in the year.</P>
      <P>The Bill before the House does not confer any extra powers to the commissioners, it merely lists their functions. The Arterial Drainage (Amendment) Act, 1995, was initiated in this House by the Minister of State's predecessor, Deputy Jim Higgins.  Many Members complimented Senator Daly on the work he did in relation to that Act and his own earlier arterial drainage Bill.  During the debate on Senator Daly's Bill, Deputy Higgins gave a commitment that he would initiate the Arterial Drainage (Amendment) Bill, 1995, in this House.  The Bill was duly initiated in this House in June of this year.  The work in relation to arterial drainage has been completed.  We are concerned now with listing the functions of the commissioners.  The Minister of State referred to obstructions that have arisen in relation to the humanitarian aid scheme for rehousing families.  We are discussing the functions of the commissioners in this regard.</P>
      <P>Senator Finneran was right when he said that the issue which is central to the debate was that these areas have flooded down the years.  All the areas we are speaking about have flooded year after year.  If the weather had not been so good this year I have no doubt we would be back here again making the same speeches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must compliment this Government, the Minister of State's predecessor, Minister of State, Deputy Jim Higgins, and Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, because this is the first Government to tackle this problem and to give a commitment to put structures and finances <Col N="1678" /> in place to alleviate the problems of flooding.</P>
    <P>We are here to legislate for the functions which are being given to the Commissioners of Public Works.  I am delighted we are making these provisions because the quicker we put this Bill into law, the sooner the work will be carried out and the people in need of aid will receive it.</P>
    <P>We have all spoken previously on this matter.  I too could highlight areas in County Mayo which have been adversely affected by flooding but this is a start, and we must start somewhere. This Government is committed to this issue and I am delighted with that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the legislation before us.  However, it is unsatisfactory to have to deal with Bills which come before us late in a session.  If Bills do not get adequate consideration &mdash; and I believe we will not give this Bill a great deal of consideration, even though I accept the need for it and it is brief &mdash; it can lead to errors and, frequently, we find ourselves returning later to rectify those errors.  The Minister's reference to the amendments he will introduce on Committee Stage would support that view.</P>
      <P>I often wonder why it can take so long for a Bill to come before the House. Bills are subject to careful scrutiny but in spite of that, when they come before us we find they need to be amended.  It is unsatisfactory that we do not have the amendments before us as we debate Second Stage because it erodes our ability to scrutinise the Bill in the way that is expected of us as legislators. There are many of precedents to support the view that legislation has been amended here for the better.  Having said that, I accept the need for the Bill. It should go through quickly and it would not be my intention to obstruct it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Townsend referred to the River Barrow.  I note he intended to circulated his speech in Carlow and I <Col N="1679" /> assume it will be of major benefit to the people of Carlow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>What about Kilkenny?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps he will flood his speech down the River Barrow that it may be collected at points along the river.</P>
      <P>We must recognise and accept that some of these natural disasters occur and preventing them is outside the Government's scope.  For example, the Barrow by its nature is a river which has a small fall from its source to the sea which, irrespective of how well it is maintained, will lead to flooding.  Having said that when an incident occurs there is a responsibility on the local authority and the State to do everything they can to alleviate hardship.  Any Government of whatever complexion would take those duties seriously.</P>
      <P>The need for an environmental impact study was raised.  I believe it is important that such a study be undertaken because we are dealing with a sensitive and unique habitat along a river.  There have been far too many instances in the past where we have had the canalisation &mdash; if I may use the word &mdash; of midland rivers, in particular, where spoil was heaped on the banks and the habitat was destroyed.  I do not see anything inconsistent in the need to protect the habitat with the need to prevent flooding; the two things can be done hand in hand.  Fortunately, we are coming to a point where the Office of Public Works takes those responsibilities seriously and is sensitive to the habitat, flora and the potential for damage where things are done without a proper study and due consideration.  I support the need for an environmental impact study; it does not have to delay works unnecessarily.  Earlier legislation empowered the Minister to take the necessary action if it is required urgently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Something which strikes me as fundamentally contradictory is that, on the one hand, we have put a lot of emphasis <Col N="1680" /> on the tourism potential of our waterways &mdash; the River Barrow would be a classic example; it is where not only an angling resource but it is also a boating resource &mdash; and, on the other, in some circumstances we have a disregard for that quality which confers the tourism benefit.  That is something about which we must be careful.</P>
    <P>There are stretches of the River Barrow where there is still spoil heaped high.  That is wrong.  It is wrong that the State enters lands, undertakes certain works and does not restore the land. That is something which, hopefully, has been consigned to the past and we will now take a more sensitive approach.</P>
    <P>The difficulty is that Bills of this nature do not solve the hardship, and there has been significant hardship in certain cases.  I am familiar with the circumstances in Gort.  I know the people who were protesting &mdash; if I may use that word.  The group who came together were dissatisfied with what took place at that time and subsequently.  As I recall from the correspondence I saw, the Irish Red Cross Society was the only agency to which that group was complimentary; they were pretty critical of all and sundry. It reminds me of the picture of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, afloat on the flood-waters of Gort like Captain Bligh on the bridge of the <i>Bounty</i>.  That looks well on television but it does not do anything for the people affected by flooding.</P>
    <P>Provision was made in the budget for assistance to farmers and this was represented as a global solution to the problem but when you read the words carefully you see it was assistance for loss of livestock and loss of fodder.  That is a much more restricted form of assistance than had been represented when it was suggested that people who had suffered other types of loss would be looked after.  Then there is the issue of people who were displaced from their homes.  As far as I can recall from listening to the debate, there were some disparaging remarks made about people who had been displaced from their homes as if, in some sense, they were <Col N="1681" /> agents of their own folly.  That is not the case.  I do not think the Minister, to be fair to him, would suggest that.  He realises that people who have been thrown out of their homes because of the flooding need assistance and support, and that is what is being done.</P>
    <P>I was rather amused by Senator Henry's reference to the thing she saw sticking out of the roof of Collins Barracks. I wondered if Ireland had decided to introduce its own nuclear deterrent or if it was a launching pad for an Irish satellite. Perhaps it was put up for Christmas.  In the National Heritage Council legislation and other legislation we have legislated for what must be done to protect our buildings and our environment.</P>
    <P>A Bill which deals with wildlife is also due to be introduced and I look forward to that.  However, I do not intend to stray into those areas now.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister.  The Bill before us is beneficial but it might have benefited from closer and longer scrutiny if Committee and other Stages were being dealt with less hastily.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I also welcome the fact that progress is being made in a number of areas throughout the country which have had serious problems with flooding. Senator Reynolds referred to the practice of politicians during elections promising to drain the Shannon.  I recall being outside a church in east Galway during a by-election in 1982 and hearing many promises being made about the drainage that would be carried out.  To date, as far as I am aware, none of that drainage has been done and none of the promises kept.  It was a promise that was always used during elections when there were serious problems with flooding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Higgins, included Duleek among the areas in which preliminary design work was to take place. This work has been completed.  When will the actual work commence?  On seven occasions in a period of a few <Col N="1682" /> years a number of houses in one housing scheme in Duleek were flooded. Sometimes help was available but at other times there was no help.  I welcome the fact that humanitarian assistance is now available; progress has been made in this regard.  It is not much consolation at the end of the day but no Government can legislate for such acts of God.  However, it is only right and proper that the Government should react to problems that arise and this Government has shown over the past 12 months that it is prepared to deal with certain areas of the country where there are ongoing problems.  It has brought forward proposed plans and designs and is willing to do something about them.</P>
    <P>I know a little about the problem in Duleek.  It is only right to say that the houses should never have been built in that location.  Having said that, it will not cost a small fortune to alleviate the problem.  I hope progress can be made forthwith on the next stages of the work to be carried out and that people will not have to ring me and the other local representatives, as they have done in recent days when it appeared that following a great deal of rain their houses would be flooded again.  At least progress is being made; we are a great deal further on now than we were 12 months ago.  After all the talk about problems in certain areas and the promises that were made by certain politicians, something is being done.  In passing this legislation it is nice to think that in the areas where people had problems with flooding work can and will commence to alleviate those problems.</P>
    <P>Having seen the work on the eight schemes outlined by the Minister, people will be thankful that this legislation was passed and that movement will be possible on the part of the Office of Public Works.  We could talk about the Office of Public Works forever and a day.  I recall when work started on the draining of the Boyne and the Blackwater. Many comments have been made about how the Office of Public Works left lands in a spoilt state; it must be admitted that the way that body carried <Col N="1683" /> out its work years ago left a lot to be desired.  There were unsightly scenes along rivers and other areas where the Office of Public Works carried out work.  However, much good work was also done and those who were involved in that good work endeavoured to leave the landscape as they found it.  That is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and look forward to seeing further progress in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I join other speakers in welcoming the Bill.  It is a short Bill but it grants the Commissioners of Public Works the necessary powers to discharge functions which many people thought they already had.  This Bill will put those powers on a statutory basis.</P>
      <P>The arterial drainage legislation which was passed by the Oireachtas this year was very important.  It had all party support.  Senator Daly played an important role in putting that legislation on the Statute Book through the introduction of his Private Members' Bill. His party and all other parties supported that Bill.  That was welcome. Until then the powers of the Commissioners of Public Works were confined to works in large catchment areas. This Bill will give that body the power to carry out works in smaller areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Counties Offaly, Tipperary, Carlow, Clare, Limerick, Cork, Kerry, Laois, Roscommon, Wicklow and Wexford suffered considerable flooding earlier this year.  County Offaly suffers continuous flooding.  The Minister of State visited the county and became aware of just how serious the flooding was in that area.  I saw at first hand the losses people suffered.  Farmers lost a considerable amount of fodder and many lost stock.  Sheep and other animals drowned.  I pay tribute to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, because he ensured that farmers in County Offaly who suffered stock losses were compensated within a relatively short time.  I wish to put on record my thanks to the Minister for being so attentive to the compensation <Col N="1684" /> issue.  Similarly, those who lost fodder were compensated.</P>
    <P>In a scheme administered through the St. Vincent de Paul, people who had lost furniture and on whose behalf I made representations or who had made approaches themselves were also compensated. It was good that people who suffered losses were compensated and that the schemes were successful.  When people's houses are flooded and their furniture and household goods are seriously damaged, it essential that they receive some sort of State payment. Insurance policies do not compensate people in full because of average clauses and other factors.  People suffer severe financial losses and are not able to restore their homes to the condition they were in prior to flooding.  It is important to compensate people so that their lives are not destroyed by flooding.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the £2 million which was made available under the agricultural compensation scheme and I was pleased that this was paid.  The Minister spoke about farmyard relocation. This was advertised in <i>The Farmer's Journal</i> and in a national daily newspaper.  When I saw the ad I contacted the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and I gave details of the scheme to my local papers.  People could obtain application forms for compensation for farmyard relocation from the Department.  The closing date for receipt of applications was 8 December. People were given too little notice and they did not have much time to prepare their cases and submit application forms.  I ask the Minister of State to use his good offices with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry to see if the closing date can be extended.</P>
    <P>Because of the Shannon, canals, bogs and rivers, a number of farms in County Offaly suffer considerable flooding on a regular basis.  I ask the Minister to ensure that moneys available under the farmyard relocation scheme are spread evenly throughout the country.  A number of people in the county have applied for these grants and I ask the Minister <Col N="1685" /> to ensure that some money is paid to them.</P>
    <P>We have experienced the worst flooding in years.  Following floods in Britain last winter there has been a considerable drought.  Around September and October last, because of the fine summer, we also had a water shortage.  The Minister's Department and the Department of the Environment are charged with powers and functions with regard to rivers and drainage schemes.  Drainage schemes can upset water levels.</P>
    <P>I forecast that over the next few years Britain will experience serious drought and water shortages.  While there can be flooding in Ireland, there can also be water shortages.  I ask the Department to investigate, perhaps with another Department, whether there is a probability of water shortages in future.  I do not know if the Commissioners of Public Works have power to deal with this matter under this Bill or existing statutes. When flooding occurs the main concern is to clear water as quickly as possible but no thought is given to the fact that water levels are dropping. Water shortages will be a serious problem in a number of years because people are using far more water than heretofore.  This point is important and will be raised again.  I thank the Minister for pushing through this Bill and the Arterial Drainage (Amendment) Bill, 1995.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister and the Bill, which responds to an urgent need by granting the necessary powers to the Commissioners of Public Works to give effect to a scheme to offer humanitarian assistance to a small number of people whose houses have been damaged beyond reasonable repair.  The powers of the Commissioners have been clarified.  The Arterial Drainage (Amendment) Bill, 1995, will give greater powers to the Office of Public Works and an input to local authorities.  We are all aware of the flash floods which can occur in places like Mallow and Fermoy.</P>

      <P>I cannot accept all of Senator Daly's criticism.  The Government responded in a comprehensive way to an unprecedented flooding problem. While I would rather do everything faster, there are constraints on us. Senator Daly asked about the £4 million allocated for improvements in county roads.  I do not have with me a breakdown of this expenditure and I will obtain it from the Department of the Environment.  The £2 million allocation for agricultural relief has been largely spent although a portion of it which was not spent is being used for the farmyard relocation scheme which is costing £700,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Daly referred to the parts of the Bill dealing with the home relocation scheme.  We expect in almost all cases we, rather than the local authority, will provide people with financial assistance to relocate.  I will give the Senator some details of that assistance.  Before doing so, however, I want to clarify that where a local authority provides a house under this scheme, it will do so as the agents of the Office of Public Works and not as a housing authority under the Housing Acts.  This means that any costs incurred by a local authority will be reimbursed in full by the Commissioners of Public Works.  However, I <Col N="1687" /> do not expect many applicants to avail of this option.</P>
    <P>Senators Daly and Finneran mentioned that the Bill introduced by Senator Daly last March to amend the Arterial Drainage Act, the amendments he proposed and the subsequent Government Bill contained provisions for the assessment and payment of compensation to victims of flooding.  They suggested that if we had accepted the proposals at the time, we would not have been required to introduce this emergency legislation.  I acknowledge the Senator's foresight in proposing the Bill, but the powers provided for the Commissioners of Public Works in this Bill relate not to compensation but to the provision of humanitarian aid. There is a fundamental difference between the two.  Compensation implies the existence of a legal entitlement, while humanitarian assistance has no such connotations.</P>
    <P>Some of the legal problems we encountered with the proposed humanitarian relief scheme related to the detail of the scheme.  We were not in a position to get legal advice about it until we had completed our deliberations.  Even if we had accepted Senator Daly's proposals at that time, there is no guarantee they would have eliminated the necessity to come before the House again.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly also suggested we should introduce an amendment to provide for an appeals procedure for people who are dissatisfied with the commissioners' proposals for humanitarian aid.  While an appeals procedure would be normal when dealing with compensation, it is not appropriate in the operation of the humanitarian assistance scheme.  I emphasise that the Office of Public Works will not acquire any property compulsorily.  We have devised a fair and reasonable assistance scheme.  We have consulted exhaustively with public representatives and with the two groups active in the south Galway and north Clare areas.  We have taken on board their points, although we do not agree with everything they <Col N="1688" /> said.  We have amended the scheme on a number of occasions following consultations. We will shortly offer this assistance to qualifying applicants who will decide whether to avail of it; there will be no compulsion on anyone to do so.  I do not agree there is a need for an appeals mechanism as it would greatly delay the process.</P>
    <P>As regards the details of the scheme, a home owner who qualifies for a four bedroom house and must buy a site will receive a total of just under £65,000.  We did some research on appropriate house values and were driven by the view that people made homeless should be treated equally before the law regardless of the reason they are homeless.  We looked carefully at the cost of local authority houses in the south Galway and north Clare areas.  We erred on the side of generosity when we examined the average house in rural and urban parts of County Galway and nationally; we considered houses at the higher scale.  The house was £42,250 and the site was £15,000, a total of £57,250.  We added a full 10 per cent to cover all fees and this brought the total to £62,975. We then added £2,000 for demolition and site clearance which brought the total to £64,975.</P>
    <P>As regards demolition, if we were to compensate people by providing them with a sum of money to erect another home and leave the existing house, and, there was subsequent flooding, we would look extremely foolish if there was another claim for compensation. The only solution which made any sense was to offer people a package, including the cost of demolishing the house.  The original scheme allowed us to take possession, but we ran into difficulties about who would own the site after the demolition.  This would have meant transferring property back and forth which would have wasted time and money.  The Commissioners of Public Works will not be involved in the ownership of the site or in the demolition. They will contribute £2,000 towards the demolition.  Salvaging materials was also mentioned.  People <Col N="1689" /> will not have a problem in this regard because they will be able to use those materials in their new houses.</P>
    <P>The scheme outlined is for four bedroom houses.  There are variations of this scheme for three bedroom houses and also for people who already have a site.  The site allowance is less for those who do not have to purchase a site.</P>
    <P>As regards the distribution of funds for humanitarian aid &mdash; the EU contribution of £390,000 and the State's contribution of £750,000 &mdash; County Clare received £160,500, which was the second largest amount.  County Galway received the largest amount of £537,000 and County Carlow received the third largest amount of £139,250.</P>

      <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn raised a number of issues, including the fact that we should not waste time.  On the assumption that this legislation will be passed in the Seanad tomorrow, we then must wait to put it through the Dáil.  The Government Chief Whip, Deputy Jim Higgins, has guaranteed his full co-operation in dealing with it as quickly as possible once the Dáil resumes.  In the meantime, we will write to each applicant, set out the details of the scheme and get their responses so that we can get the process in train.  I hope the legislation is passed early in February so that we can start to pay out the cheques.</P>

    <P>I thank Senator Henry for her interesting and colourful comments about the work of the Office of Public Works.  While there is not an architectural historian in the Office of Public Works, there is one in the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  As areas of heritage, including wildlife and public monuments, are being transferred to that Department, they will <Col N="1690" /> benefit from the availability of the architectural historian.  The position is not affected by an embargo.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works will liaise with the new Heritage Council in relation to any buildings which have heritage value.  I take the Senator's point about courthouses.  They will remain within the remit of the Office of Public Works, which will act as agents for the Department of Justice.  Some of the buildings are quite important and if a procedure is not in place already it would be appropriate if the Heritage Council and/or the architectural historian were consulted regarding some of the conversions.  This would be worthwhile.</P>
    <P>Dublin Castle will also remain within the ambit of the Office of Public Works as it is an occupied building and being used by the State.  I note the Senator's comments about the work at the castle. Regarding her question, the cobblestones came from the streets of Liverpool and Manchester and were brought to Ireland in empty Guinness trucks. They were not just for President Clinton's visit.  I do not know who thought of it, but it was a good idea.  Another point about the Office of Public Works may interest the Senator.  The Office of Public Works is increasingly required to apply for planning permission for work it carries out, which consequently involves public consultation and an appeals system.  This is another safeguard.</P>
    <P>I take the Senator's point about restoration and conservation.  It is not possible to restore everything and we must conserve everything which cannot be restored.  In many cases, conservation is more appropriate and I agree with the Senator's comments.  I was not totally aware of the situation in Castletown. However, I presume it will be transferred to the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht rather than to the Office of Public Works as it is a heritage building.</P>
    <P>The Senator asked about the lift shaft in Collins Barracks.  I will query the position for her, even though it will be <Col N="1691" /> the responsibility of the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht as it will be a museum.  The Office of Public Works has a substantial involvement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Senator Townsend mentioned Carlow and the requirements of environmental impact statements. Senator Dardis also mentioned this aspect.  We must realise that in the future we will be increasingly constrained &mdash; and correctly so &mdash; and perhaps react more slowly to situations given the necessity to carry out an assessment of the impact a project will have on the environment.  However, this will be of benefit to the country overall. It will be irritating in some instances, such as this case where people are frustrated by the lack of action in areas regularly affected by flooding, but we must try to maintain a balance between the two aspects.  It is not appropriate and we would not be allowed to rush in headlong to deal with a problem and cause devastation to the environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the people who will be affected by the eight or nine priority schemes to bear with us.  We are mandatorily required to go through the process of environmental impact assessment in addition to cost analysis.  I am unable to give precise dates for the commencement of construction projects in these schemes because the result is not predetermined by the carrying out of an EIS. <Col N="1692" /> I do not know what the EIS will show in every case and a result may emerge which would cause a delay.  At the end of the process we are required, in all cases, to publicly advertise what we are doing and this involves a statutory period of one month.  However, more time may be required if the public makes a comment or recommendation which should be taken on board.  It is difficult to give precise dates.</P>
    <P>Construction will be ready to commence soon on the Sixmilebridge scheme.  This is expected to start in the spring and it is expected that construction of most of the other eight or nine schemes, including Carlow and Kilkenny, will start next autumn.  I cannot say the schemes will start, only that it is expected they will commence, because of the constraints imposed by EIS.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran mentioned County Roscommon and suggested no money was provided for the county.  However, humanitarian aid from the Irish Red Cross Society in County Roscommon amounted to £23,100.  I cannot be specific about County Roscommon or any other county at present but the Government is committed to an initiative and a programme over ten years to solve the problem of our deplorable county roads.  A sum of £20 million was devoted to this area in September and a much larger amount will be provided in 1996. I am sure successive Governments, in so far as resources permit, will wish to continue that programme.  As Members are aware, once one goes 30 or 40 miles outside Dublin, particularly to rural areas, one hears serious criticism about the state of the county roads.  While I cannot anticipate that County Roscommon will get priority, it will receive fair play in the allocation of those funds.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran mentioned the local drainage schemes in County Roscommon. Having got the priority schemes for 1996 off the ground, we are also commencing the work of preparing a national priority list.  County Roscommon will have as good an opportunity as any other county to put forward its <Col N="1693" /> case in that regard and it will be assessed on its merits.  The Senator also raised issues about the maintenance of the River Suck.  However, this is a matter for the Suck drainage board, not the Office of Public Works.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Senators who stated that people really want flood relief schemes.  The humanitarian assistance provisions are a necessary response to immediate problems but more long term action is also required.  I outlined the priorities in that regard earlier and the intention to begin to prepare a national priority list to follow on in some type of orderly way in the years ahead.  However, it will take time.</P>
      <P>Senator Reynolds mentioned the Ballinamore/Ballyconnell area.  This has been transferred to Leitrim and Cavan County Councils and the Department of the Environment is due to set up a drainage board involving both councils. I am not certain of the current status of that matter but that is the proposal.</P>
      <P>Senator Kiely referred to the Mulcair. As he is aware, it was not possible to develop a satisfactory cost benefit for a major drainage scheme for the entire Mulcair catchment area.  It is now intended to concentrate on a flood relief scheme in Cappamore and Newport. This will form part of the first priority list.  As I stated earlier, I expect progress on those matters and commencement at the end of next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Burke was broadly supportive and I thank him.  Senator Dardis suggested the legislation may have been rushed.  It is difficult to defend that suggestion when, already I have had to put forward technical amendments. While there is an urgency about the legislation in relation to the humanitarian <Col N="1694" /> aid, the preparation of the Bill for the wider powers has been going on for some time, since the Attorney General advised us early in October that he believed our powers were deficient and suggested how we might deal with it.</P>
    <P>The new chairman of the commissioners, Mr. Barry Murphy, has been involved in most of this work, apart from the humanitarian aid aspect which only came up in the last two weeks and has an element of urgency about it.  The Senator should not take it that the entire Bill was rushed.</P>
    <P>The Senator made a responsible contribution on the River Barrow.  He is right in saying that the State cannot cope with every imaginable disaster. The River Barrow has problems but, hopefully, we will alleviate them to some extent with the proposed works.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrelly raised the proposed scheme for Duleek, County Meath, and we expect it to commence in the latter part of 1996.  Senator Enright referred to County Offaly.  While I visited the county during the summer, nonetheless, I got an appreciation from Senator Enright of what had happened during the flooding.  The Red Cross aid in County Offaly amounted to £24,612. The farmyard relocation grants are a matter for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry but if there is a genuine feeling the date is too restrictive I presume the Deputy will make representations to him.</P>
    <P>Senator Enright also referred to shortages of water and drought.  I do not know if it is because the world is heating up or cooling down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has its origins in a proposal for a Bill to provide for a variety of issues, including, principally, measures to facilitate the construction by Bord Gáis Éireann of the Ireland-UK natural gas interconnector. However, it became necessary to proceed with the provisions relating to the construction of the interconnector and these were enacted in the Gas (Amendment) Act, 1993.  The remaining issues were deferred and these, with a number of additional issues which have arisen since then, form the subject matter of the Bill before the House which contains a range of provisions relating to BGÉ specifically as well as provisions relating to other aspects of the energy sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As its title indicates, the Bill deals with a variety of energy issues relating to the production, supply, sale, transmission, distribution and use of certain forms of energy and matters incidental to those activities.  Energy plays a major role in our economy with economic and social implications.  State investment in energy infrastructure is some £5 billion. <Col N="1696" /> Energy imports represent about 3 per cent of GNP and the annual final energy demand bill at approximately £2.5 billion is about 9 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>As outlined in the Operational Programme for Economic Infrastructure 1994-1999, Irish energy policy has three primary objectives.  The first is the supply of a choice of fuels to consumers as efficiently as possible at internationally competitive prices taking account of supply security, socio-economic and environmental considerations.  The second is the consumption of this energy as efficiently as possible.  The third is the production of as much national energy requirements from indigenous sources as is economically possible.</P>
    <P>The final objective encompasses what are now called &ldquo;renewables&rdquo; and &ldquo;alternatives&rdquo;&mdash; wind, hydro and biomass. Some months ago I announced the results of the alternative energy requirement scheme.  Assuming all the projects proceed, 111 megawatts of capacity would be installed.  The electricity generated would represent a 35 per cent increase from present production from alternative sources and alternative energy would then supply about 10 per cent of our total electricity needs.</P>
    <P>Our total final consumption of energy is increasing and more than half of the fuel for this is imported.  As a result energy efficiency is very important and, as I stated, is one of the three main pillars of our energy policy.  Ensuring energy efficiency involves raising awareness of its importance, ensuring efficiency and rational use of energy and providing incentives where appropriate. Initiatives in this area include the establishment of the Irish Energy Centre and the Energy Advisory Board.  The Irish Energy Centre provides sound advice and expert guidance in relation to best practice in individual sectors, encourages the development of companies offering energy audit facilities and provides incentives to companies to invest in new systems and technology.</P>
    <P>With regard to energy costs, the characteristics of the Irish energy sector place customers here at a competitive <Col N="1697" /> disadvantage compared to elsewhere in the EU.  Our geographical situation on the periphery of Europe adds to the costs of energy supply, particularly electricity and gas.  Because of its isolation, our national electricity system must maintain excess standby capacity as spinning reserve, so adding to costs. Another important factor is our population settlement pattern.  Our population density at 51 per square kilometre is low by comparison with the EU average of around 150 per square kilometre.</P>
    <P>This Bill is an important measure.  It will provide important legislative bases and support for a wide number of areas, such as BGE, oil and gas exploration and pollution control measures, and it will remedy a number of identified defects in existing legislation.  Many of these defects are of a technical nature and I do not propose to go into them at this point.</P>
    <P>One important measure in the Bill is the statutory basis provided for the introduction of a system to allow BGE to transmit gas owned by another party through its gas network at a price to be negotiated.  This is known as third party access.  This provision in the Bill marks a watershed in the development of what is still a young but successful gas industry in this country.  The provision will fulfil the Government's commitment in relation to the Moriarty task force on the implementation of the Culliton report.</P>
    <P>IBEC has pressed for the early introduction of third party access to the gas network in accordance with the commitment in the Moriarty task force report. My first priority in the development of the gas industry is to ensure BGÉ remains a vibrant and progressive State body, with adequate financial resources providing a first class gas supply to its customers.  It is against that background I have decided to provide for TPA.  I am not satisfied it would be in the best interests of BGÉ or the gas industry generally that BGÉ should grant unlimited access to its network for gas transmission. Accordingly it should have <Col N="1698" /> discretion in the extent to which it is prepared to provide TPA.</P>
    <P>The threshold prescribed for third party access is that contained in the draft EU Directive concerning common rules for the internal market in natural gas.  In all the circumstances I deemed it the most appropriate.  BGÉ customers who are above the threshold prescribed in the Bill for TPA account for approximately 75 per cent of its annual total gas deliveries, so a sizeable market is being made potentially available.  To enable me to exercise my functions in regard to TPA, my Department is acquiring the necessary expertise and I hope to announce shortly the appointment of consultants to advise me on the charging methodology and other conditions relating to the granting of TPA.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides the statutory basis for an injection of £100 million in equity into Bord na Móna.  This is the major part of the £120 million investment approved by the Government.  The first tranche of £30 million cannot be invested in Bord na Móna until the terms and conditions specified by the Minister have been satisfied and the investment approved by the EU Commission. However, for budgetary purposes this tranche can be paid this year to a special account and issued from it when determined by the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.</P>
    <P>As a number of sections deal with BGÉ I propose to give the House information about its performance and the major issues affecting the board at this juncture.  Since its establishment in 1976 BGÉ has performed satisfactorily.  It has developed the gas industry so that it now contributes 17 per cent of our total primary energy requirement, as against 6 per cent in 1980.  It also contributes 26 per cent of the fuels input to electricity generation.</P>
    <P>It supplies a varied market, including domestic, and industrial or commercial users, the ESB and NET.  Domestic and industrial or commercial users account for 35 per cent of gas sales and 61 per <Col N="1699" /> cent of revenue.  Gas deliveries to the ESB account for 42 per cent of total deliveries while those to NET account for 23 per cent.  In terms of revenue, the ESB contributes 31 per cent and NET 8 per cent.  Domestic customer numbers have increased by an average of 9 per cent per annum in the last three years and now stand at some 233,000, representing over 30 per cent of all Irish homes.  BGÉ plans to have natural gas available to 40 per cent of Irish homes by the end of this decade, which would be the equivalent of 75 per cent of all homes within the area of the gas grid.</P>
    <P>This progress has been achieved without the need for any State investment in BGÉ.  On the contrary, the Exchequer has benefited to the tune of £394 million in contributions from BGÉ, so the whole economy, not just gas consumers, has reaped the benefits of its success. This success story is due in major part to the expertise and resourcefulness of the chairman, Dr. Michael Conlon, the board, the chief executive, Mr. Philip Cronin and the management and staff of BGÉ.</P>
    <P>Under the legislation BGÉ has a statutory obligation to develop and maintain a system for the supply of natural gas on a commercial basis and any proposals for extension of the gas grid are assessed by the board in the light of that obligation.  Only projects which meet the board's economic criteria are undertaken.  In that context I asked it to investigate the economics of extensions to Shannon, Ennis, Tralee, Galway and other towns, as I am anxious that the network should be extended to other areas of the country where that would be commercially viable.</P>
    <P>The gas industry has now reached an important milestone in its history.  BGÉ has constructed an Ireland-UK gas interconnector, comprising onshore pipelines and facilities in Ireland and Scotland, an undersea pipeline and a compressor station in Scotland.  All the onshore and under sea pipeline elements of the project have been completed, <Col N="1700" /> while the compressor station is expected to be completed by the end of this month.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the interconnector is to provide gas supplies when the Kinsale and associated Ballycotton gas fields are depleted, which is expected to be in the next five years are so, and to provide an alternative supply in the event of any disruption of that source prior to depletion.  If further indigenous gas supplies are discovered the interconnector could be used to export any gas surplus to our requirements.  When the Kinsale-Ballycotton fields are depleted, BGE will have to purchase all its gas requirements on the UK-Norwegian markets unless adequate further indigenous supplies are discovered and developed in the meantime.  BGÉ will have to import gas even before then. From October 1996 it will start to import gas to meet peak requirements for the domestic, industrial and commercial markets.</P>
    <P>Since December 1993, when the pipeline part of the project was completed, the pipeline has provided security of supply facilities to protect BGÉ's core market of 240,000 customers should there be an interruption in supplies of gas from the Kinsale Head-Ballycotton fields.  On 29 October this year the first commercial gas flowed through the pipeline.</P>
    <P>The Bill also includes provision relating to exploration for oil and gas.  The promotion of hydrocarbon exploration is an activity to which the Government attaches considerable importance in the context of national economic development. The current taxation measures and licensing terms are specially designed to attract the interest of exploration companies in the Irish offshore.</P>
    <P>A strong interest has been stimulated in exploration and currently 24 exploration licences are in place.  There has also been a steady increase in interest in licensing options and at present nine options covering 34 blocks or part-blocks are in force.  It is expected that a number of those options will be converted <Col N="1701" /> to exploration licences carrying well obligations.  The number of major exploration companies now turning their attention towards offshore Ireland gives me confidence that this renewed interest will result in a significant increase in exploration activities in coming years.</P>
    <P>In 1993 the frontier licensing round in the Slyne and Erris Troughs off the north west coast of Ireland resulted in a positive response.  The interest shown in that round was surpassed by that for the Porcupine licensing round which closed on 15 December 1994.  Some 16 exploration companies submitted 11 applications for 35 blocks in the area and last March, eight licences were awarded to groups representing 15 companies in respect of 32 blocks.  Ireland now has a good coverage of licences and effective exploration programmes have been committed over Ireland's prime prospective acreage, ranging from the Irish Sea across the Celtic Sea to the Porcupine and Slyne-Erris Basins off the west coast.  The licences represent a good balance between shallow water and frontier areas.  I hope the efforts in these basins will prove successful.</P>
    <P>In addition to awarding licences under rounds it is my policy to operate an &ldquo;open door&rdquo; licensing system for acreage available for licensing.  The use of both licensing rounds and the open door system has served Ireland well in recent years and it is my intention to continue this policy.  However, I have decided that two areas should not be included for the present.  The Porcupine Basin was not re-opened following the close of the round in December 1994.  In addition, the Rockall Trough has been closed to encourage the acquisition of data and preparation of assessment reports so that its hydrocarbon potential could be properly assessed.  I expect to be in a position to make an announcement of future licensing opportunities in the Rockall Trough in May 1996.</P>
    <P>I take particular pleasure from the announcement of test results from the recent appraisal well drilled by Marathon just four and a half miles south <Col N="1702" /> west of the Kinsale Head gas Bravo platform.  The initial results appear to indicate the present of &ldquo;new&rdquo; gas, that is gas it would not be possible to extract through the existing Kinsale Head field facilities.  This encouraging news endorses the confidence already shown by oil companies in Ireland's offshore and further enhances the attractiveness of investment there.  The test results are now being analysed with a view to establishing the feasibility of extracting the gas.  Although further analysis of the data acquired during the testing period is required, the fact that the well has been suspended gives hope that it may be possible for Marathon to declare commerciality later this year.</P>
    <P>At this point I will outline the main provision of the Bill.  Section 2 of the Bill provides a statutory basis for the introduction of a system for what is called third party access to BGÉ's gas network.  Under section 40 (1) of the Gas Act, 1976, persons other than BGÉ may not construct or operate a gas pipeline over or under the surface of land without the giving of previous and reasonable notice to the Minister. Section 3 of the Bill will extend that restriction to the sea bed in the territorial seas of the State or to a designated area within the meaning of the Continental Shelf Act, 1968.  The need for the provision arises from the growing international trend towards the construction of international energy inter-connectors.</P>
    <P>Section 3 also amends the definition of &ldquo;foreshore&rdquo; in the Gas Act, 1976, so as to bring it into line with that in the Foreshore Act, 1933.</P>
    <P>At present, the Continental Shelf Act covers only pipelines that are laid in connection with the exploitation of the Irish continental shelf.  Section 4 of the Bill extends the relevant provisions of the Continental Shelf Act to apply also to pipelines crossing the Irish continental shelf carrying gas and to electricity cables.  The opportunity is also being taken to amend section 7 of the Continental Shelf Act in order to provide the Minister with the powers to make regulations <Col N="1703" /> to control discharge of polluting substances.  As a consequence of this amendment, section 7 of the Bill amends the Sea Pollution Act, 1991, so as to exclude pollution from pipelines and cables from that Act.</P>
    <P>Section 5 amends sections 5, 6 and 12 of the Continental Shelf Act so as to control the construction, alteration or improvement of any structure or works in a designated area and the removal of any object or material from a designated area without the consent of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications and the Minister for the Marine. The functions of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications relate to the orderly and proper use of a designated area while the Minister for the Marine's functions relates to safety of navigation.</P>
    <P>Section 6 amends section 48 (1) of the Safety, Health and Welfare (Offshore Installations) Act, 1987, so as to extend that section to cover any provision of the Continental Shelf Act, 1968, rather than just section 3 of the 1968 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for extension of the powers of BGÉ to effect certain commercial transactions, for example to establish subsidiaries and to lend or advance money or guarantee repayment of moneys by subsidiary companies.  For the most part, this section incorporates into statute the provisions of the Gas Act, 1976, (section 9)(Establishment of Subsidiaries) Order, 1990.  The powers in that order have been extended to include the power to guarantee the contracts and obligations of third parties. This is deemed necessary to ensure that BGÉ is not placed at a disadvantage <i>visà-vis</i> its competitors at home and abroad.  BGÉ operates in a competitive energy market and should have powers equivalent to those of a company incorporated under the Companies Act to engage in commercial transactions. From time to time in the course of negotiating its contracts, the board is required to give valid and effective guarantees and indemnities as a matter of commercial bargain and necessity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1704" /> The opportunity is being taken to clarify the arrangements for BGÉ on the establishment of subsidiaries, lending money or guaranteeing repayment of moneys by subsidiaries by providing that the exercise of such powers by the board shall be subject to the prior written consent of the Minister, given with the approval of the Minister for Finance. Sections 21 and 24 make similar provision in respect of the Electricity Supply Board and Bord na Móna respectively.  These controls already apply in the case of Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides for an extension of BGÉ's borrowing powers for capital purposes so as to enable the board to issue securities, for example the creation of stock or other forms of securities.  BGÉ has informed me that the absence of these powers has caused some difficulty for the board in arranging for borrowings in the most attractive terms.  For example, some bodies wishing to deal with BGÉ in this regard cannot do so because of the particular constitution of those bodies.  The provision in section 9 will overcome this problem. All proposals in this area will be subject to the consent and approval of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications and the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>There is a need to strengthen the Minister's powers regarding the inspection of energy infrastructures.  The Minister's powers to inspect energy infrastructures such as exploration and production platforms at sea, electricity plants, powerlines, gas installations, oil refineries and pipelines are fragmented at present.  The Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act, 1960, contains some powers on petroleum leases and licences.  Energy infrastructure is likely to become more widespread and diverse in nature and may increasingly be operated under the control of non-State bodies.  It is important the Minister should have a power, through authorised officers, to oversee all energy operations capable of being a source of risk to the public or the environment <Col N="1705" /> and to ensure they are conducted in conformity with good industrial practice and in accordance with statutory requirements.</P>
    <P>Section 10 of the Bill provides the Minister with the power to appoint authorised officers to inspect energy infrastructures and to oversee all energy operations capable of being a risk to the public or the environment.  Authorised officers would be appointed following consultation with the Minister for Enterprise and Employment where appropriate and the powers and duties of authorised officers are set out in the Bill.  The authorised officers will be empowered to enforce industry standards and statutory duties in the construction, operation or decommissioning of energy infrastructures.</P>
    <P>Section 11 enables the Minister for the Marine to appoint authorised officers to exercise inspection and supervisory powers in connection with any matter for which the consent of the Minister is granted under section 5 of the Continental Shelf Act, 1968, as amended by this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 12 of the Bill will empower the Minister to order an investigation into an accident or incident involving an energy infrastructure.  Apart from existing law relating to safety in workplaces, the holding of inquiries and in the case of the gas industry, the investigation of gas related incidents by BGÉ on his behalf, there is no power available to the Minister to examine the causes of major or serious incidents involving, for example, drilling rigs at sea and gas or oil production platforms.  The powers under this section would be used where the procedures under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, are inappropriate and would provide also for ancillary powers relating to the holding of investigations and the protection of life and property following such incidents.</P>
    <P>Section 13 details a number of restrictions on the exercise of powers on the holding of investigations.  Where there is a power vested in a persons other than the Minister under any Act to conduct <Col N="1706" /> an investigation, the Minister is required to establish whether that person proposes to hold an investigation.  If that person does propose to hold an investigation and if the Minister is satisfied that such an investigation will give enough information and facts as regards the matters of concern to him, the Minister would not hold a separate investigation. This section is designed to avoid duplication of investigations.</P>
    <P>Section 14 provides for the formal vesting, by ministerial order, in Bord Gáis Éireann of the assets of the former town gas utilities acquired by BGÉ to consolidate ownership of BGÉ's assets. The conveyance of these assets would normally give rise to the imposition of stamp duties, which could amount to nearly £3 million.  Section 14 obviates the need for BGÉ to rely on a legal conveyance and thereby avoid the payment of duty.</P>
    <P>The utilities in question are Dublin Gas Company, Limerick Gas Company Limited, Cork Gas Company, City Of Waterford Gas Company and Clonmel Gas Company Limited.  BGÉ took over the assets of Dublin Gas Company to secure the continued distribution of gas to Dublin in a safe, efficient and progressive manner.  Likewise, BGÉ acquired the other four town gas utilities to ensure their customers continued to receive gas supplies.</P>
    <P>Section 15 provides for the creation of offences and associated penalties relating to the theft of electricity and gas.  The relevant provision of the existing legislation &mdash; the Larceny Act, 1916 &mdash; relating to this subject in so far as electricity is concerned, is being repealed. The legal experience in bringing prosecutions under the existing legislation was most unsatisfactory and much difficulty was encountered in securing convictions.  Accordingly, new provisions are required in a single statute. Section 16 provides for the power of entry and search of premises where an offence under section 15 of the Bill is suspected.  This power is deemed necessary because of the inadequacy of existing legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1707" /> It is necessary to strengthen the Minister's powers on undertakings to grant exploration licences &mdash; known as licensing options &mdash; undertakings to grant petroleum prospecting licences and undertakings to grant petroleum leases. The existing provisions of the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act, 1960, do not specify the Minister may impose conditions when granting these authorisations and do not refer to their revocation when the holder fails to comply with the conditions attached.  The amendment to the 1960 Act in section 17 of the Bill will enable the Minister to issue these undertakings subject to such terms and conditions as may be necessary.</P>
    <P>Section 17 also ensures the Minister for the Marine retains full control over any foreshore which is involved in the grant of working facilities permits under the 1960 Act.  The section also provides for the requirement to obtain the consent of the Minister for the Marine before the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications authorises the abandonment of an offshore installation.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 18 is to extend the scope of the Fuels (Control of Supplies) Acts to broaden the definition of petroleum to include, for example, natural gas and to include the production of petroleum as well as the exploitation of the fuel resources of a designated area.  These Acts provide for the regulation and control of the acquisition, supply, distribution and marketing of fuels, as well as the control of the import and export of fuels.  The Minister's powers under these Acts can only be exercised when the Government has declared, by order, that the common good warrants such action.  In other words, these powers are designed to deal with an energy supply emergency.</P>
    <P>Section 19 provides for the removal of an anomaly in ESB superannuation schemes in respect of staff seconded to the Oireachtas.  When an ESB staff member is seconded to the Oireachtas <Col N="1708" /> he/she has to pay both employer's and employee's superannuation contributions to the ESB for the period of the secondment.  This amendment proposes that, in the event of the member being awarded an Oireachtas pension, the secondment period will be disregarded for ESB pension purposes and on retirement he/she will receive a refund of all contributions paid during the secondment period rather than just a refund of the employee's superannuation contributions, as heretofore.</P>
    <P>Section 20 amends the Electricity Supply Board (Superannuation) Act, 1942 to provide for the establishment of a single fund to cover all employees and to provide for trustee discretion on fund investments.  The Bill provides for the amendment of the Electricity Supply Board (Superannuation) Act, 1942 so as to provide for the amalgamation of the manual workers' superannuation scheme and the general employees' superannuation scheme.  This was to be achieved by revoking the former scheme and transferring the moneys in that fund into the fund in respect of the general employees' superannuation scheme.  This amalgamation actually took place in 1981.</P>
    <P>Until 1981 superannuation contributions were divided on a 50/50 basis between employees and employer.  Subsection 4 provides that this equal divide need no longer apply.  The rationale behind the change was to allow the board to take on a greater portion of the cost to fund the changes required by the amalgamation of the two schemes.</P>
    <P>Section 22 enables the Minister to recover from the ESB the cost of any reviews and consultancies which may be undertaken to advise on the provision and regulation of electricity.  In the short term, the provision will allow the Minister to recover the cost of three consultancies &mdash; one which commenced in December 1993 and has since been completed, and two others which are at present under way.  The combined cost of the three consultancies should not exceed £1 million.  Since the reviews concerned all share the common purpose <Col N="1709" /> of improving the welfare of the electricity consumer, it is only reasonable that the cost of such reviews should be recovered from the ESB's revenues rather than being borne by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The most significant of the consultancies relates to a major restructuring of the electricity sector approved by Government.  This exercise is designed to stimulate efficiency and create a market which will respond effectively to the wide variety of customer needs.  The most significant changes would involve the facilitation of competition in power generation and electricity retail supply. Restructuring is also an essential response to current proposals on the liberalisation of the European energy market. Work on the appropriate legislation and regulatory changes necessary to give effect to the proposals approved by Government is continuing with the advice and assistance of consultants.  I would hope to introduce legislative proposals in 1996 with a view to achieving a new regulatory framework in 1997.</P>
    <P>Section 23 provides for an amendment to the Turf Development Act, 1946 consequent on the moving of the headquarters of Bord na Móna from Dublin to Newbridge, County Kildare.</P>

      <P>To the wrong constituency; they changed it since.  Section 25 enables the Government to make an equity investment in Bord na Móna.  At present, there is no statutory basis for any equity investment in Bord na Móna. The section provides for the establishment of a special account out of which the moneys will be paid.  The purpose of this is to enable the first tranche of Exchequer funding, i.e. £30 million, to be paid out for budgetary reasons before the end of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 26 is a simple amendment proposed by the Attorney General and agreed by the Department of Health to resolve a conflict between a section in the Radiological Protection Act, 1991 relating to the medical use of ionising <Col N="1710" /> radiation and provisions of European Communities legislation.  Advice given to my Department was that legal difficulties could arise from a conflict between the primary legislation which prescribes the role and functions of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland and the European Communities (Ionising Radiation) Regulations, 1991 if this conflict was not resolved.  Briefly, section 7 (2) of the Radiological Protection Act, 1991, as it stands, imposes a general restriction on functions of the institute by excluding the medical use of ionising radiation from these functions. However, the Community legislation on the other hand places no such restriction on the institute's functions in respect of the use of radioactive substances and appliances other than that the institute should consult with the Department of Health in respect of medical use.</P>
    <P>The provision in the Community legislation is considered to be more appropriate and the legal advice is that it must prevail over alternative provisions which conflict with Community legislation.  Therefore, section 7 (2) of the 1991 Act is being amended, as proposed in this Bill, to remove the inconsistency between the two pieces of legislation. Section 27 ensures that the Foreshore Acts are not prejudiced by either the Gas Acts or the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act.</P>
    <P>Section 28 provides for necessary repeals and revocations, including most of the Turf Development Act, 1981. That Act provided for payment of bog development grants which have now been discontinued.  The private bog development grant scheme was introduced by the Turf Development Act of 1981.  The scheme was designed to stimulate the development of private peat resources, and provided grants towards access roads, drainage and machinery for bog development.  Under the scheme, which was funded by my Department, applicants submitted development plans to Bord na Móna which administered the scheme on behalf of the Department.  The scheme proved successful as it brought private <Col N="1711" /> turf production to an annual level of approximately 1.5 million tonnes from a previously low base.</P>
    <P>The scheme was terminated in October 1987 having been deemed to have achieved its purpose and Bord na Móna has not accepted any new applications since that date.  It has not been possible to terminate financial outlay as there remains work approved which has not yet been completed due to delays caused by bad weather and also a shortfall in funding in recent years.  Only when work has been completed can the funds be paid to projects.  I understand from Bord na Móna that all outstanding grants will be paid during the current year.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very comprehensive Bill.  In fact, quite a number of areas are covered in the Bill which could form the subject matter of a separate Bill.  We are dealing with very important bodies like Bord na Móna, Bord Gáis Éireann and Bord Soláthair Leictreachais.  These bodies have made a significant contribution to the development of our economy including job creation, the development of new technology and the opening up of new areas of opportunity. They have also made a major contribution to social development since their establishment.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on bringing forward this legislation which contains an amount of detail.  It covers areas such as gas exploration, the interconnector, the possibility of further oil exploration and sea pollution.  The Bill, which will give us plenty of opportunity for discussion, is welcome and opportune. There is a need for a comprehensive look at some of the semi-State bodies in terms of modernising the legislation which deals with their activities. They need to be given new opportunities and new drive and the Bill is welcome from that point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the detailed explanation he has provided. We will co-operate fully with him on the <Col N="1712" /> various Stages to endeavour to improve the legislation.  I also compliment Bord Gáis Éireann on its achievement and the important development work it has undertaken.  The interconnector is an example of where top class, high technology has been used to create a longterm link which will benefit this and other economies.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister outline further gas exploration activities?  He referred to a number of new licences which have been issued and the interest in offshore oil exploration.  There has been much interest in the Porcupine Basin off the west coast of Clare.  It is understood that much activity will take place there next summer.  The extent of the operation that will be undertaken is not clear, but I believe plans have been made to open up new opportunities in the exploration area.  While this is welcome, we must ensure it is done in a careful and balanced way and that care is taken to protect the environment.</P>
    <P>We recently passed the Harbours Bill, 1995, which offers harbours a mandate to become involved in such ventures. Offshore oil exploration can make an important contribution to port activity. I would like to hear the Minister's views on how offshore oil exploration will be developed and serviced by ports like Cork or the Shannon Estuary.  Will there be opportunities for new activities?</P>
    <P>Developments in the ESB have been the cause of anxiety for some time. Detailed and protracted negotiations between ESB management and unions were recently concluded.  I compliment the outgoing chairman of the ESB, Mr. Paddy Moriarty, and I express our appreciation of his work during his chairmanship and management of the company.  He made an outstanding contribution to the development of the company at a critical time when large scale investment was taking place.</P>
    <P>I come from an area a few miles from Moneypoint and I acknowledge work done by the ESB in planning and building that project, which has made a large contribution to our energy requirements, <Col N="1713" /> and to the development of the economy in the mid-west region, in particular west Clare.  I would like that type of initiative to continue.  Mr. Moriarty knew it was necessary to move forward with new projects and ideas.  With that in mind the ESB put in place a plan to develop the potential of further coal-handling and transshipment at Moneypoint. We recently saw details of a major project at Moneypoint which would create additional employment opportunities in that type of activity. This is important because there is anxiety &mdash; not only in Moneypoint, but in other areas &mdash; that the new arrangements which will be put in place for the transmission and generation of electricity will have serious implications for personnel in the ESB.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the number employed in Moneypoint could drop from 400 to 200.  This would be a significant job loss in an area which could not sustain it.  Nevertheless, new procedures will be put in place and there will be agreement between unions and management on how to proceed.  It is important that in any restructuring of the ESB that sight will not be lost of the unique possibilities it has because of its location in areas like Moneypoint to develop new and sustainable employment opportunities in activities relating to electricity generation.</P>
    <P>Proposals at Moneypoint include further investment in jetties so that coal imported there could be handled, regraded, sold off and exported. Because of the huge quantities of coal being imported to Moneypoint, it is possible to have a viable coal-related activity there which may, to some extent, offset the job losses being forecast as a result of the new policies being put in place in the generation business.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that work done by staff of the ESB at present would be subcontracted.  I would like the Minister to outline decisions being taken on restructuring, employment, new opportunities and further development in the ESB which will enable it to continue the <Col N="1714" /> same dynamic leadership which it has given in the generation of energy since its foundation.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to Mr. Moriarty on his work and I wish him well in his retirement. I also wish the new chairman and personnel success in the future. Although it will be a traumatic time, the ESB will be rise to the occasion and will not be found wanting in terms of its responsibility to the economy and welfare of the community.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to invest £100 million or £120 million in Bord na Móna.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to outline the end result of this investment.  I presume this investment will be made in the interests of employment and further development.  Bord na Móna has been <Col N="1715" /> innovative as regards some of the initiatives it has taken, although it has had difficulties in the midlands, to which my colleague Senator Cassidy will refer. I do not want to dwell on Bord na Móna other than to query the Minister about this issue of the £100 million, £120 million and the £30 million and the special accounts and to ensure at the end of the day that this investment is made.  This side of the House would welcome an investment of equity in Bord na Móna, which will use it well and wisely to develop more employment opportunities and economic prosperity.  I will try to deal with a number of issues raised in the various sections although I do not have them in the same order.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned issues such as radon and the problems with radiological protection.  The Minister said that he was making a very minor amendment, but it was to deal with a very complex issue between the Department of Health, the Radiological Protection Institute and the European Community.  I am not clear about what the Minister is trying to achieve here or the purpose of the section, but I want to highlight one very important issue. There is an unacceptably high level of radon in many houses, particularly in the west and in areas of north Clare, which we mentioned earlier in connection with problems of flooding, as well as areas like Salthill in Galway and Galway city.  Some areas on the west coast where testing has already been undertaken have shown very clearly an unacceptably high level of radon which needs to be dealt with urgently.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Radiological Protection Institute on its work.  It carries out a test on a private dwelling for around £15.  This is a good investment, especially in high risk areas.  Perhaps we could avail of the opportunity to impress upon people in such houses the desirability of having radon testing done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Radon testing is free.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1716" />
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes and the testing of domestic houses should be encouraged so that we can get a clear picture of the overall situation.  The institute is conducting a national survey at the moment and I hope we will have the result fairly soon, but financial support for people who have a problem with radon is also necessary.  My understanding from the Department of the Environment, the institute and the Department of industry and energy is that, to insulate a dwelling with a very high radon level against radon an investment of between £900 and £2,000 might be necessary.</P>
      <P>I strongly urge the Minister to bring forward a scheme to provide assistance to the less well off sections of the community, those on low incomes and those who have very high levels of radon so that an overall scheme could be put in place to, prevent, reduce or eliminate radon levels in houses.  This would also help to prevent lung cancers and other problems arising from high radon levels.</P>
      <P>In relation to insulation generally, the ESB and the Government had a very comprehensive energy conservation programme which saved millions of pounds for the taxpayer.  However, that scheme seems to have run out of steam, I am not certain whether it has been abandoned, but it is not promoted as enthusiastically as in the past.  I would like some information about that.  The Minister of State will be aware of recent reports that poor insulation in dwelling houses was blamed for the untimely death of many elderly people and that it could be possible to eliminate problems by energy conservation through better insulation.  I strongly suggest to the Minister of State that if he were to look favourably at introducing financial measures to deal with issues like energy conservation related insulation for the elderly, and measures to reduce radon levels in domestic dwellings and other places such as public national schools, he would have widespread support in the community and the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill has raised a number of issues in relation to foreshore licences and foreshore law; this is a very complex <Col N="1717" /> area.  On Committee Stage, we will deal in more detail with how it is hoped to deal with what the Minister proposes here without necessarily interfering with foreshore rights and access as this is quite a complex business.</P>
    <P>The main thrust of this legislation is towards development and improvement in the energy resources and development of the State.  It is important from the point of view of economic progress and prosperity, employment development and generation that we have healthy institutions such as Bord Gáis Éireann, Bord na Móna and the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
    <P>In dealing with this Bill we want to show the Minister of State our total committment to dealing effectively and speedily with these issues.  We will, on the other hand, very carefully examine every section in this legislation and if we feel it is necessary to make amendments on Committee Stage to improve the legislation we will do so.  Overall I welcome this legislation, I compliment the Minister of State on bringing it in to the House and I assure him of our whole hearted co-operation and support in getting it through speedily.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I wholeheartedly welcome the Bill and commend the Minister for bringing it before the House so expeditiously.  It shows considerable initiative, enterprise and innovation by the Minister, Deputy Lowry, and his Minister of State, Deputy Stagg.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill covers quite a large number of areas in relation to energy distribution, generation, and the overall funding and cost for energy.  There is a State investment of approximately £5 billion in energy infrastructure The energy imports to this country represent approximately 3 per cent of GNP.  I listened attentively, as I am obliged to do, to many people who are highly critical of the workings of the ESB and Bord na Móna.  Many people criticise the debt of Bord na Móna and the work it does. However, it is important to bear in mind that the workings of Bord na Móna reduce the cost of imports and similarly, <Col N="1718" /> Bord Gáis also helps to reduce the import of costly energy resources.</P>
    <P>The Bill covers many aspects and areas.  It deals with a large number of Acts.  It deals with the Gas Act, 1976, a considerable extension of powers of Bord Gáis Éireann and the gas interconnector between Great Britain and Ireland.  I welcome the limit on the amount of gas coming through this interconnector which can be utilised on a commercial basis.  The ESB, Nitrigin Éireann Teoranta and four other semi-State companies use approximately 75 per cent of the gas imported into Ireland.  I would not like to see an open-ended extension of the gas interconnector. If such scope were given, it would place Bord Gáis Éireann in difficulty.</P>
    <P>The provisions in relation to the Turf Development Acts from 1946 onward are of particular importance to my constituency and the midlands area and for Bord na Móna and the ESB who have significantly improved the standard of living in the midlands.  They provided much needed and well paid jobs and have benefited the Exchequer.  They had an important influence on employment in the midlands and have made an important national contribution in the supply of energy.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision to Bord na Móna of £100 million to repay debts. The provision of equity to Bord na Móna for funding is long overdue.  Bord na Móna's overhanging debt prevented its development and effectively crippled it.  The current debt is approximately £163 million.  Annual repayments cost Bord na Móna approximately £18 million to £20 million per annum.</P>
    <P>It is important to examine how such debts occurred.  During the energy crises of the 1970s and 1980s, Bord na Móna and the ESB were directed by the Government on future development and incurred a considerable level of debt.  For years I have requested an injection of equity to Bord na Móna.  I felt that the debt had to be drastically reduced or wiped out.  Mine was a lone <Col N="1719" /> voice for many years but I am glad my requests have been acceded to.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that, before many other State companies, Bord na Móna realised that major changes were essential for survival.  To ensure a solid commercial future, Bord na Móna embarked on a major programme of rationalisation and change. It employed 7,100 people at its peak in the mid 1980s although the annual average of those employed by the company was 4,500 which included full-time and seasonal workers.  During the past five years staff numbers in Bord na Móna have been reduced by 2,200 and at present, the company employs in the region of 2,100 to 2,300 people.  I saw the effect of these job losses.  I can state categorically they have had a very serious and damaging effect on the midlands where whole communities have been devastated.  Significant numbers of shops closed and houses were left empty.  Large numbers of people have either left the area or become unemployed.</P>
    <P>It is to the credit of the board and staff of Bord na Móna that work practices within the organisation changed radically with little publicity and job losses were accepted.  Many of the staff felt changes had to be made in order that the company survive.  They were anxious the board should have a competitive future and be able to provide milled peat, turf and briquettes at a competitive price.  They have succeeded and Bord na Móna has become more efficient in its core activities.</P>
    <P>The £100 million being provided under the Bill will be of direct benefit to the taxpayer.  The ESB will benefit from a reduction of approximately £6 per tonne in the cost of milled peat available for use in its five generating stations at Ferbane, Rhode, Shannon-bridge, Lanesboro and Bellacorick.  This reduction will bring the price for milled peat into line with the projected long-term price of gas and oil.  The ESB will, therefore, be able to purchase milled peat at a competitive price.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1720" /> The moneys allocated under section 25 will help to relieve Bord na Móna of the massive bank interest payments it has been obliged to pay to date on its bank loans.  As a result of this cash injection, the total savings will be approximately £13 million per year.  This is a case where Government investment will be a direct relief to electricity users who are also taxpayers.  This Bill, and the moneys granted thereunder, ensures that Bord na Móna can supply peat to the new electricity generator in the future, at competitive prices.  In excess of 100 million tonnes of peat can be economically extracted from bogs in the midlands in counties Offaly, Kildare, Meath, Westmeath, Tipperary, Mayo, Galway, Roscommon, Longford and Laois.  I am glad this natural resource, which is a great source of wealth to the country, will be utilised.  It is also important to note that these bogs are in counties, many of which have no strong alternative industrial base.</P>
    <P>It is important to bear in mind also that we have three stations in County Offaly &mdash; Ferbane, Rhode and Shan-nonbridge. I urge the Minister to ensure his Department makes every effort to ensure these stations are upgraded, improved and maintained at a proper level so that employment can be maintained. The communities in these areas are waiting and watching attentively because their future, to a large measure, will be dependent upon the decisions taken and whether or not investment is to continue.</P>
    <P>I warmly welcome the building of this new 120 megawatt power station. Across County Offaly and the east-midlands&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In replying to Second Stage, perhaps the Minister can tell the House when tenders will be sought for the building of this new station.  I would not like to see this matter proceed with the provision of a procurer for the electricity first and the tendering process at a later stage.  If I might borrow a phrase from elsewhere, I hope there would be a twin-track approach on this matter so that it can proceed in tandem and tenders can be sought at an early date.  We could then see an early start to the project because the funding will run out in 1999, if my memory serves me correctly, and that is why it is so important.</P>
      <P>The building of this station is important from another viewpoint.  We ought not forget that much of the world's reserves of energies, such as oil and gas, are held predominately by countries which have been political unstable in the past.  Many of these areas, such as Russia, the former Soviet Union, the Middle East and north Africa, have had political problems in the past and, as a result, our supplies have been seriously affected.  That is why we must have some resources of our own available.</P>
      <P>There is also the matter of the depletion of the gas reserves off the south coast of Ireland.  I understand most of these reserves will be exhausted by the end of this century unless we are lucky enough to find alternative supplies in the meantime.  This country must ensure it is not 100 per cent dependent on energy from outside the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill will ensure the survival of <Col N="1722" /> Bord na Móna as a vibrant natural supplier of energy for electricity well into the next century.  The resource of 100 million tonnes of peat guarantees the supply of electricity until at least 2020.</P>
    <P>There has been much progress in Bord na Móna over the last number of years.  Workers have made many sacrifices, particularly in the last ten years, and a lot of changes have taken place due to their dedication and efficiency. By granting this equity injection of £100 million the Minister has recognised the sacrifices of the staff.  While these moneys may recognise retrospectively the sacrifices which have been made, the removal of this debt burden from the shoulders of the company and this injection of equity shows the Government is committed fully to maintaining our own independent, native energy supply.  It is essential that we continue to work and strive for that objective.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister has a clear policy on energy supply.  I welcome the new 120 megawatt power station.  I see a great future for Bord na Móna and the ESB.  I wish the Minister well in his work and congratulate him on his enterprise and work to date.</P>

      <P>I can assure Senator Cassidy that I will be brief.  Turf, coal and oil have been dealt with satisfactorily by Senator Daly and Senator Enright so the only area on which I want to comment is section 26, which relates to the medical use of ionising radiation.  I am glad the Minister has included that <Col N="1723" /> section.  I do not think anyone really knew why the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland was not empowered to cover ionising radiation for medical uses when the 1991 Act came into effect.  I presume the Minister's professional experience must have shown him how important it was to introduce this.</P>
      <P>I welcome its introduction but I hope he will ensure there is sufficient equipment and personnel to monitor this because the Minister will be only too well aware, again from his background, that ionising radiation is being used more and more in procedures, research and with new medical tests which are being brought into the medical area on a daily basis.  While I welcome it, I would like to be sure the Department will see that the Department of Health is in a position to monitor it carefully under the safety and health regulations which, after all, are not only important for those patients on whom it may be used but are extremely important to those workers who may use it.  The latter are in daily contact with such radiation whereas patients come in contact with it, we hope, on a once-off basis only.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill as it seems to cover a great deal of important work.</P>

      <P>It is for the £30 million that this Bill has been introduced and the hurry is because the Government needs the £30 million this year.  The rest of the Bill is a mishmash that has been put together to include different companies and different issues.  However, before <Col N="1725" /> Christmas the Government will pay £30 million to Bord na Móna.  It is typical.</P>
      <P>We should not be paying £30 million to Bord na Móna; we should not give anything to that body because, as the Minister knows, Bord na Móna is bust. It is a bankrupt company and has been such for as long as I or the Minister can remember.  Instead of putting forward constructive projections and plans for Bord na Móna we are told that this £30 million is part of £120 million which will go to the company courtesy of the taxpayer. It will tide us over the next little problem in the semi-States and we will put in a bit more next year and the year after and we will see how it develops.  If it does not do well the Minister knows what will happen &mdash; the Government will put more money into the company when the £120 million has run out.</P>
      <P>The problem with this is that it sends all the wrong signals to the other semi-State companies.  This company has been allowed to behave in a profligate fashion, guaranteed and supported by successive Governments.  Loans have been guaranteed and subsidies have been given for years and the place is being used as artificial jobs blotting paper.  Politicians have not had the guts to say that it is a bankrupt company and it should be tackled.  That is the problem.</P>

      <P>Let us look at how Bord na Móna behaves as a semi-State body and how it behaves following an announcement that it will receive £30 million this year and a total of £120 million from the taxpayer.  One of the first things the company did was buy a corporate hospitality box in Croke Park.  What an extraordinary thing for a bankrupt company to do.  It was announced that the company would get £120 million and off it went and bought a corporate box for its clients in Croke Park.  It laid on plenty of champagne and smoked salmon courtesy of the taxpayer and there was not a whisper from the Minister or anybody else.  Good luck to the company but the wrong message went to the other semi-State bodies.</P>
      <P>There are many other semi-State bodies &mdash; including bankrupt semi-State bodies &mdash; doing the same thing.  The first thing they will do when the Minister makes another announcement is go and buy a corporate box in Croke Park with Bord na Móna.  Guess who is sitting beside Bord na Móna's wonderful hospitality box in Croke Park?  Telecom Éireann.  It only has a debt of £1,000 million so why would it not spend £150,000 on corporate entertainment? Good luck to that company too.  Telecom Éireann is under the Minister's Department and there has not been a whisper from the Minister about it.  Who else decided that corporate entertainment was a good idea?  CIE.  Why should it not?  It only loses £85 million or £90 million a year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make them as relevant as possible.  I am trying to demonstrate <Col N="1727" /> that although Bord na Móna is bankrupt it does not appear to take its bankruptcy terribly seriously.  There are many private companies which are making plenty of money but they do not seem to think they can fork out £150,000 to entertain their clients in Croke Park at a football match.  However, apparently it is perfectly all right for a semi-State company to behave in that way. That is up to it because it is not answerable to anybody.  The Minister does not reprove them, the taxpayer cannot do anything about it and nobody mentions it in this House because we are going to put £30 million through on the nod. Does the House know how many corporate boxes they could buy with £30 million?  It is about 200.  They might as well because nobody will stop them.</P>
      <P>This company is unfortunately not answerable to anybody; none of the semi-State bodies in reality are answerable. I wrote to Bord na Móna recently to ask what was the attendance at their board meetings.  It is a reasonable question for a Member of the Oireachtas to ask of a semi-State company which is in debt to the tune of £180 million.  It is fair enough to ask if the board members are turning up for their meetings.  They sent back a garbled extract from the annual report and financial statement giving a few global figures but the company would not give me the facts about the individuals concerned.  It is right that these people should be answerable.  The chairman is paid £6,000 per year and the directors are paid £4,000.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it is.  This money will go towards paying the directors fees.  Where else does it come from, the air?  That is what the semi-State companies think.  It does not come out of the air, it comes from taxpayers and each one of the directors who gets £4,000 is getting it from the taxpayer.  That is why it is relevant.  This £30 million and the <Col N="1728" /> other £90 million which the Minister is asking us to vote through will also come from the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>Accountability is the great maxim of this Government.  I have demonstrated &mdash; to some extent in a frivolous way although I am making a serious point &mdash; that accountability does not exist in Bord na Móna.  There is no promise in the Minister's speech of increased accountability in Bord na Móna in the future.  I can see a possible case for putting what is euphemistically called &ldquo;equity&rdquo; into Bord na Móna &mdash; it is a case I would reject but I can see that a case could be made for it &mdash; if Bord na Móna was going to be accountable, open and transparent in the future.  However, we all know that this is just the first of many payments.  The <i>quid pro quo</i> for this &mdash; a totally inadequate one &mdash; which is that the relationship between Bord na Móna and the ESB should be on a commercial basis is long overdue.</P>
      <P>It is a great pity that we talk in this Bill about restructuring and that we talk in glowing terms in the annual report.  Neither Bord na Móna, the Minister or anybody else is prepared to face up to the reality that Bord na Móna is a bankrupt company.  We are skimming over the problem with taxpayers money and this is only the first payment of a series.  Bord na Móna should be launched into the commercial world or should be allowed to die.  This, unfortunately, is not being done in this Bill which seeks to tide us over into next year.  It will solve a political problem.</P>

      <P>I am tempted to call a vote to see if Senator Ross will join this side of the House this evening.  The late Paudge Brennan, who was a prominent <Col N="1729" /> politician in Wicklow, the constituency for which Senator Ross tried to be elected, said that there is never a wrong time to say the right thing.  Senator Ross had already put the views he has expressed here in his favourite Sunday newspaper but there is another side to Bord na Móna.  Since 1946 the company has brought life to the midlands, to counties Laois, Offaly, Longford, Westmeath, Meath, Cavan and Kildare, etc.  It has brought a social dimension to these areas which did not exist before. It provides good employment.  At one time it employed over 7,100 people.  At peak season now it employs over 4,500 people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>How much is it losing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Its losses are not enormous compared to the money paid in dole.  In my area Board na Móna ceased production of sod turf at Coolnagun leaving us having to travel 50 miles for such fuel.  Some 180 people were employed there by Bord na Móna but the current workforce is only six.  The population of the area has fallen by 28 per cent.  It is better for life in rural and urban Ireland that people are working rather than on the dole.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross reminds me of a true socialist; he wants to share everything with everyone when he has nothing himself. I am not saying the personally has nothing but his philosophy is bankrupt. From the way he is performing here I do not see him being elevated in his own party to any position where decisions might have to be made in areas such as the one we are discussing.</P>
      <P>I became a Member of the House in 1982, and I recall that at that time Bord na Móna began experiencing difficulty. Approximately £20 million was required to pay interest on the company's massive debt which had been there for years. When people are involved in an industry which depends on the weather &mdash; only those who create employment would know about this &mdash; they cannot predict whether the season will be good&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pleasure for me to educate the Senator on the difficulties for an industry which depends totally on the weather being favourable.  The midlands area get little from Government by way of resources to create employment. Most of the money available goes to the east coast with large amounts being directed to the south and west. Despite that, the midlands are being advertised as the undiscovered beautiful part of Ireland.  It was a tragedy for the people of the area that the previous Taoiseach had to resign.  During his term of office there was substantial investment and development in the area.</P>
      <P>An allocation of £120 million to Bord na Móna is a step in the right direction towards eliminating its debt.  Any job creation initiative in the midlands would be a major advance on unemployment. There is nothing more soul destroying than waking up in the morning and not having a job to go to.  Senator Ross and all of us here are fortunate to be Members of this distinguished House, to hold positions as legislators but there are some 300,000 people who do not share this fortune, temporary as it may be.  There is massive social need for Government to create employment. Bord na Móna has played its part since 1946.  I support the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Kinsale gas pipeline is one of Ireland's great achievements of the past 20 years.  The oil crisis in the early 1970s brought the country to its knees.  Being partly self sufficient in energy because of Kinsale gas is very advantageous.  The Minister's local area and mine might adopt a joint approach with regard to this gas.  He may be able to tell us when it is proposed to bring the gas pipeline to Leixlip, Maynooth, Kilcock, Mullingar and Athlone?  This would give these areas advantages, particularly in manufacturing, <Col N="1731" /> which other parts of Ireland have already.  Urban renewal has been of much benefit in the creation of employment but rural renewal is also important.  I hope the Minister will consider an extension of the gas pipeline given that by-pass roads have been constructed around Leixlip, Maynooth, Kilcock and Mullingar.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposed generating station for the midlands.  I would like it to be located in my county while the Minister would like it to be in Kildare. This station will be a step towards our being self sufficient for the next 30 years.  Senator Ross may think that £180 million is a great deal of money but it is minuscule compared to amounts by way of dole.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes the elimination of development grants for private peat producers.  Private producers are trying hard to survive.  Those grants allow them develop and drain bogs so that the machines can be used to cut turf for local people.  Being practically self sufficient in this regard, it is too soon to eliminate the small grants available for private producers.  There may be a case for doing so in areas where Bord na Móna operates but there is no such case in areas like north Westmeath.  As I have said, the company has ceased production in Coolnagun and the area is totally dependent for turf on the two or three small peat producers there.</P>

      <P>As usual, I was bemused with Senator Ross's contribution. He will only be satisfied if he becomes dictator of this country because he will then be able to decide everything.  I disagree with his opinion of semi-State companies.  He has many blind spots when it comes to this issue and he is selective in his quotations.  For example, he condemned this Bill for giving money to Bord na Móna, but he forgot to inform us that the Exchequer benefited to the tune of £394 million in contributions from Bord Gáis Éireann. It might help if Senator Ross had a little <Col N="1732" /> balance in his approach to the semi-State companies.</P>
      <P>He also spoke about Telecom Éireann.  Its report states that Telecom Éireann is a profitable company which in the financial year 1993-94 reported operating profits of £173 million; after paying interest and currency costs the figure was £81 million.  It also states that the Government's take from Telecom Éireann is high.  In the period between 1991 and 1997 it is estimated that the total amount received will be £1.88 million. I am tired listening to Senator Ross's trendy journalistic approach to serious issues such as semi-State companies.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross should look at what is happening in Britain as regards privatisation. While people may make a profit if the State does not have control in these areas, the system we have is a good one if people want properly run companies which provide essential services.  A lot of good work has been done trying to solve the problems in these companies as regards the services they supply. Bord na Móna is a good example.  This money will be well spent if it maintains jobs in the areas where Bord na Móna operates.</P>
      <P>This legislation was not introduced to provide money for Bord na Móna.  The Minister said this money would have been provided earlier, but it was necessary to bring in legislation for the natural gas interconnector.  The other issues were then included.  This legislation was not introduced to throw taxpayers' money away.</P>
      <P>Bord Gáis Éireann has been a success story.  The Minister indicated that 40 per cent of homes should be supplied with gas through BGÉ by the end of the decade. He also highlighted the benefits to the Exchequer.  I welcome the parts of this legislation which deal with BGÉ and the continuation of a supply.  The legislation provides for third party contributions to the supply, a provision which was instigated by business representatives. I hope Senator Ross is pleased that the Government is responding to the needs of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1733" /> We hope that the gas explorations will be successful.  The Minister stated that 24 licences have now been granted in this regard and others are pending. He indicated that Marathon Petroleum Ireland Limited hopes to produce increased gas supplies which would make it easier to provide this source of energy in the future.</P>
    <P>I use natural gas as I live in an area where I can receive it.  I support those people who have called for its extension to other parts of the country.  It is a good form of energy for heating homes.</P>
    <P>I welcome the section in the Bill which gives the Minister the power to inspect lines, infrastructure, etc.  We are all concerned about environmental safety and we must ensure that proper safety measures are in place.</P>
    <P>The ESB is facing its problems and ensuring it will be able to supply our needs in the future.  I welcome the fact that the Minister is committed to supplying a certain percentage of our energy through alternative sources.  I am interested in hydroelectric power as I live a couple of miles from Ardnacrusha, which pioneered the use of electricity in this country.  People marvelled at its construction at the time.  I hope we continue to have a commitment to hydroelectricity as opposed to the other methods because it is an environmentally friendly and good method of producing electricity.  Although we must use the other methods available to us, I hope we do not turn our backs on the system which supplied us with electricity when we did not have other options.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill, particularly the provisions for Bord Gáis Éireann and Bord na Móna.</P>

      <P>Senator Ross seems to have struck a chord with the Labour Party and with some members of his own party.  However, he is needed to bring realism to the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For too long we have accepted the theory that semi-State or State companies would survive.  They may have done so in the past, but they must now meet EU criteria.  Many things have happened <Col N="1734" /> in semi-State companies which must be questioned.  All is not rosy in the garden as far as the semi-State sector is concerned and I have said this on a number of occasions at the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies.  I cannot understand why many decisions are taken.</P>
    <P>I agree with the claim that there is secrecy in semi-State bodies.  I find it extraordinary that a request by Senator Ross for information on board meetings was not made available.  As a member of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies, I remember we wanted to know the salaries of those who worked in RTÉ.  However, Government members or members of the Opposition were not entitled to that information.  If that is the case, we should question the use of public funds in this regard.  If semi-State bodies want the support of the Houses of the Oireachtas and if taxpayers' money is being used, then there must be accountability and people must know what is happening.</P>
    <P>I am not happy about the level of information from some areas.  I would like to know why a matter which I brought to the Department's attention 12 months ago was not considered.  It concerned small fuel merchants who were being put out of business because of the prices Bord na Móna was charging.  If one buys 500 tonnes from Bord na Móna one receives a rebate of approximately 80p a tonne.  However, if one buys 20,000 tonnes, one receives a rebate of £5 a tonne.  It is not hard to understand that the small operator will go out of business as long as that system is maintained.</P>
    <P>If one buys and sells briquettes in Ireland, one pays VAT at the rate of 12.5 per cent.  However, fuel merchants across the Border in the Six Counties can pick them up without paying 12.5 per cent VAT and they find it easy to sell them in the midlands and west.  This puts our fuel merchants out of business. What is the Minister doing about this? This type of practical issue should be addressed.  It is fine to introduce Bills on <Col N="1735" /> various matters but fuel merchants are being put out of business because of inaction and abuse in some cases in the purchase, distribution and sale of products produced by Bord na Móna.  This matter should be addressed.</P>
    <P>The Bill concentrates on energy and I appreciate the Minister's interest over many years in this matter.  I have no personal criticism of the Minister because he inherited some of the difficulties. However, the person in office must respond to queries which arise.  I appreciate the massive energy cost faced by the country &mdash; £2.5 billion which is approximately 9 or 10 per cent of GNP.  Representatives from the ESB recently attended the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies. The company is interested in many issues, one of which is that the new procurers, which must be available under EU criteria, should be answerable to the ESB.  This is extraordinary.</P>
    <P>I recently visited Finland where there is not only approximately 120 different energy companies but two different national grids.  However, in Ireland, the ESB is seeking to make the procurers answerable to it.  The company also has an interest in the new power station. The interest of the semi-State company in the new power station is not in the best interests of the country.  It may be able to do it on a commercial basis, but with what will it compete in the future?</P>
    <P>Another aspect disturbed me following my visit to Finland.  I met senior officials of the state body there but, when they visited Ireland, they were only shown two possible sites for the proposed new peat power station.  This is extraordinary.  I wanted to know whether they visited the site in Ballyforan which was developed for a briquette factory.  However, they were not shown the site in Ballyforan or the Derryfada bogs, which is part of Bord na Móna's third phase.  What type of half book were they shown with regard to their interest in a power station in Ireland?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1736" /> They are recognised experts in their country and internationally in relation to peat power stations and they are interested in designing, building and commissioning the new station in Ireland.  However, it is extraordinary if they are not given the full facts.  In addition, they were not too happy with the proposed design of the factory and they wondered why we had not expanded into using combined heat and power in the past.  I chaired a task force which included a submission from an expert on this matter and I mentioned it in the House previously.  Although some attempts have been made in that regard, the issue has been placed on the back burner.  It is most successful in other countries but it has not been used in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna is to receive £120 million and I said on many occasions that it required equity.  I supported this move but I am not sure the company and Governments have acted in the best interests of those who supplied the raw materials, such as small farmers.  Land owners surrendered their bog for nominal rates &mdash; it was confiscated.  In my area, 15,000 acres was confiscated for as little as £3 an acre.  In return, there will be nine workers in 1996 whereas there were 228 workers in 1982.  The bog was confiscated on the basis that a power station or briquette factory would be established to provide jobs for the sons of farmers who surrendered the bog. When Bord na Móna got the bog, the company and the Minister &mdash; the Taoiseach was the Minister at the time &mdash; pulled the plug on the proposed factory. Nobody has a job there and Bord na Móna has the people's property.</P>

There have been many scandals involving and interferences in the lives of the public by the semi-State sector and none more so than in my <Col N="1737" /> area of County Roscommon/east Galway. Perhaps the Minister could find out why a contender of such standing for the new power station was not shown the site in Ballyforan.  Why was he not informed that there is approximately 20,000 acres of untapped resource in the area which is in the hands of Bord na Móna?  Is there a political agenda with regard to this site?  Is it not extraordinary that the site of the new power station is so close to the east coast?  Is it the case that the new power station will replace the old and run down stations in the midlands?  Does the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications have an agenda on this matter?  In the future the answers may become clear.</P>

Ministerial decisions were taken on many infrastructural developments with regard to Bord na Móna. I appreciate EU criteria must be met on this occasion, that EU money is involved and there is a period for evaluation. However, the two semi-State companies appear to be deeply involved, either on their own, if possible, or in co-operation with another operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why not show all the sites to all the applicants when they visit Ireland?  It should be established whether it is in the best interest of Ireland to set up one power station on the east coast or perhaps a small station on the east coast and another small station on the west coast.  The position is not clear and the issues have not been fully debated.  I <Col N="1738" /> intend to seek a more comprehensive debate on the new peat power station because all the issues have not yet been fully discussed.</P>

      <P>As the Minister said, the purpose of the Bill is to provide for a variety of issues, including measures to facilitate the construction by Bord Gáis Éireann of the Ireland-UK natural gas interconnector.  This is the main point.  Energy plays a major role in our economy and Bord Gáis Éireann should be congratulated.  The Minister mentioned its chairman, Dr. Michael Conlon, who was the manager of Cork County Council for many years.  I was a member of the council when the Kinsale gas field was initiated.  However, I am disappointed the Kinsale and associated Ballycotton gas fields are expected to be depleted in the next five years.  I thought there was more potential in the Kinsale gas field.  Perhaps that point might be clarified.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated that domestic and industrial-commercial use accounts for 35 per cent of gas sales.  In Mallow we have natural gas for industrial purposes only.  We were told it may be too expensive to extend the main line.  In Cork city there is contention and concern about what I might describe as a minimum payment.  The matter was raised publicly by a colleague, Councillor John Kelleher of Cork Corporation, and I would like the matter looked into. The Exchequer has benefited to the tune of £394 million in contributions from BGÉ and I hope that will continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ross made an outrageous attack.  When he was writing to Bord na Móna did he do so as a Member of the Seanad or as a well paid journalist?  He has a double salary as a journalist and Member of the Seanad.  He is seldom here and when he is he attacks people on social welfare or the semi-State bodies. That day is gone.  This country is progressing.  Senator Ross is like a little dog barking at the moon.  An attack was also made from the other side of the House.  From its inception Bord na <Col N="1739" /> Móna has made a significant contribution to the State.</P>
    <P>I have always been loud in my praise for BGÉ.  The Minister said that section 14 provides for the formal vesting in BGÉ of the assets of the former town gas utilities, including Dublin Gas.  We know how inefficient it was.  The Bill is a welcome development.</P>
    <P>Although not wishing to sound a discordant note, I hope the Minister is not being over optimistic when he refers to the objectives for renewal or alternative energy sources, such as wind, hydro or biomass.  In Mallow we have goethermal wells which we have connected to the swimming pool.  However, it has not had any great impact at the end of the day. Perhaps the potential is there and hopefully such sources of energy will be a success.  I am not too confident but I am sure the Minister of State will explore it to the utmost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will refer briefly to the provisions of the Bill dealing with Bord na Móna.  About seven or eight years ago I attended a public meeting in Lanesboro, County Longford, and a call was made by the unions and the workers of Bord na Móna for equity for Bord na Móna.  Prominent politicians from the midlands were at the meeting and some of them strongly voiced the view that when a change of Government occurred in 1987 there would be support for the demand.</P>
      <P>There was a myth that if a particular political party was not in power it would be bad for Bord na Móna.  We have heard shades of that view this evening. However, we have to deal with facts: this Government has delivered to Bord na Móna that which was sought for the past few years.  In latter years Bord na Móna has diversified and this boost will give it the opportunity to expand, develop and experiment with the various aspects of its operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Finneran that Bord na Móna acquired a lot of bog at a low price.  However, many farmers got employment from Bord na Móna and <Col N="1740" /> did well out of it.  Bord na Móna has given a lot of employment in the midlands and the west.  I am glad it will now have a chance move forward.  Many of Bord na Móna's problems through the years were the result of bad weather.  In some of the areas into which it will diversify perhaps it will not be as subject to the weather.  Bord na Móna's expertise has been called upon abroad.  In many ways we can be proud of Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, particularly the section dealing with Bord na Móna.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg) Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to deal with the various points made.  I thank Senators for the positive response they have given to the Bill.  I do not propose to deal in any great detail with what Senator Ross had to say.  It was the usual extreme right wing rant we have come to expect from the Senator.  Most of what he said was entirely irrelevant to the content of the Bill; I would describe it as unadulterated rubbish.  I read the same rubbish from Senator Ross in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> every week.</P>
      <P>I reject every point he made: he said nothing with which I could agree.  His ignorance of the subject is culpable.  He is not an ignorant person arriving unknowingly to the issues.  He ignores the House and is ignorant arising from that.  He was not here for the opening speech but seemed to think he is capable of dealing with the matter without having read the Bill, heard the opening speeches or waited for the response to his comments.  He will remain culpably ignorant.</P>
      <P>British Gas, which was forced to do what he suggests we do to our company, will lose £1 billion this year &mdash; not over a period of ten years &mdash; directly arising from the imposition of the type of policies Senator Ross says we should apply to our companies.  Enough of Senator Ross.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was surprised at the unusually and uncharacteristically negative response <Col N="1741" /> from Senator Finneran.  Most of the points he made are outside the remit of the Bill and outside my remit as Minister of State.  I have taken note of the points made and I will come back to him personally when they have been examined. As they are outside the remit of the Bill I do not propose to respond to them now.</P>
    <P>I concur with Senator Daly's remarks about Dr. Paddy Moriarty, former ESB chairman.  He gave great service not just to the ESB but to the country over many years.</P>
    <P>Many Senators asked what exactly was involved in the funding of Bord na Móna.  We propose to provide in this Bill a legal facility so that money can be transferred to Bord na Móna which it will not have to repay to the State. There is currently no legal basis for giving money which does not have to be repaid to any State body.  The Minister will now have power to invest in a State company.  The amount of £100 million in the Bill is the first tranche of the £120 million and it is envisaged that will be paid in 1995, 1996 and 1997.  I assure Senator Daly this is not a similar proposal to that which found disfavour in the other House recently.</P>
    <P>The Senator also raised the issue of radon gas, which is not directly pertinent although there is a section in the Bill which deals with radiation.  A national survey is currently being undertaken and when it comes to a house-holder's area, he or she may have his or her premises tested free of charge.  I have prepared proposals, which I am pursuing with the Government, to provide assistance to remedy the presence of radon gas in houses.  The gas arises from the decay of uranium naturally in the soil and it collects in houses and other buildings.  Studies indicate it gives rise to a high incidence of lung cancer &mdash; the figures for deaths arising from radon in Britain are frightening.  I welcome the support of the House, from the Opposition as well as the Government side, for measures we are behoven to take to remedy and eliminate radon gas from homes, schools, etc.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1742" /> Senator Daly also covered insulation and conservation of energy.  The Irish Energy Centre supports Energy Action. a community based organisation involved in the insulation of houses of less well off people, mainly the old. Other measures are being taken by other Departments in regard to insulation but energy conservation is a much wider area which I covered in an earlier statement to this House and will discuss again at a later stage.</P>
    <P>Senator Enright asked when the new 120 megawatt power station would be likely to be notified for indication of first interest; I understand this will be done in January this year.  We also propose a second power station, of 30 megawatt capacity.</P>

It will also be open to competition; the successful competitor will decide where it will be located and there are a number of possibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1743" /> I thank Senator Henry for spotting the difficulty between our primary legislation and European legislation on radiation. Senator Cassidy mentioned the extension of the gas network.  As I said in my initial contribution, the Government has given BGÉ a criterion that any extension of the network must be commercial. That does not take into account the social element in the extension.  The same point was made by Senator Sherlock. That being said, I have asked the board of BGÉ to look specifically at a number of towns.  I hope to see a circle from Limerick to Shannon, Galway and through the midlands to meet the gas pipeline.  It has been extended to Maynooth now because Intel attracted it, not because I am there.  The decision was made about that before my time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Intel, the major user in the area, made it possible to extend gas to Maynooth and Leixlip and I will raise the possibility of extending it to Mallow, as gas is already in that town.</P>
      <P>Senator Sherlock also mentioned the tariff whereby one must buy a certain amount of gas &mdash; one could say one had to waste gas &mdash; to reach the cheap level. The review of the tariff has been completed and we will announce a new pricing system for gas in early January.  The waste element will be taken out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry to have to confirm to the Senator that Kinsale Head gas, even with the associated Ballycotton field, will run out in about five years at our current level of usage.  That is quite a long time as far as the exploration is concerned and I am hopeful we will have found other resources within that time.  Even if we have not, we will be able to buy gas and import it through the interconnector we have now provided, which is a great security.  We now have two points of supply.  We are also discussing with the Northern Ireland authorities the possibility of an interconnector to them &mdash; they are building an interconnector to Scotland, which <Col N="1744" /> would also provide security of supply in the event of a breakdown.</P>
    <P>I assure Senator O'Sullivan of my support for hydro power and for a continuation of it where possible.  It is not true, as she mistakenly thought, that it is entirely environmentally friendly.  There are some problems with spawning rivers where we have put in small hydro schemes and we are looking at new systems which avoid the damage done and allow further small hydro plants to go ahead.</P>
    <P>We will continue with the alternatives from wind, for which we have an application for 73 megawatt capacity.  That amount of energy would, in one year, prevent 73,000 tonnes of CO 2 sulphur dioxide and other pollutants which would arise from the burning of fossil fuels.  That is the measure of saving &mdash; for every megawatt produced from alternatives that do not involve incineration, such as wind and hydro, we prevent 1,000 tonnes of atmospheric pollution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill introduces modest and limited amendments to the Licensing Acts.  Its main aim is to ensure that shops and supermarkets that have licensed sections can open as if it was a weekday on any Christmas Eve or 23 December that falls on Sunday.  The last time Christmas Eve or 23 December fell on a Sunday was five years ago.  This year Christmas Eve is on Sunday and then <Col N="1745" /> the legislation will not be relevant until the year 2000 and I cannot say who will be here then.</P>
      <P>The Bill has a simple and straightforward purpose.  It recognises that people like to shop, eat out or simply meet their friends for a drink on Christmas Eve, even when it falls on a Sunday.  It will facilitate retail businesses and consumers alike in the immediate run up to Christmas.  In the interests of fairness, its provisions will extend to other licensed premises and registered clubs.</P>
      <P>With Christmas Eve falling on a Sunday this year, restricted trading hours would apply to premises licensed to sell alcohol, like shops, supermarkets, pubs, restaurants and off licences.  Were that to remain the position, it would cause unnecessary difficulties for people who rely on food shops being opened during their final preparations for the festive season.  I have in mind people shopping for fresh foods in the run up to Christmas and those persons who like shopping up to the last moment; people for whom such shopping has become a tradition.  Of course, many people like to shop and sample the Christmas atmosphere as family groups on Christmas Eve.  There are also those who, because of work commitments or because some family members are living or working away from home, find it difficult to organise a family shopping day until Christmas is almost upon them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present position under the Licensing Acts is that, when Christmas Eve falls on a Sunday, licensed premises cannot open for business until 12.30 p.m. and have to close their doors between 2.00 p.m. and 4.00 p.m.  For the owners of, and shoppers in, most premises with off licences this would mean an unpleasant day.  One could easily envisage the chaos that would ensue in supermarkets, especially at the check-outs, if the available shopping time was shortened on what is one of the busiest days of the year.  Some shop owners might take the view that trading on Christmas Eve would be so disjointed, it would be better, safer even, to keep their premises <Col N="1746" /> closed all day.  Uncertainty as to which shops would open and which would close would add to the problems for shoppers.</P>
    <P>Pubs and off licences will be able to open as if it was a weekday on what is normally a very busy day for them, a day on which persons who may not have met one another for a year may want to socialise over a drink.  The supply of meals in hotels and restaurants with wine or pub type licences would be restricted without a change.  Such premises would not be able to open between the hours of 3.00 p.m. and 4.00 p.m.</P>
    <P>That is why I have decided to introduce this short Bill, which this year will do no more than allow shops with licensed sections, pubs, registered clubs and restaurants with licences, to operate on Christmas Eve as they did last year and ever other year that it falls on a weekday.  It will not provide for later opening hours in public houses because their closing time on Sunday nights and week nights during the winter months is 11 p.m.</P>
    <P>Section 2 will allow licensed premises to operate weekday permitted hours on any Sunday that falls on Christmas Eve or on 23 December.  Section 4 extends that concept to restaurants and hotels that serve alcohol with substantial meals.  Section 5 extends it to registered clubs and section 6 extends it to restaurants with special restaurant licences. Section 3 will allow licensed premises which also have non-licensing business to operate the weekday mixed trading provisions of the licensing Acts on any Christmas Eve or 23 December that falls on a Sunday.</P>
    <P>Section 2 amends the general permitted hours provision of the licensing Acts so the hours that apply to premises such as public houses, hotel bars and restaurants with full licenses as well as off licences and supermarkets which retail the full range of alcoholic drinks, will, on any Christmas Eve or 23 December that falls on a Sunday, be the same as if either such day was a week day.  I am including in my proposal any year that 23 December falls on a Sunday, as the <Col N="1747" /> arguments for week day hours on a Christmas Eve Sunday also apply to any 23 December that falls on a Sunday. The net effect of section 2 is that the premises I have referred to will be able to open for licensed business at 10.30 a.m. on Christmas Eve this year and will not have to close between 2.00 p.m. and 4.00 p.m.</P>
    <P>Section 3 deals with mixed trading. For anyone who may not be familiar with the concept, mixed trading, in the context of the licensing Acts, refers to businesses which involve both the sale of drink &mdash; licensed businesses &mdash; and the sale of other commodities, referred to as non-licensed business.  The licensing Acts make allowance for the demands of such businesses by permitting them to open early during weekdays for non-licensed business only. This is to facilitate, for instance, the delivery of goods from suppliers to businesses such as a grocery with an off licence.  Section 3 will enable these week day mixed trading provisions to apply to the premises concerned on a Christmas Eve or 23 December which falls on a Sunday.  That means shops with off licences attached will be able to open for non-licensed business at 7.30 a.m. on Christmas Eve this year and shops and supermarkets with off licences will be able to open for non-licensed business at 9.00 a.m.</P>
    <P>Such businesses are simply being allowed to commence their non-licensed business on Christmas Eve this year as on every other year that Christmas Eve falls on a weekday.  The licensed business will commence at 10.30 a.m.  This is the reason, not always well understood or appreciated, persons can purchase their shopping in, for example, supermarkets from 9.00 a.m. on a weekday but have to wait until 10.30 a.m. to purchase alcohol.</P>
    <P>Section 13 of the 1927 Intoxicating Liquor Act, as amended, allows less restrictive hours to apply to the sale of alcohol with meals in hotels and restaurants. Section 4 will extend the more generous week day provisions to 23 or <Col N="1748" /> 24 December which falls on a Sunday. Thus, that section will allow, for example, a family which is delayed by shopping or other reasons, to obtain a meal in any of the premises concerned at any time in the afternoon of the coming Christmas Eve.  Without this amendment it could not do so between 3.00 p.m. and 4.00 p.m.  It will also allow hotels and restaurants to serve alcoholic drinks with substantial meals on a 23 December that falls on a Sunday as if it were a week night, i.e. until 12.30 a.m. When 24 December is a Sunday, alcoholic drinks can only be served and consumed with substantial meals until midnight, because, except where there is specific statutory intervention, Christmas Day is a closed day in licensed premises.</P>
    <P>Section 5 extends the proposed changes to registered clubs and section 6 extends them to restaurants with special restaurant licences.  In the case of restaurants with special restaurant licences, the usual Sunday afternoon times when alcoholic drinks cannot be served with substantial meals is slightly different from other licensed premises &mdash; it is 3.00 p.m. to 6.00 p.m.  Therefore, this year persons eating out in such restaurants on Christmas Eve will be able to have a drink with their meal no matter what time of the afternoon they are eating.</P>
    <P>Like the Minister for the Environment I too call for sanity and care on our roads over Christmas.  There has been a marked change in peoples' habits when it comes to driving without drink and it is essential that this change extends to all.  The Garda will enforce the law vigorously and I appeal to drivers to have patience when queues of traffic build up at Garda check points as we will all be winners in the end if fewer people drink and drive.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the co-operation of the Senators to these proposed modest changes in the law.  I also expect and look forward to other issues relevant to the licensing Acts being raised.  I will listen carefully to any points made. While this legislation does not allow for <Col N="1749" /> a widespread review of the licensing Acts in the short term, it is only a matter of time before such a review is required.</P>
    <P>When this Bill went through the Dáil, we dealt with many matters, such as pubs in tourist areas, selling drugs in licensed premises, opening hours, deregulating and confining hours, not allowing drink to be sold in certain places etc.  However, the purpose of this Bill is to ensure this proposal is operable by 24 December.  The next time this becomes relevant is in the year 2000.  If I had allowed the Dáil debate to colour my actions, it would have been that year before this change was made.</P>
    <P>I ask for a short debate not because I believe Senators will make invalid points on the licensing laws but amendments asking me to look at similar cases for St. Patrick's Day and New Year's Eve were put down.  I do not believe that any other day in the year meets the same circumstances that I am trying to tackle here &mdash; that is, the combination of a family shopping day and the kind of celebrating that people do around Christmas time.  The same thing does not necessarily apply to some of the other days that were mentioned, but that is not to say that at a later stage people might not make comments about that.  I suggested in the Dáil that licensing legislation &mdash; some of it dating back many years &mdash; could be reviewed by the committees of the House.</P>
    <P>Nothing is more destined to raise a head of steam than matters which require licences, such as fish, taxis and drink.  We have an antenna that builds up a huge head of steam about anything we need a licence for.  Relevant changes were suggested to me by Members in the Dáil but even minor changes to the licensing laws can have a knock-on effect for other groups, for example, those concerned about the use of alcohol in our society.</P>
    <P>I make these concluding remarks so Members will not think that I am being discourteous or ungracious.  I hope I have built up a record in this House of normally being very open to amendments. <Col N="1750" /> However, in this instance, I will get my retaliation in first by saying that I will not be in a position to accept amendments.</P>

I do not think that my grandchildren would be terribly enamoured at being thrown out of the restaurant at a certain time.  Christmas Eve is a time of celebration when families get together.

      <P>Somebody here is looking for an extension of time on a Saturday night.  There are others who think the Intoxicating Liquor Acts are too liberal and that every publican is a drug dealer.  Such people suggest that the situation we living in should be changed. It is nonsense to think we can change people's attitudes by restricting the liquor laws.  People who serve intoxicating liquor have been extremely careful over the years.  In the courts it has been proven that they tried to abide by the Intoxicating Liquor Acts as best they could.</P>
      <P>There have been times when people went over the top and misused the situation. Generally speaking, however, if one takes the social aspect of society, publicans have done a fantastic deal with the public providing them with outlets where they can mix and converse in a safe ambience.  That is a fact.  There have been a small number of cases where people have not abided by the rules.  I am 57 years of age, going on 58, and I cannot remember five people who have lost their liquor licences because they did not abide by the rules.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1752" /> There is a need to examine the licences under which people who sell liquor operate.  I have no doubt that trading on Sundays does not generate any more business for supermarkets or shops than trading from Monday to Saturday does.  Christmas Eve falls on a Sunday this year.  I will get my turkey from a certain shop on Sunday and I will bring my three grandchildren and my father into a restaurant.  Obviously, my grandchildren will not be taking intoxicating liquor but this change means we will all be able to stay in a restaurant and enjoy its facilities during times that were prohibited last year.  I thank the Minister for bringing forward this necessary piece of social legislation which is not going to change society.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard will now tell us the story of rural publicans who had to close down on Christmas Eve in the past. When was the last time that Christmas Eve fell on a Sunday?</P>

      <P>I am a licensed vintner. I compliment the Minister on introducing this desirable legislation, which I support.  Although I will not table amendments, I will take up the Minister's invitation to refer to other issues. However, I am conscious that the Minister said she would retaliate first.  This is a welcome step and is an indication of a reforming attitude for which the Minister is noted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1753" /> This legislation is long overdue.  The Minister is revising outdated legislation. She referred to the 1927 Act, but the founding statue dates back to 1833.  As Senator Lanigan said, great changes have taken place in society since then. The Minister accepts that the time is approaching when society will insist on updating legislation which has its roots in a statute dating back to 1833.</P>
    <P>When the results of this extension on Christmas Eve is reviewed by the Minister, I hope she will be encouraged to go further during the year.  Although she indicated that she would not look too favourably on other dates, certain times during the year require special consideration.  Senator Lanigan referred to New Year's Eve and the difficulty of trying to get people to leave a licensed premises when they want to ring in the New Year.  It is something which only those of us engaged in the trade must confront head on.  I am conscious of the difficulties my fellow publicans face. That is a date to which the Minister should extend this legislation, but there are others.</P>
    <P>We are unique in Europe as regards our opening hours.  The Minister expressed consideration for families shopping on Christmas Eve who wish to have a meal together like the extended Lanigan family where four generations will sit down together in comfort.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a record that I am unlikely to beat, but I congratulate Senator Lanigan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the coming months the Minister should extend that consideration to tourist areas.  Tourists find it extraordinary that on a summer's evening when it is still daylight our liquor licensing laws oblige them to leave the premises in which they are enjoying themselves. That does not happen in other European countries, yet we continue to treat tourists in this way.  It does not help that <Col N="1754" /> industry which is so important to the economy.</P>
    <P>I always feel discriminated against &mdash; other interests in the licensed trade may not agree with me &mdash; when I am told to clear my premises at 11.30 p.m. A number of people who leave my premises will go down the road to a disco or a club where they can continue to drink for many hours.  There is no question of a meal being served in the disco or a members' register being produced in the club, although they are requirements of the law.  Of the three outlets, I and those who trade in seven day licences premises are the only ones who are expected to fully comply with the law.  That is discrimination and it must be considered.  I would not mind if everyone closed at 11.30 p.m. or 2 a.m. once we all had the opportunity to compete on a level playing pitch.  Summary justice requires that that be considered in the near future and I would expect a reforming Minister to do so.</P>
    <P>I join the Minister's appeal for care on the roads over Christmas.  We all know about the mayhem in the licensed trade 12 months ago because of legislation which the Minister for the Environment and his colleagues in their wisdom amended.  There is a responsibility on those involved in the trade to try to reduce the number of accidents caused by drink driving.  I am satisfied that is happening this year.  I compliment the gardaí I meet travelling to and from Leinster House in recent weeks on their courtesy.  They are doing an excellent job and ensure that roads are safe.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a discussion I heard on the radio two weeks ago.  A senior garda officer said that an analysis of road accidents showed that the greatest cause of accidents on the road is speeding followed by careless driving and then people under the influence of medication and drugs.  The fourth cause is drink driving.  He also pointed out that the number of accidents due to speeding is almost double the combined figure for the next two causes.  Last week driving through fog to get to the House I witnessed outrageously dangerous <Col N="1755" /> driving and speeding by other drivers. A combination of speed and dangerous driving was involved.  I know I have strayed from the content of the Bill but I am sure the Minister will not have any objection to that.  I congratulate the Minister on the Bill and wish it a speedy passage through the House.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill on behalf of my colleagues in the licensed trade.  We encourage her in the light of the experience that will emerge from this Christmas Eve to look at other special days, or more importantly, to look at providing a level playing field for all who operate in the licensed trade in terms of hours.  I do not mind what the closing hours are, provided they are adhered to by everybody.  I feel unreasonably disadvantaged if I have to tell people to leave my premises when I know they can go to two other types of premises where the law will not be observed as carefully as I am obliged to observe it.</P>
    <P>Tourism is an important industry; it is a growing industry.  We are getting a higher proportion of tourists from continental Europe &mdash; I welcome this &mdash; but they simply cannot understand being obliged to leave licensed premises while there is still daylight because, in their own country, many of them would only be going to a licensed premises.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>As chairman of a company which has two hotels in this town, I too have vast experience in the tourism <Col N="1756" /> industry.  I fully respect the responsibility and honour with which most people in the liquor trade carry out their duties.  They have the good of their customers in mind.  I concur with Senator Howard in regard to the level playing pitch.  It is not fair that a publican has to let his customers out at 11 p.m. in winter to comply with the law when they can go to the local disco.  They do not have to pay any admission charge into the local disco and there is no meal there. This is against all the regulations.  I asked the Minister the last time she visited this House to clarify this point. Somebody is not doing their duty in that regard.</P>
      <P>It costs millions of pounds to locate a hotel in a particular community and hotels give very high employment.  Any hotel worth its salt employs 25 staff in a 30 bed unit or over 50 staff in a 100 bed unit.  One establishment in this town employs 400 in a hotel that can seat up to 1,200 people in its conference centre. That is massive employment.  There must be a level playing pitch for the ordinary seven day licence publican.  No public house must be allowed to stay open.  I would like to know, if a pub has a special restaurant licence, whether it must sell a certain percentage of its takings to be classified to have a licence, and do the Revenue Commissioners supply certificates in that regard?  If not, how are they allowed to serve drink until 2 a.m. when, if they have a restaurant certificate, they can only serve for one hour after the pub is supposed to close anyway?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some 90 per cent of venues run until 1.30 a.m. or 2 a.m. on a Sunday morning. I am unfortunately one of the 10 per cent.  In particular in rural Ireland they do this not because they want to, but of necessity.  The week's entertainment now takes place on Saturday night. Years ago it used to be Friday, Saturday and Sunday, now it is Saturday.  Sunday night does not have anything like the value it used to.  I agree with Senator Howard that the Minister is a reforming person; we look forward to great things in the future from her.  Sunday night <Col N="1757" /> could be forfeited for Saturday night as people congregate on a Saturday night and some 68 per cent of those Catholics still go to Mass on Saturday evenings.  I would welcome any change that can be achieved.</P>
    <P>I also concur with Senator Howard, a man of wide knowledge who has the respect of the public licensed trade, about New Year's Eve this year.  Must hotels close at 11 p.m. for one hour, reopen at 12 midnight and serve for one hour?  That is the legislation, as far as I understand it, in regard to Sunday night. That is unfortunate; it is unfortunate that the other House is in recess because as Members know, on New Year's Eve, you have to ring out the old and ring in the new.  This is all happening when the pubs and hotels are closed.  It is not common sense.  All good legislation must make common sense.</P>
    <P>I welcome wholeheartedly the changes in regard to 23 and 24 December, they are necessary social changes.  I do not partake of intoxicating liquor; I am one of the 200,000 members of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association, but I see the need for this change. However, to leave the situation in regard to New Year's Eve as it is must have been a massive oversight because on New Year's Eve the meal is generally served around 10 p.m. and you cannot have a drink with your meal because the premises must close for one hour between 11 p.m. and midnight on a Sunday night.  In the winter, hotels are obliged to close at 10 p.m. and may serve food for one hour afterwards, that is, 11 p.m.  Senator Kiely would know about this, he has attended many functions in the course of his political and sporting career.  It is impractical to expect the Garda to enforce this provision where premises must close between 11 p.m. and midnight on New Year's Eve.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  There will be no amendments from this side of the House.  I wish it a safe passage.</P>

      <P>Both the taking and the discussion of drink are among our favourite national pastimes; there is no doubt about that. Measures regarding pub opening hours and drink driving limits and such are subjects always calculated to excite heated debate.  The publicans lobby regards any moves to regulate the consumption of alcohol as a personal affront.  The Bill before us is a common sense piece of legislation to allow the sale of intoxicating liquor, subject to normal weekday licensing hours this Christmas.  To a large extent our licensing laws have served us well and I favour their retention and improved implementation. However, the problems associated with alcohol will not be reduced by retaining legislation on the Statute Book.  Ireland must be one of the few countries which bans its indigenous liquor, poitín.</P>

In this regard, I welcome the campaign by Canon Donal O'Driscoll &mdash; the retired parish priest of Ballycotten &mdash; for its legalisation and the establishment of legal poitín distilleries, subject to proper controls.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I urge the Minister to examine the current practice in this regard as the people who stay in pubs during extended hours are often those who can ill afford it.</P>
      <P>The rigour of our licensing hours legislation is not matched by the rigour with which we prosecute alcohol-related offences, particularly those relating to minors.  In 1994 proceedings were initiated against only 27 off-licence proprietors, 17 of whom were convicted, for selling liquor to children under 18 years of age.  Fewer still were prosecuted for allowing unaccompanied minors to enter their premises.  Yet we have all seen children buying alcohol in off-licences and licensed premises.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed at the application of the law which prohibits the sale of intoxicating liquor to people under 18 years of age.  When children reach 18 years of age they will, at least, be mature and know whether they want to partake of alcoholic beverages. However, young people of 14, 15 or 16 years of age can obtain alcohol in licensed premises or at discos.  That is not good enough and great emphasis should be placed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is a prohibition on the sale of intoxicating liquor up to 18 years of age and this should be applied.  Heavier sanctions should be placed on proprietors who contravene the legislation.  I would also like to see a much clearer physical distinction made between the grocery and off licence business of liquor selling retailers.  It is unacceptable that children should be forced to walk through rows of shelves containing bottles of alcohol to reach grocery sections in an off-licence store. I would like to see the introduction of legislation to prohibit off licences which do not sell groceries from stocking sweets, snacks and other goods which children are likely to purchase.</P>

      <P>A problem exists in relation to hotels across the country where alcohol cannot be served after 12.30 on Saturday night. Will the Minister consider the possibility of developing legislation to take account of this problem?  A hotelier contacted me yesterday and stated he had received five or six summonses on Saturday night for having people on the premises after a particular time, none of whom had been served with alcohol but were merely finishing their drinks.  I do not believe this hotelier should be prosecuted as on Friday and Sunday nights people can drink until the early hours of the morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having experienced that phase of life in the 1970s and 1980s, it would benefit <Col N="1761" /> the workforce if there were no late opening on Sunday nights.</P>

      <P>We must be radical and state this fact.  As a result of doing so, the industry might not lose so many days to absenteeism.  I acknowledge it is not the only reason that many workdays are lost.  However, I would like to see the statistics regarding those people who miss work on Mondays as opposed to other days in the week.  As public representatives, we have different ways of considering the country's problems and this problem is one of which I am acutely aware.</P>
      <P>Senator Sherlock raised the issue of young people being allowed to drink alcohol at discos but I am not aware of any in my constituency.  However, I understand that there is a disco near where I was born which sells alcohol to children of 14 or 15 years of age.  This is wrong.</P>
      <P>I attended a function a number of years ago and I was asked why as a public representative I would not do something about young people being served alcohol on that premises.  I made the point that perhaps those young people did not buy the alcohol themselves, that someone else purchased it for them. This is often the case.  I would appreciate the opportunity to have a longer discussion on this matter.  We must deal with this problem and regularise the way we think and the way in which we would like to see our society work for young people.  We can make a serious and positive contribution in this regard.</P>
      <P>I spoke to the Minister in relation to this matter on a previous occasion.  Perhaps she will consider the introduction of legislation to deal with the problems to which I referred.  Our request will improve the lives of many people and the statistics of those who miss work on Mondays would change dramatically.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators for contributing in such a knowledgeable, caring and responsible <Col N="1762" /> manner.  As Senator Howard stated, there are points to be made about our laws which date back to 1833 and a time when circumstances were very different. I also thank Senators for their understanding of the role that alcohol plays in the lives of underage drinkers and families, which can lead to domestic violence, etc.  Any debate in connection with licensing laws cannot take place in a vacuum.  Alcohol is being sold and we must be conscious that any changes might have an effect on people's lives, apart from the people who enjoy a social drink and the 99 per cent of responsible publicans and hoteliers.  I welcome the fact that Members tempered their remarks in this regard.</P>
      <P>Section 12 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1962 allows specifically for special exemptions to be granted for any Sunday that is New Year's Day, New Year's Eve or St. Patrick's Day so the far-sighted legislators in 1962 saw there would be a problem.  For some reason they did not think of Christmas Eve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>It means now we can safely get rid of that.  There is no doubt it is an anomaly that on New Year's Eve you can get an extension at midnight but must shut at 11 p.m. and not serve drink for an hour.</P>
      <P>There are other implications which have to do with staffing, the availability of transport, etc.  I was anxious not to extend this legislation into an area where someone would have an argument for another day.  Those who are interested can quote section 12 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1962 for New Year's Day, New Year's Eve and St. Patrick's Day which are already covered for special exemptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Howard and others raised the question of tourism with regard to public houses, hotels and restaurants with licences and it is an area which requires examination.  I would be less than honest if I did not say that tourists are not always thrown out of the pubs at closing <Col N="1763" /> time.  In no way can I condone the breaking of any licensing law but I am quite sure there are Senators who would be able to tell me anecdotes of times when they might have been in a pub at 11.5 p.m., 11.35 p.m. or 12.5 a.m. in a tourism area.  It is fair to say there is a case to be made for examining facilities for tourists who are, after all, able to lie on in the morning as they do not have the same pressures as when they are working.  It is not a simple matter of picking tourism areas and allowing later opening hours.  Everywhere could claim to be a tourism area and if we provided for that, we might as well change the laws prevailing everywhere.  If we just selected places like Kilrush, Ennis, Dingle, Carlingford and some of the obvious tourism areas, we could create more danger on the road because people would leave one place to race to where the nearest pub which would be open.  It sounds simple to say we must designate these areas and give them an extra hour or two because there are tourists there but a tourist can travel from one place to another, even the most isolated places.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the whole country can be regarded as a tourism area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is it.  It leads to the whole area of trade unions, staff terms of work, pay, days off, holidays, the availability of transport and all the other issues.  That is why there is a need in reviewing the legislation to give a more considered period of time for that review.  Perhaps, the Seanad could have a three or four hour debate on this matter in order to trawl through the issues and draw up a checklist of all the different problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Senators raised the issue of special licences for discos and clubs and the fact that they do not get the same treatment from the Garda.  I cannot speak with huge experience but I know there are a number of disco-type premises that have been prosecuted for all sorts of reasons, including allowing <Col N="1764" /> drugs to be sold on their premises, and I get calls from disco owners who are unhappy that the Garda are hassling them.  It is fair to say we are all aware that people can leave a pub when it shuts and can buy drink somewhere else for two or three more hours because they are supposedly getting food, etc. Many road accidents happen then and not at normal closing time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>They have licences but often they breach the terms of the licences.</P>
      <P>Senator Cassidy raised the issue of seven day licences but I would like to finish the point on exemptions after midnight on Saturday nights.  There have been calls for liberalisation on Saturday night and Senators made the point that there has been a change in people's socialising habits.  I mentioned a change in social habits which I noticed where, particularly around Christmas, people always make sure they have a driver who does not drink when they plan their nights out.  Equally valid is the fact that Saturday night is now the main night out.  People tend to have changed their habits.  They might have a family night on Friday and like to stay out late on Saturday night and get a baby-sitter, etc. so there is a validity in the argument that we should look at licences for Saturday night which run into Sunday morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once we start looking at Sundays, there is another group of people who will participate in an element of the debate.  We would have to allow all points of view to be taken into consideration. Since people can practise their religion on Saturday night and that has also changed the way people behave. The number of early morning Sunday masses has been changed to make <Col N="1765" /> allowances for the greater numbers attending on Saturday evening.</P>
    <P>There has been a steady rise in the number of special exemptions.  Last year, there were 55,000 special exemption licences granted and I do not believe the legislation ever intended to allow for so many.  These licences were supposed to be confined to special occasions and I am afraid that description has now extended practically to somebody crossing the road.  The worry I have about over liberalising the laws is that people, if they so wished, could stay drinking all night through.</P>
    <P>We must recognise that alcohol plays a part in domestic violence.  There is also the serious problem of under age drinking and antisocial behaviour.  As responsible people, we may all say that if we feel like staying out drinking until 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. that is all right but there will be people who will stay in pubs until they shut.  There will be drinking up time irrespective of what time people decide to leave the pub.  One cannot really get rid of that and we are all the same.  If you have a deadline, you leave it until the last minute.</P>
    <P>The other area to which we would have to give consideration in any debate about liberalising our laws is the issue of transport.  It is not such a big issue in the cities but it would be an issue if pubs were open until all hours.  Transport in urban areas tends to coincide with closing time but there would be an increased need for taxis or people might be tempted to drive if they were drinking until 2 a.m. when the buses are not running rather than taking taxis.  I know that worry exists now with discos and late exemptions.  Every time an argument is put forward for something I am sure all of us can find a matching one which will cause a problem on the other side.</P>
    <P>Senator Cassidy raised the incidence of late opening in public houses and there is no doubt there are pubs which sell alcohol right into the early hours of the morning.  These pubs seem to be doing this on the basis of full restaurant certificates.  A pub may obtain a restaurant <Col N="1766" /> certificate from a court if it can convince the court that the premises are, as section 12 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1927 puts it, structurally adapted for use and mainly used as a restaurant, refreshment house or other place for supplying substantial meals to the public.  That Act was passed in 1927. The restaurant certificate entitles the licensee to serve drink with meals until 12.30 a.m.  It also entitles the licensee to apply to the District Court for a special exemption which would enable the pub to remain open later.  Before such an order could be granted the court would have to be satisfied that a special occasion is taking place.  Those special occasions have become cheapened by the numbers &mdash; 55,000 at this stage.</P>
    <P>Senator Sherlock referred to poitín and said that the rules were antiquated. I am sure the Minister for Finance would like to hear the Senator's comments because he would be happy to tax anything he could.  There is no doubt that the laws on poitín are antiquated.  I recently encountered a case of a young person being fined an enormous sum of money &mdash; about £600 &mdash; for having 20 millilitres of poitín while all around him were young people with ecstacy tablets and other drugs.  My common sense told me that the amount of poitín he had &mdash; albeit illegal &mdash; was far less damaging to his health than ecstacy tablets or other drugs.  He happened to be caught with the little bottle and the law provided that he be fined this amount.  It highlighted how antiquated the law is.  I am not saying that I will amend the law to legalise poitín; nobody need get that impression.  However, the issue can be part of the debate on the intoxicating liquor Acts.</P>
    <P>Senator Sherlock also spoke about minors and under age drinking and he referred to the 1988 Act.  There are many strong clauses in the Act.  Unfortunately, young people are ingenious and are often aided and abetted by people over 18 who will go into off-licences and pubs to purchase liquor for them.  There has been a bad reaction to obligatory identification cards; there is <Col N="1767" /> an aversion to them.  It is a little like licences &mdash; people seem to have a fear of obligatory identification cards.  There are more than 100 voluntary schemes for young people under 18 and they have been very successful.  There are also many responsible publicans who put somebody on door duty, particularly in areas where there is a high concentration of young people socialising. These doormen stop young people entering the premises if they are under age.  Indeed, I have received complaints from friends of my children who, although they are over 21, were stopped from going into a premises because they look younger.  They asked me to intervene but I told them to fight their own battles and advised them to bring their birth certificates or some identification to show their age.</P>
    <P>There is a greater role that we as parents and adults can play with regard to under age drinking.  We must get control of the situation.  The law, which includes the public order legislation passed last year, is available.  The reality is that we all know many people under 18 who drink in public and manage to get drink in pubs.  The gardaí are aware of the problem and there have been prosecutions, although maybe not as many as there should be.</P>
    <P>An interesting point was made about forfeiting Sunday night extensions to allow a double extension as it were. That is something I can examine. Senator Farrelly mentioned the degree of absenteeism on Mondays as a result of extensions on Sunday nights.  That is a valid point.  If people consume extra drink on Saturday night at least they have all day Sunday to prepare themselves for work on Monday.</P>
    <P>Many points raised tonight are relevant to a much wider debate on the licensing laws.  I recommend that the Seanad use a less rushed opportunity to look at the licensing laws, perhaps through the committees of the House or through a Seanad committee.  The last examination of the licensing laws took place in 1987 but it did not deal with <Col N="1768" /> fundamental issues such as deregulation and the abolition of licences and, perhaps, it is time we widened the debate into those areas.  However, the alcohol issue gives rise to great concern among many people because of the damage it can do and we must temper any debate with that thought in mind.  I thank the Senators for their contributions on this pragmatic Bill.</P>

      <P>My understanding of a substantial meal is that it would consist of something like chicken and chips.  I am not sure that the section defines a substantial meal because what is a substantial meal to the Senator might only be a snack for somebody else.  Essentially it refers to a plate of salad or a hot meal; a small sandwich accompanied by a slice of tomato would not be considered a substantial meal.</P>

      <P>That is not acceptable.  If one has a full restaurant licence the menu would offer a few courses including starter, main course and dessert.  The main course would be the substantial meal.  Chicken and chips would not be a substantial meal.  It was not considered a substantial meal in the courts when I was seeking a licence.  There must be a main course.  However, some places which run functions do not offer a wafer, let alone a meal.  The Minister <Col N="1769" /> would have the support of the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This does not apply to most hotel discos in the midlands as they are confined to those over 21 years of age. Will the Minister give a directive at an early stage that there cannot be extensions without the charge of £2 set in 1962 being indexed linked to bring it up to its equivalent value today?  Providing free after hours opening, and advertising this, is making a laughing stock of the regulations under which 90 to 95 per cent of publicans have to run their businesses.</P>

      <P>I warmly welcome the Bill.  It will allow people to socialise, have a few drinks and go home early on Christmas Eve.  When deciding on applications for exemptions, most courts demand that menus be produced so that they can see what food is served.  The legislation should ensure menus are provided. If people have meals during functions on 23 December for which special exemptions have been granted, there is less chance of them overindulging in intoxicating liquor.  This is the reason for the provision with regard to meals and it should be enforced.  On Christmas Eve and during Christmas, while it is not provided for in the Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House to take this matter. This issue arose at Meath County Council level.  Many people in Bettystown and Laytown were annoyed earlier this year because of cars being vandalised and a number of other incidents.  Manpower at Laytown Garda Station has remained constant for many years at one sergeant and three gardaí.  Would it be possible for extra gardaí to be assigned to the station during the busy tourist season?  This is not too much to request.  The Assistant Garda Commissioner has said the force is happy with the position as it is but local people do not share this view, given that there were a large number of people in this seaside resort during this year's fine hot summer.</P>
      <P>I ask that extra gardaí be made available between June and September when people arrive at the coast in County Meath.  There was a greater number of gardaí in the station in Laytown in the past than there is today, regardless of what the Assistant Commissioner said. The Garda Commissioner should ensure a greater Garda presence during the year, when extra people visit the area, to prevent what happened in Laytown this summer.</P>
      <P>I ask for an opportunity to discuss the scaremongering &mdash; in this and the other House &mdash; on law and order.  Comments were made here today which suggested that crime only started since 15 December 1994.  We all know that is untrue.  I would like an opportunity to discuss crime and I know Senators made many comments in this regard which will help the Minister to deal with the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1774" /> There were fewer gardaí in the Meath Louth division for many years as a result of the Border.  That has changed and I hope what happened yesterday will not affect it.  We have fewer gardaí per head of population than many other parts of the country.  Perhaps the Minister could ask the commissioner to ensure a greater Garda presence in certain areas, such as the coastal areas in County Meath, when greater numbers visit.  We do not want people to take the law into their own hands as they did earlier this year.  There is no need for permanent gardaí on a full-time basis.  I ask the Minister to consider this issue.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter which is important to his area.  The Garda authorities are responsible for the detailed allocation of Garda personnel and resources to different areas. There is a perception that I allocate the gardaí to different areas each morning.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the coastal area of County Meath is policed by the gardaí attached to Laytown Garda station which covers Bettystown, Mornington, Donacarney, Julianstown and Gormanston.  The current strength of Laytown station is one sergeant and three gardaí and the station is open from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Monday to Saturday and from 12 noon to 1 p.m. on Sundays.  A direct communication link at Laytown station becomes operational when the station is unmanned which allows callers to contact the gardaí direct at the district headquarters at Drogheda.</P>
      <P>There is a patrol car allocated to Laytown station and it is utilised in patrolling the sub-district, including the coastal area referred to by the Senator. Garda coverage in the area is augmented by a district patrol car from Drogheda station.  In addition, the traffic corps and detective branch based at Drogheda also patrol the area.  At present, there are 176 gardaí of all ranks stationed in County Meath in the following stations: Kells 31, Navan 46 and Trim 22.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1775" /> Crime statistics for the Laytown area over the past three years show that there were 228 committed in 1993; 208 in 1994; the trend for 1995 suggests that the levels will be similar to 1993. However, the rate of detection in the present year has increased significantly over that achieved in 1994.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrelly suggested &mdash; I have heard this before in other areas of high tourist activity &mdash; that at certain times of the year, such as June to September, extra gardaí should be allocated to particular areas because of the growth in population because of tourism.  As Minister for Justice, I am responsible for the delivery of an efficient and effective police service to the community.  The deployment of resources in the Garda Síochána and the operation and control of the force, however, remain the responsibilities of the Garda Commissioner. The Garda authorities have informed me that when manpower next becomes available the allocation of manpower to Drogheda district will be fully considered in conjunction with the other districts throughout the Louth-Meath division.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have assured me that local Garda management continually review the policing arrangements <Col N="1776" /> in place for Laytown sub-district with a view to ensuring that optimum use is made of available resources.  I announced recently the regionalisation of the gardaí which will add to the effectiveness of policing between one district or another within these new regions. Louth-Meath belongs to the eastern region.  I hope that regionalisation will be used as a method by senior gardaí in that area to look at the changes in population and redeploy gardaí in the regions affected.  If tourists increase in one area, the chances are that another area will be quiet in the summer but full of activity in the winter.  It should give more flexibility to allow an interchange of personnel within a region.</P>
    <P>This regionalisation programme which has been put in place will make a change in the coastal regions which Senator Farrelly mentioned.  I recommend that when the programme is in place early in the New Year he should suggest to the superintendent in his locality that one way of modifying manpower during the summer months is to take up the increases in the coastal region.  I thank the Senator for raising this issue.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 9.20 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 20 December 1995.</P>
