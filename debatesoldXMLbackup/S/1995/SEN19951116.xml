      <P>I have notice from Senator Enright that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The withdrawal by the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the corncrake grant scheme and the need to immediately restore the scheme which is essential in order to restore corncrake numbers which have dramatically dropped in recent years.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <Col N="478" /> Once again horrific crimes were committed last night on the streets of Dublin. The Government would have the full co-operation of this side of the House if it introduces emergency legislation to deal with this situation which is getting out of hand.</P>

      <P>Last week we tabled a motion dealing with Government interference with the governance and charter of Trinity College and the autonomy of the colleges of the National University of Ireland.  Will the commitment we were given then be honoured and will the motion be discussed next week?</P>
      <P>When will the Voluntary Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill be brought before the House?  Will it be initiated here?  We received a commitment from the Leader that the Minister for Health would come to the House to discuss the White Paper on mental health.  I would like the Acting Leader to give an assurance that this will be dealt with within the next few weeks.</P>

      <P>It is proposed that the Harbours Bill will be taken next Wednesday.  I am sure Senator Fitzgerald will have a particular interest in this. It is possible that we may not sit next Thursday because of the referendum the following day.  Information on this will be given next week.  I agree with the Senator's condemnation of the crime level.  We have had debates on crime and we should continue to play whatever part we can with regard to this issue.  There may well be an opportunity <Col N="479" /> to discuss crime next week during Private Members' Business.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point made by Senator Norris about Mother Teresa, I am not sure what we can do about her taking part in the public debate on the divorce referendum.  Mother Teresa has the same right to free speech as anybody else and she is entitled to make her views known.  This is the nature of public debate and I am not sure we can do anything about her expressing views on the subject.</P>
      <P>I know a promise was given with regard to the motion on Trinity College and the National University of Ireland. I cannot answer for the Leader but I understand that it will be debated within the timescale promised, which was three weeks.</P>
      <P>Commitments were also given on the Voluntary Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill and the White Paper on mental health and I understand that the Minster for Health will come to the House in the near future.</P>

      <P>Nuclear safety is a matter of concern to all Irish people and is one issue about which there is consensus across all political parties.  That consensus ought to be reflected in the various parties co-operating in what is after all a national attempt to remove the direct threat imposed on the Irish people by the UK's nuclear industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since radioactivity was discovered almost 100 years ago, it has come to be realised that the benefits it offers to society are also attended by the potential for serious damage.  Nuclear weapons and nuclear power accidents like Chernobyl are at the upper end of this scale of concern.  The recent report of the breakdown of the safety culture at the Wylfa nuclear plant in Wales bought <Col N="480" /> home how close we in Ireland could be to a radiation accident.  The House will be aware the ESB has no plans for the generation of nuclear powered electricity in Ireland.  Public opinion in Ireland is firmly against nuclear energy. Our national nuclear policy objectives therefore place a heavy emphasis on nuclear safety and radiological protection.</P>
    <P>While recognising that certain countries have retained nuclear energy as an option for power generation, we remain totally opposed to any expansion of this industry, especially as certain serious problems remain unresolved.  These include the reprocessing and transport of nuclear materials, problems relating to radioactive waste disposal and the decommissioning of reactors which have reached the end of their useful life. There is also the ever present risk of a major nuclear accident whether due to safety or human failures.</P>
    <P>My Department's role in nuclear energy is to encourage the development and application of the highest safety standards in the nuclear industry worldwide. Our main focus is on issues of nuclear plant safety and radiological protection.  We participate in international organisations in the nuclear field to progress issues of safety and protection.  My Department is assisted in that role by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The RPII's statutory role and functions are contained in the Radiological Protection Act, 1991.  Generally, the institute has regulatory, monitoring and advisory responsibilities to the Government in the area of ionising radiation.  In particular, the RPII concerns itself with hazards to health associated with radiation both from nuclear plants and medical uses.  It monitors radioactivity throughout Ireland, on land, sea and in the air.  The RPII also assist in the development of national plans for emergencies arising from nuclear accidents and in the implementation of measures to deal with radiological emergencies.</P>
    <P>In addition to the extensive range of services I have already referred to, the <Col N="481" /> institute is also undertaking a national radon survey, which is due to be completed in 1998.  Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas originating from the natural decay of uranium.  It has no taste, smell or colour.  It is found in soils and rocks, although the amount varies from place to place.  Radon which surfaces in the open air is quickly diluted to harmless concentrations, but a problem arises when it enters an enclosed space, such as a house, where it can build up to unacceptably high concentrations.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this survey is to identify those existing houses with radon concentrations above the reference level and identify areas at particular risk from radon.  The Department of the Environment and the planning authorities can then be advised on the need to incorporate radon preventative measures in future buildings.  Radon measurements will be made in over 6,000 homes nationwide and a statistical evaluation of the results will allow the percentage of houses above the reference level of 200 bequerals per cubic metre in each national grid square to be predicted.</P>
    <P>The RPII has carried out surveys to date which indicated that about 4 per cent of Irish houses have radon concentrations above the reference level of 200 bequerals per public metre.  The institute estimates that in the 1,000 cases where radon levels have been found in excess of the safe minimum, remedial measures have been implemented in less than 50 of them and that by the end of 1996 up to 1,500 houses will have been identified as being above the reference level.</P>
    <P>While houses with high radon levels are found throughout the country, there is evidence of a greater incidence of such houses in the west, parts of County Louth and Cork city.  Remedial action to deal with unacceptable levels of radon gas is a matter for the householders and property owners concerned. However, I am at present examining ways of assisting householders in addressing this problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="482" /> Over the years, all Irish Governments have voiced their concern about the nuclear installations at Sellafield, focusing on the discharge of radioactive waste into the Irish Sea.  They have argued that the only way to resolve Irish concerns about Sellafield is to close the plant.  These views have been repeatedly conveyed to the UK Government but as of yet to no avail.</P>
    <P>This Government's policy agreement, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> recognises that Sellafield poses a serious and continuing threat to the health and safety of the Irish people.  Other hazards include the ever increasing traffic of radioactive materials on the Irish Sea and the number of ageing nuclear reactors on the west coast of Britain.  The agreement sets out a series of proposals which the Government is pursuing on Sellafield and the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>A task force of Ministers was set up by me during the year with other Ministers, representatives of the Office of the Attorney General, the Radiological Protection Institute and other Government Departments.  The task force will develop and co-ordinate a concerted strategy for progressing the Government's policy on Sellafield and related concerns about the nuclear industry. This is the first comprehensive initiative taken by any Government to date to address the problems caused by Sellafield. It illustrates the Government's serious intent to pursue all realistic and effective courses of action to safeguard the Irish people.  The Government will consider the outcome of the task force's work when completed.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the major focus of interest from the Irish people's point of view, namely, British Nuclear Fuels' facilities at Sellafield.</P>
    <P>Sellafield, on the west coast of Cumbria, lies about 100 miles to the east of Ireland.  It contains British Nuclear Fuels' reprocessing plants, where spent nuclear fuel is reprocessed to extract uranium and plutonium for reuse.  The new THORP plant, opened in March 1994, forms part of the complex.  There are also four Magnox reactors on the <Col N="483" /> site, called Calder Hall, as well as a vitrification plant for high level radioactive waste.  The UK authorities have also identified the Sellafield area as a potential site for a nuclear waste repository or dump to be built around the year 2010.</P>
    <P>The Government strongly opposes the continuation and expansion of reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel by British Nuclear Fuels at Sellafield.  The main reasons for this are: the increase in risk to the health of the public and of environmental contamination arising from discharges of radioactive effluent; the risk of accidents arising from the reprocessing activity and the storage and transport of nuclear fuels, plutonium and radioactive wastes; the accumulation of large amounts of radioactive waste on one site close to the Irish Sea and to Ireland; the risks of nuclear weapons proliferation from increasing stocks of plutonium; the so far unresolved problems of long-term safe storage and disposal of radioactive waste and because there is no demonstrable economic benefit from reprocessing which will balance and justify the risks involved.</P>
    <P>In addition, the four ageing Magnox reactors at the Sellafield site, built as far back as 1956, are considered to have a higher risk of major accident compared to modern reactors.  The lifespan of these reactors has been extended by the UK authorities, mainly for economic reasons.  Another cause of concern is the radioactive contamination of the marine and aerial environment from Sellafield which should be prevented and ultimately eliminated.</P>
    <P>Regarding the new THORP reprocessing plant, two detailed and wide ranging submissions were sent to the British authorities in 1993 as part of a consultation process.  Despite objections from this country, other European Ministers and many environmental groups, the British Government decided in December 1993 to grant authorisation to British Nuclear Fuels for the THORP plant to operate and in April 1994 operations began at the plant.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="484" /> From Ireland's point of view, this decision is highly unacceptable.  It increases the risk to the health of the public and of environmental contamination arising from discharges of radioactive effluent.  There is also a higher risk of accidents arising from the reprocessing activities and storage and transport of wastes.</P>
    <P>Spent fuel reprocessing brings serious hazards from a safety and non-proliferation point of view, due to the growing stockpile and trade in plutonium and other highly active nuclear materials, for which there is no immediate economic use.</P>
    <P>The Government shares the Irish public's concerns about the discharge of radioactive wastes into the marine environment.  My Department cannot directly monitor the day to day operations of Sellafield.  However, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland monitors the levels of radioactivity in Irish waters to study the distribution of contaminating radionuclides, identify trends and assess the risks to public health.  In relation to the Irish Sea, the monitoring programme involves the routine sampling and analysis of seawater, seaweed, sediments, fish and shellfish along the east coast. Samples of seawater and sediments are also collected in the Irish Sea from an area south of Dublin extending northwards to Dundalk Bay.</P>
    <P>While the RPII's monitoring programme provides reassurance that there is no significant risk to the health of the Irish public as a consequence of the Sellafield discharges, they continue to cause contamination of the Irish Sea. Such contamination is objectionable and unacceptable and I consider all radioactive discharges should be progressively reduced and ultimately eliminated at the earliest possible date.  The international convention on discharges from land based sources places such an obligation on member states so as to prevent pollution of the seas.</P>
    <P>While the Government has always been and continues to be committed to legal action against Sellafield if a case <Col N="485" /> for it can be shown to exist, it cannot initiate such action without a firm legal case based on sound evidence.  In the past the Attorney General has advised that any such action would have to be based on evidence as to the injurious effects of operations at the Sellafield plant on Ireland.</P>
    <P>A member state which is considered by the Commission or another member state to have failed to meet an obligation of the EU treaty may be brought before the Court of Justice.  It should be noted that the EU Commission examined the implications of THORP and issued an official opinion on 30 April 1992 that the implementation of the plan for the disposal of radioactive waste from that plant is not liable, either in normal operation or in the case of an accident, to result in radioactive contamination, significant from the point of view of health, of the water, soil or airspace of another member state. However, at the request of the ministerial task force, the Attorney General is re-examining the possibility of legal action against the Sellafield-THORP plant.</P>
    <P>An Seanad will be aware that four Dundalk residents have initiated legal action against British Nuclear Fuels Limited regarding THORP.  The decision of the High Court last year, establishing the jurisdiction of the Irish courts to hear the substantive case brought by the Dundalk residents against BNFL, was welcomed by the Government.  Books of appeal have since been lodged on behalf of BNFL and the matter will be heard in the Supreme Court in January 1996.  I can assure the House that, as in the High Court case, counsel for the State will support the Dundalk plaintiffs in the Supreme Court in resisting this appeal.</P>
    <P>Although Ireland and the Attorney General are named as co-defendants in the substantive case taken by the Dundalk residents, the Government also resisted BNFL's application to have an order set aside allowing service of the summons out of the State.  This is a clear illustration of the Government's commitment <Col N="486" /> to do all in its power to eliminate the threat posed by Sellafield and THORP.  The State is also making available to the plaintiffs on a voluntary basis its files relative to the issues they raised.</P>
    <P>As the nuclear age enters its second half-century, the question of what to do with nuclear waste has not yet been resolved.  The problem is that much of it will remain lethally dangerous for thousands of years and will pose a measurable hazard for a good deal longer than that.  The UK Government's nuclear waste authority, NIREX Limited, plans to build a deep underground repository for the permanent storage of its medium level radioactive waste produced by its reprocessing facilities and its 23 nuclear power stations.  NIREX's preference is that such a repository should be at Sellafield.</P>
    <P>This Government has committed itself to opposing these plans.  As a first step I recently objected to the proposed development of a rock characterisation facility to study the geology and hydrogeology of the Sellafield area.  I believe the rock characterisation facility is a &ldquo;Trojan horse&rdquo;&mdash; once agreed, it would be harder to stop a repository for nuclear waste.</P>
    <P>After examining a number of locations during the 1980s as a possible site for a repository, in 1992 NIREX finally focused its attention on the Sellafield area as the preferred site.  On 29 July 1994 NIREX applied for planning permission to Cumbria County Council to build the rock characterisation facility or &ldquo;rock laboratory&rdquo;.  In December 1994 the county council refused planning permission after considering a number of submissions on the matter, including one from my Department. NIREX decided to exercise its statutory right of appeal under UK legislation against the decision to the Secretary of State for the Environment, Mr. John Gummer, MP, who then decided to hold a public inquiry this year.  I have confirmed to the UK authorities that I wish to attend the inquiry. A date of 7 December 1995 has been fixed for my presentation and a comprehensive <Col N="487" /> submission has already been forwarded separately to the inquiry's secretariat detailing my objections to the rock characterisation facility.</P>
    <P>We have also seen in recent months reports of potentially serious incidents involving Magnox nuclear power plants in the UK at Wylfa in north Wales and Dungeness in south-east England.  In the case of the Wylfa Magnox plant in Anglesey, Wales, the operator of the power station, Nuclear Electric, was fined £250,000 and costs for waiting nine hours before shutting down a potentially dangerous reactor.  Nuclear Electric makes an operating profit of around £1.2 billion a year and it is my view that this paltry fine does not in any way reflect a just and lawful penalty for the company's dangerous incompetence. The company pleaded guilty to four charges under the UK Health and Safety at Work Act following an incident in July 1993 when part of a refuelling crane fell into the reactor. Although there was no danger of meltdown, it is my view that in his tough condemnation of the Wylfa operators, Britain's chief nuclear installations inspector placed a huge question mark over the continuous statements emanating from the UK nuclear industry about its safety culture.</P>
    <P>Nuclear Electric also shut down a Magnox reactor at Dungeness, Kent on 6 September this year in order to carry out precautionary checks following the discovery of external damage to one of the metal standpipes which form part of the fuelling system.  The UK Health and Safety Executive's nuclear installation inspectorate, after completing its investigation into the facts pertaining to this event, was satisfied with Nuclear Electric's response to the discovery of the specific problem.  However, these are worrying occurrences because of their proximity to this country.</P>
    <P>In September I wrote in the strongest terms to the UK Minister for Energy, Mr. Tim Eggar, MP, and the Secretary of State for the Environment, Mr. John Gummer, MP, expressing grave concern <Col N="488" /> about the safety and reliability of the ageing Magnox reactors and the adequacy of safety in the UK nuclear industry.  Some Magnox reactors were built as far back as 1956 and are clearly not as reliable as more modern reactors. I pointed out that some of these reactors are particularly unsafe for a number of reasons, the main ones being, first, the reactors do not have a secondary containment, that is, a back-up system to prevent the dispersion of radioactive substances into the environment; and, second, they are vulnerable to accidents initiated by external events &mdash; for example, the boilers for the Calder-type reactors stand in the open and are connected to the reactors by pipes carrying the reactor coolant, which can be seen by passers-by.</P>
    <P>I asked the UK Ministers to phase out all Magnox reactors in the interest of nuclear safety and radiation protection. I pointed out that the nuclear operators' closure and decommissioning strategies should be reviewed immediately by the nuclear installations inspectorate and decisions on the de-fuelling and shutdown of individual stations, particularly the Sellafield and Wylfa Magnox plants, should be taken without delay.</P>
    <P>The House may be aware that the UK Government recently published a White Paper on the conclusions of its year long nuclear energy review.  The review focused mainly on the future prospects for nuclear power, including plans to privatise parts of the UK nuclear generating industry during 1996.  The White Paper has confirmed the UK Government's commitment to nuclear power, provided it remains competitive and is able to maintain rigorous standards of safety and environmental protection.</P>
    <P>The two nuclear electricity generating companies, Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear, will be merged and part privatised. Eight of the more modern nuclear reactors within those companies, called advanced gas-cooled reactors and pressurised water reactors, will be transferred into the private sector.  The older Magnox stations and their liabilities, <Col N="489" /> about which I have expressed concern, will remain in public ownership under a new Government owned stand alone company which will ultimately be integrated with British Nuclear Fuels plc.  The White Paper states that there will be no other change in the status of BNFL &mdash; it remains publicly owned as well as its facilities at Sellafield.</P>
    <P>The White Paper emphasises that there is no case for State intervention or public funds for the construction of new nuclear plants.  It also states that payments to Nuclear Electric from the existing fossil fuel levy on electricity consumers will cease at the time of privatisation. In relation to future prospects for nuclear generation, I understand that during the review the nuclear industry argued the case for more nuclear power stations.  However, in the White Paper the UK Government concluded that there was no case for State support or guarantees to one form of electricity over another.  The review has also concluded that private finance is unlikely to be available at present for new nuclear construction.</P>
    <P>However, despite this I have continued to express my concern about the UK Government's proposals for privatisation next summer.  I believe that its policy change towards privatisation of parts of the nuclear industry is inconsistent with its statement that safety is to remain of paramount importance.  The UK Government should retain the full nuclear industry in the public sector where commercial pressures do not tend to compromise safety to the same degree as they would in a privatised industry.  In my opinion, with privatisation there would be increasing pressures on persons and safety, as output and profit become more important to private interests in the long term.</P>
    <P>Ireland has consistently, at every international forum, pressed for the closure of unsafe, Soviet designed nuclear power plants in eastern and central Europe, particularly the existing ones at Chernobyl.  There are other reactors in Bulgaria, Slovakia and Armenia which are also considered <Col N="490" /> dangerously unsafe by the western world.</P>
    <P>As the 1986 Chernobyl accident demonstrated, the distance from Ireland is not a barrier to significant amounts of radioactive contamination reaching us. The level then was not high enough to cause an immediate health risk but it could have had severe and costly implications for food production and exports and, hence, our main economy and export trade.  A relatively small amount of contamination of foodstuff, particularly dairy products and meat, can rapidly lead to trade restrictions and the continuing loss of good will and quality reputation long after the immediate effects have receded.  The consequences for Ireland with a large food export market are considerably higher than for other countries who supply mainly domestic markets.</P>
    <P>Recent European summits and the G7 group of industrialised countries recommended that the Chernobyl plant be closed definitively and as early as possible.  An action plan was drawn up involving the closure of Chernobyl, structural reform of the Ukraine energy sector and improvements in safety in the nuclear sector.  In May of this year, President Kutchma of the Ukraine gave a commitment to a time table for the closure of Chernobyl by 2000.  The Ukraine must be pressed to honour this commitment.</P>
    <P>The Irish people's greatest concern about Sellafield and other plants along the west coast of Britain and some reactors in eastern and central Europe continues to be the risk of a large release of radioactivity resulting from a major accident.  The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland has responsibility for the provision of advice on the potential consequences of any nuclear accident and on measures to protect the public.</P>
    <P>The national emergency plan for nuclear accidents was published by my Department in 1992.  As the Minister responsible for nuclear safety matters, I have responsibility for the emergency plan and for ensuring co-ordination of the responsibilities and functions of the <Col N="491" /> relevant authorities.  The plan is designed to provide a rapid and effective response to accidents involving the release, or potential release, of radioactive substances into the environment which could give rise to radiation exposure.</P>
    <P>First information of the occurrence of an accident at a nuclear installation overseas would be obtained by the Garda Communications Control Centre through the international notification procedures established after the Chernobyl accident.  These provide for early warning of an accident and for exchange of information.  The 24 hour national radiation monitoring system would also detect increases of radioactivity directly in Ireland.  A further source of information about an accident in the UK is the bilateral arrangement between Ireland and the UK under which the UK authorities notify my Department of incidents involving a release of radioactivity into the environment.</P>
    <P>In the case of a possible accident involving a ship containing nuclear material, under the national emergency plan the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland has a liaison agreement involving co-operation and advice arrangements with the Irish Marine Emergency Service of the Department of the Marine &mdash; IMES.  These arrangements are effected as soon as the IMES receives notification of the marine incident from the UK's coastguard agency through the normal channels.</P>
    <P>Under the national emergency plan, measures are in place to assess and mitigate the effects of nuclear accidents which occur in the UK or elsewhere and which might pose a radiological hazard to Ireland.  The plan shows how accident management will operate, how technical information and monitoring data will be collected, how information to the public will be provided and what counter measures may be taken for the protection of the public in the short and long term.</P>
    <P>In the event of an emergency, this co-ordination would be effected by means <Col N="492" /> of the Emergency Response Co-ordination Committee which is chaired by a senior official of my Department who reports to me.  The committee has representatives of the relevant Departments and agencies, the Garda, Defence Forces, Meteorological Service and nuclear and medical experts.</P>
    <P>A test of the plan took place in October 1992 involving the main Departments and agencies.  The plan was further tested in May 1993 as part of an international emergency exercise arranged by the Nuclear Energy Agency of the OECD.  I am making arrangements for a further review and test of the plan at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>Ireland's membership of the International Atomic Energy Agency ensures that we are part of the IAEA's emergency information network which would be of crucial importance in providing the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland &mdash; RPII &mdash; with early warning of a nuclear accident abroad.  The International Atomic Energy Agency is an autonomous intergovernmental organisation under the aegis of the United Nations.  It was established in 1957 and, at present, has 113 member states.  Ireland became a member in 1970.  Ireland's membership of the IAEA does not in any way restrict our opposition to the expansion of nuclear energy, even for peaceful means.  On the contrary, it allows us to have a direct say in seeking to ensure that the highest standards of nuclear safety and radiological protection apply in the nuclear industry worldwide.</P>
    <P>Since the Chernobyl accident it has been evident that the existing international civil nuclear liability regime is seriously deficient in many respects.  For this reason Ireland attaches great importance to the development in the IAEA of an updated and enhanced global international regime on liability and compensation for damage to health and environment in the event of a nuclear accident.  Ireland believes that efforts must be directed not only at a revision of the existing Vienna convention for civil liberty but also involve a supplementary <Col N="493" /> funding convention which would attract universal acceptance and provide additional meaningful compensation for nuclear damage, particularly where transboundary nuclear damage occurs.  Discussions on an integrated approach involving these two elements are now progressing in Vienna.</P>
    <P>The Euratom Treaty is the framework for dealing with nuclear matters within the European Community.  At the time of entry into force of the Euratom Treaty in 1958, the European nuclear industry was in its infancy and one of its primary aims was to further an ambitious research and development nuclear programme.  The terms of the treaty were based on the assumption that uranium would replace coal as the world's energy source.  The founding member states, therefore, considered it important to establish a treaty specifically to deal with nuclear energy. However, it must be noted that the treaty was drawn up some 30 years ago and that much has changed since then. A review and update of this treaty to place a greater emphasis on health, safety and environmental aspects should now be considered.</P>
    <P>The Irish member of the EU Reflection Group, which is helping to identify options for discussion at the intergovernmental conference in 1996, has raised the possibility of strengthening the nuclear safety provisions of the Euratom Treaty.  Any amendment to Euratom, however, requires unanimous agreement and this may be difficult to achieve given the strong views of certain member states on the use of nuclear power.</P>
    <P>The Euratom Treaty encompasses some important provisions for the protection of health and safety of workers and the general public.  Article 30 provides for basic safety standards which must be laid down within the Community for the health protection of the general public and workers against ionising radiation.  The Radiological Protection Institute and my Department are actively involved in a proposal for a revision of Directive 80/836 which sets <Col N="494" /> out these standards.  Through our participation in these discussions, we aim to ensure that the revisions agreed ensure that the highest standards of safety and protection will be implemented to protect our citizens for the future.</P>
    <P>Ireland has always been a strong advocate of nuclear non-proliferation and has a unique and long standing association with the treaty on the non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons &mdash; NPT &mdash; as one of its original proponents. Ireland believes that universal accession to the NPT and full compliance with its deliberations are essential steps towards ensuring nuclear non-proliferation and thus preventing major threats to international peace and security. The agreement, reached earlier this year to extend the NPT indefinitely, is of vital importance.  The agreement encompasses five yearly reviews of implementation of the treaty which will make all state parties &mdash; now 180 countries in all &mdash; more accountable in the future for their implementation of the treaty.  The agreed principles and objectives for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament set out, <i>inter alia,</i> a programme of action in nuclear disarmament to which Ireland attaches the highest importance.</P>
    <P>With the treaty extended indefinitely, there is a corresponding continuous obligation on all states, particularly the nuclear weapon states, to pursue nuclear disarmament.  It was, therefore, with great dismay and concern that I learned of the French Government's decision to resume nuclear testing, considering the near completion of the comprehensive test ban treaty to be signed next year.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs urged the French Government, in public statements and bilateral contacts with his French counterpart, to reconsider this decision.  He appealed to France to set an international example in support of continued moratoriums on nuclear testing. The Tánaiste particularly emphasised the commitment made by the nuclear weapon states at the Nuclear Proliferation Treaty Review to exercise <Col N="495" /> utmost restraint pending the entry into force of a comprehensive test ban treaty.</P>
    <P>I thank Members for their attention to this general exposition of my nuclear safety policy.  I will be glad to hear views and suggestions in relation to this very serious topic.  The concerns I have related are common to all parties and we must present a united front on this issue.  Nuclear safety and radiation protection is not a topic for political point scoring.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his very comprehensive statement, which could set out the basis for a policy in this area.  While much discussion and activity have taken place, particularly with regard to the integration of the Nuclear Energy Board into the Radiological Protection Institute, there has been an absence of a clearly defined policy.  I take this opportunity to re-emphasise the necessity to draw together the various strands of activity with which different Departments are involved.  I compliment the Minister of State on the establishment of the interdepartmental committee which will hopefully issue its report in the near future and set down a formula for an overall framework to deal with this issue rather than the present <i>ad hoc</i> situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="496" /> I also compliment the institute on its work.  This has been highlighted in the reports which have gone unnoticed to a large extent.  This House should have an opportunity to debate the work of the radiological protection institute annually. The institute is involved in important work on surveys and monitoring duties.  This work goes unnoticed to a large extent.  It is difficult for the institute to function effectively because its budget amounts to only £1 million per year.  I would like to see a substantial increase in funding to expand and expedite the work with which the institute is involved.  I take this opportunity to put on record our appreciation to the personnel of the institute for their activities and the amount of documentation they have issued from time to time.</P>
    <P>On 26 April 1986 the Chernobyl nuclear reactor went out of control and a contaminating cloud spread across the continent.  The tragic consequences of this catastrophe awakened the consciousness of a largely indifferent international community to the global nuclear threat.  For the many who had been acutely aware of the aftermath of Nagasaki and Hiroshima, and believed such disasters would never happen again, the Chernobyl tragedy was a stark reminder of the nuclear nightmare that threatens mankind.  Has the message from that tragedy made an impression on international leaders?  I question whether it has, given the strange decision taken by the French Government to resume nuclear testing. This indicates that nothing has been learned from the tragedies of the past.</P>
    <P>It is not commonly known that the Chernobyl nuclear plant remains in operation and is rapidly deteriorating. Plans had been made to close down this plant by the year 2000, but these were apparently conditional on funding being made available from the West.  The President of the Ukraine sought finances but they have not been forthcoming. Unit 2 of the plant, which was closed following the fire in 1992, has been refurbished.  There are 5,000 operators <Col N="497" /> in Chernobyl, the fourth reactor of which was crippled in 1986 and is now in a very critical state.  The Ukraine Academy of Sciences recently stated that the levels of radiation and the physical state of construction were deteriorating rapidly.  Amounts of fuel and other radioactive materials from the reactor inside the structure would be enough to cause another 30 Chernobyl disasters, according to information provided by one of the academy's leading professors.  China has also made the inexplicable decision to resume nuclear testing.</P>
    <P>The neglect of the Russia's nuclear industry is a cause of major concern. Russia's nuclear inspectorate, which had access to the Russian installations and some of the more dangerous sites, has been prohibited from examining some of those installations by the Russian President.  At present, Russia is endeavouring to seek contracts for the disposal of some of its nuclear waste through reprocessing.  There is a possibility that such waste may be directed to Sellafield. A very real cause for concern exists in this regard.  It is recognised that Russian nuclear facilities and power stations are dangerous, inefficient and face many problems.  They have been described as a disaster waiting to happen.</P>
    <P>Each year nuclear power production creates 200,000 cubic metres of low and intermediate level waste and 10,000 cubic metres of high level waste and used nuclear fuel.  The radiological and safety risk varies from low to very great. The use of radioactive substances in medicine and industrial research is constantly expanding.  Consequently, further risks and threats are posed.  Pollution from sources such as energy production and use affects the health of many millions of people.</P>
    <P>Our greatest concern is the threatening state of the United Kingdom's nuclear industry.  The fears that were confirmed after a series of accidents at UK installations have highlighted the menace of nuclear energy and the necessity to take every reasonable step to protect our population and environment. <Col N="498" /> More than half the world's nuclear reactors are located on Ireland's doorstep.  The expansion of reprocessing facilities, the discharge of radioactive waste into the marine environment and the possible dangers arising from the shipment of radioactive materials through the Irish Sea are matters of grave concern to the people.</P>
    <P>The time has come for the Sellafield issue to be brought before the International Court of Justice by the Government. I had the opportunity to attend the Rio summit where commitments were made that assistance would be given to countries like Ireland where problems had arisen with neighbours in relation to such issues.  Commitments were made to provide technical and financial assistance and legal advice to states threatened by nuclear disasters in areas over which they had no jurisdiction and which did not have the technical and legal advice to help them deal with these issues.</P>
    <P>We should now seek assistance from the European Union and the United Nations, through the various institutions with which we are affiliated, to get the necessary legal and technical advice and financial support to challenge the United Kingdom Government on the risk to our population and environment from the unsafe and damaging British nuclear industry which threatens this island.</P>
    <P>If the UK Government continues to ignore genuine Irish concerns about Sellafield and other plants where there have been accidents in the past, then we have no alternative but to take it to the European Court or the International Court of Justice to find a way to resolve these matters.  Advice given by the Attorney General on a number of occasions was that there were few mechanisms by which the United Kingdom Government could be challenged.  The fact that serious incidents have occurred even this week is reason enough to have this matter fully investigated in the international fora.  Action should be taken at international level to prohibit the risk to the environment and the <Col N="499" /> population from these unsafe and unhealthy installations.</P>
    <P>People will be appalled by recent revelations which indicate that some dumping of radioactive material took place adjacent to the Irish coastline.  We had the opportunity to debate on the Adjournment the concerns of coastal communities about the risk to the population from dumping which has taken place over a number of years.  Little is being done to identify these locations, to assess the state of these dump sites or to see what action could be taken with the British Government or with the British Government and the European Union to deal effectively with problems at these sites.</P>
    <P>I am aware that a study is being undertaken at present which will be concluded by 2000, but that is not adequate.  As more disclosures are made each day, the situation becomes more alarming and threatening and in need of urgent remedial action.  There is strong evidence that waste dumped around the coastline has deteriorated to such an extent that it will be a hazard to humans and the environment unless something is urgently done to deal with that situation. The Government must take action fairly soon.</P>
    <P>I refer to our efforts in dealing with problems associated with nuclear disasters and accidents.  I would like to avail of this opportunity to put on record the work done by people like Adi Roche, who has continuously highlighted the tragedy of Chernobyl and the need to help in such a disaster situation.  The Government should put in place a mechanism where assistance could be provided to deal with the aftermath of tragedies like Chernobyl.  While the work of many non-governmental agencies has been successful in dealing with some of the problems, it is an enormous task which is beyond their capabilities.</P>
    <P>In any policy on the nuclear area which may be put in place by the Minister provision should be made for and account should be taken of the aftermath of tragedies like Chernobyl.  Financial <Col N="500" /> assistance should be provided to people like Adi Roche to enable the work in which they are involved to continue and accelerate.  Adi Roche has highlighted the continuing menacing threat to people in the vicinity of these installations and, as we know, this is not only confined to the vicinity of Chernobyl.</P>
    <P>We need a clear policy, and the Minister is the ideal person to undertake its preparation.  I compliment the Department's presentation in 1992 on the emergency plan for nuclear accidents. There is a need to bring together the Department of Defence, the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications and so on and to set out a clear policy on the nuclear area, where we stand on the various issues and how we propose to deal effectively with this real and permanent threat.  The people need an indication of how the Government proposes to deal with this major hazard in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Daly, I welcome the Minister's comprehensive contribution on this issue.  The Minister said that nuclear safety is matter of concern to all Irish people.  He said that there is one issue about which there is consensus across all political parties and he referred to the direct threat imposed on the people by the United Kingdom's nuclear industry.  He further stated that over the years all Irish Governments have voiced their concern about the nuclear installations at Sellafield, focusing on the discharge of radioactive waste into the Irish Sea.  He said they have argued that the only way to resolve Irish concerns about Sellafield is to close down the plant.  These views have been repeatedly conveyed to the United Kingdom Government, as yet to no avail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also said the Government strongly opposes the continuation and expansion of the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel by British Nuclear Fuels at Sellafield.  He outlined the main reasons for this and they numbered six in all.  It is important to emphasis these <Col N="501" /> points in any discussion of nuclear energy policy.  It is only proper that this House debate the whole question of nuclear energy and nuclear industry on a regular basis and that is an additional reason for welcoming the opportunity of this debate this morning.</P>
    <P>Any discussion on nuclear energy policy here must focus, as it has this morning in the contributions of both the Minister and Senator Daly, on what is happening across the Irish Sea.  I know there are issues further afield which can be of major concern to us but the immediate issues of concern are virtually on our doorstep.  Therefore, the situation at Sellafield and, indeed, THORP are of major concern to all citizens of this country.</P>
    <P>I applaud and commend the sustained commitment of the Government in its opposition to these developments at Sellafield.  In particular, I welcome the Government's support for the Dundalk residents in their case against the developments at Sellafield and wish these efforts every success.  I condemn the attitude of the British Government in persisting to ignore the legitimate fears of our people.  Indeed, these fears are not confined to the people of this island. They are shared by many residents in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>In the course of his address, the Minister referred to the many dangers which these installations constitute.  He referred to the ageing Magnox reactors, which have been well documented.  I have some information which emerged recently from the Minister's Department. It outlines some of the reasons for the concern about these reactors and explains why so many share these concerns. Among the reasons which have been advanced are the following: they do not have secondary containment, as the Minister said; corrosion, fatigue and fretting in pressure components and other vital parts must be a safety problem and one which is becoming more difficult to assess; in-service inspection is limited because reactors were not designed from this; graphite degradation, like corrosion, gets worse with <Col N="502" /> age and this has implications for the integrity of the reactor core and the ability to shut down the system to work as designed; and they are vulnerable to accidents initiated by external events.</P>
    <P>For example, the boilers for the Calder-type reactors stand out in the open and are connected to the reactors by pipes carrying the reactor coolant that can be seen by passers-by.  Again, that is a point which the Minister emphasised this morning.  This particular type of reactor is now almost 40 years in service and it is obvious from what the Minister said, and, indeed, from the document to which I referred, that people's concern over the dangers which these ageing reactors constitute is justifiable.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding all that, there have been a number of incidents and accidents at these installations which confirm, unfortunately, our worst fears. Chernobyl was mentioned by both the Minister and Senator Daly.  Senator Daly went on to commend the work which has been done by voluntary agencies in this country for the children who have been affected by the accident at Chernobyl.  I have had the experience of meeting some of the children who were taken to Ireland in order to be given the opportunity to recover their lost health to some degree.  It was wonderful to see them, but it was tragic to hear that the life expectancy of many of them is much shorter than would be the case in other circumstances.  It is only when you come face to face with such a tragic reality that the inherent risks in nuclear activity are forcefully brought home to you.</P>
    <P>I notice the Minister referred in the course of his speech to the fact that the examination which is being carried out in the Irish Sea does not indicate there is contamination of a worrying degree there.  He also referred to the European Commission's examination of the worries which related to THORP.  The Commission concluded the likely damage was not of major importance.  Nonetheless, when ones thinks of Chernobyl. and other accidents, incidents and issues which have been raised, even these <Col N="503" /> reassurances are not adequate to relieve the anxiety of the people of this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the fact there is major concern with regard to the proposal to build an underground nuclear dump in the Sellafield area.  He spoke of the first step toward that end &mdash; the application for planning permission for an underground rock laboratory. We should compliment Cumbria County Council for refusing to grant planning permission for it.  We were, of course, told the rock laboratory was for the purpose of testing the site's geology and general suitability for an underground nuclear dump.  The Minister said that following Cumbria County Council's refusal of planning permission, the issue is to be taken before an inquiry in the United Kingdom. Arrangements have been made for the Minister to attend and make a presentation on 7 December.  I wish him every success and I am quite sure his presentation will carry the same determination which he has shown here in his opposition to this matter.</P>
    <P>The decision by Cumbria County County's to refuse planning permission for the underground rock laboratory throws the whole timetable and target date out of kilter.  There is another problem in that the nuclear waste which it was intended to store underground is now being stored above ground and continues to constitute an unacceptable risk to the people on these islands.  I have been reading an article about the underground nuclear dump.  The comment was made that before a decision is reached by the United Kingdom inquiry on Cumbria County Council's refusal of permission, there will be a general election in Britain and there may well be a different Government.  It would be interesting to establish the view of that possible alternative Government.</P>
    <P>I welcome the work done by the ministerial task force as outlined by the Minister of State.  I hope the task force and the Attorney General will be successful and find an opportunity to take legal action against Sellafield and British <Col N="504" /> Nuclear Fuels in addition to the action by the Dundalk residents which they support.</P>
    <P>Fears continue about the risks inherent in the transportation, reprocessing, storage and disposal of waste and in the decommissioning of nuclear installations.  These concerns affect all countries, regardless of whether they pursue the nuclear option.  I am conscious of the comments made by both the Minister of State and Senator Daly about central and eastern Europe where there are a number of ageing nuclear plants that are developing into a dangerous condition.  We recognise the dangers that can arise from a repeat of Chernobyl and there is a major risk of such an occurrence.  This is an international problem requiring international action. I am sure our Government will be at the forefront of all attempts to put in place the international action required to ensure the safety of these plants.</P>
    <P>For years, Ireland has been a strong advocate of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear disarmament. I share the Minister's concern about the decision of the French Government to resume nuclear testing. I hope that international pressure, in which I am glad to see we are taking a leading part, will persuade the French Government to discontinue the series of nuclear tests and to go further and become party to the international test ban treaty which is being negotiated at present.</P>
    <P>I endorse the Minister's concern about developing United Kingdom policy on the part privatisation of the nuclear industry which contains increased risks for the safety of the nuclear installations that will pass from national ownership into other hands.  I say this with a certain measure of reluctance because I generally believe that private enterprise can have a useful part to play in the economic development of countries.  However, because of the inherent risks, private concerns are not the appropriate people to have control of nuclear plants.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to participate <Col N="505" /> in this discussion.  I support the Minister and the Government in their approach to the problems across the Irish Sea, in central and eastern Europe and to the French nuclear testing exercises. It is important that we continue to express in the strongest terms our reservations about the dangers inherent in all activities associated with the nuclear industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House to discuss a matter which is of great concern to everybody here and most reasonable people in the world.  The nuclear power industry started 39 years ago when the first station was opened in Calder Hall.  It was supposed to provide a new method of energy generation which would remove the ecological damage done by producing electricity from coal and other non-renewable energy sources. However, Calder Hall was not commissioned for the production of electricity. Its prime purpose was to produce weapons grade plutonium.</P>
      <P>When the Queen opened Calder Hall she talked about the great benefits that would flow from the generation of clean electricity.  In fact, they were preparing for the production of the nuclear bomb and the development of the nuclear bomb industry was prompted by Britain's opening of that generation station.  We saw in Japan the results of the initial development of that industry during the Second World War.  Most of those who were involved in the development of nuclear energy changed their minds over the years about whether they were producing a cheaper form of energy and began to actively campaign for the elimination of the nuclear weapons industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Ireland we have a major worry about the huge complex in Wales which is between 40 and 100 miles from us. In the original advertisements produced by British Nuclear Fuels one always saw pictures of cows grazing around the plant to show there was no danger to the land or animals.  They also showed people swimming close to the point <Col N="506" /> where emissions were let into the Irish Sea.  The cows had no choice but to graze around the power plant but the people of Wales will no longer swim in the area.  At least they have a choice and know the dangers of contamination.</P>
    <P>The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland has stated in its annual reports that there is no danger to humans from the contamination levels in the Irish Sea.  Many people would dispute that.  However, we must remember that those who produce the report for the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland are nuclear physicists or people who are linked to the nuclear business. Although they are working for the institute on behalf of the Irish people we must bear in mind that their opinions might be clouded by the fact that they are members of the profession. If there were no nuclear industry they would not be there except, perhaps, in the context of the natural production of radioactive material such as radon.</P>
    <P>There has been a scare about radon and its effects.  I do not know what can be done about it.  If people are building new houses they should avoid sites where radon emissions are strongest. However, I cannot envisage that happening because I doubt that there will be a policy in the future of resettling people who are living in areas with high radon emission rates.  I also doubt that the building industry will have much regard for what happens in such areas.</P>
    <P>One matter was not mentioned in the report and I would like to hear the Minister's comments on it.  In many areas throughout the country there has been controversy about the MMDS television transmission system; it has been a bone of contention.  While we have been told by many experts in the nuclear and medical sectors that MMDS emissions are no stronger than those produced by a cooker in a suburban home, the public, perhaps for commercial reasons, has not really believed their analyses in this regard.</P>
    <P>Britain, having been the first country to establish a nuclear power station, is one of the last to stop the commissioning <Col N="507" /> of such stations.  It is about 17 years since the United States stopped commissioning nuclear power stations. That policy was adopted for two reasons &mdash; a near accident at the Three Mile Island complex in Pennsylvania and the fact that nuclear power is the most costly method of generating electricity. The decision was taken for safety and economic reasons.  However, in Britain BNFL has been a subsidised entity in the public service for many years and, being a State utility, commercial considerations were not taken into account. It would have been better if a tenth or more of the money that was squandered on the nuclear energy industry had been put into energy conservation, renewable resources and even into analysing how best to use coal in a less threatening way environmentally.</P>
    <P>The nuclear industry not only squandered an enormous amount of money but also generated the most dangerous weapons of mass destruction.  We must again blame Britain.  Sir John Cockcroft and Sir James Chadwick were the scientists who were most involved at that stage.  The progression from the first generation station to nuclear weaponry has had horrific consequences in the world and there is a potential for further conflict.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the French Government over recent months as evidenced in their resumption of nuclear tests should not be ignored in this debate. When the Irish Minister spoke about taking legal action against Sellafield the EU Commission examined the implications and issued an official opinion on 30 April 1992.  It said that the implementation of the plan for disposal of radioactive wastes from THORP is not liable either in normal operation or in the case of an accident to result in significant radioactive contamination, from the point of view of health, of the waters of another member state.  The EU is, of course, composed of nuclear states.  I presume this was a majority decision &mdash; I doubt that the Irish representative offered that view &mdash; and France, Germany <Col N="508" /> and the UK are three of the greatest producers of nuclear power in the world.</P>
    <P>The arrogance of the French in resisting all pleas to stop nuclear testing should not be forgotten.  We also must look at the statement made by John Major.  He said that Britain is a nuclear power, France is a nuclear power and France is quite right to continue the tests to ensure that its nuclear energy programme is as modern as those of other countries.  However, this has given great encouragement to countries such as China which has the potential to advance in the nuclear power stakes. China has already conducted tests, although not as many as France and other nations.  There is a danger that what is being done by Europeans in the Far East will encourage China to extend its nuclear programme.</P>
    <P>The NIREX issue and the application for underground storage space was the first occasion when the county council in Cumbria stood up to the nuclear power industry.  It turned down the application.  The British White Paper on nuclear energy states, with regard to dry storing, that the Government concludes that the question of whether and when to reprocess spent fuel should be a matter for the commercial judgment of the owner of the spent fuel, subject to meeting regulatory requirements.</P>
    <P>It also says that the policy for the siting of dry stores was considered, including an appraisal of the benefits and implications of a multi-storage strategy compared to a single storage strategy with particular regard to the question of safety.  It did not point to conclusive benefits deriving from a central stores or storage compared with one or more stores beside nuclear generation stations.  The conclusion was that it is the manufacturer's responsibility.  The British Government is passing the buck to people who want to store or reprocess spent nuclear fuels.</P>
    <P>Governments around the world, with the exception of the Irish Government, are not terribly worried about the siting of stores for spent nuclear fuels.  They <Col N="509" /> can get rid of much of their spent fuels by sending them across the Irish Sea, which is one of the most heavily used stretches of water in the world.  The dangers of collisions in those waters are enormous.  While there are enormous commercial benefits for Wales in having those facilities, the people of Wales are now beginning to realise that there are huge dangers as well as economic benefits attached to such facilities.</P>
    <P>It would have been much better for the British Government to invest one tenth of the money they spend on these facilities in renewable energy sources or in a changeover of how best to use coal, turf or other fuels for the generation of electricity.  There has been talk about the non-proliferation treaty of 1970 and here we must praise an Irishman, Frank Aiken, who formed the committee that was the catalyst for that treaty.  He was ahead of his time in realising the dangers of nuclear proliferation.</P>
    <P>The problem with nuclear power is that not alone has it been used for the generation of electricity, but it has been used for the production of the atomic bomb.  The number of nuclear weapons around the world at present is a result of a decision made in Calder Hall in October 39 years ago.  We must ensure that we support every effort around the world to eliminate nuclear energy from the world scene.  We must look at alternative ways of producing energy.  We must help in every way to guard against what could happen if the supply and distribution of electricity in Wales is privatised. I believe that when the commercial people have a look at the cost of producing electricity and so forth, the planned privatisation may not go through at all.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for giving us the chance to air some of our fears on nuclear energy and in particular the implications of nuclear energy for Ireland.</P>
    <Col N="510" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Minister's paper on the nuclear safety policy.  Most Irish people would have a problem with this issue because it concerns everybody.  I am delighted that it is not an issue on which political parties set out to score points.  We are all in agreement that we must face up to this issue very seriously.  Irish people are against nuclear energy and thankfully we have never generated energy in this way.  We have always had co-operation and agreement in regard to threats to the Irish people.  The major threat to the Irish people at present seems to come from British nuclear industry.</P>
      <P>This country has seen none of the benefits of radioactivity since it was discovered, 100 years ago, but we have seen massive deaths occurring all over the world because of nuclear bombs and nuclear accidents which have never benefited anybody.  Efforts are still being made to improve that industry and make it safer.  The British do not seem to have any clear policy as to what intentions they have to slow down the use of nuclear energy.</P>
      <P>We know how far it is from Ireland to Chernobyl, but some effects of the nuclear accident there in 1986 were felt in Ireland.  The winds blew from Chernobyl into this country and the radiation levels found in sheepmeat on the mountains in Finntown outside Letterkenny were much higher than ever before.  It was obvious that radiation released by the accident in Chernobyl found its way to this country and created problems for us.  This begs the question of what plans we have in the event of such an accident occurring.  The Minister outlined some of them in his statement this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must always be ready for such an accident.  The general public should be made aware of these plans.  People do not really know what plans are in place in the event of such a major accident occurring.  The recent breakdown at the Welsh nuclear plant caused major concern. The public asked what we would have done if the gases had reached this country, so we must let it be known <Col N="511" /> what is available and how we are going to deal with this situation.</P>
    <P>We are lucky that the ESB has never generated electricity using nuclear energy.  People may complain about the cost of electricity, but it is much better that we pay in a safe way for the energy we receive than that we tamper with nuclear powered electricity which is accident prone and which public opinion in this country is completely against.</P>
    <P>Central and eastern European countries have a nuclear energy culture which we do not have.  For some reason their views are very different from ours. I was at a Council of Europe meeting recently in which bio-ethics were discussed. The discussion was about experimentation on embryos and people with mental handicaps and the difference in attitude of western Europeans from central and eastern Europeans was unbelievable.  The people who come from this part of the world have a completely different view altogether on that issue, and the nuclear energy agenda seems to create divisions along the same lines.</P>
    <P>We definitely oppose any expansion of the use of nuclear energy because far too many problems remain unresolved here at present.  Irish people are against incineration.  If an incinerator is proposed for Donegal or for Cork the opposition to it is unbelievable.  The Minister is welcome to build one in Kildare, but I would advise him to stay well away from us.</P>
    <P>Another related issue is that of dumping at sea.  The British carried out massive dumping 50 miles off the Donegal coast.  Governments through the years ignored this problem.  I have no doubt that the reason the Irish Government ignored this was because it was dumping at sea itself.  It had no intention of taking on the British in relation to the amount of gases, munitions and so on dumped off the Donegal coast because it was at it itself.</P>
    <P>The French Government recently snubbed the rest of the world by its <Col N="512" /> decision to continue nuclear testing at the Mururoa atoll.  Nuclear energy is accident prone and I welcome the plans the Minister has made in relation to safety standards.  We have to keep up to date with safety standards at all times and see that we are on top of the situation. The British have moved in relation to THORP and Sellafield and those two areas are causing major problems for this country.  What will happen if the British say no to us in relation to the objections and complaints that have come in from the Dundalk area?  I welcome the Minister's decision to support the Dundalk people in their High Court case.  The French snubbed the rest of the world, the British are doing the same in relation to Sellafield.  At the end of the day, if they say no, what can we do?</P>
    <P>I welcome the Government's policy, stated in the programme for renewal, that Sellafield poses a serious and continuing threat to the health and safety of the Irish people.  The east coast seems to have a major problem in this regard and it is possible that there are major dangers in the Irish Sea, but tests and analyses that have been carried out by the EU have not found any specific dangers there within the waters.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, dialogue is the only recourse.  We must talk to the British to see what can be done to move the situation forward.  We are not going to make any major headway if we start to threaten them because they will simply tell us to bugger off.</P>
    <P>We are concerned about the THORP plant.  If would appear that the British will continue their building programme there.  I understand they plan to build a dump around the year 2010.  We strongly oppose this situation on health grounds and because of the risk of accident, which we have seen through the years.</P>
    <P>It is up to the Minister and others in his Department to consult with the British and get the message home to them that their policy in this regard is something we do not agree with.  The British appear to have an attitude that one can bugger off if one does not like it. <Col N="513" /> However, we must object in the strongest possible terms and try and bring the message home to them that we are concerned about the situation.</P>
    <P>People have stated that along the east coast children have been born malformed and so on.  No real case has been made that these incidents have been caused as a result of Sellafield. However, it is a strong issue, and people are very concerned and vocal about it. It is something we must continue to work at.  I thank the Minister for his statement this morning.  We are going in the right direction and it is important that we are all together on this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for what was a carefully prepared speech, which was fairly comprehensive in that it appears to have dealt with many of the issues.  However, there are a few questions arising from the speech that I wish to address.</P>
      <P>The issue of nuclear energy is not a green issue, nor is it an issue that any one party or group has a monopoly on. It is an issue for us all.  It is an issue about the way we live, about lifestyle, about technology, about the way the world is today, about neighbouring countries, about sovereignty, about the international arms trade and so on.  It is an extremely complex, global issue that is probably one of the most important items of environmental concern for people in this and many other countries. Some people try and corner it as an issue and say that they are more concerned about it than others.  This is not the case.  Perhaps some people dwell on it to the exclusion of other issues, but that is not to say that they have a greater concern, expertise or a desire to bring about change in this sphere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In terms of the proximity of the nuclear plants to the east coast of Ireland, indeed to Ireland, Chernobyl was a salutary lesson.  There was no mention, perhaps correctly, in the Minister's speech regarding an analysis, which I am sure has been undertaken by the nuclear authorities in this country, <Col N="514" /> as to what exactly would be the effect of a major meltdown, explosion or whatever in Sellafield.  Are we ready for it, or is it so horrible and horrendous to contemplate that we do not have a realistic scenario or picture of what would happen if such an incident were to take place?</P>
    <P>I am reminded here of the fact that, even though Switzerland is neutral and has been neutral for hundreds of years, it has an extensive system of underground shelters, nuclear bunkers and so on, although it is the least likely country to be the victim of nuclear fallout, at least in a direct way.  In theory the story of Chernobyl &mdash; one does not wish to be alarmist about this &mdash; should lead us to be in a state of utter preparedness on a day by day basis for the possibility that there could be a major problem in one of the English nuclear reactors.  By analogy this does not apply only to English nuclear reactors.  It could apply to French nuclear reactors also, because the French have a very large programme of civil nuclear power stations. With prevailing winds coming from Europe, these plants are much closer than Chernobyl and their effects could be devastating.</P>
    <P>The problem is so large and fundamental that it is hard to come to grips with it in a meaningful way.  If we were being honest with ourselves, we might say we recognise how horrendous it is. Indeed, it is so horrendous that if something goes wrong we are finished.  We might as well live under this cloud and be done with it, because we are not going to change the minds of the authorities in the USA, France, Germany, England, Japan or other countries that have a significant nuclear energy programme. They have decided, for good or for bad, that this is the way they are going to generate electricity; and if we think little old Ireland is going to change their minds and bring about a nuclear free world, then we are living in cloud cuckoo land.</P>
    <P>As a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Sustainable Development, I cannot think of anything more <Col N="515" /> obnoxious to the concept of sustainable development as the nuclear energy and nuclear armaments industries.  We would all like a nuclear free world; but if we are being honest with ourselves, can we see such a world in our lifetime? I have to say, realistically, that the answer is no.</P>
    <P>This is not to say that we cannot play our part.  In this respect we should judge ourselves very harshly in terms of what we have done, or could do, to assist in the nuclear debate, not just on an Irish-English basis but also on a worldwide basis.  In this context I ask the Minister to agree with the proposition that no Irish Government has ever done enough, no Irish Government has ever been aggressive enough and no Irish Government has ever been loud enough in its condemnation, especially of our neighbour, on the issue of nuclear policy. No Irish Government has ever really articulated, in an international sense, the abhorrence that the vast majority of Irish people feel about the entire nuclear industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I will agree with the Senator, except for what is happening now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was apolitical in saying no Irish Government, and I include the Government in this.  I am sorry to tell the Minister that simply because he has a trendy anti nuclear pin on the lapel of his jacket, it does not compenstate for the Government's lack in articulating opposition to the nuclear energy policy.  I was very disappointed, at the first coming together of Fianna Fáil and Labour in Government, at the reaction of both parties to the nuclear issue.  I recall pressing the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Michael Smith, on this topic and was disappointed with his reasons &mdash; which I respected but disagreed with &mdash; for not taking legal action against the English authorities or for not initiating some other action against them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="516" /> I am equally disappointed with what the present Minister for the Environment has done.  I am terribly disappointed with the silence of the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs on French nuclear testing.  I am not sure whether a Fianna Fáil Minister would have been more articulate on this topic. It is well known that Fianna Fáil is allied to the Gaullist party in the European Parliament and it may have been politically embarrassing to raise the issue. This lack of articulation is way out of step with the basic feelings of ordinary people, who fear contamination of the Irish Sea and a Chernobyl-like-fall-out from England or France and who have a general antipathy to the entire nuclear energy sector.</P>
    <P>I commend the decision to assist, albeit in an informal way, the Dundalk residents who are taking a case against British Nuclear Fuels Limited.  I know some of the counsel for these people; they are of the highest ability and integrity and some of them are working on the case out of genuine commitment.</P>
    <P>There is a contradiction in the plaintiffs' case, which they will have to address.  They cannot have it both ways; they cannot have Ireland and the Attorney General as a defendant on the one hand and on the other seek assistance from the offices of the State.  I appeal to the Minister to ask the plaintiffs to consider dropping Ireland and the Attorney General as co-defendants and to join them as plaintiffs and give them the full backing of all the legal machinery the State has at its disposal. I would like the Government to say to the plaintiffs that they would like to fight the same people they are fighting.</P>
    <P>In the High Court the plaintiffs won the right to have the case heard in Ireland.  The Irish courts for the first time took jurisdiction.  I do not see why there should ever have been a problem with jurisdiction if we consider the principles of nuisance as enunciated in the Hanrahan case involving a farmer in Tipperary and Merck, Sharp and Dohme.  It is high time that the Government, of whatever hue, started backing <Col N="517" /> the people who only started these legal proceedings after a sense of frustration at the inactivity of successive Governments.</P>
    <P>The Minister pointed out that an opinion was given by the European Commission on 30 April 1992.  He stated that a member state which is considered by the Commission or another member state to have failed to meet an obligation of the EU Treaty may be brought before the Court of Justice.  If the United Kingdom is not in breach of the treaty, we should try and change the treaty.  What is wrong with saying that it is not good enough that a neighbouring state can have a potentially devastating plant 50 or 60 miles from us?  Did we ever receive a letter of indemnity from the British Government?  It guarantees its nuclear industry is safe, but did it ever say it would indemnify us in respect of any loss or damage that may be occasioned by its nuclear facilities?  I do not believe we ever received any such guarantee of indemnity.  Did we ever ask for such indemnity, and should we ask for it?  These are the kind of practical steps we should take.  I know the Minister will agree with almost everything I said and I look forward to his reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and I am glad of the opportunity to make points on this issue.  Other speakers have outlined many of the concerns of all of us and I will concentrate on the issue of Sellafield and THORP.  All parties in the Oireachtas have been unanimous in their opposition to Sellafield and have always supported the calls by this Government to have the plant closed.  Ireland's case for the closure of Sellafield and THORP is based on the belief that it is inherently unsafe.  This and previous Governments have on numerous occasions requested the British Government to close Sellafield and have emphasised our total opposition to the plant.  The question of safety standards at the plant, its history of mismanagement and the numerous accidents <Col N="518" /> which have occurred there all give rise to grevious concern.</P>
      <P>However, we must be realistic.  No matter how often we call for the closure of Sellafield and THORP, we know this will not happen.  When the THORP plant was built it was one of the largest civil engineering contracts in Britain and had an estimated life of 25 years.  It employs almost 10,000 people.  The number of jobs this operation provides, the foreign currency it generates and the billions of pounds it brings into the British economy show that Britain has no intention of closing the plant, particularly in the near future.</P>
      <P>We should be concerned about the operation of the plant and the powers we and the EU have to inspect it and ensure it is operating to safe standards. We should seek the establishment at international level &mdash; we could first do this within the EU &mdash; of an appropriate nuclear agency with powers of inspection. The International Atomic Energy Agency only has powers of inspection when it is invited by sovereign Governments. There is no way Britain will constantly ask this agency to inspect its nuclear industry.  This is a totally inadequate inspection system.</P>
      <P>The Irish Sea is the world's busiest sea lane for submarines carrying nuclear waste.  This country has a huge vested interest in ensuring that there is an independent inspection agency.  We know that Chernobyl and other places well outside the EU have the capacity to affect us apart from plants nearer home. The idea of an agency with powers to inspect and set down safety standards should be high on our agenda, particulary given that we will shortly assume the Presidency of the EU.  The agency I would envisage is one which can inspect when it wishes and does not have to wait for sovereign Governments to invite it to do so.  It should be able to assuage the concerns of other EU member states.  We will have an opportunity to do this when we hold the EU Presidency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our nearest neighbour, Britain, and its Sellafield THORP plant is our major <Col N="519" /> concern.  France is also a near neighbour. It is not only a military nuclear power; it also uses nuclear power to generate a substantial amount of its electricity.  During our Presidency of the EU we should establish an independent agency that will have powers to inspect these nuclear stations without the permission of the sovereign Governments. That will go a long way towards allaying the concerns of many of our people and all parties in both Houses would support such a measure.  It is a practical way of doing something about the problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the possibility of legal action against Sellafield is being re-examined by the Attorney General but it has been shown in the past that it must be based on evidence of injurious effect of operations of the plant in Ireland and that has not been available up to now.  We do not seem to be able to make a case at the moment.  If that is so, we should ensure there are inspection facilities over which we and other member states would have control.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg) Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Members for their valuable contributions. However, Senator Mulcahy's contribution is a notable exception.  His was the only negative contribution in the debate.  I regret that he took the opportunity to take cheap political shots.  I assure him the badge I wear is not a new yuppie gimmick.  I have been wearing it since the 1960s and have been active in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and have been against the use of nuclear energy for many years, probably even before he was born.  I reject his cheap shot.  His magic wand proposals have been made many times before by people who either do not know or have not taken the trouble to find out what they are talking about.  His statements on the US, Germany and even Britain who, with the exception of the Sellafield reprocessing plant, have all stopped building new nuclear generating stations were incorrect.  He did not even know <Col N="520" /> that well known and accepted fact.  I will pursue the positive and definite proposals made by Senator Honan.</P>
      <P>Our nuclear policy objectives place a heavy emphasis on continuous improvements in nuclear safety and the highest levels of radiological protection standards in the use of nuclear power.  It is the clearly expressed wish of the Irish people not to pursue nuclear power as a means of generating energy or nuclear weapons as a means of defence.  This does not mean that we reject all nuclear related activity.  That has never been the case.  There are many applications in medicine, industry, research and agriculture where nuclear technology is useful and beneficial and the risks are minimal.</P>
      <P>I reassure the House that this Government remains opposed to the expansion of the nuclear power industry especially as certain serious problems remain unresolved, such as the risk of serious accidents and problems relating to the reprocessing and transport of nuclear materials, waste storage and the disposal and decommissioning of nuclear installations.  These problems affect all countries whether they pursue the nuclear option.</P>
      <P>The implications of the global use of nuclear power is of serious concern to us, particularly in the aftermath of the Chernobyl accident in 1986 which clearly showed that radioactivity respects no frontiers.  Consequently, the Government has, and continues to, use every opportunity at all appropriate international fora &mdash; in particular European Union, International Atomic Energy Agency, Paris Commission relating to marine discharges and International Marine Organisation levels as well as direct representations at all times to the United Kingdom Government &mdash; to highlight its concerns about the safety of the nuclear industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A direct diplomatic initiative at a formal and high level has been mounted by the Government.  Our diplomats have been asked to persuade countries providing raw materials for reprocessing in Sellafield not to enter into agreements <Col N="521" /> for reprocessing and where there are agreements, that they might bring them to an end.</P>
    <P>It is this Government's policy to be proactive rather than reactive on nuclear safety matters.  The Government's policy agreement, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> recognises that the nuclear industry in Britain and abroad poses a serious and continuing threat to the health and safety of the Irish people. The agreement therefore sets out a series of proposals which the Government is actively pursuing.</P>
    <P>A task force of Ministers was established to develop and co-ordinate a concerted strategy for progressing these proposals.  It is important to emphasise this is the first comprehensive initiative taken by any Government to date to address the problems caused by Sellafield and it illustrates the Government's serious commitment on energy matters.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan referred to the possibility of eliminating the dangers from radon gas.  It is easy to eliminate these dangers in existing houses.  The cost of the RPPI's proposals to do it would be approximately £1,000 per house.  Radon gas can be eliminated in a newly built house at a cost of around £500.  That provision will be included in the new building regulations adopted by the Department of the Environment. Senator Lanigan can be assured that we are again examining how people may be assisted in bringing that about.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, nuclear safety and radiological protection are a matter of concern to all Irish people, particularly in view of the proximity of British nuclear plants to this country, the litany of incidents that have occurred at Sellafield and other plants and the coming on stream of the THORP reprocessing plant.  I will continue to object at every opportunity to the UK's nuclear industry in general and to Sellafield, THORP and related matters in particular which pose a threat to the Irish public.</P>
    <P>The question of taking legal action against Sellafield remains open if there is scientific evidence as to the injurious effects of Sellafield's operations or there <Col N="522" /> has been a breach of UK or international law.  The Attorney General is re-examining this matter with my Department.</P>
    <P>In the case of the action being taken by four Dundalk residents against British Nuclear Fuels, the State's counsel will be supporting the plaintiffs in the Supreme Court next January in resisting the appeal taken by British Nuclear Fuels against the earlier decision of the High Court in favour of the Dundalk residents.  My Department is also cooperating fully with the Dundalk plaintiffs in voluntarily providing access to its files and documentation for the substantive case even though the Government and the Attorney General are named as co-defendants in this matter.</P>
    <P>On the Magnox reactors in Britain, I have expressed in the strongest terms to the UK Ministers for Energy and of the Environment my concerns over the reliability of Magnox reactors such as those at Sellafield, which were built in 1956, and the Wylfa and Dungeness reactors where there have been recent accidents.  They have passed their sell by date by a long margin and are now being kept in operation because of the huge cost of decommissioning them and the danger arising from them is greatly increased.  The cost of decommissioning one of these monsters is in the region of £1 billion sterling.  I have called on the United Kingdom Government to phase out all Magnox reactors in the interests of nuclear safety and radiation protection as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>As further evidence of my personal commitment to nuclear safety matters, I will be presenting at a public inquiry in Cumbria in early December the State's objections to a proposal by the UK company, NIREX, to site a rock characterisation facility near Sellafield.  This may be a forerunner to the siting of a permanent repository or dump for nuclear waste at the Sellafield site.</P>
    <P>If safety is to remain of paramount importance I believe the UK Government should retain the full nuclear industry in the public sector where commercial pressures do not tend to <Col N="523" /> compromise safety to the same degree as they could in a privatised industry.  To my mind, privatisation would lead to increasing pressures on persons and safety as output and profit become more important to private interests in the long term.  I welcome the support across the House for the Government's position, although there would normally be different opinions on privatisation.</P>
    <P>The implications of the global use of nuclear power is of serious concern to us also, particularly in view of the aftermath of the Chernobyl accident in 1986, which showed that radioactivity respects no frontiers.  The existence of vast quantities of separated fissile plutonium and highly enriched uranium worldwide arising from the dismantling of nuclear weapons and the reprocessing of spent fuel continues to be a cause of great concern.  As the stockpiles grow, the danger of someone stealing the material and selling it to a country who wishes to make nuclear bombs for use against its neighbours also increases.</P>
    <P>The unsafe state of some ageing reactors in eastern Europe similar to Chernobyl is also of great concern.  Our attitude is that these should be shut down and decommissioned if they are in such a state that they cannot be upgraded quickly to the internationally acceptable safety standards.  I support the proposal to assist the Ukrainian authorities in the final decommissioning of Chernobyl, which is still operating and spewing out radioactivity.</P>
    <P>As the 1986 Chernobyl accident demonstrated, distance is no guarantee that significant amounts of radioactive contamination will not reach us.  In that case the level was fortunately not high enough to cause an immediate health risk.  When I say &ldquo;immediate&rdquo; I do not mean no damage was done, rather that people did not fall down dead.  It has been established that long term low levels of radioactivity affect people's health.  That happened as a result of Chernobyl and precautions must be taken to mitigate against it.  The fact that there was no immediate health risk <Col N="524" /> does not mean there is no cause for concern. The other aspect which directly affects us is that because we are a food producing and exporting country, if our good name is damaged it would be difficult to get it back.</P>
    <P>I strongly dispute that the officers of the RPII are members of the &ldquo;nuclear club&rdquo;, as suggested by Senator Lanigan; their concerns are for the safety of the Irish people.  It is an independent institute which does a good job for us. Last Tuesday, the Irish Marine Emergency Service was notified about a shipment of uranium ore concentrate going through the Irish Sea on its way from Portugal to Liverpool.  It monitored the progress of the vessel which, after unloading at Liverpool, proceeded to Dublin, docking this morning.  The vessel was examined by inspectors from the RPII and the Department of the Marine to ensure none of that material was brought into Irish waters.  I compliment the institute for that and for its excellent monitoring on our behalf on a 24 hour basis.  I have full and absolute confidence in the officials, who are in no way members of a &ldquo;nuclear club&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Arising from what I have said, we have in place a national emergency plan for nuclear accidents which provides a comprehensive, rapid and effective framework for response to all aspects of accidents involving the release or potential release of radioactive substances into the environment which could give rise to radiation exposure.  The plan is now eight years old; it has developed with experience and taken note of changes.  We are now reviewing the detail of the plan and will test it within months.  I hope Senator Daly's concerns will be met by that point, which I intended to mention in my opening contribution.</P>
    <P>I hope I have outlined clearly for the House the current nuclear energy issues and this Government's commitment to ensuring the radiological protection of the Irish people and our diligence in pursuing at every EU and international forum that the highest safety standards for the use of nuclear power are <Col N="525" /> employed.  The Government is committed to action against nuclear power.  It will not sit passively watching it build up in the UK or on a global scale and do nothing.  We will be to the forefront in ensuring our concerns over safety standards and radiological protection are heard and acted upon.</P>

    <Title>Report of the Ombudsman: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate this report.  I congratulate the Ombudsman, Mr. Kevin Murphy, and his staff on the excellent service they provide to the State and on their objectivity in handling their duties.</P>
      <P>The Ombudsman's Office was established as an independent body by the Dáil and the Seanad.  Its role is to examine complaints and to report to the Houses of the Oireachtas, to identify the causes of maladministration and to recommend redress.  His independence gives the Ombudsman the public credibility to perform his functions and also leads to various bodies within his remit having confidence in him.  It gives citizens the capacity to question the administration and in many instances the office represents an avenue of last resort for citizens aggrieved by actions of the public services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that the office plays a strong part in rooting out the causes of many complaints encountered, as it is important to identify the underlying causes of maladministration and suggest improvements.  It is incumbent on the authorities to examine closely and implement the suggestions of the Office of the Ombudsman.  It is obviously a matter for each Department or agency to take whatever steps are necessary to redress and prevent the recurrence of any maladministration reported to them.  I note that the Ombudsman has called for increased co-operation and dialogue between his office and the individual <Col N="526" /> organisations on improvements in administration practices and procedures. It is important that this is developed and introduced and that the Government supports this approach.</P>
    <P>An effective democracy requires that both elected and non elected public servants should be held accountable for their actions.  Politicians are accountable in the democratic system in that they put themselves before the people for reelection. The people are asked to pass judgment on their performance and, if satisfied, to re-elect them.  It is important that there is also accountability for non elected officials.  It is important to ensure that public service activities and exercises of decision making powers, whether discretionary or otherwise, are carried out not only in a proper legal manner but in a manner consistent with fairness and good administrative practice.  This is the area which is policed by the Ombudsman.  He is similar to an auditor in that he checks if the audit of the administrative practices is up to standard.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman endeavours to reflect his views on the efficiency and effectiveness of the public administration system in his report, in which he has outlined the principles of good administration, to which I wish to refer directly.</P>
    <P>In exercising their powers, including those of decision making, whether discretionary or otherwise, public bodies should ensure that some basic principles are adhered to:</P>
    <P>&mdash;powers must only be used for the specific purpose for which they are given;</P>
    <P>&mdash;powers must be applied with objectivity and impartiality &mdash; factors not relevant to a particular case must be disregarded;</P>
    <P>&mdash;unfair discrimination must be avoided &mdash; like cases must be treated in like manner;</P>
    <P>&mdash;public bodies must ensure that an appropriate balance is achieved <Col N="527" /> particularly in relation to any penalties or adverse effect &mdash; known as the principle of proportionality; this may be of particular interest where a body must decide between the needs of the common good and the rights of a particular individual;</P>
    <P>&mdash;public bodies must avoid undue delay &mdash; particularly in cases where practical difficulties may arise for the individual as a result of or where uncertainty may be created;</P>
    <P>&mdash;public bodies must have available good administrative guidelines to which the public at large may refer;</P>
    <P>&mdash;in addition, where discretionary powers are involved, public bodies must ensure that they are exercised in a reasonable manner having regard to the foregoing principles, all the circumstances of the particular case and without any undue fettering of their actual discretion e.g. by exclusion of classes of persons from eligibility for services or otherwise.</P>
    <P>One of the principles outlined as part of the role of the Ombudsman is to strive to persuade public bodies to adhere to such principles.  Where they fail to do so, the Ombudsman has a strong role to ensure that they adhere to the principles of good administrative practice.</P>
    <P>Citizens' rights are often referred to. I presume that if Senator Quinn was here he would agree that the citizen is a consumer of the facilities of the public service as well as their owner, and should be recognised as such.  As with any product, the customer is always right and it is important that I outline the rights of the users of the public service, as outlined by Mr. Murphy in his report.  The citizen has a right to be heard, to receive sufficient information, to assistance and representation, to be given reasons and to be told what remedies are available to him.</P>
    <P>The customer &mdash; that is, the public &mdash; must be facilitated in putting his point <Col N="528" /> of view and arguments before the decision is taken.  These should include arguments for an exception to be made in the individual circumstances of their case.  This is often the most difficult area in which to obtain success, as bureaucracy and the fear of precedent limits the discretion which public servants have or wish to have.  Citizens should have information available to them on any general guidelines which apply to the particular scheme or programme involved.  Advice and representation must be available, especially for those least able to make their case.  The reasons for a decision are particularly important where a decision is an adverse one and they must be told of remedies or avenues of address, especially rights of appeal to independent bodies where they are available to them.</P>
    <P>It is important that we promote a greater awareness of these rights among the public bodies.  In some other jurisdictions, guidelines on good administration practices are regularly used and should be the overriding principle for all public bodies.</P>
    <P>On a few occasions the Ombudsman has been disappointed with the level of cases referred to him by public representatives. In a way, public representatives are a type of Ombudsman in much of their work.  Adverse comment is often made on the amount of work done by public representatives in representing their constituents, raising issues of concern to individuals and making representations on their behalf. In Ireland we tend to be overly critical of the work done by public representatives, who have a very important role to play in that area.  They also have an overriding role to involve themselves in legislation, the development of society and the implementation of good laws. However, we should not downgrade or overly criticise the work done by politicians in representing their constituents. There is a balance between the legislative and representational roles. We feel that this is more prevalent in Ireland than in other countries, but that is not so; constituency work is the norm <Col N="529" /> for parliamentarians in almost every country.</P>
    <P>I read an interesting article on this some years ago which distinguished between a client and a broker.  The role of a politician is more that of a broker than client.  The term &ldquo;client&rdquo; infers that there is an agreement to deliver something for some payment whereas a broker just offers assistance.  The work carried out for individual constituencies would be more properly referred to as brokerage rather than clientelism.  A broker provides people with access to those who control resources rather than directly to the resources themselves.  A situation may exist where someone may wish to obtain something but is unable or unwilling to obtain it from the person in whose possession it rests.  The services of a broker or public representative might be useful in such a case.  I use the term &ldquo;public representative&rdquo; in its broadest sense because Deputies and Senators are not alone in offering assistance to constituents.  Urban and county councillors and town commissioners involve themselves in this area.</P>
    <P>However, when the service is provided, the brokerage relationship ends. A continuum does not exist.  Many politicians would hope that a continuation might occur but no deal has been made that it should be so.  Brokerage in politics takes many forms.  It can involve advising constituents with regard to the benefits for which they are eligible and how to obtain them.  Such benefits might include receipt of a grant or pension or having a hole in the road repaired, which is often the case at present.</P>
    <P>Brokerage in politics also involves mediation &mdash; with regard to an apparently harsh decision made by the Civil Service &mdash; and helping or seeming to help someone obtain local authority housing or a job.  People can be assisted in this way.  Very often politicians fail because they create an expectation that they can do more than is actually possible. If we were more honest about our role and powers, it would enhance that role and our standing in the public eye. Work carried out by public representatives <Col N="530" /> can involve activity on behalf of a community, village or local association. This could include, for example, persuading central or local government to introduce or improve a water or sewerage scheme in one's area.</P>
    <P>It is widely accepted in most democracies that contacting the local or national representative can be of help. The main value of this lies in the fact that it enables people to discover the existence of benefits, grants or rights of which they would otherwise have been unaware.  They can also discover how to obtain such entitlements and if they are eligible for them.  Politicians should be in a position to inform people how to secure those entitlements.  This involves work for politicians but saves time for constituents, many of whom are not used to the bureaucracy which surrounds the obtaining of information.</P>
    <P>In all non-urban societies, the capital city and machinery of central government tend to be regarded with some suspicion. This is the case in most post-colonial states where that factor was reinforced by the ruling elite who, at a previous time, were seen to have access to power and influence.  An expectation exists that today's democratically elected politicians, who replaced such elites, retain similar power and influence. Historically, this is the reason politicians in post-colonial countries are regarded in this way.  However, I understand that MPs in the UK now spend over 50 per cent of their time writing to constituents.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I congratulate Mr. Murphy and his staff for their excellent work.  They are carrying on the work of the office so efficiently established by Mr. Michael Mills.  Politicians must ensure the development of the office and their role.  They must respond to the recommendations in the report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The creation of the Office of the Ombudsman was a relatively novel development in Ireland's administrative tradition.  I suggest that it is time to review the jurisdiction of the Office of the Ombudsman and the powers he <Col N="531" /> himself retains.  Some extraordinary deficiencies exist in the legislation which deals with the Irish Ombudsman.</P>
      <P>The current Ombudsman, Mr. Kevin Murphy, and his predecessor, Mr. Michael Mills, have filled that office with distinction.  Their staff have conducted themselves extraordinarily well. They have established the office in the minds of the people and engendered an important sympathy and regard for that office.  Nonetheless, the Office of the Ombudsman is one of the most fettered institutions of its kind in the world.  In the past I had the opportunity to review some 80 pieces of legislation connected to the Office of the Ombudsman.  Under 25 or 26 different headings, I discovered that literally every possible exclusion that existed, in every similar law in every other country, had been carried into the Irish Ombudsman's Act.</P>
      <P>Some years ago a book was written on the British Parliamentary Commissioner entitled <i>Our Fettered Ombudsman</i>.  Like most things British, the title could be recycled for this country without any difficulty.  Despite the fact that the Ombudsman's jurisdiction has been somewhat extended since the office was established, the Irish Ombudsman still suffers from restrictions which have no parallel &mdash; in terms of jurisdiction or powers &mdash; in any other comparable piece of international law.  I believe that the Ombudsman's Act was drawn up in a deliberately narrow manner. The Act underwent debate and discussion in an all-party Oireachtas committee 15 years ago.  I believe that committee was treated like a mushroom and kept in the dark.  Some of the information given to it was highly suspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Ombudsman's jurisdiction is excessively narrowly drawn.  No reason exists today for such conservatism.  The Ombudsman's remit is deliberately limited to matters of administration.  There are areas within the public service, other than matters of administration, which can cause a sense of grievance and injustice for the population as a whole.  The formula of complaint which the <Col N="532" /> Ombudsman follows was drawn from comparable international legislation, particularly the more conservative elements of the original Ombudsman's Act in New Zealand.  It is a pity we have not followed the example of other countries and broadened that particular aspect of the remit.  With the exception of An Post and Telecom Éireann, for example, the commercial and non-commercial State-sponsored bodies are still excluded from the Ombudsman's remit. Key elements of health administration, specifically matters where clinical judgment is involved, remain outside the Ombudsman's powers.  The Ombudsman has no powers in relation to the Prison Service, an area where he should, could and, if international were followed, would have powers.</P>
    <P>Many of the exclusions and limitations should be examined.  The institution has an 11 year history.  Fear and trepidation existed within the public service when it was established.  I carried out a survey of Deputies and civil servants at the time, and it was interesting that Deputies were particularly disposed towards the office while senior civil servants were cautious about it, to say the least.  There is no need for such caution now.  Any novelty regarding this office in our administrative setting which may have been pleaded 12 years ago, cannot now be pleaded.</P>
    <P>I would like to see three specific limitations lifted and I will address those limitations in this debate.  These are the power to consider complaints which include or touch upon clinical judgment; the power to inspect and the power to take complaints against all State-sponsored bodies, commercial or non-commercial. I will draw attention to some other weaknesses if time permits.</P>
    <P>I will first deal with the issue of inspection which is the neatest and most self-contained.  It is an extraordinary fact that the Ombudsman has no real power.  The Ombudsman can request papers and review administrative actions that have been taken.  He can then give judgment within the terms of the Act.  The Office of the Ombudsman <Col N="533" /> is extremely successful within the context of the limited powers available to it.  However, the Ombudsman has no power to inspect, to prosecute or to cause a prosecution to take place.  These seem to be extraordinary deficiencies.</P>
    <P>If, for example, one looks at the home of the Ombudsman institution, the Scandinavian countries, one finds that inspection, particularly that of closed institutions, is a common feature of the Ombudsman's activities.  Outside the Nordic countries in the common law states which adopted the Ombudsman, there has been a tendency to extend the powers and to give Ombudsmen power to inspect corrective and closed institutions.</P>
    <P>In the context of some recent events in Irish life, there is an unanswerable case for giving the power of inspection and of initiating prosecution to the Ombudsman's Office.  For example, in the case of the child care institutions which recently attracted such unfortunate publicity, including Trudder House, Madonna House and other institutions, it would have been appropriate and proper for the Ombudsman to have had some power of inspection because no other public institution has or fulfils the inspectorate power in those particular institutions.</P>
    <P>There is an inspectorate for medical health institutions but it is within the institutional setting.  We need an autonomous inspectorate too and the Ombudsman could and should provide it.  Within the Prison Service there is an abundance of precedent for Ombudsmen being given powers to look inside prisons, to arrive unannounced and to examine what is happening within the closed institutions.</P>
    <P>An interesting point about powers of inspection is that where they exist, Ombudsmen have been able to highlight good administration and, occasionally, to feature what is bad.  If an Ombudsman can bring the light of public scrutiny into otherwise closed areas of public administration, then a great public benefit flows from that.  If the Ombudsman falls upon good practices, <Col N="534" /> then citizens know what is being done in their name is good.  However, if the Ombudsman highlights something that is wrong, then corrective action can be taken.</P>
    <P>If we look at Ombudsman institutions around the world we see there is an increasing tendency to give it powers of inspection and powers to prosecute.  For example, the Finnish and the Swedish Ombudsmen can initiate proceedings in their own right.  Although in New Zealand, Alberta, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Hawaii and Nebraska Ombudsmen do not possess direct powers or authority to initiate proceedings, they may, if they have witnessed a breach of duty or misconduct, institute proceedings by contacting the appropriate body to request the equivalent of the Director of Public Prosecutions, for example, to initiate a prosecution.  I cannot understand why we denied these powers to our Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>As far back as 1980 I highlighted what I regarded as an extraordinary deficiency in judgment when the Act was being drafted.  I pointed out that a major problem with the Act was that not only did it initially exclude the health boards but, even in the long term, it was the intention of the drafters of the Act to exclude matters of clinical judgment.  We slavishly copied the worst aspect of the British Parliamentary Commissioner legislation.</P>
    <P>We now have a situation where an action against a health board can be investigated.  If I complain that a member of my household is badly treated by the health service, the administrative and clerical aspects of that complaint can be investigated.  If a person goes to hospital for attention to their left leg and by accident their right leg is cut off, the Ombudsman may investigate to see if the administrative details were correct but can make no judgment on the clinical aspects.  That is a farce which we have put into law and have lived with for ten years because we do not have the wit, intelligence or the capacity to develop autonomous thinking in areas <Col N="535" /> of important legislation.  We are still slavishly colonial in that regard.</P>
    <P>Many cases in the health administration services will involve the crossing and recrossing of the boundaries between administration and clinical judgment.  It is wrong and unacceptable that one cannot have a full and thorough investigation of all aspects of health administration by the Ombudsman. In my constituency an elderly lady died in a public hospital of MRSA.  It caused great pain and anxiety to her family because during the period of her care and attention complaints were made.  Only the administrative aspect of that case can be examined.  In another case, a patient went into trauma and died after a hospital bed collapsed.  The only aspect of that case which I can have examined is whether the next of kin was appropriately contacted by telephone on the day in question.  That is a farce which we should not tolerate.  We have a duty to the people to ensure the legislation we put on the Statute Book is sensible.  In this case, this good legislation is not sensible.</P>
    <P>I turn to the issue of jurisdiction.  For some extraordinary reason which I could never understand, the initial decision was taken to exclude local authorities, health authorities and State-sponsored bodies from the Ombudsman's jurisdiction.  Subsequently, local authorities and the administrative aspects of health care were brought into the Ombudsman's jurisdiction.  The Ombudsman may also examine complaints about An Post and Telecom Éireann.  Those who advised both Houses and who put words into the mouths of different Ministers who brought the legislation before us ten to 15 years ago suggested that the sky would fall if State-sponsored bodies could be examined by the Ombudsman. What a farce.</P>
    <P>The argument put forward was that this would allow the Ombudsman to intrude his or her office into areas of potential commercial secrecy.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  There <Col N="536" /> are approximately 120 Ombudsmen internationally at national level, the majority of whom can examine complaints about State owned enterprises. There is no evidence that an Ombudsman, wittingly or unwittingly, has gone out to destroy a state enterprise.  If we look at Canadian provincial Ombudsmen, in particular, evidence suggests that their scrutiny of state monopolies has been beneficial from the point of view of the institutions, the agencies and the citizens.  For example, in Alberta, a Canadian province, a pylon was put in the driveway of a citizen.  That person could not get any redress from the electricity company.  If our Ombudsman legislation applied in that Canadian province, the unfortunate citizen would only have recourse to the courts.  I am not suggesting the ESB would deliberately do something as patently stupid as that or that it and other State-sponsored bodies are so endowed with wisdom that they will not make the occasional slip up which trespasses or intrudes upon the rights of the citizen.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence to suggest that expanding the Ombudsman's role would have anything other than a beneficial effect.  Ten years ago when the Ombudsman's Office was set up there was a brouhaha about telecommunications bills and the Ombudsman was finally given the power to oversee Telecom Éireann.  If we look at the ten reports over the past 11 years we will see that there has been an extraordinary decline in complaints against Telecom Éireann which improved its system because the Ombudsman was there to defend the citizen.  We have no reason to fear this office which has served the people well.  It is time we adopted a more mature approach by expanding the office and giving the Ombudsman additional powers and, above all, jurisdictions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimTownsend" hpid="Mr. Townsend Mr. Townsend">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Townsend</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Ombudsman and his staff on compiling such a readable report.  The examples he gave would be helpful to me as a practising politician.  I was also delighted <Col N="537" /> that his report put down some markers on the way forward.</P>
      <P>When the Office of the Ombudsman was set up we were lucky that someone with the integrity, capability and commonsense of Michael Mills was appointed as its first chairman.  Over ten years in office he established the independence of the Ombudsman's Office and he did not accept orders from Government or any organisations which came within his remit.  He did his job as it was supposed to be done in a fearless and courageous way.  During those ten years he was successful in resolving many thousands of complaints, most of which would never have been resolved without his assistance.  The reason for this is that most of the complaints were brought by ordinary people who got no hearing from the Departments in question. On inquiring, these people were told that a decision had been made and that was that.  People working in various Departments refused to admit they could make a mistake.  It was as simple as that.</P>
      <P>Not only was the Office of the Ombudsman responsible for resolving many complaints, it also was responsible for changes in our legislative and administrative systems, which led to the mistakes in the first place.  Mr. Michael Mills left the office in great shape and great credit is due to him.  Not only did he resolve the problems which confronted him, he also got to the root cause of them and put mechanisms in place to prevent them recurring.</P>
      <P>The new Ombudsman, Mr. Kevin Murphy, had a hard act to follow, but all the indications are that he has his heart in the right place.  In particular, I like what he had to say about accountability in the 1994 report.  It states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An effective democracy requires that both elected and non-elected public servants should be held accountable for their actions. Accountability may take different forms and operate at different levels. The most demanding is political accountability which requires elected <Col N="538" /> representatives, at fixed intervals, to put themselves before the people for re-election.  Accountability for the management and use of resources is another form with which we are all familiar.  This is aimed at ensuring that monies raised by, or given to, public authorities are not only properly used but are also used in an efficient and effective manner.  [I do not think anyone can complain about that.]  The process is validated by independent external auditors;...</P>
    <P>The report continues:</P>
    <P>Another form of accountability, which is perhaps not so widely discussed, is what I would like to call administrative accountability.  This is a process of ensuring that public service activities and, in particular, the exercise of decision making powers, whether discretionary or otherwise, are carried out not only in a proper legal manner but in a manner consistent with fairness and good administrative practice.  [That applies to a great extent to health boards and local authorities.]</P>
    <P>This is the area in which I and my Office and indeed, the courts operate. Just as financial auditors examine the activities of the public service against certain financial principles and criteria, I examine their activities against the background of what are commonly referred to as the principles of good administration.</P>
    <P>I agree completely with Mr. Murphy when he says citizens and users of the public service have the right to be heard, to receive sufficient information, to assistance and representation, to be given reasons for being refused something and to be told what remedies are available.  He is setting out on the right course when he has all that in mind.</P>
    <P>I am also delighted that the Government is committed to the extension of the powers and remit of the Office of the Ombudsman.  I understand discussions are taking place in that regard at present.  Some people might say the <Col N="539" /> Ombudsman was not given wide enough scope when the office was set up.  I think it was correct to ease him into the job rather than have him snowed under with piles of complaints in all Departments. It was the right decision.  At the same time, I am not convinced that it would be good to bring some of the areas which Senator Roche suggested within the remit of the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the number of complaints which the Ombudsman received in 1994.  The report makes interesting reading from a public representative's point of view.  Senator Neville hit on this too.  A public representative in rural Ireland &mdash; I do not know about Dublin &mdash; is also a kind of Ombudsman.  When people have complaints, they come to their local representative. Some would be ordinary representations and others would be complaints.</P>
    <P>I looked through my notes and the complaints I receive would not differ from the type of complaints which the Ombudsman received about the various Departments.  The report states that in 1994 there were 3,160 complaints.  Of these, 671 were outside the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman.  This indicates clearly that a lot of people do not know their entitlements or whether various Departments come within his remit. That left a balance of 2,489 valid complaints. In addition, there was a carryover of 641 complaints from 1993, resulting in a total of 3,130 complaints to be dealt with in 1994.  Of these, 2,321 were finalised during the year, leaving a balance of 809 to be carried forward to 1995.  It appears from the latter figure that the Ombudsman's Office might require more staff and that would be a step in the right direction.  The carryover of complaints from last year was greater than that from the previous year.</P>
    <P>The report also states that of the 2,321 complaints finalised in 1994, 414 were resolved in favour of the complainant, while in 580 complaints assistance of one form or another was provided. <Col N="540" /> The number of complaints not upheld and those where assistance was given is not a great one considering the vast number of transactions in the Department of Social Welfare, An Post, Telecom Éireann and other areas covered by the Ombudsman's remit.  The number not upheld was 914 which was reasonably high.  A further 355 complaints were discontinued and 58 were withdrawn.</P>
    <P>A breakdown of the number of complaints is fairly interesting and coincides with the types of complaints which I get as a public representative.  According to the report, 48 per cent of concerned Civil Service Departments.  Of these, 54 per cent involved the Department of Social Welfare, 15 per cent concerned the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and 12 per cent were against the Revenue Commissioners.  Of the total handled during 1994, 23 per cent concerned local authorities, 14 per cent involved health boards, 12 per cent were against Telecom Éireann and 3 per cent were against An Post.</P>
    <P>The continuing high level of complaints received outside the Ombudsman's jurisdiction, which amounted to 21 per cent of the total received in 1994, indicates a level of confusion, as I already said.  The Ombudsman intends remedying that through a publicity campaign to make people aware of what comes within his remit.</P>
    <P>The numbers are not excessively high. When I go to county council or health board offices to try and push a case in a certain way, I am often told that they have to look over their shoulders to ensure everything is right or the case may be brought to the Ombudsman.  It is an indirect benefit of the Office of the Ombudsman that people in public offices are more careful.  They know that if they make wrong decisions, the Ombudsman can have a further look at the situation.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the present Ombudsman has continued the trend set by his predecessor in making <Col N="541" /> regional visits and I am very pleased he included Carlow in those visits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an tuairisc seo.  Is tuairisc fíor mhaith agus tábhachtach é.  In welcoming the report I congratulate the new Ombudsman on the direction his thinking is taking.  He is expanding the authority of the Ombudsman and extending its activities.  His reflections on the importance of a culture of openness &mdash; such a culture is at an early stage in this country &mdash; should be taken on board by all of us.</P>
      <P>When he talks about the citizen's right to receive sufficient information, he puts his finger on one of major weaknesses in the functioning of effective democracy in this country and I hope he will be able to make progress in that direction.  The Ombudsman reflects generally on the implications of the implementation of the provisions of the EU Directive on freedom of access to information on the environment.  That is a classic case study of the difficulties one can encounter when trying to instill a culture of access to information in our public bodies and local authorities.  Like Senator Roche, I have spent years advocating that local authorities should have greater authority and that decision making should be brought closer to those affected by it.</P>
      <P>It is sad that resistance to providing access to information seems at least as deeply ingrained in many local authorities as it has historically been in the central authority.  I do not know why that has to be.  Senator Neville made some interesting observations about how citizens remain suspicious of Government and how such suspicion seems to be characteristic of many post colonial societies.  Even more striking is the suspicion of the citizen by the Government and the administrator at various levels.  One must overcome this suspicion when implementing a culture of access to information and openness. It is a difficult and attritional campaign which must be waged against the forces of resistance in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="542" /> I am not criticising public authorities particularly, because we can all be defensive about providing access to our own activities for any number of reasons, some of them eminently sensible. We all have a role to play in developing a culture of openness.  When the Ombudsman says it is hardly surprising that from the public authorities' perspective the balance of advantage lies in withholding rather than releasing information, he is making an observation which is a sad commentary on our approach to such topics.  I hope that debates like this one may make some contribution but legislation is required to give teeth to the thinking being expressed.  There is scope for a greater exchange of views.</P>
    <P>Senator Townsend expressed reservations about some of Senator Roche's recommendations.  I was not clear whether he was rejecting the principle of how one gains access to information or whether he thought that the examples were inappropriate.  It is important to ascertain where a consensus might emerge in that respect because my instinct is that somebody must have a right of access to information. In the end the courts can gain access to information but that is extremely cumbersome, expensive and awkward.  It is also well beyond the capacity of many of the weaker elements of society to pursue effectively.</P>
    <P>I see the Ombudsman as representing those elements in society which do not have the muscle to turn elsewhere to secure satisfaction.  For that reason I am a strong supporter of the general principles expressed by Senator Roche and the thrust of his thinking about the extension of the jurisdictional authority and remit of the Ombudsman.  It is high time that we emancipated ourselves from the mental enthralment with the British legislation from which we have taken so much of the specifics of our own legislation.  A great deal of this comes back to self confidence.</P>
    <P>All institutions make mistakes and there are complaints against all of us.  I <Col N="543" /> have no doubt that there are complaints against me in my professional capacity which expose mistakes.  However, if mistakes are exposed, they can rectified. There should not be a taint attached to having a mistake exposed in an institution. From time to time serious mistakes may become major issues, but we should all be prepared to accept that none of us is perfect and that even the best institution will make mistakes.  As a matter of course it should to be part of the institutional structure that mistakes are rectified as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>As Senator Roche said, it should be one of the functions of a properly supported Ombudsman Office to point to good as well as inadequate administration. We are very bad at praising people for doing something well, but we are quick to jump on them if we think they are doing things badly.  If the Ombudsman's Office was not overwhelmed with the responsibilities involved in chasing complaints, it could stand back and offer examples of good administrative practice.  Without being an authority on the specific issues raised by Senator Roche, I would be very supportive of the thrust of his thinking.  I would hope that in light of its rhetorical commitment to openness, accountability and transparency, this Administration will take major steps in that direction.</P>
    <P>Some of the specifics in the Ombudsman's report are expressed in a discreet way but point to potential for extending authority.  He intends to publish a report on individual cases in due course which would be extremely interesting.  He is following the general principle that information should be released unless it is specifically exempted by the terms of regulations giving effect to the EU directive to which I referred earlier.  Such a principle would effect a change in our psychological attitude towards information and the furtiveness with which we try to conceal it.  Historically, we have had a differential attitude towards authority.  Many officials, whether public or in the private sector, tended to rely on their <Col N="544" /> authority as the basis for decision making and for the rejection of the possibility of complaint and criticism.</P>
    <P>I hope that our culture is loosening up towards accepting the more egalitarian attitude that others might have contributions to make and that expertise other than that of the officials involved in any given case can be drawn on.  The Office of the Ombudsman has a significant contribution to make towards inculcating that approach and diffusing that disposition throughout wider society.</P>
    <P>It is also unfortunate that authorities should take the attitude of releasing as little information as possible and of relying on regulations to hinder access to information.  It conveys the impression that there is something to hide; most of the time I am confident that there is nothing to hide.  However, it suggests that decent and honourable officials are somehow covering up something.  That is an unfortunate impression to convey to the public and it can only reinforce the scepticism the public sometimes feels about the effectiveness and openness of Government.</P>
    <P>Every democracy needs a strong investigative tradition.  There must be a capacity to investigate what appear to be injustices or inadequacies.  We are developing a tradition of investigative journalism, at times in ways of which not all of us would approve.  Sometimes it can go over the top and lack balance but that might be a symptom of teething troubles because the approach is so recent a recruit to our way of looking at things.  However, within the public service the Office of the Ombudsman ought to play the crucial investigative role which should be a central part of a healthy democracy.</P>
    <P>I welcome this report.  I welcome the principles it enunciates and the spirit that informs it.  I hope the powers of the Ombudsman will be extended in the direction pointed out by Senator Roche and that the resources necessary to implement those powers will be allocated to the office.  When we debate this report in future years I hope we will be <Col N="545" /> able to look back on this discussion as having initiated something which went in the right direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this report.  As other Senators have said, it is important that we discuss it.  It is an important report because it is one of the first and most important annual reports we consider each year.  It is also important because it touches on the lives of every person in the country.</P>
      <P>I intend to deal with three topics: the number of complaints, the specific issue of delay in the area of public administration and the need to use this report as a springboard for future action instead of seeing it as an end in itself. The Ombudsman receives about 3,000 complaints each year and about one quarter of these are outside his remit. The report makes the point that there is obviously a certain amount of confusion in the public mind about the role of the Ombudsman if a quarter of the complaints should not be sent to him at all.</P>
      <P>There is no need for a publicity campaign to prevent people sending the Ombudsman complaints that are outside his remit.  I am not concerned about wrongly addressed complaints because they can be dealt with quickly. However, there is a need for a publicity campaign to encourage more complaints that are within his remit.  I am more concerned about complaints that are not made.  We have no way of dealing with them if they are not made. Indeed, we have no way of knowing how many there are in the first place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One might say that an office that receives 3,000 complaints a year needs more of them like a hole in the head. However, we should be positive about complaints.  In the short term we should seek more complaints rather than fewer. We need to get all possible complaints on the table before we talk about reducing them.  In the long term we are interested in reducing the number of complaints but there is a right way and wrong way of doing that.  The shortsighted <Col N="546" /> way is to choke off complaints. That can be done by making it difficult for people to complain and by handling the complaint so badly that people get discouraged.</P>
    <P>The right way to reduce the number of complaints contains two elements. First, one establishes systems to ensure that complaints are resolved as early as possible thereby reducing the number of complaints that reach the person of last resort, the Ombudsman.  The second and most important element is that one tries to remove the cause of complaints so that in future one does not receive the same complaints.  If this is done correctly, eventually, there are fewer complaints reaching the Ombudsman because they have been resolved satisfactorily inside the system and much earlier than they would otherwise have been.  There will also be fewer complaints entering the system because the system has so improved that most of the causes of complaints have been removed.</P>
    <P>That is the process we should be working towards in the long term. However, the first step of the process involves encouraging more complaints and not fewer.  We should send a clear signal to the Ombudsman that we would like him to do that.  We need the Government's support in this regard because more complaints will require more resources.  People need to know about the Ombudsman process; they need to know how to make a complaint effectively.  They should be able to make their complaints easily; it should not be an obstacle race and it should not require a visit to an advice bureau or their local TD.  We must inform people that they have a right to expect.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Ombudsman on the excellent first section of the report.  It sets out seven basic principles of good administration and five basic rights to which the public is entitled.  One page contains most of the information that must be conveyed in order to explain to people whether they have cause to complain. I would like to see the seven principles and five basic rights on a type of <Col N="547" /> charter that would be displayed on the walls of every public office in the country. They should also be set out on a single piece of paper which, for a period of about two years, would be sent out as an enclosure with every letter and form issued from every Department.  This would be a great deal more effective than an expensive advertising campaign in which it would be difficult to get across the level of detail required.</P>
    <P>The next step is to ensure that we do not put obstacles in the way of people making complaints.  We should make it as easy as possible for them to do so. There should be a freephone number people could ring whenever they have a grievance.  The number could connect them to people who would explain how to make a complaint.  There should also be tools to help people make complaints. There could be, for example, a form that would walk them through the process which would be available in public libraries, post offices and so forth.  My message is that we need more complaints and that we should do everything possible to encourage them.</P>
    <P>I turn now to a specific complaint &mdash; the question of delay.  This is included in the seven principles set out by the Ombudsman and I wish to highlight it for a particular reason.  The biggest single difference between the public service and the world outside is the attitude to time.  Traditionally, the public service has lacked a sense of urgency, the type of urgency one encounters, for instance, in the world of business.  This lack of urgency has always been a problem in dealing with the public.  If a person with limited means is deprived of money to which they are entitled it matters a great deal whether they receive it this week rather than next week or even next month.  Often, time is an issue; sometimes it is the essence of the problem. The old adage is correct &mdash; justice delayed is justice denied.</P>
    <P>The report of the Ombudsman gives a number of examples of cases where delay was the sole problem.  I highlight this for two reasons.  First, the time gap <Col N="548" /> between the outside world and the public service is getting wider.  That is not because the public service is not trying to do something about it but because, in spite of the efforts of the public service to move faster, the world outside is moving even faster.  People expect things to happen fast.  Delays they would have tolerated 20 years ago are now considered unreasonable.  They are more aware of the importance and value of time.  The commercial world is responding to those changing attitudes and needs.</P>
    <P>My second reason for highlighting the issue of delay is more encouraging.  Of all issues to do with the public service, it is the easiest one to tackle.  One can measure time but it is not possible to measure fairness or impartiality.  Once something can be measured it is possible to get control of it fairly easily.  When the managers in the public service set goals for raising the quality of the service they provide, they should focus first on the question of speed.  If they can serve the public more quickly they will be serving the public better.  The two go hand in hand.</P>
    <P>I would like to see more time limits put on public service activities.  At the moment, for instance, if one applies for planning permission, the local authority must give an answer one way or the other within two months.  That is a reasonable amount of time for all the various interests involved, but the great thing about it is that one knows what the decision is after two months.  That precedent could be widely extended throughout the public service.  I would like every Department and every office that deals with the public to publish time frames for the most common activities.</P>
    <P>I have found in business that there is a world of difference between having a vague aspiration and having a specific target.  With a specific target you know exactly where you are and if you publish that target then your customers know exactly where you should be and they can pull you up if you slip up.  It is good <Col N="549" /> when your customers get involved in your quality control process.</P>
    <P>I wish to talk about using this report as a springboard for action.  I have been talking about actions that I believe we should take.  The Office of the Ombudsman could do more to publicise its service. The public service could take action to eventually make the Office of the Ombudsman redundant and the Oireachtas can take action to lessen the need for the Ombudsman's Office.  As we legislators read this report I am sure we are struck by the difficulties that are caused to the public service by vague, ambiguous legislation.  We should perhaps be more conscious of that when dealing with legislation.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman draws attention to the deficiencies in existing legislation revealed by his investigations.  That is the most important function of this report.  I am concerned about the lack of a system to ensure that these recommendations are looked at and turned into legislation at the earliest possible moment.  How many of the legislative recommendations made during the 11 years the office has been in existence have made it to the finishing post?  In future, I intend to ensure through the medium of Adjournment matters that the relevant Ministers are reminded of some of the key issues.  I cannot help feeling there should be a better way of doing it.</P>
    <P>Perhaps there should be a statutory provision to ensure that, unless legislation is introduced within 12 months of the Ombudsman making a recommendation, there should be an immediate debate on the matter in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I would be interested to hear the views of other Members on this.  I welcome this debate because it draws attention to a report which in the past has not always received the attention it deserves.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the report of the Ombudsman for 1994.  I congratulate him for the promptness with which he published his first report.  Although we <Col N="550" /> are debating the report in November, the document was published in June of this year.  This compares very favourably with the performance of other Government Offices and Departments. The Prison Service, for instance, is one of the most troubled and controversial areas of public administrations, yet the prison report for 1992 was only published late last year.  As we move into 1996, there is still no sign of the annual reports for 1993 or 1994.  The same could be said of many other areas of Government.</P>
      <P>The Office of the Ombudsman is a key part of the apparatus of Government in Ireland.  Since Government is becoming more complex by the day and less accessible to the ordinary citizen it is essential that there is a body to which people can go to seek redress for their grievances.  As the Ombudsman's report points out, much of his workload in the social welfare area is due to the sheer complexity and inaccessibility of the relevant legislation.  We need to look again at our social welfare system.  The whole regime is in need of simplification and rationalisation.  There has been talk for years now of integrating the social welfare and taxation systems but nothing has been done.  If anything, the number of tax and social welfare poverty traps is growing and contributes to our high levels of unemployment.</P>
      <P>The Ombudsman makes clear his dissatisfaction with the way many Government bodies conduct their dealings with the public.  It seems that we are still a long way from inculcating a customer service ethos into the public and Civil Service.  His report is full of references to delays and difficulties in eliciting information from public bodies, and even the withholding of information in certain instances.  The Ombudsman continuously refers to the defensive attitude which seems to prevail in some organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Ombudsman's Office has a short mission statement which begins: &ldquo;We are committed to serving the public&rdquo;. This is a message that should be taken on board by Departments and offices <Col N="551" /> right across the public service.  The public cannot be regarded as just some sort of nuisance that interferes with the smooth working of the bureaucratic machine.  The public are the customers. At a time when hamburger joints are displaying their quality certificates on the wall, it is unacceptable that few, if any, Government bodies have attained recognised quality standards, such as the Q mark or ISO 9000.</P>
    <P>The Government is the single biggest service provider in the country.  It is important that it should act to the highest standards of quality and customer service.  In this respect, as part of a programme of Civil Service reform, the Government should require each Department and office to attain a recognised quality standard within a reasonable time frame.  Taxpayers pay dearly for their public service; they are entitled to the best.  If Departments operate to higher quality standards, then I have no doubt that there will be far fewer complaints for the Ombudsman to deal with.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Ombudsman has made efforts to make his office accessible to the 70 per cent of the population who live outside Dublin. During the year staff from his office conducted visits to several regional centres, such as Galway, Carlow, Dundalk, Portlaoise and Tullamore, where they met the public and invited them to bring forward their grievances.  In addition, staff attended on a monthly basis at citizens' information centres in Cork, Limerick and Sligo, a programme which has now been extended to other areas.  This is a very welcome development in a country which suffers inordinately from over-centralisation.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman is now operating in an area which was once the preserve of public representatives.  He deals with complaints on behalf of social welfare claimants, grant seekers and housing applicants, but the volume of work handled by public representatives in areas of this kind is still way in excess of the 2,500 complaints dealt with by the Ombudsman last year.  I note that from <Col N="552" /> this year individual health boards and local authorities will be named in case summaries in the Ombudsman's annual report.  This is a welcome development and it will do much to concentrate minds in county halls around the country when the call from St. Stephen's Green comes through on the telephone.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Matter. - Restoration of Corncrake Grants Scheme.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Corncrake numbers have suffered such a dramatic decline that they are now threatened worldwide with extinction.  The corncrake is Ireland's only globally threatened bird species.  Since the turn of the century, corncrake numbers have been falling continuously.  In 1978 the numbers recorded in a national census had fallen to just over 900; the most recent full national census was in 1993 and found that only 174 singing male corncrakes were recorded in Ireland.  Most of them were restricted to four areas &mdash; the Shannon Callows in County Offaly, north County Donegal, County Mayo and County Fermanagh.  A further census was undertaken in 1994, mainly restricted to these four areas, which found that numbers had hit an all time low of 129 male corncrakes.  In 1994, for the first time, no corncrakes were recorded in Northern Ireland during the census period.</P>
      <P>In 1992, the Irish Wildbird Conservancy and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds decided to pay grants to farmers for corncrake friendly practises. The scheme is open to all farmers with a calling corncrake on their lands for at least one week.  The grant payable was £80 per hectare in the Shannon Callows and £120 per hectare in north County Donegal and County Mayo.  There was also a further grant of £20 per hectare payable when mowing from the centre of the field outwards was undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This grants scheme has proved to be an outstanding success.  In 1995, for the first time since recording began, an <Col N="553" /> increase in corncrake numbers in Ireland was recorded.  The number of singing male corncrakes was increased to 174.  Given the success of the scheme, appropriate management and sufficient support, we can be optimistic about not alone the survival of the corncrake but a real increase in their numbers in the future.</P>
    <P>However, I raise this matter here today because there appears to be a problem over who is to continue to manage the corncrake grants scheme. This year the National Parks and Wildlife Services, which was formerly under the control of the Office of Public Works but is now under the control of the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, contributed £65,000 to the scheme.  There is a proposal that the scheme will now come under the REP scheme, under the aegis of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry. However, the uptake of the REP scheme in the specific areas to which I referred is only approximately 5 per cent.  If the scheme is to be included under REPS it would have to be dealt with under a separate budget.  Such a proposal must be in place before any change in the existing arrangements takes place.</P>
    <P>It is my opinion, and the opinion of those involved in wildlife preservation, that it is essential for this funding to continue.  Any break in the continuity of the scheme could lead to corncrake numbers being depleted to such a level that the species could be wiped out.  I appreciate that the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins, the Minister of State and all those attached to his Department are anxious to ensure that the corncrake survives and it is essential that we all work together to ensure this.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Enright for giving me the opportunity to reply to his Adjournment Matter regarding the special effort required to save corncrakes from distinction.</P>
      <P>On two recent occasions the Minister for Arts Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins, gave commitments in Dáil Éireann first, on the preservation of the corncrake and, second, that he would not abandon the corncrake grants scheme until such time as he is satisfied that REPS is capable of providing at least the same protection for this endangered species.  Following a proposal in 1992 by the Irish Wildbird Conservancy to pay grants to farmers for corncrake friendly farming practices, the Exchequer, through the National Parks and Wildlife Service, has provide annual interim funding for the scheme. It was never the intention to make it a permanent scheme and it was envisaged that it would be supported by agri-environmental measures still being mooted.</P>
      <P>The 1995 corncrake grants scheme was operated in three areas &mdash; Shannon Callows, north County Donegal and parts of County Mayo.  Where mowing was delayed until 1 August the scheme provided for payment to landowners of grants of £80 per hectare in the Shannon Callows and £120 per hectare in north County Donegal and in County Mayo. In all three areas an additional grant of £20 per hectare was payable where mowing from the centre of the field outwards was undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year the scheme cost £85,000 and it received Exchequer funding of £60,000, with the balance coming from the Royal Society for Protection of Birds.  In addition, to the £60,000, the Irish Wildbird Conservancy, which administers the grants scheme, has been promised funding of up to £5,000 and £10,000, respectively, this year by the NPWS and RSPB for habitat creation measures.  I understand also that the costs of the IWC fieldworker network <Col N="555" /> are borne by the RSPB and the EU LIFE fund.</P>
    <P>Between 1992 and the end of 1995 Exchequer funding of £142,000 has been allocated for corncrake conservation measures, made up of £133,000 for the corncrake grants scheme &mdash; £5,000 in 1992, £13,000 in 1993, £55,000 in 1994 and £60,000 in 1995 &mdash; £4,000 towards the cost of a survey in 1993 and £5,000 earmarked for habitat creation measures this year.  Total grant payments in the three areas in 1995 were £63,884 in the Shannon Callows, £15,832 in County Mayo and £6,143 in County Donegal.</P>
    <P>While the number of corncrakes increased by nearly 35 per cent from 129 to 174 between 1994 and 1995, the increase between 1993 and 1995 is only about 7 per cent when the 1993 number of birds was 163.  The greatest level of increase has been in north Donegal, where actual expenditure and take up of the grants scheme this year was lowest. In the Shannon Callows, where take up and expenditure was highest, the number of corncrakes dropped slightly between 1994 and 1995 with a significant drop of 28 per cent since 1993.  It would appear from this analysis that the evidence as to the relationship between the grants scheme and corncrake numbers is still not conclusive.</P>
    <P>This year the action programme for the corncrake is operating independently of the rural environment protection scheme.  As REPS has been operational <Col N="556" /> since June 1994, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht asked our officials to examine the feasibility of a transition from these annual interim payments, which have been in place since 1992, to REPS.  I believe that the considerable potential presented by REPS should be examined and utilised to maximum advantage for corncrake conservation purposes.  My officials, along with their counterparts in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, are currently exploring the options provided by REPS for corncrake conservation.  While aid is available under the supplementary measure in REPS to encourage the preservation of the corncrake, greater efforts will have to be made to get landowners in the target areas to join REPS, where funding of up to £6,000 per annum is available to each of them.  I understand the Department does not consider that there is any scope for a special REP scheme for the corncrake.</P>
    <P>I can do no more than reassure the Senator and the House that the Minister does not intend to abandon the present corncrake scheme until such time as he is satisfied that REPS or other agri-environmental measures are capable of providing at least the same protection for this endangered species.  He intends to review the situation at the end of February 1986.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 3.25 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 22 November 1995.</P>
