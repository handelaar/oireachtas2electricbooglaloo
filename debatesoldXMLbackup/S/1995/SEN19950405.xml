      <P>I have received notice from Senator Wall that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he wishes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to outline the action she intends to take on foot of the 1991 report on the code of practice for safety at sports arenas and the concern of all sporting organisations at this inaction.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Roche of the following matter:</P>
      <P>Recognising the widespread concern that, exists throughout the country, but in particular on the east coast, at the ongoing operations of British Nuclear Fuels at Windscale, Sellafield, the need for the Government to publicly support, fund and seek to join in the further legal actions against BNFL's THORP plant at Sellafield.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Kelly of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1734" /> The need for the Minister for Justice to examine the possibility of transferring the Garda responsibility for Croom and adjoining areas from Askeaton to Limerick city.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to appoint a remedial teacher to Croagh, Kilfinny, Cappagh, Coolcappa and Kilcoman schools in County Limerick.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Burke of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to provide funding for upgrading the swimming pool and facilities at Castlebar, County Mayo.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Mulcahy of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to clarify when the recommendations of the report on violence at Lansdowne Road will be implemented.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Wall's and Senator Roche's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise to Members who were inconvenienced by not being informed about the change in today's sitting time.  I made attempts to inform people but I did not do so sufficiently widely.  The time was changed in an attempt to measure the day in accordance with the business ordered.  We might discuss future timing at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1735" /> Today's Order of Business is the Committee Stage of item 1, and item 10 &mdash; No. 18, Fine Gael's Private Members' motion.  There will be a sos of about half an hour.  Because we started at 12 o'clock the Whips can decide when the sos will be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree the Order of Business.  I ask the Leader to let it be known that the House commends yesterday's successful Garda operation in my constituency when guns and arms were apprehended.  However, one would have to be greatly concerned about the intentions of those who had those arms and guns.  I ask that, after the Easter recess, we be given a chance to discuss the report on the violence at Lansdowne Road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>About now, if somebody has not intervened in the meantime, a prisoner in the United States is being executed.  In this country we have a record of moving away from the death penalty and we have discussed it in the House.  I ask the Leader to convey to the Minister for Foreign Affairs the need for this country to participate actively in the Amnesty International campaign to outlaw capital punishment.</P>
      <P>When the executioner throws the switch, the prisoner cringes in torture. His flesh swells and his skin stretches. His tongue swells and, in some cases, his eyeballs pop out.  His flesh is burnt and smells of cooked meat.  When the autopsy is performed, his liver is so hot that it cannot be touched by the human hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is horrific to think that this is going on in this day and age.  We have many times discussed what is horrific in various aspects of human life.  I ask the Leader to bring to the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs the need for us as a developed country to participate actively in the worldwide campaign <Col N="1736" /> of Amnesty International to outlaw capital punishment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support the sentiments expressed by Senator O'Toole on what is barbarism by any standards.  I welcome the report on the incident in Lansdowne Road and the speed with which it has been published. I note that there is a proposal for a committee to deal with aspects of the report. Could I ask the Leader if we are forming yet another committee, or is this work for an existing committee?  Does he expect that there will be legislation to deal with the specific matter of the exclusion of known hooligans from football grounds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I endeavoured to ascertain from the Leader if he could ask the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to make a statement here about the critical situation in Aerospace where over 700 jobs are threatened.  If this was happening in Dublin there would be widespread public debate about the matter.  However, it is scarcely being mentioned, even in the media. Could the Minister for Enterprise and Employment come to the House and give us some information about the current situation there and the future prospects for that industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the point raised by Senator O'Toole.  The record of the Tánaiste and leader of the Labour Party has been entirely consistent. He has, from my certain knowledge, from his entry into politics condemned the principle of capital punishment either here or abroad.  I am quite sure that he would concur completely with the remarks of Senators O'Toole and Dardis.  It is barbaric and should have no place whatsoever in civilised or, indeed, uncivilised societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Finlay report on the rioting in Lansdowne Road is an ideal topic for measured debate in this House. <Col N="1737" /> Members will recall that we had a brief number of interventions the morning after the Lansdowne Road débâcle.  I was critical then &mdash; and I am glad to see that it has been borne out &mdash; not of the gardaí, whom I praised for their bravery, but of senior Garda management who acted, or did not act, in a manner which aggravated the situation.  I ask the Leader to institute, if possible, a debate in this House on that report and on violence in general at sporting events.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the comments of Senator O'Toole on the carrying out of the death penalty today in the United States of America.  The circumstances are quite horrific.  If one analyses those sentenced to death in the United States, one finds that they are usually men of low intelligence from a poor economic background and black.  There is a highly discriminatory element in the application of the death penalty.  It is curious to note that in the Pope's most recent pronouncement while he talks about the culture of death, he still allows for the application of the death penalty.  I find that extremely regrettable from a source which is so consistent in opposing what he describes as the &ldquo;culture of death&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Many people find very disturbing the degree of bullying which appears to be carried out, in particular the case in Waterford.  Could the Leader of the House suggest when we could have a debate on this issue, perhaps in the context of the specific case of a family in Waterford who have been terrorised out of their homes as a result of very vicious attacks on an 11 year old schoolboy? That is not acceptable in this country and we should all, as a community, be ashamed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the publication of the report of the expert committee on hepatitis C which was launched by the Minister at 12 p.m. today.  Could the Leader make time available soon after <Col N="1738" /> our resumption after Easter to discuss the report in the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Leader ask the Minister for Justice to address the House on the subject of crime, which has reached an all time high.  Elderly women have been robbed in chapels and on their way to Mass in the morning. It is time that we did something about that and we need to discuss it in this House.  In certain parts of Dublin motorists are being robbed and their windscreens smashed.  Those no go areas in the heart of the city were highlighted by Gay Byrne on his morning radio programme.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Norris' call for a debate on school bullying.  It is terrible that a family has to leave the country because the whole family is now being bullied, their windows have been broken and their house damaged.  Law and order has completely broken down when people cannot live in peace.  It will be very bad for tourism and so on if we allow this to happen.  An ambassador's wife was mugged in the heart of the city outside the National Concert Hall the other day and had to receive medical treatment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is time that something was done about it and we should have a debate on those two subjects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GordonWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Senator Wright said regarding the arrest yesterday of four alleged INLA members, together with a large quantity of ammunition, in or around Balbriggan.  I offer my congratulations to the Garda on a job which appears to have been very well done.  The mind boggles as to what would have happened to the peace process <Col N="1739" /> if those men and that ammunition had crossed the Border.  As a result of yesterday's arrest, I ask the Leader once again &mdash; and I know that it is at the top of his agenda &mdash; to make time available to discuss again the peace process and Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call by Senator Wilson for a debate on Northern Ireland.  It is generally felt that there is a slowing down, to some extent, and a debate in this House would be fruitful and helpful at this time.</P>
      <P>With regard to item 12 on the Order Paper, the proposal that the Minister for Health would publish the White Paper on mental illness and the care of the mentally ill.  I know that the Leader said recently that he would have a debate on health in the House.  However, unless the White Paper is published, the debate will be in the dark as regards that issue.  The House must be aware that the legislation under which the mentally ill are cared for at the moment is 50 years old.  Many parts of that legislation are no longer effective and are being breached every day.  If that White Paper was published we could have a constructive and informed debate on suitable legislation, structures and regulations for the care of the mentally ill in the next decade or two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the comments made by Senators Wright and Wilson on the achievements of the Garda.  I hope that the necessary resources will be made available.  It is a matter which we will be discussing later in relation to their intelligence gathering network.  Despite the ceasefire and so on, the fight against criminals goes on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The insurance ombudsman published a report some weeks ago.  Could time be made available early in the next session for a debate on this important report? The insurance industry covers a wide variety of aspects of life, including, as <Col N="1740" /> was mentioned, the violence in Lansdowne Road.</P>
    <P>With regard to the ongoing difficulties faced by some charities in view of the national lottery absorbing so much expenditure, will the Leader of the House arrange time for a debate on this issue?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator Wright in his commendation of the Garda.  It is worrying that in spite of the ceasefire there is one group which refuses to accept it and is still heavily armed.  The capture of the arms haul yesterday is a tribute to the bravery of the Garda and good intelligence.  It is something which we all commend.</P>
      <P>The Finlay report was mentioned by a number of Senators.  I attempted to arrange for the report to be discussed today in the House by exchanging the Fine Gael Private Members' Business this evening for a debate.  However, the Cabinet has taken a decision that the report be referred to the Select Committee on Legislation and Security.  As this is a committee of the other House only, it would be the wish of Members of this House that a debate take place on the report and I will endeavour to arrange this as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole's description of the death penalty was graphic, gruesome and appalling, but it gives us an opportunity to note that in this House and the other House there is unanimity in our abhorrence of the death penalty.  I was a Member of the House for the first time when the final vestige of the death penalty &mdash; hanging &mdash; was removed from our Statute Book.  It is important, therefore, that the feelings of Members on all sides of the House is noted.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis mentioned the Finlay report, which I have addressed.  We will return to this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any legislation promised?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1741" />
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any promised legislation arising from the report, but I will make inquiries on this matter.  I referred Senator Daly's inquiry yesterday to the Minister.  Negotiations and discussions are at a very delicate stage.  Matters are not unhopeful and a debate at this stage may not be helpful.  However, the Minister will attend the House as soon as he has something definite to report and the Senator's concern was noted.</P>
      <P>Senator Magner mentioned the issue of capital punishment, which I have already addressed.  The question of bullying is important and it can be addressed in the open ended debate on education which will take place &mdash; as I advised Senator O'Toole yesterday &mdash; early next month after the publication of the White Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The bullying case in question did not take place in the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>That point is noted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator cannot always protect his members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the issue of the report on hepatitis C, mentioned by Senator Honan, I raised it with the Minister and he will attend the House shortly after Easter to discuss it and any other issues.  Senator Finneran raised the wider question of health and it is time to have a full debate on the health services.  I will see how it can be organised.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point raised by Senator Farrell, the Minister for Justice will be in the House all day and there will be a debate on drugs this evening. If the Senator has concerns regarding crime he can raise them on that debate, as he has been known to be inventive on such occasions in making his point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Wilson and Senator Finneran raised the question of a debate on <Col N="1742" /> Northern Ireland.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has indicated that he will attend the House after Easter.  He was invited to attend to discuss issues which are more properly concerned with questions raised by Senator McGowan on cross border co-operation, development and so on, but it may be possible to broaden this into a full debate on Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Senator Cosgrave raised a number of important issues.  The report of the insurance ombudsman and the whole question of insurance is worth considering. I am aware, a Chathaoirligh, that when you were Leader of the House you arranged a number of debates on this issue&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I read the report of the insurance ombudsman and it is very interesting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>With that commendation, I will attempt to arrange a debate on it.  The question of charities was raised by Senator Cosgrave.  A number of well established and worthwhile charities are facing enormous problems and there is a danger that the national lottery is swamping many of them.  The concern of Members of the House and of those involved in these charities should be given an opportunity to be expressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the information of Members, a number of Seanad Bills will be introduced in the next session.  The first of these will be the European Communities Bill, which I understand will be taken on the first or second day of the next session, and the report on science and technology &mdash; item 8 on the Order Paper &mdash; will be debated on the second day, a Thursday.  I am attempting, out of deference to Senator Bohan.  to have the Road Traffic Bill introduced in the House and am hopeful this will be the case.  In addition, the preparation of the Arterial Drainage Bill, which is a <Col N="1743" /> Seanad Bill, is on course, in line with commitments given to the House.</P>
    <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">

      <P>The Minister for Justice has been unavoidably detained, but she will be in attendance shortly.</P>

    <P>SECTION 1.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  Amendment No. 1 is consequential on amendment No. 6. Amendments Nos. 7, 8, 9, and 10 form an alternative proposal and all may be discussed together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;the Act of 1981&rsquo; means the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;the Act of 1990&rsquo; means the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 6 provide comprehensive guidelines for the hearing and reporting of incest proceedings. They provide for an integrated scheme which will bring incest trials into line with trials for other sexual offences. These amendments recognise that the public has a legislative right to be informed, not only of the verdict but also of the conduct and details of the proceedings of incest trials and the fact they have taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My problem with the Minister's Bill, as I said on Second Stage, is that the verdict of guilty or not guilty and the sentence will be announced in public, <Col N="1744" /> but the nature of the offence or its gravity will not be revealed.  We will not know if the offender has been found guilty of the rape of a child or of becoming involved on a consensual basis in an emotional relationship with a sibling.  In addition, we will not know if the offence is an isolated one or represents a continuous reign of terror for a child, or if it is accompanied by aggravating or mitigating circumstances.  Furthermore, if the Bill is passed without amendment, judges will be deprived of the means of knowing how other incest cases have been dealt with by their colleagues.  This will militate against consistency in sentencing. Concern has been expressed in recent weeks that judges should be assisted in making their judgments more consistent.</P>
    <P>The deficiencies I have outlined are addressed in my amendments.  If the Bill is amended accordingly in relation to incest trials the system will work as well as it has done in rape trials.  The media have shown responsibility in their reporting in this regard.</P>
    <P>May I discuss amendment No. 6 with amendment No. 1?</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 1 states:</P>
      <P>In page 2, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;the Act of 1981&rsquo; means the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;the Act of 1990&rsquo; means the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 6 states:</P>
      <P>In page 2, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1745" />&ldquo;2.&mdash;(1) The provisions of sections 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 11 of the Act of 1981 shall apply to any criminal proceedings for&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  an offence under section 1 or 2 of the Act of 1908, or</P>
    <P>as if the said proceedings were proceedings for a rape offence within the meaning of the Act of 1981.</P>
    <P>(2)  References in subsection (1) to sections of the Act of 1981 shall be construed as references to such sections as amended by the Act of 1990.</P>
    <P>(3)  (a) Section 5 of the Act of 1908 is hereby repealed.</P>
    <P>(b)  Section 45 (3) of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961, shall no longer apply to the Act of 1908.</P>
    <P>(4)  The provisions of this Act shall apply to any prosecution pending at the commencement of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981, restricts the rights of counsel for the accused to question the victim about any sexual experience with anyone other than the accused.  The provisions of section 3 apply in the case of trials and section 4 restricts the rights in the case of preliminary examination. Section 5 of the 1981 Act deals with the trials of juveniles.  It is a technical section in relation to trial before a jury. It takes account of the fact that in trials of juveniles in certain cases there is provision for a trial to be heard without a jury.  This section allows this to apply in the case of rape trials.  By including it in my amendment, it will apply in the case of incest trials.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the 1981 Act is replaced by section 11 of the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990.  This deals with the exclusion of the public from hearings.  This is the central point <Col N="1746" /> of my argument.  In the case of rape trials the judge shall exclude from the court all persons except officers of the court, persons directly concerned in the proceedings and bona fide representatives of the press.  The judge, justice or the court, as the case may be, may, at his discretion, permit certain people to remain in the court.  This is the main point of my argument.  We want the same reporting provisions to apply to incest and rape trials.</P>
    <P>Sections 7 and 8 of the 1981 Act provide for a system of anonymity for the victim and the accused.  These two sections provide a system of checks and balances to protect the victim and the accused.  That system is just as necessary in incest cases as it is in rape cases.  All of these apply to offences under sections 1 and 2 of the 1908 Act, which relate to incest committed by a man or a woman of or over 16 years.</P>
    <P>The Minister's Bill makes no provision for penalties.  Although the press is not permitted to identify the parties, there is no criminal sanction to support this.  By applying section 11 of the 1981 Act the same penalties would apply to incest trials as apply to rape trials. Under amendment No. 6 (3) (a) &ldquo;Section 5 of the Act of 1908 is hereby repealed.&rdquo;.  This section provides that all proceedings are to be held <i>in camera.</i> My amendment sets down guidelines as to who may or may not be in court during the hearing and the nature of what can be printed about the proceedings and about the verdict.  It provides for penalties and anonymity.  In these circumstances section 5 of the 1908 Act is redundant and should be repealed.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 6 (3) (b) is a technical section.  This section revived section 5 of the 1908 Act.  If section 5 is repealed this provision is no longer necessary. Amendment No. 6 (4) provides that the &ldquo;Act shall apply to any prosecution pending at the commencement of this Act.&rdquo;.  It would apply immediately to cases now pending.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1747" /> All of us would like to see the provisions that apply to rape trials also applying to incest trials.  The public has a right to know.  We have learned from our experiences with the Kilkenny incest case, the X case and the Kerwick case that only then will steps be taken to rectify the lack of justice and the lack of legislation to take care of women and children who are victims of incest and sexual offences.  The provisions of the Bill regarding reporting do not go far enough.  I am concerned that we might be taking a retrograde step instead of moving forward.  I urge the Minister to accept my amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil drafted its amendments in the same spirit in which the Minister introduced the Bill.  That spirit was that this was essentially emergency legislation necessitated by two decisions of the Central Criminal Court. The primary decision was by Mr. Justice Carney, who ruled &mdash; in my view correctly &mdash; that as a result of legislation passed since the enactment of Bunreacht na hÉireann in 1937, section 5 of the Incest Act was constitutional and accordingly all incest cases were to be held <i>in camera.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's immediate problem was that the caring agencies and health boards would be unable to get sufficient information from court cases held <i>in camera</i> in order to protect people from abusers in the future.  They did not know who was being prosecuted and what were the outcomes of such proceedings. Following the publication of a Bill by the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil, the Minister speedily introduced this short Bill.  In essence it contains two sections.  One section permits the reporting of incest cases.  The second permits, where an incest and rape case are taken together and the rape prosecution is subsequently dropped, that the incest case can then be heard not <i>in camera.</i>  Those, in layman's terms, are <Col N="1748" /> the provisions of the two sections as I understand them.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil amendments are quite simple.  Without straying from the topic of incest and without referring to rape cases and defilement, our amendment proposes that the same provisions that apply to the reporting of rape cases should now apply to incest cases.  Our amendment is in the same form as the relevant provision in the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981.  The amendment reads:</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Punishment of Incest Act, 1908 is hereby amended by the substitution of the following section for section 5:</P>
    <P>&lsquo;5.&mdash;In any proceedings for an offence contrary to this Act the judge or the court, as the case may be, shall exclude from the court during the hearing all persons except officers of the court, persons directly concerned in the proceedings, bona fide representatives of the Press and such other persons (if any) as the judge or the court, as the case may be, may in his or in its discretion permit to remain.&rsquo;.</P>
    <P>This is to facilitate, in circumstances where the incest victim feels alienated from his or her family, the incest victim bringing a friend into court.  I have been informed by the caring agencies that this is frequently the case.  This provision would permit that.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 8 protects confidentiality and everybody agrees that it should be protected.  It reads:</P>
    <P>3(1).&mdash;After a person is charged with an offence contrary to the Punishment of Incest Act, 1908, no matters likely to lead members of the public to identify a person as the complainant in relation to that charge shall be published in a written publication available to the public or be broadcast.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1749" /> This provision is also taken from the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 9 states:</P>
    <P>A person guilty of an offence under section 3 [that is, somebody who publishes a report likely to identify the personal shall be liable on conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding £10,000 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years or to both such fine and imprisonment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot really object to this provision.  It is the same sanction that is provided in our rape legislation.  Perhaps one could say that it is a greater crime to identify the victim of an incest case, but that might be stretching the point.</P>
    <P>Our amendments are in keeping with the spirit of what the Minister is seeking to achieve.  The Minister said that the Bill was simply an emergency measure. We are not trying to reform and update the law on incest, rape or defilement.</P>
    <P>I wish to broaden my comments and speak about a matter which I wish had been available on Second Stage.  It is so critically important to many people that I would be failing in my duty if I did not raise the speech of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Mr. Éamon Barnes, which was made over the weekend &mdash; I am sure the Minister has read it.  I beg your indulgence, a Chathaoirligh, because this is important.</P>
    <P>The DPP is totally independent in the exercise of his statutory functions.  He rarely makes a speech but when he does it is a fine speech, with a good deal of content.  In his address to the Burren Law School last weekend, he advanced the thesis &mdash; which has much merit &mdash; that sexual offences are imitative.  By that he means he has seen a huge increase in the number of sexual offence, including incest, files in the last 20 years and has little doubt that pornography, violence on television, etc. <Col N="1750" /> has led to this increase.  Many of us share that view and there are statistics which support it.</P>
    <P>This is a critical area so it behoves us to look carefully at what we are putting into legislation.  It is fine to say the press should have free access to these cases so they can be reported, because it will help the nation grow up &mdash; which we will, because it will highlight something which has been under the carpet for too long.  However, if the Minister had evidence that the graphic and gory publication of these incest cases was leading to an increase in the incidence of incest, she would be compelled to make legislative changes to stop that.</P>
    <P>Mr. Barnes advances the thesis that newspaper editors may be unaware of the effect these articles may have.  There is a big difference between letting in the press and letting in people from caring agencies or from legal reporting agencies who report the cases in the legal journals so the facts are available to the health care professionals.  It will be extremely explosive if we allow the press to reproduce these cases in gory detail.</P>
    <P>I may be out of order here, because these points should have been made on Second Stage.  That having been said, the Fianna Fáil amendments allow the press and other interested parties in; the <i>in camera</i> rule is unacceptable <i>vis-a-vis</i> the caring agencies.  The Minister should realise that if a link is proven between the reporting of these cases and the incidence of incest, legislation will have to follow to control such reporting.  I have spoken at length because I regard this as a matter of the utmost seriousness. Perhaps the Minister can comment on the DPP's speech.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened carefully on Second Stage to Senator Honan and Senator Mulcahy and again today to their submissions on amendments.  I reiterate what I said on Second Stage.  When Mr. Justice Carney <Col N="1751" /> gave his judgments on 1 and 17 February, particularly the latter decision not to make known to the caring agencies any information about a person accused of incest, I was deeply concerned about any cases currently going through the courts or which might come up immediately after that decision.  I was anxious to close that loophole and Senator Mulcahy has recognised that was my aim.</P>
      <P>I moved quickly to prepare legislation to bring to either House so at least the loophole would be closed.  In bringing forward the legislation I made clear that all I was doing was closing that dangerous loophole; I did not say the Bill was comprehensive but it deals with a number of matters allied to Mr. Justice Carney's decisions and other issues concerning incest and unlawful carnal knowledge which have needed addressing for some time.</P>
      <P>My intention was that the Bill would be quickly brought forward in the Dáil. In the event, because of other legislation, it did not come up as quickly as I had hoped.  I did not introduce it here immediately because my intention was to initiate it in the Dáil but I was glad of the opportunity to bring it before the Seanad.</P>
      <P>In introducing the legislation as quickly as possible I felt that publishing the Bill would stay the hand of any judge examining Mr. Justice Carney's decision on <i>in camera</i> rulings, in other cases where the principle might have been suspect.  I was afraid the ruling might become a precedent so I was anxious to publish Government legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say that notwithstanding the fine work done by Senator Honan.  who published her Bill before mine, and Deputy O'Donoghue, whose Bill was published after mine.  I am conscious that they too were anxious to close off loopholes but I felt it important that Government legislation be published so that no judge <Col N="1752" /> would make a decision based on Mr. Justice Carney's precedent.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to be as accommodating and helpful as I can to amendments Senators have put down in the interests of improving the Bill.  If I had more time before publishing my Bill I would have included many of the provisions in the amendments.  It is good for democracy to allow a debate such as this, so that I as Minister can say I understand the intent behind the amendments; that I am willing to accept some of them; and where I cannot accept them, I will explain why.  I will also indicate that in not accepting some amendments, it is not that I do not accept the principle behind them but my advice is that the phrasing and wording of those amendments would introduce more difficulties into the law.  However, I will be able to accept the principle of some of the amendments; if the wording is not acceptable I will introduce my own versions on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>Senators will recall that when concluding the Second Stage debate, the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Deputy Currie, who has special responsibility for matters concerning children, gave a specific undertaking on my behalf that I would be positive about Committee Stage amendments.  Because time had passed, I believed the Bill would be strengthened, given the contributions on Second Stage by Senators and myself.</P>
    <P>I reiterate my thanks and appreciation to Senators Honan, Mulcahy, O'Toole, Neville and Gallagher for their work on and their contributions to this legislation.  A number of Members raised the same issues.  The amendments before the House attempt to put into effect issues raised by Members at that time.</P>
    <P>Essentially, Senator Honan is proposing that the provisions of sections 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 11 of the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981, as amended by the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1990, <Col N="1753" /> should be extended to incest.  Incest with a girl under the age of 15 is an absolute offence in the sense that consent is not a defence.  It is essential to apply many of the provisions in the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981, as amended in 1990, to the crime of incest. However, some sections of this Act are not applicable to the crime of incest.  I will go through some of those and my reasons for not accepting some of the amendments.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan's amendment is very comprehensive and essentially wipes out the main part of the Bill.  If she had divided that long amendment into shorter individual amendments I might have been able to accept some of them. However, because she has put down such a composite amendment here and because of the difficulties of applying the provisions of the rape Acts without alteration to the crime of incest, I cannot accept her amendment totally as phrased here.  I can, however, accept the principle of her amendment and will be able to accept some of Senator Mulcahy's amendments because he has dealt with each change in a separate amendment.</P>
    <P>Sections 3, 4 and 5 of the 1981 Act are concerned in particular with restrictions that apply to questions that can be put to a rape victim about sexual experience with a person other than the accused. This is a mechanism to stop the accused from using the fact that a victim may have had intercourse with others as a means of showing that consent was not lacking in his own case.  This is not relevant to the offence of incest in the case of a girl under 15.  Accordingly there is no point in applying sections 3, 4 and 5 to that offence and any attempt to do so, I submit, could only give rise to confusion and perhaps to the mistaken belief that consent could operate as a defence in respect of an offence of incest.</P>
    <P>If we applied sections 3, 4 and 5 of the rape Act to the crime of incest somebody accused of incest with a girl under 15 could say that she consented. A charge of incest in respect of a girl <Col N="1754" /> under 15 is an absolute offence.  There is no question of somebody using consent as a defence, so I would be very concerned that there would be any confusion that prior consent could be used as a defence mechanism in a court case of this nature.  For that reason I urge that we do not apply sections 3, 4 and 5 of the 1981 rape Act to the crime of incest.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the 1981 Act has essentially and substantially been amended by the 1990 Act.  It provides for the exclusion of the general public from rape proceedings.  Bona fide representatives of the press are entitled to attend and the verdict and sentence, if any, must be announced in public.  I will come back to the principle behind that section in a moment.  Section 7 deals with the anonymity of victims and section 8 is concerned with the anonymity of an accused which is removed following a conviction.  Section 11 lays down the penalties for breaches under section 7, that is, where somebody has breached the anonymity of the victims.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;complainant&rdquo; is used extensively in sections 3, 6 and 7 of the 1981 Act and I referred to this in my Second Stage speech.  It is also relevant for the purposes of sections 4 and 5 of the 1981 Act.  In the context of the rape Acts, a complainant is a person against whom an offence has been committed and it could be wholly inappropriate to apply the same wording to incest proceedings, which can involve the prosecution of fully consenting adults.  In other words, there may not be a complainant in a case of incest.  Where that happens there is no complainant in the sense that that term applies in the rape Acts.  The complaint will probably be brought by a garda, which would render the relevant statutory provisions not only meaningless but also inoperable.  I see the Senator nodding; it is important that we do not introduce an element into the crime of incest that does not exist there.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that a potential conflict could arise by applying both sections 6 and 7 of the 1981 rape Act <Col N="1755" /> to incest cases.  Those sections provide respectively for the anonymity of the victims and the accused.  In so far as the victim is concerned, that anonymity cannot be breached at any stage.  In the case of the accused, however, identity can be disclosed after a conviction.</P>
    <P>In view of the inevitable link between the parties where incest is involved, the Senator's amendment could, if interpreted literally, have the result that the names of child sex abuse victims who had suffered at the hands of a close relative could very easily be ascertained.  I understand the Senator's intent; she wants to make sure that the accused person in an incest case is given no comfort. However, in a case of incest it is not possible to disclose the name of the accused because the very nature of the crime of incest is that it has to be committed by a close family relative; in identifying the close family relative there is a risk that the victim's identity could be easily ascertained, so there would be a serious danger in such a provision.</P>
    <P>In the light of the points I have just made, it is clear that whatever legislative changes might be required, it would not be sufficient to simply bring incest proceedings within the scope of the rape Acts which is in effect what Senator Honan's amendment proposes.  If she had divided up her amendment I would have been more easily able to accept individual amendments from her.  I know the Senator will understand.  I accept in principle some of what she is proposing in her amendment but I cannot as Minister for Justice introduce any risk to incest victims by automatically transferring the provisions of the rape Act into the crime of incest.  In the circumstances, I believe Senator Honan will accept my bona fides as I accept hers in bringing forward these amendments.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy has introduced a set of amendments which would have the effect of extending the scope of the Bill. I have no problem in that regard and, for the most part subject to a number of <Col N="1756" /> matters that I will outline, I can agree in principle with the changes he has proposed. They run parallel to a number of the changes that Senator Honan proposed in her amendments.</P>
    <P>The first of Senator Mulcahy's amendments, amendment No. 7, proposes to replace section 2 of the Bill with a provision similar to that in the rape Acts which would require that the general public be excluded from incest proceedings but would allow the press and other persons permitted by the court, for example, a friend or relative of a victim, to attend.  I am concerned, however, that in Senator Mulcahy's desire to introduce that part of the amendment, a provision which I have already indicated I am very open to, he left out the intent of my own section.</P>
    <P>The Senator has sought to dispense with what is contained in section 2 (1) of the Bill, namely, the requirements that any verdict or sentence arising out of an incest case should be announced in public.  That is included in the rape Act and perhaps it was an oversight on Senator Mulcahy's part that he did not include it in transposing that provision to this Bill because I believe it should be included.  Our recent experience in relation to incest matters would have demonstrated the importance of including the provisions in section 2 (1) of my Bill.  This provision is found in section 6 of the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981, as amended by the 1990 Act.  In other words, I am prepared to accept Senator Mulcahy's amendment but I must also include the public announcement in it.</P>
    <P>It is conceivable to allow the bona fide press in to report an incest case once this amendment is passed and goes into the Bill.  I want to be sure that the verdict and sentence are actually made public.  It is possible that health care workers who may not want to sit through the whole case will be able to get a report on it, but they may want to know very definitely what the verdict and sentence were.  I am prepared to accept amendment No. 7 on the basis that the following additional subsection <Col N="1757" /> (2)  would be added to the Senator's proposed section, as follows:</P>
    <P>In any proceedings to which subsection (1) applies, the verdict or decision and the sentence, if any, shall be announced in public.</P>
    <P>Not only will the press be present in court but the verdict and sentence must be announced in public.  I believe it strengthens Senator Mulcahy's amendment and also includes what is in the Bill.  The Senator will appreciate that I am trying to facilitate his amendment and I hope that he can accept this addition.</P>
    <P>I am accepting this amendment and am making an oral amendment to it.  I will have to get the parliamentary draftsman to make sure that the wording runs well together.  If I find that an &ldquo;and&rdquo; or a &ldquo;but&rdquo; needs to be included I will bring it back on Report Stage.  I am accepting amendment No. 7 with that extra provision and perhaps Senator Mulcahy will indicate that he is prepared to accept that addition.  That would have the intent of accepting some of Senator Honan's amendment, which is built into our composite amendment, while accepting Senator Mulcahy's amendment with my own section in the Bill as well.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 8 seeks to create an offence of &ldquo;publishing or broadcasting information likely to lead a member of the public to identify an incest victim&rdquo;. It is proposed to replace the direction procedure provided for in section 2(2) of the Bill with a more direct method of ensuring that the names and other details of victims are not disclosed. From that point of view I can accept the substance of the amendment, but I do not believe that it should be incorporated in the Bill in its current form.  In that context it refers to the protection of the identity of a complainant which I have already indicated would not exist, or necessarily be appropriate, in an incest case.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, Senator Mulcahy's amendment has not defined the expressions &ldquo;written publication&rdquo; or <Col N="1758" />&ldquo;broadcast&rdquo; which are the subject of specific definitions in the equivalent provision of the rape Acts.  In other words, I accept that the Senator is trying to move some more provisions from the rape Acts into this Bill, but if he is doing that he must also bring in all the sections with it and he has not done so. In the circumstances, I would ask him not to press amendment No. 8 but to give me time to consult the parliamentary draftsman for the purpose of preparing an appropriate amendment on Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am perfectly willing to accept the substance of what the Senator is saying.  It goes along very much with my own thinking and indication on section 2 (2) of the Bill, as well as with my feeling that as much of the rape Act as possible should apply with regard to publishing in this Bill. However, I am afraid that the Senator's wording is faulty and I will come back on Report Stage with a new wording.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 9 provides for certain penalties in respect of the offence proposed in amendment No. 8.  That follows on from the Senator's amendment No. 8 and I would ask him not to press that one either.  It would make no sense to press it if he accepts that I will come back on Report Stage with an improved provision for the offence of publishing and broadcasting, with all the proper definitions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be equally concerned that amendment No. 9 does not deal with certain matters which have been included in the provision of the rape Acts under similar circumstances.  For example, in the rape Acts there is a provision whereby somebody can claim they did not know the information that was being published was going to have the effect of making the name of the accused known.  That defence clause is built into the rape Act.  I am thinking of a corporate liability clause and the defence that might be available to a person who could prove that he or she was <Col N="1759" /> not aware, and neither suspected nor had any reason to suspect, that the publication or broadcast of particular information could lead to the identification of a victim.</P>
    <P>That was built into the rape Act because a case was made at the time that a journalist who might talk about a case happening in a particular part of the country might not realise that by identifying that part of the country and because everyone in that area knew that something had gone on, people might be able to identify the victim.  That clause was built into the rape Act amendment in 1990.  It has not been transposed with Senator Mulcahy's amendments and I would like it to be included.</P>
    <P>These are items that should be catered for in an effort to bring as much similarity as possible into the reporting of rape and incest trials, while guarding all the time against any danger to incest victims by introducing amendments from the rape Act that would not be appropriate for the crime of incest.</P>
    <P>I hope the Senator will accept that both amendments Nos. 8 and 9 are contingent on each other and that in withdrawing amendment No. 8 he would also withdraw amendment No. 9 on that basis.  I will bring them back on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>I want to finish by summing up the conclusions that I have reached in relation to both Senator Honan's and Senator Mulcahy's amendments.  While accepting that there is a great deal of wisdom in the amendments that have been moved by both the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil Parties, I regret that I cannot accept Senator Honan's amendment for the reasons I have outlined.  It is too composite and it brings in issues I do not want to accept here that would be damaging and dangerous in the case of incest.  I can accept amendment No. 7. subject to the small addition I wish to include under subsection 2 (3).  I am prepared to accept amendments Nos. 8 and 9 in principle but they require a good deal <Col N="1760" /> more work before they can suitably be included in the Bill.  To that end I will undertake the necessary work by the parliamentary draftsman before Report Stage.</P>
    <P>Because of the time-lag since I published this Bill, we have had a chance to debate these amendments and the principles behind them.  I hope that Senators will agree to my proposals on Report Stage.  I thank the Senators who contributed on Second Stage because their speeches were extremely useful and matched what I would have done if I had had more time following Judge Carney's decision of 17 February, which had to be tackled instantly.</P>
    <P>Too often in this House and in the Lower House Members complain that we allow too much time to elapse when something like this happens in the courts.  Consequently, I was anxious that neither the Government nor myself, as Minister for Justice, would be accused of any delay.  In this instance, the time lapse has allowed us to improve the Bill. I thank Senators for their co-operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's comments relating to what she is prepared to accept and what changes she will bring in on Report Stage.  Two weeks ago, on Second Stage.  I said that with more time a more comprehensive Bill could be brought in.  The considerations that the Minister has given to the issues we raised will enable a better Bill to be brought before the House.  As the Minister said, my amendment No. 6 was too composite, but perhaps if it had been divided into various amendments she could have accepted some of them. The spirit or main thrust of my amendment was that the press should be allowed into incest trials but with the same restrictions that apply to rape trials.  The Minister is to introduce an amendment that will do this.  I think the Minister also indicated that she will bring in amendments on Report Stage to deal with criminal sanction on publication, who it is being published by and the fines and criminal sanctions that can be imposed on people who breach those <Col N="1761" /> regulations.  I will study what the Minister has said and consider whether I should bring in an amendment or amendments that would be acceptable or look at the amendments the Minister is prepared to bring in on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>Reporting should take place because it is necessary &mdash; the public has a right to know.  From the point of view of consistency in sentencing, we must send out the message that people who perpetrate crimes of incest, rape or sexual offences against women are not protected in any way.  We must show how society views these crimes and that we, as legislators, are prepared to introduce legislation that will punish in a fair manner the people who perpetrate these crimes. From the point of view of women and young girls coming forward to report cases of incest, rape and other sexual offences committed against them, it is essential that they have confidence in the system.  We must also send out the message that they will be treated fairly if they go through the difficult stages of bringing their case to court.</P>
      <P>I will consider what the Minister has said.  I welcome the fact that the Minister seems prepared to go a long way towards meeting what I and those on this side of the House were trying to do in regard to these matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I also very much regret the fact that lecture engagements abroad prevented me from speaking on Second Stage.  The Minister has raised a number of very interesting points and dealt very clearly and effectively with some of the matters, particularly the question of consent.  It is perfectly clear that consent cannot be a defence in the <Col N="1762" /> case of incest and for that reason the amendment involved clearly falls.  It would be highly dangerous to introduce because it might lead the way to counsel introducing tendentious arguments in a rather nasty way about the sexual history of the victim in an incest case and that would be extremely regrettable.</P>
      <P>Publication of the verdict, the judgment of the court and the conviction would be a welcome step for a number of reasons and I would like to take some time on that.  I tend to differ from both the Director of Public Prosecutions and Senator Mulcahy on the question of reporting, for the following reason.  My information is that one of the principal newspapers in the State. <i>The Irish Times</i>, frequently reports these very distressing cases in some detail, although editorial judgment is exercised to ensure that there is nothing put in for prurient or salacious reasons. I have been told that there have not been a great number of complaints from the general public about this.  Indeed &mdash; this is the cardinal point &mdash; not one single victim has ever complained.  The victims have always made the point that part of the resolution of their trauma is the publication given to what happened and it is important not to neglect the interest of the victims in these cases.</P>
      <P>The Minister is perfectly right in saying that this Government has responded very quickly to the Justice Carney judgment.  I imagine that his judgment was so provocative as to be an invitation to the Oireachtas to intervene.  One of the matters that amendment No. 7 clears up is the anomalous position of the health boards, where, for example, they would not have any knowledge whatever of the convictions or of the circumstances of the case.  It is very frequently said that people in the area knew and that people may have reported this to the health board.  It is one thing to know something like that in the generally accepted sense of the word &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo;, but it is quite another to have legal knowledge that will stand up in court.  This amendment largely cures this problem, but it was a very particular problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1763" /> One of the essential aspects of criminal law is that when a crime is committed the case is taken against defendants on behalf of the State and not the individual. This is one of the main reasons such cases must be conducted in public, since it is seen as a matter of interest to all citizens.  This is the same public dimension that prevents, for example, victims of sexual assault from getting their own legal representation.  They are mere witnesses on behalf of the State and not there in their own right.  This has led to all kinds of problems, most notably those raised by Lavinia Kerwick in her rape trial, when she believed that her views and the degree of her suffering were not sufficiently taken into account in the trial of her rapist, where ironically, the judge sitting in that case was the same Justice Carney.</P>
    <P>One important distinction between incest and other forms of family cases is that the outcome of family law can be determined even if the identity of the parties is concealed.  Law reports are published at regular intervals on significant cases and evidence can be introduced in one civil case about the outcome of another.  As a result of the Bill, as amended, it seems that this will continue to be the case, even in incest cases.</P>
    <P>I also wish to raise the question of carnal knowledge, which is a troubled area.  The prohibition brought about by the 1908 Act, due to the peculiar legal definition of incest &mdash; this should be looked at in this debate &mdash; means that if a male is charged with the rape of an underage family member as opposed to incest &mdash; sexual intercourse with a female family member &mdash; there are no reporting restrictions once the identity of the victim is concealed.  An amendment by Senator Honan which dealt with the question of carnal knowledge was apparently ruled out of order as being outside the scope of the Bill.  In my opinion, this is complete and utter nonsense because the scope of the Bill is determined by its contents and not by its title.  It is open to this House to enlarge the scope of the Bill, particularly <Col N="1764" /> where it deals with matters which are clearly germane and relevant.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that her response was one in which she intended to include as many areas as possible. However, this argument was used before in this House &mdash; I think it was during the rape Act &mdash; when I attempted to put down amendments which would have knocked out certain sections of the 1861 and 1885 Acts and which would have obviated all of the difficulties we had in introducing legislation governing homosexual relations in this State.  As it turned out, it was probably better that we had the full debate and introduced a very good law; but the technical point still remains that this was ruled out of order.  This amendment was moved by my friend and colleague, Senator O'Toole, and the ruling was given that it was not a matter that was contemplated by the Title of the Bill, that it was outside its scope and so on.  I do not accept that all.  We are the Oireachtas and the sovereign Parliament. We can determine what is in the Bill and its effects should derive from the provisions of its text and not from any arbitrary or narrow definition of what the scope of the Bill should be by persons who are not public representatives. I strongly feel that this amendment should not have been ruled out of order and I am challenging that ruling.</P>

      <P>I am making a point about an amendment that should be there, but I have concluded that argument. I hope the House will take note of it because it is something that I feel very strongly about and on which the House may have been incorrectly advised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understood and fully sympathised with the Minister's difficulties, which <Col N="1765" /> she expounded very clearly, with the question of consent and the anonymity of the accused.  It is obvious in an incest case that it is usually the father, the uncle or the brother and one cannot name them without clearly labelling the family.  It is a clear and logical problem which has been demonstrated by the Minister.  If I understand her correctly, she indicated that if the substance and positive, non-contentious areas of Senator Honan's amendments could be teased out and presented in a form which did not cause these complications, she would be prepared to accept them.  Perhaps Senator Honan would consider doing this on Report Stage which, I understand, will not be taken today.</P>
    <P>My final point wanders only marginally and I am invited to make it by the Minister's remarks about all the attendant matters.  Before I was contacted by the Progressive Democrats I proposed to introduce a Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill, 1995, but I was impressed by the eminent legal advice they had.  However, one area which has not been addressed but which may be addressed in a subsequent Bill is the giving of evidence on video by minors which, as I understand it, is not permitted in this jurisdiction.  The law has been amended in England and it is a very important area.</P>

The Bill introduced by Senator Honan and myself, which addressed this issue with even greater alacrity than that of which the Minister was capable, was not <Col N="1766" /> accepted by the Government and the Government's own legislation was introduced.  I take it that this should not be regarded as an indication that the Government will never accept a Bill from this side of the House should one be presented.  It would be a good principle to establish that, if there is sufficient expertise and initiative on this side of the House and a Bill which is largely satisfactory to the Government is introduced by this side of the House, the Government can support it with amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a brief conversation about it.  My rationale for not supporting the amendment was that it was better to keep the Bill short and strictly to cover the judgments.  This is an important area which requires great work and thought from the Minister and her Department to bring forward fresh proposals.  I agree &mdash; and I think the Fianna Fáil Party will agree &mdash; with almost everything the Minister said about our amendments.</P>
      <P>With regard to amendments Nos. 8 and 9, I agree with the Minister that the word &ldquo;complainant&rdquo; must be taken out. No doubt the parliamentary draftsman will come up with a solution.  The phrase &ldquo;written publication available to the public or be broadcast&rdquo; needs to be changed if there is a legal difficulty.  We agree with those two points relating to amendment No. 8.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1767" /> The Minister has no objection to the fine in amendment No. 9.  She made a point about ignorance of the law on the part of a person writing an article and mentioned the escape mechanism available in the rape legislation.  I agree with that but there should be a heavy onus on broadcasters.  They should not escape by saying their journalist did not know what would happen.  The Minister might look at that in terms of a strict liability principle for the publisher as opposed to the writer of an article.  I do not see why an incest victim should pay for the mistakes of a commercial broadcaster. I question that provision but agree with the other points made.</P>
    <P>We agree with the provision dealing with the verdict and the sentence and we have no problem with it.  However, I would add a caveat.  I presume that when the verdict and the sentence are announced, the identity of the convicted person is not revealed nor is the identity of the victim revealed.  Is that correct?</P>

      <P>I add that caveat and ask if the draftsman could examine the issue of the verdict and the sentence and anonymity of both parties.  Subject to that, everything is agreed and I would like to make a few brief concluding remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Minister for the positive way she has opened her good offices and accepted the Fianna Fáil amendment which, I think she will agree, fully entered into the spirit of her Bill.  We tried to assist and I believe we did so to a great degree.  I also thank Deputy <Col N="1768" /> O'Donoghue who assisted me in bringing forward this amendment.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not reply &mdash; perhaps quite correctly &mdash; to my comments on the speech of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I would like to take this opportunity to read one paragraph &mdash; it is very brief &mdash; into the record.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The speech was made by the Director of Public Prosecutions on 1 April 1995 to the Burren Law School.  The relevant paragraph states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Constant saturation in depravity produces first a general mentality hardened to depravity, leading to its acceptance as part of normal human behaviour.  Above all, in a small but important minority consisting of people especially susceptible to the malign influence of such behaviour, it produces imitative sexual offences. My personal conviction is that the public should be informed as fully as possible regarding the extraordinarily brutal and depraved crimes which are regularly committed in our country &mdash; here I am referring not just to sexual crimes &mdash; but that this information should be imparted in a manner which alerts people to the danger rather than one which ultimately dulls <Col N="1769" /> the perception of the evil of the violence in our midst.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the difficulties the Minister would have with effectively introducing some form of censorship. However, does she agree that the Director of Public Prosecutions perhaps has a point, given that he has had access to these files for 20 years?  In his opinion, there is an explosion of crimes of this nature and it is possible that pornography and/or over salacious court reporting leads to an increase in the number of such crimes.  I ask the Minister to examine this issue and perhaps commission studies which may result in further legislation.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for her graciousness in largely accepting the Fianna Fáil amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">

      <P>I, too, compliment the Minister on her approach to the amendments. I congratulate Senator Honan and Senator Mulcahy for the formulation of their amendments.  They initiated a discussion which has developed our knowledge of the Bill and of the wider issue.</P>
      <P>It is important that incest victims are fully protected and that there is no danger of the absolute crime of incest being diluted in any way.  The Minister's approach to such amendments is positive and augurs well for the future, given that we have experience of a different approach in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate initiated by Senator Mulcahy with regard to the contribution of the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr. Barnes, is interesting, as is Senator Norris's response.  This area should be explored because there is merit on both sides of the argument.  It is important to expose incest and sexual crimes and encourage people to do so.  However, it is also important to know if the exposure leads to further crimes.  It is a very complex area which should be explored in detail.  It would be interesting to know if research has been done on this area in other jurisdictions. If so, it would be to our advantage to <Col N="1770" /> obtain this information and debate it in the House.</P>

      <P>The discussion in the House some weeks ago was very helpful in highlighting various areas of the law relating to sexual crimes generally.  The Minister will proceed with legislation in relation to the wider issues but I am delighted that many of the matters with which I agree will be considered on Report Stage.  I look forward to that and I compliment the Minister on her work in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I note that the speech of the Director of Public Prosecutions was made on 1 April.  I also note that not one shred of evidence was induced in support of his contention that readers of the newspapers were inflamed and went out and committed copycat crimes.  I do not believe that for one second. However, in common with Senator Neville, I would be happy to have a debate on this issue and examine whatever evidence exists.</P>
      <P>With regard to the matter I raised about the treatment of children in abuse cases, my information is that a recent judgment was given in the Dublin Circuit Court which will have profound implications for children who are the subject of child care cases.  Unless there is legislative reform in this regard, the civil courts will be greatly hampered in their scope to examine possible cases of child abuse, including cases involving custody and access disputes and proceedings by health boards to take children into care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following this judgment, in the absence of consent on both sides, no video evidence of interviews with children <Col N="1771" /> can be introduced, nor can evidence be given by professionals of their conversations with children where such material might prove prejudicial to one of the parties in the case.  The only way this evidence could be introduced would be if the children themselves were to get into the witness box and give it directly. Given the age of some of the children, this is hardly a feasible alternative.</P>

      <P>I have tried to tie a number of issues together in this amendment.  By virtue of amendment No. 5, I welcome the fact that the Minister has anticipated one aspect I intended to cover.</P>
      <P>In my amendment to section 1 (1) of the 1908 Act I am attempting to extend the crime of incest beyond carnal knowledge to that of sexual assault.  I am certain that much of the abuse of children can only be described as sexual assault in particular situations and therefore the capacity of the courts and Garda to act is restricted.  I am attempting to ensure that it will also be punishable to sexually assault a child in the manner outlined in the 1908 Act.  This would bring carnal knowledge and sexual assault under the terms of the Bill.  As I said on Second Stage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand; that was on the list circulated this morning.  I am moving amendment No. 2 but I am also referring to the other amendments <Col N="1773" /> which are grouped with it, amendments Nos. 3, 4 and 5.</P>
      <P>In the amendment, I am seeking the extension of the punishment for sexual assault to the crime of incest.  The effect of the first part of the amendment is to extend it beyond carnal knowledge.  I look forward to the Minister's reply.  At this stage, I would prefer to hear what she has to say before making a response.</P>
      <P>In amendment No. 4 I am attempting to give a definition of sexual assault by referring to section 4 of the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990. This lists various definitions of sexual assault.  I know this matter is of crucial importance from the evidence I have of child sexual abuse.  It is critically important that this definition is included.  I will not go into detail at this point, although I may need to do so later.</P>
      <P>The second part of the amendment seeks to reclassify the crime as a felony rather than as a misdemeanour.  I made a strong case for that on Second Stage. The difference between a felony and a misdemeanour in this case is that a person under suspicion of a felony can be held by the Garda immediately and an aider and abettor to a felony can be held responsible whereas aiding and abetting a misdemeanour is not really a crime.  I cite as an example the recent horrific case in the west when a father forced his son to have sex with his daughter. Under the terms of this Act if we did not re-describe it as a felony the person would be technically not guilty.</P>
      <P>I note the Minister has anticipated me on that point and I welcome the open way she has dealt with that.  I take it we are agreed on that approach and I do not need to stress the point.  I would feel I have achieved something important if after over 80 years incest is redefined as a felony rather than a misdemeanour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of people have misunderstood what I have being trying to do with the third element of the amendment. I am attempting to replace the provision that a person can be kept in penal servitude for any period not less than three and not exceeding seven <Col N="1774" /> years with a provision for a life sentence. Some people misinterpret it as meaning all those convicted of incest should be given a life sentence.  What I was doing was giving discretion back to the courts.  I want to remove the minimum and maximum provision and leave it to the courts to decide a sentence of any period up to life.</P>
    <P>There is not any great virtue in consistency, but I tend to try to be consistent in my opposition to mandatory sentencing. It defeats the purpose of the law and the courts.  A life sentence should be allowed should an horrific case so require, but the court should have discretion and not be tied to the current minimum and maximum sentences.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 has the same effect on section 3.  I note the Minister is proposing the elimination of subsection (3) of the Act.  I am confused by that and I look forward to the Minister's proposal.  Section 3 deals with attempted incest, which, I presume, the Minister will tell me is to be covered in some other way.  The House would not for a moment countenance any weakening of the 1908 Act, which sees attempted incest as a crime in itself.  I look forward to the Minister's explanation. I will come back at that point with my third amendment if need be.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 4 interprets sexual assault.  I have taken the interpretation from sections 4 and 12 of the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990 &mdash; section 12 deals with sexual assault in detail.  My interpretation of section 4 is different to the Minister's, but I feel strongly that my section 12 reference should stand.  My interpretation of section 4 of the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990, might not be universally accepted and I would like the Minister's view on that.</P>
    <P>I have tried to contextualise the amendments in terms of the earlier debate and what the Minister is proposing in her amendment.  I fully agree and am delighted that she is accepting my proposal that this should be a felony. I do not understand what exactly she has in mind with the deletion of subsection <Col N="1775" /> (3) of section 1 of the 1908 Act, which says that: &ldquo;If any male person attempts to commit any such offence as aforesaid he shall be guilty of a misdemeanour...&rdquo; The Minister is proposing to delete that subsection.  If that is done the Act would not cover attempted incest and I presume the Minister will tell me that it will be dealt with in another way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was simply asking. The proposed change from misdemeanour to felony is correct and the Minister has wisely tabled an amendment to give it effect.  The punishment would have been consistent with a misdemeanour. The maximum sentence for defilement, that is unlawful carnal knowledge, under the 1935 Act is life imprisonment.  When the Minister is bringing in new legislation she will need to consider the issue of unlawful carnal knowledge itself.  In the speech I referred to earlier the DPP points out that there are many cases in which both parties are under age and it is fully consensual &mdash; such are the times we live in. We will support the change from misdemeanour to felony.</P>
      <P>The question of sexual assault is tied in which the issue of sentencing.  It could be wrong that one could get life imprisonment for a sexual assault; that is a slight inconsistency in Senator O'Toole's position.  I would prefer to keep the definition of incest as it is &mdash; in other words, it is the same act as defilement, unlawful carnal knowledge, except it is with a member of a family as defined in the 1908 Act.  We would not agree to the amendment putting sexual assault in this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>

      <P>That is ridiculous.  For certain offences in the Road Traffic Act, 1994, for example, there are minimum sentences.  Perhaps, for incest we will also have to consider that, but it would have to be more fully considered. Fianna Fáil will not agree to the sexual assault provisions of Senator O'Toole's amendments but we will agree to the life imprisonment and the misdemeanour to felony changes.</P>

      <P>I support all of Senator O'Toole's amendments, including the provision dealing with sexual assault.  In commenting briefly on the question of felony, part of my mind is still in Los Angeles.  My education in the law is being conducted extensively here.  Perhaps if I had been here on Second Stage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am just half-witted. On the question of felony, I understood it was an offence which carried a penalty of two years or more &mdash; no, then I am incorrect on that.  In any case it is clearly a more serious matter than a misdemeanour.  Public perception of something regarded as a misdemeanour would be that it is something comparatively light and that a slap on the wrist would be sufficient punishment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask for further illumination.  Is there a provision in the criminal law for an offence known as misprison of felony? This makes it a criminal offence for somebody to be party to knowledge of <Col N="1777" /> the commission of a criminal act and they may be liable to prosecution.  That may have serious implications, although I am not sure if it could implicate a minor.  Perhaps the Minister might look at the question of misprision of felony and whether it should be removed from criminal law.  I fully support life imprisonment as opposed to maximum or minimum sentences and this amendment is most important.</P>
    <P>As regards press coverage and the desire by some to restrict it because it might cause copycat crimes, one of the problems &mdash; although I support maximum coverage &mdash; is that there can be a heat of the moment response from the public which is not always sufficiently informed.  This sometimes leads to ill-informed criticisms of judgments which, if the full evidence was known, are reasonable in the circumstances in the light of all cases.  I particularly dislike the introduction of maximum and minimum sentences because they often conceal a distrust of the Judiciary and a refusal to rely on its good sense, which in most cases is firmly established.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

      <P>I thank Senators O'Toole, Henry and Lee for putting down these amendments.  I made a comment to Senator Norris about leaving his mind in Los Angeles and being here only in body, but he seems to be seriously exercising his mind in the House.  Members will be conscious of how complex the area of sexual crime is.  We must ensure that when a step is taken it does not damage that taken a week or a year ago.  Senator Norris asked if this Government would be prepared to accept Bills from the Opposition.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope we will see the day when there is a female Pope.  Now that I have moved from the Opposition benches to Government, I realise that the facilities available for preparing legislation in Opposition are not always as good as those available to me, for example, in the Department of Justice, where all legislation is taken into consideration when new legislation is being drafted.  Access to such information is not always available when in Opposition. Sometimes a Member of the Opposition introduces legislation which appears to be the answer to a problem which has arisen, but when examined difficulties are revealed which cannot be made into law.  That is why the Government cannot immediately accept legislation introduced by the Opposition because it may need amendments to make it viable and workable.  Opposition Bills introduced during our term in Government will be examined by the relevant Minister, although they may not always be accepted.  However, the Taoiseach is open to this.</P>
      <P>I listened carefully to what Senator O'Toole and other Members said about the amendments put down by him and Senators Henry and Lee.  I share the concerns expressed and I have no difficult accepting the principles behind the amendments; but I cannot accept them as worded in some instances.  I introduced an amendment in regard to a misdemeanour and felony and I propose to put down further amendment on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy anticipated some of the difficulties I have with the amendments. Amendment No. 2 causes me the most difficulty as it seeks to amend the Act, <i>inter alia</i>, to alter the provisions of the Punishment of Incest Act, 1908, so that sexual assault as defined in legislation <Col N="1779" /> by a male on a person who is to his knowledge his granddaughter, sister or mother would become punishable in the same manner as incest.  There is a tendency to use the term &ldquo;sexual assault&rdquo; when referring to anything to do with sexual assault in the broadest sense.  In law sexual assault has a specific meaning, which is indecent touching without consent.  That is an offence which, in accordance with the Criminal Law (Rape Amendment) Act, 1990, is punishable by imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years and it is a felony.</P>
    <P>I accept that sexual assault by a parent or a close family member is a serious matter.  However, we must accept that there is an element of degree involved. It would not be correct to equate touching a member of a family with the more serious offence of full incest.  That is not to underestimate what Senator O'Toole is trying to get at, that is, that often a child may be subjected to many years of what is defined by law as sexual assault without full intercourse taking place or act of incest.  A child's life could be ruined by constant touching or caressing by a member of a family, which is the first step towards full incest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister only instanced female family members, mothers, sisters and granddaughters. Does this extend to male relatives being subject to sexual assault?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Senators will know that in law incest by a male member of a family as opposed to a female member is dealt with differently as far sentencing is concerned in that maximum sentences for incest carried out by females are lower.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>My point was that it could be perpetrated against a male member, not necessarily by female.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is covered as well. Equating sexual assault by giving it the same sentence as full incest would not <Col N="1780" /> be a good step to take.  If the crime against a person, a family member or otherwise, is one of sexual assault, a case may be taken under other Acts.  If a child is being subjected to what is essentially a long period of sexual assault which does not result in incest under the Act, the perpetrator can be prosecuted under the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981, and the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990.</P>
      <P>The 1990 Act provides for the offence of aggravated sexual assault, which is sexual assault that involves serious violence or the threat of such violence or is such as to cause injury, humiliation or degradation of a grave nature to the person assaulted.  The maximum penalty for an aggravated sexual assault is life imprisonment and the offence is a felony. The offence is applicable irrespective of the relationship between the parties. Where a child is subjected to long term sexual assault as opposed to actual incest, a prosecution can be taken under the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990, and the offence can be regarded as aggravated sexual assault, the full sentence for which is life.</P>
      <P>Existing laws allow for this kind of grievous sentence to be imposed for this kind of grievous offence.  The law adequately caters for the degrees of sexual assault which Senator O'Toole wants to be catered for in this Bill. Aggravated sexual assault can occur within and outside families.  Where it occurs within a family the appropriate sentence is life imprisonment.  It would not be appropriate in this Bill to equate sexual assault with incest.  Incest is a very grievous and absolute offence whereas sexual assault can be of different degrees.  Some instances of it can be far more serious than others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senators have tabled a related amendment which defines sexual assault by reference to sections 4 and 12 of the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990.  The Senators appear to have in mind that a light sentence should be a possibility for a whole range of sexual offences.  I think that, on reflection, Senators will accept that it would not be <Col N="1781" /> appropriate for a life sentence to be imposed on a person convicted of touching somebody without their permission. Somebody who has subjected someone, particularly a young person, to a long series of aggravated sexual assaults, should be liable to a life sentence.  We must keep a balance in our laws with regard to the crime of sexual assault, With the exception of sexual assault and complicity in such an assault, a person convicted of any of the offences in question can be sentenced to life imprisonment under existing legislation for aggravated sexual assault.</P>
    <P>Moving to the other amendments, I accept the proposal that life imprisonment should be the maximum penalty for incest.  I am anxious to achieve consistency and I do not think it has existed in our laws with regard to sexual offences.  I am anxious that in any laws I introduce there is as much consistency as possible and a recognition of the heinousness of sexual crimes so that such crimes, whether they be incest or rape, are perceived by people to be of the same seriousness.</P>
    <P>For that reason I accept that a sentence of 20 years is in effect one of life but it gives the impression that is a different kind of sentence to life. Section 1 (1) of the 1908 Act was amended by the Criminal Justice Act, 1993, which provided for a sentence of 20 years.  Previously a paltry sentence existed.  This was entirely wrong.  I am satisfied that a sentence of 20 years is generally in keeping with a life sentence. I accept that we should move to calling it a life sentence and I will introduce an amendment on Report Stage to change the 20 years sentence provided for in the 1993 Act to one of life for incest.  Unfortunately, the relevant part of the Senator's amendment is defective in that he is trying to amend a non-operative section of the 1908 Act, because it was itself amended in 1908.</P>

      <P>Therefore, there is no need for me to accept this amendment. <Col N="1782" /> The House should accept my reservations about including sexual assault in the Bill.  If it is in order I will move amendment No. 5, in my name, which proposes the substitution of &ldquo;felony&rdquo; for &ldquo;misdemeanour&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 5 is relevant to Senator O'Toole's amendment No. 3 as they both propose the substitution of &ldquo;felony&rdquo; for &ldquo;misdemeanour&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>An interesting piece of history is that the 1908 Act was introduced not as a Government Bill but as a Private Members' Bill.  The forerunner of some of the lobby groups of today encouraged a Member to introduce this Bill and it was accepted by the Government.  It was accepted for social reasons and not to protect children because simultaneously the Government introduced its own Children Bill in that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The incest Act was introduced because of the impression that incest was not nice and should not happen in society.  It was regarded as a misdemeanour because the attitude then was very different to the attitude today towards the awful crime of incest.  The language used in the 1908 Act &mdash; such as calling the offence a misdemeanour, which made it seem very minimal &mdash; was because of the attitude of the time to the fact that there was a great deal of overcrowding in families and incest was seen by society to be not the done thing but was not regarded as criminal or dangerous.  The Children Act, which was also introduced in 1908 but has since been amended, was a child protection <Col N="1783" /> Act.  Child protection was not the basis for the incest Act.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that we change the term &ldquo;misdemeanour&rdquo; to &ldquo; felony&rdquo;.  I am preparing a criminal law amendment Act which will remove these terms and refer to them as arrestable crimes.  The main difference between a crime being a misdemeanour and a felony is that once a felony is suspected there is the power of arrest whereas this power does not exist in the case of a misdemeanour.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The main difference is one of a trial by jury.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the power of arrest where the Garda suspect a felony has been committed is also very important.  It is particularly important, where there is a suspicion that incest is taking place, that the Garda have the power of immediate arrest to remove the suspected person from the family home or wherever the crime is being committed.</P>
      <P>I accept in principle most of what Senator O'Toole has proposed.  Senator Neville and Senator Gallagher have not tabled amendments but spoke on Second Stage.  The debate on the Bill has been extremely useful in identifying and highlighting the complexity of the matter and the non-simplistic way with which it must be dealt.  It is easy to give a very quick reaction when an issue like this arises, it happens all the time, but we must be careful that anything we do will stand the test of time and will not create another problem with another Bill.</P>
      <P>These crimes are often intricately bound up with each other.  The issues of degree, intimidation and coercion are very often hard to define.  We must accept the effect on people's lives of something insidious and evil which has gone on for a very long time.  For that reason, I very much welcome the statements by Senators that we need to make sure that our society is aware of these crimes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1784" /> Senator Mulcahy invited me to comment on the DPP's statement at the Burren school.  As Senators know, the DPP is an utterly independent officer of this State and I would not dare to comment on what he says.  However, the media have played a vital role in opening up and uncovering what has been going on in our society.  It is very easy for us to pretend that these things do not happen if we do not read about them.  There is an onus on both the broadcasting and print media to ensure that they are not publishing material simply for prurient reasons but in order to let us know what has been going on.</P>
    <P>As Senator Norris said, a journalist from <i>The Irish Times</i> stated on a programme the other evening that there has not been a backlash from the victims. That is not to say that some people will not be disgusted or upset in various ways by what is being said.  I am not aware of any evidence that the printing of details of these cases has led to other crimes.  However, I share some of the concerns expressed by Senators Mulcahy and Neville that we must always be conscious that allegations have been made in courts that the availability of pornography and certain videos have led people to commit such crimes.</P>
    <P>I do not think that there is enough evidence or research for us to be able to draw those conclusions&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>

      <P>This is a good day for democracy.  I understand what the <Col N="1785" /> Senator is saying and I will check out the matter; there may well be some ongoing research of which I am not aware.  I will consider the Senator's concerns and see what action I can take.</P>
      <P>I said on Second Stage that I intended to publish a discussion paper &mdash; and to circulate it to the health boards, newspapers, all the caring agencies, groups such as the Rape Crisis Centre and the Council for the Status of Women and Members of the Oireachtas &mdash; covering a number of areas which have not yet been dealt with in our laws, including carnal knowledge to which many Senators referred.  At present, there are no restrictions on reporting carnal knowledge cases.  I want to get some feedback from the people who deal with the victims of these crimes.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate for me to take some time rather than rushing into amending laws or bringing in new laws just because there are some very difficult cases at the moment.  Some reflection on these wider issues would be good.  That discussion paper will be available very shortly and I will ensure that it is circulated to Senators so that they can give me their views on it.  It will cover whether newspaper reporting has had any effect and, I hope, will also result in feedback from people who share Senator Mulcahy's view that prurient or graphic reporting is in some way damaging to the victims and potential victims of incest, rape or any other sexual offence.  If the Senators bear with me, some of those issues will be covered.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris implied that somehow or other this Bill could be made a catchall. This discussion paper is my answer to that and perhaps he will let me have the benefit of his wisdom on these issues when his mind returns from Los Angeles.</P>

      <P>I cannot accept amendment No. 3 in its current form as I am unable to accept amendment No. 2. However, in my amendment to section 4 &mdash; which is the one Senator O'Toole <Col N="1786" /> was worried about &mdash; I intend to repeal the section of the Act which allows for a different penalty for attempted incest. In other words, attempted incest will be subject to the same penalty as incest.  It is a throwback to the way in which incest was thought about in 1908 when they made it two separate crimes.  Incest and attempted incest should be treated in the same way.  That is what my amendment means but the Chair will probably not allow me to say that.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to be in a position to accept what I believe are the main issues raised by the Senators.  They match very much my own views and they would have been in the Bill if I had not been so anxious to publish the Bill quickly.  I think that the Senators accept that that was done for very good reasons.  I have promised to accept some of the amendments, particularly amendment No. 7 which is in the name of Senator Mulcahy with the slight addition of my subsection.  I will bring forward the amendments which I indicated on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>I believe I have accepted what I can of Senator Honan's amendments.  I cannot accept the amendments with regard to sections 3, 4 and 5 of the rape Act for the reason I gave, even if she brings them back on Report Stage.  Wherever the issue of complainant arises in any of Senator Honan's amendments, that is just not relevant to incest and, therefore, I will not be able to accept them. I think that the Senator will realise on reflection that what I have accepted at this Stage and what I will bring back on Report Stage is essentially accepting what I can of her amendments.</P>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their information, knowledge and understanding of the need to deal with this matter sensitively. I look forward to their input when the discussion paper is published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much appreciate the Minister's comprehensive response to the three amendments I tabled today. On section 2 she explained, as did Senator Mulcahy, her reservations about the words &ldquo;sexually assault&rdquo;.  I <Col N="1787" /> accept the points which were made.  In effect, I had intended that to be &ldquo;aggravated sexual assault&rdquo; but, somewhere along the way, I dropped the word &ldquo;aggravated&rdquo;&mdash; perhaps the issue of teachers' pensions intervened.  Having looked at sections 4 and 12 of the other Act, I am absolutely clear that the Minister is right that there is provision under the amended Act of 1990 to deal with aggravated sexual assault in a thoroughly acceptable way.  Therefore, it would be inappropriate to accept the first section of my amendment.</P>
      <P>I welcome and appreciate her taking on board the arguments I made on Second Stage for the need to distinguish this as a felony rather than a misdemeanour. I look forward to her amendment which I will support.  Similarly, her acceptance that it should not be imprisonment for life.  That gives more discretion and powers to the courts, sends a very clear signal and allows the crime to be dealt with positively.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage, I referred to the point Senator Norris has just raised about the concealment of information.  I did not get the chance to develop that point then and I intended so doing today.  It is absolutely crucial and central to making concealment a felony.  Where neighbours, teachers and others become aware of incest taking place, it might make life easier for the Minister if the disclosure of such information was made mandatory.  It is also one of the recommendations of the Kilkenny incest report and it is an area which must be addressed.  I will withdraw amendment No. 2 on the basis of the commitments given by the Minister.</P>
      <P>With regard to amendment No. 3, the Minister has advised that she will delete the section which I sought to amend for reasons with which I agree, because she is now making attempted incest the same as incest.  The Minister has not indicated how she will do this; presumably it will be introduced on Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann commends the security forces on their recent drugs hauls; and urges the Government to give the most urgent attention and the fullest possible resources to the implementation of an integrated attack on the drugs problem at all levels.</P>
      <P>This important motion has implications for the continuation of our society.  The record seizures of cannabis and Ecstasy last Friday and Saturday are extremely serious and give a small insight into the problem which confronts the State.  The street value of the drugs, £25 million of cannabis and £0.5 million of Ecstasy, highlights the size of the business in which the criminal community is engaged.  While the seizure is the biggest haul of drugs so far in the State, it is only the tip of the iceberg.</P>
      <P>There is every reason to believe that the nature and extent of the drugs problem in Ireland is worse than it was at any time in the history of the State.  Not only is drug abuse a serious problem in urban areas, but drugs are also readily available in rural Ireland and the situation is deteriorating.  The growing drug abuse problem is the most serious issue facing Irish society.  If it is not controlled, it will threaten the existence of society as we know it.</P>
      <P>I discussed this with an American who is involved in this area and he said that the structure of society is threatened by the drug culture and the level of crime associated with it.  Garda figures for 1993 show that seizures of controlled drugs increased by 15 per cent over the previous year.  Offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1984, increased by 10 per cent over the same period.  Garda sources suggest that the latest provisional figures show a further escalation of the problem in 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The success of the security forces in seizing drugs in the past three years is highly commended.  The Government <Col N="1792" /> must ensure that the fullest possible resources are available to facilitate a concerted attack against this problem. Ireland must not become the drug trafficking centre of Europe.  The security forces must have the necessary men, material and equipment to deal with the crisis.</P>
    <P>As a step in controlling this, the Government should examine the introduction of helicopter units in the Garda Síochána.  Airborne law enforcement is a practical and cost-effective tool in the fight against crime.  It could be effective against trafficking of drugs on seagoing vessels.  It has been a statistical success in other jurisdictions.  Studies show that the use of helicopters can help to suppress crime because the helicopter can see at least six times as much detail as any ground vehicle in the same time.  It can search a 25 mile area in the same time as it takes a ground vehicle to search a one mile area.  It can increase the level of convictions by providing aerial photographs or videos of criminal activity.  Helicopter units are a proven deterrent against crime.  A dozen people might see a patrol car in five minutes, while 1,000 would see a helicopter.</P>
    <P>Patrolling the Irish coastline is a task to which the helicopter is ideally suited. While helicopters have been used by the security forces in recent times, the Government must closely examine the introduction of Garda operated units. Helicopter patrols are cost-effective.  In Los Angeles the cost of a two man patrol car searching one square mile is $54 while the total cost of a two man helicopter surveillance unit for one square mile is $8.5.</P>
    <P>The drugs problem is escalating throughout the world.  In 1993 more than 400 tonnes of hashish, seven tonnes of heroin, almost 18 tonnes of cocaine and large quantities of other illegal substances were seized throughout the EU. However, it is estimated that this is less than 10 per cent of the total quantity of drugs illegally imported to the Continent.</P>
    <P>The Irish coastline is a major target area for drug shipments.  Since July 1991 <Col N="1793" /> major drug seizures were made along the south-west coast.  Cannabis, with a street value of £7 million, was discovered on a yacht at Courtmacsharry in July 1991.  In 1992 300 kilogrammes of cannabis resin was seized at Ringaskiddy and 50 kilogrammes of cannabis was seized in Cork harbour.  Cannabis was discovered in large quantities along the Cork-Kerry coastline in 1993; 135 kilogrammes near Skibbereen in January and 500 kilogrammes in July of the same year, with an estimated street value of £6.8 million.  Cannabis, estimated to be worth £1.25 million, was discovered buried on a beach in Rosscarbery in May 1993.  The arrest of the yacht, <i>The Brime</i>, with two tonnes of cannabis was one of the biggest successes prior to last weekend.  In March of this year cocaine to the value of £3 million was found on the Clare coast south of Black Head near Fanore village. On 26 March cannabis to the value of £300,000 was seized in the Innishannon area of County Cork.</P>
    <P>This demonstrates the level of activity along the coast and the security forces must be congratulated on their success in this area.  However, I must emphasise that this is just the tip of the iceberg.  We must recognise that it represents a small portion of the actual level of drug smuggling. Given the resources and manpower, the Garda Síochána has the expertise to make further inroads in drug dealers' activities.  The EU must play a key role in this area.  There is a common duty among the member states to guard the European coastline against drug smuggling.  I reiterate the strong case made by the Taoiseach at the weekend for the establishment of an EU funded European coastguard which could augment the over-stretched and under-resourced Naval Service.</P>
    <P>This is the drug trafficking season.  At this time of year the international drug barons will exploit the increase in marine activity to ply their evil trade along the Irish coastline.  As well as seeking European help to combat what is essentially a European problem, we must also <Col N="1794" /> put our own house in order.  I urge the Government to establish a joint task force to spearhead the fight against the drug barons and to provide the Navy with the necessary legislative powers to arrest suspicious vessels.  The establishment of a joint task force involving personnel from the Garda Síochána, the customs service and the Irish Navy would end interdepartmental rivalry and ensure a team effort against drug trafficking on the basis of shared intelligence.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, because of deficiencies in legislation, the Navy is unable to take unilateral and immediate action against suspect vessels.  It must first contact the Department of Defence seeking assistance from the civil power and must have either gardaí or customs personnel aboard before it can board or detain a ship.  This procedure results in valuable time being lost.  Legislation should be introduced to allow the Navy to act along the same lines as it does in its role as a fisheries protection body.  It would then be able to board suspicious boats, detain them for further investigation and bring them to shore to be handed over to the Department of the Marine and to the Garda.</P>
    <P>In addition to adopting these measures, we must convince our European partners of the need for additional European financial assistance in the short term to help combat drug trafficking off the Irish coast and of the need in the long-term for the establishment of a European coastguard.  Enforcement alone has not and will not solve the drug problem.  The best the Garda can do in the enforcement area is sit on the lid of the problem by remorselessly pursuing the dealers and tackling the supply network and the attendant violence while assisting education policies in the prevention area.</P>
    <P>Drug abuse is a multi-faceted problem. Drug treatment facilities must be expanded and upgraded.  There is a need to expand the drug education programme in schools.  We must, as a matter of urgency, formulate a coherent policy to tackle the drugs crisis.  The survival <Col N="1795" /> of society as we know it may depend on having such a coherent policy. There are no accurate figures available for the number of drug abusers in Ireland.  The age at which people first experiment with drugs is falling all the time.  The major drugs of addiction, as indicated by the health research board report of 1993, are heroin, morphine sulphate tablets and other opiates. These are drugs which also give rise to the greatest concern because of the antisocial behaviour of those who misuse them as well as the risk of the spread of HIV/AIDS which arises from the sharing of contaminated needles.</P>
    <P>In 1991 the Government announced a strategy to prevent drug abuse.  This was based on the recommendations of the national co-ordinating committee on drug abuse.  The strategy recognises that the problem of drug abuse is complex and difficult and that it is a problem to which there are no easy or instant solutions. It, therefore, proposed a multi-disciplinary approach requiring action in the areas of supply reduction, demand reduction and increased access to treatment and rehabilitation programmes together with co-ordination mechanisms geared towards their effective implementation.  The strategy was accepted by that Government.  It is timely that a comprehensive review is completed on the outcome of the implementation of the strategy.  I ask the Minister to ensure that such a review takes place and that the report on its findings be put before this House.</P>
    <P>On 25 January this year Fianna Fáil introduced a Private Members' motion on this issue.  During that debate I outlined in detail to the House research which was completed by the National Youth Council of Ireland in October 1994.  I wish to refer briefly to its findings because they are important.  They were that drug abuse does not recognise class barriers; most young people can get drugs if they want to do so; drugs are readily available and, in some cases, socially acceptable; young people know a lot about drugs, the cost and side <Col N="1796" /> effects; initially people experiment with drugs from curiosity, particularly those who experiment with solvents such as sniffing glues, gases and petrol; young people are usually offered drugs by friends and acquaintances and not by shady people and schools are a major drug supply point for many.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion proposed by Senator Neville and I welcome the Minister for Justice to the House.</P>
      <P>This is probably the most important debate we have had in this House for quite a long time.  We are all only too well aware of the ongoing drugs problem and how it is affecting every aspect of society.  Drugs will be the new killer disease. However, unlike other diseases which only kill the person affected, drugs affect many others &mdash; the family and friends of the addict, people whose houses are burgled and people who are mugged because somebody is trying to get a few pounds for a fix.  It is important that the Minister address this serious problem and this House should adopt a unified approach.  I hope all the ideas that are put forward tonight &mdash; indeed at any time &mdash; for dealing with the drugs problem will be taken on board.</P>
      <P>I commend the Garda for their recent tremendous successes.  I also commend the customs officials and all who work in this area.  Their work in recent years has paid off, particularly in the seizure last week of £20 million worth of cannabis resin which was found in a container in Dublin port.  Such seizures and finds are achieved only through meticulous training and detection with the necessary resources and equipment being made available to the bodies involved.  It is important that every resource of the Department is utilised. If we are successful in this area there will be a considerable saving in other areas, such as health care, education and particularly in the cost of incarcerating individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a practitioner in the courts I often hear the mitigating argument that the defendant is on drugs, that he is seeking <Col N="1797" /> help and that he deserves another chance.  I am not saying some people do not deserve another chance but, if the drugs were not so readily available, there might not be a need to seek another chance.  Education for prevention of the problem is important, particularly when we see how it affects young families and young people.  The need for treatment is important.  We hear of waiting lists for treatment, but that did not arise only when the Minister was appointed.  It is important that the Minister consult with the Minister for Health, the Minister for Education and, at a different level, the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I hope she will make this problem her hobby-horse, as it were, at European Union level.  The drugs problem can only be solved by the coming together of European minds.  We will not solve it alone, no matter what precautions we take.</P>
    <P>It is important that this country does not become the starting point for drug trafficking in Europe.  An interesting report on this issue was published in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 31 March last.  A map showed that this ship started in Kenya and stopped in Antwerp before arriving in Ireland.  This is a huge business and we must commend the customs national drugs team, the Garda and all those involved in this operation, code-named &ldquo;Early Bird&rdquo;.  They prevented horrendous misery, hardship and crime, not alone in this country but elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Minister should look at ways of strengthening the drugs squad, educating people on drugs and of gaining greater intelligence about drugs.  She should consider further preventative measures around our coast, the stationing of squads around the country and the use of helicopters.  A small amount of money put towards prevention will reap millions in savings.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also consider a drugs educational programme in schools so that students are well informed about and warned of the dangers of drugs. This will ensure people will not think they can take small amounts of drugs without adverse effects.  Drugs are <Col N="1798" /> illegal because they are harmful and devastating to so many people, not just drug users.  This is a big business and we must do everything in our means to stamp it out.  At times people say small amounts of drugs will not necessarily do much harm, but unfortunately small amounts lead to larger ones and to greater problems.  We must ensure this is prevented.</P>
    <P>When the Minister speaks I am sure she will accept the various points made. This House is largely united on how to approach the problem.  We are all aware of it.  Everyone in the House knows of constituents or others who have been affected.  There may be a slight diversity of opinion about the approaches and we all want more money to be ploughed in. When the Minister is fighting her corner in Cabinet, all of her colleagues, especially those in Departments also concerned with drugs, will be supportive of her approach.  A combination of various Departments will be needed to tackle the problem.  I hope she responds positively.  I formally second the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will know from the attitude of Fianna Fáil this morning that where Government legislation or activity is good and merits support, we have been more than willing to give it.  I thank her for complimenting us on our support this morning and for her co-operation.  However, Fianna Fáil is not prepared to accept the Fine Gael motion because we strongly believe it smacks of complacency.  This is not a view particular to Fianna Fáil.  Yesterday's leading article in <i>The Irish Times</i> stated:</P>
      <P>...there are few signs that the deep level of concern felt by the ordinary citizen has percolated through to Government.  How else can one explain the easygoing, indeed complacent, approach to this problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>The Irish Times</i> is echoing a deep rooted concern that the problem is so large and growing at such a rate that it is likely to get out of hand.  I do not address this only to the Minister, because every resource available to the <Col N="1800" /> Government must be channelled urgently to combat this problem.</P>
    <P>I hope I do not speak with unmerited gravity because the Minister will be aware of the horrendous statistics on the rate of increase of drug abuse and trafficking. She will also have seen the figures from the customs search teams.  In 1991, they seized drugs worth £10.2 million; in 1992, £11 million; in 1993, £16.5 million.  In 1994 the figure was down to £5 million, but already in 1995 drugs worth more than £25 million have been seized by the customs authorities alone. That is a compliment to the customs unit concerned and we are happy to support the first part of the motion, which commends the security forces on their recent hauls.  However, many other things must be done as a matter of urgency by the Government to tackle this problem.</P>
    <P>I have some questions for the Minister. When will the O'Donnell report be published?  When will she agree to the establishment of a national drugs enforcement agency?  Will she prepare a comprehensive report and statistics on the scale and extent of drug trafficking in Ireland?  What plans has she to stop the importation of drugs into Ireland, now that the European Union has introduced frontiers without passports? Ireland and the UK are not signatories to the latest agreement because there is a common travel area between our countries.  What steps will the Minister take to obtain European funding to protect our coastline from the invasion of drugs?  The Maastricht Treaty specifically mentions a Europe-wide police force, but no information has appeared about it yet.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister aware there are large waiting lists at the drug treatment centres?  If she is aware, what is she doing to shorten the lists?  Is she satisfied that there are only five vessels exclusively dedicated to drugs interdiction operating around our coasts?  That does not include the Navy, which has co-operated on many occasions, but five vessels are not sufficient to cover the coast of one of our provinces.  It is a ridiculously <Col N="1801" /> small number to patrol about 1,600 kilometres of coastline.  Has the Minister started a system of co-operation on drug interdiction with her counterparts in Northern Ireland? te</P>
    <P>Does the Minister agree that a large amount, perhaps the majority, of violent crime in Ireland, especially in Dublin, is drug related?  What is she doing about the drugs black spots such as Dolphin's Barn, where drugs are almost openly peddled?  She must be aware that in many parts of Dublin halls are hired and the Garda know that Ecstasy is taken there, again almost openly.  If I sound alarmist, it is only because the public feels the same way.  We go into our constituencies and people tell us that they do not feel safe in their houses because they are afraid that drug addicts are going to come in the middle of the night and steal their money.</P>
    <P>The liberal approach to drugs, which our party is totally against, has failed.  It has failed in Zurich where they had a drug needle park.  It has failed in Amsterdam, which is now the drug and criminal centre of Europe to a large extent.  I say that advisedly; I have spoken to some of the security officers involved in this country who believe that Amsterdam is a centre for much of this activity.</P>
    <P>We do not want an uncoordinated, under-resourced effort, with different people pulling in different directions. Until the Minister establishes &mdash; this is the most important part of our amendment &mdash; a national drugs enforcement agency to co-ordinate the operations of the Garda, the customs, the Navy, the Army and the Air Corps, people in this country will not have confidence that this Government is on top of the drugs problem.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister agrees with me that the last Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, was on top of her job; she was strong and vigorous.  She instituted a system of surprise visits to Garda stations.  Will the present Minister give us an undertaking that she will continue with those surprise visits and <Col N="1802" /> that she will visit drug hot spots?  The Minister may find this funny, but the public is not laughing.</P>

      <P>I hereby commend the amendment to the Fine Gael motion to the House.  I ask the Minister to provide adequate resources to the Garda, Navy, Customs and Excise and also to publish the O'Donnell report.  <i>The Irish Times</i> published an article saying that there is no reason why the O'Donnell report should not be published forthwith.  I also ask the Minister to establish the national drugs enforcement agency and to get the proper funding from Europe so that we can deal with this problem in an integrated way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Minister for her time.  She is in the House for the second time today.  I hope the Minister does not infer rudeness from the tone of my voice, but this is a problem that all politicians hear a lot about.  I would be failing in my duty as a public representative if I did not make sure that the Minister heard about it.  The Fianna Fáil Party is only asking the Minister to deliver what the people of Ireland want.  We want urgency and activity.  We want the Minister to be strong and to clamp down on <Col N="1803" /> this problem in a co-ordinated way.  I commend the amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>I second the amendment. I also commend the action that took place in our own constituency yesterday in relation to the apprehension of the arms, guns and four individuals in the town of Balbriggan.  The House this morning recognised the excellent work done by the Garda on that occasion.</P>
      <P>Sometimes a scream is better than a thesis, somebody once said.  The congratulations being poured on the security forces in connection with recent drugs hauls have a very hollow ring to them.  Words are cheap, action costs effort and funding.  When it comes to tackling the illegal drugs racket that is tearing apart the fabric of our society, all the back-patting and congratulations in the world are useless unless we have action.</P>
      <P>It was extremely good that the weekend seizures of cannabis and Ecstasy took place, but the reality is that those seizures were just the tip of the iceberg, as Senator Neville and others mentioned in the last couple of days.  The drugs problem in this State is now worse than it was in the early 1980s, not just in regard to the misery and violence that goes with it but also with regard to the spread of drug abuse from the inner city out to other areas into schools, discos, streets and house parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister knows, it is unfortunately true, as a survey to be published soon will show, that the normal teenager in our constituency is saying that there is wide availability of drugs in our constituency.  Our constituency is no different from everywhere else in that. That has to be of concern to all who represent the area and in particular to the <Col N="1805" /> Minister, who has a national responsibility.</P>
    <P>More drugs are available; more drug addicts are being created.  More attacks are being made on innocent, often elderly people and tourists.  More robberies are being committed, more arrests being made.  All these offences are related to drug abuse and the need to feed addiction. It is shameful, terrifying and worrying.  What has happened to combat this evil?  Official complacency, as my colleague, Senator Mulcahy, has mentioned.  We must consider that tonight.  The Minister must address this issue in her contribution later on this evening.</P>
    <P>I wish to remind the Minister of some of the replies she gave in the other House in the last month.  There is now a reduced drugs squad.  The national co-ordinating committee on drugs has not met for over a year.  Our airports and ferry terminals are devoid of any sign of specialised Garda drugs units, which should be in place there if there is to be a serious effort to tackle this problem, a problem which seems to be out of control.</P>
    <P>The Department &ldquo;is working on proposals to ensure a more co-ordinated approach to the drugs problem&rdquo;, as the Minister told the other House in the last month.  The Department is only &ldquo;working on&rdquo; the situation and all the while drug pushing, drug abuse, drug importation, drug related beatings, disease, death, violence and murder go on.  As Senator Mulcahy has mentioned, we require action at this stage.  Action and funding are needed now.  Congratulating the security forces is all very well, and those congratulations are richly deserved, but it is time for the talking and promising to come to an end.  I ask the Minister, as my colleague asked her, whether she has a policy in relation to drug abuse?  I sincerely hope that the usual fix will not be that we will set up a committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the Seanad for the second time today on this most important matter.  I intend to set out in detail the response of the Government to this most pressing of problems.  As has already been said, it is a problem that has health, social, education and law enforcement dimensions. Sadly, drugs did not arrive in this country on 15 December 1994.  If they had then I would quite happily accept all the criticism that Fianna Fáil Members have tried to lay on my shoulders this evening.  Listening to those speakers one would think that their party had not been in Government for the last seven years during which time we have actually seen the kind of growth in drugs availability that they are complaining about now.  Senator Mulcahy listed some of the finds that were made over the last few years but in the 1993-94 period, when they were in Government, finds went down.  Since I became Minister for Justice the finds have gone up and this is as a direct result of the work of the Garda and the Customs and Excise service.  Drugs have been coming into our country for a number of years during which time young and not so young people have been getting their hands on them.  It is essential that they be caught by the Garda and customs officials so that they do not find their way on to the streets and into our homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil Senators should reflect on the fact that their party's Ministers have been in the Department of Justice for the last seven years.  If there were so many simple answers, why did they not discover them?  They should not pretend that this new Government can somehow, after three or four months in office, correct everything that they <Col N="1807" /> allowed to take place during their term of office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>Fair play.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>There can be no greater priority than the need to deal with the drugs problem.  The recent seizures made by the Garda and Customs are to be applauded but there is no room for complacency.  We are all aware of the damage that drugs can do, and we know the misery caused to families and entire communities by this menace.  It is a serious problem requiring a serious response.  It is not just the lives of abusers and their families that are ruined; the problem also affects the lives of others who fall victim to crimes committed by abusers so that they may feed their habit.</P>
      <P>There are, of course, no easy solutions. The problem must be confronted on a number of different levels.  Law enforcement alone can never be the solution. In the time available to me I want to set out in detail the Government's response to the problem.  Some of what I have to say was covered by my colleague the Minister for Health, Deputy Michael Noonan, when he dealt with a similar motion in the Seanad last January. He and I share a common view that the drugs problem must be put at the top of the agenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The multi-agency approach, involving the Departments of Health, Justice and Education, and their respective agencies, has been recognised as providing the best possible framework to deal with the problem.  We need action on the demand and supply sides of the problem. Much has been achieved and special funding has been provided for prevention and treatment services.  Satellite clinics have been established and general practitioners are being encouraged to take on responsibility for the treatment of abusers.  Detoxification facilities are being expanded.  Emphasis <Col N="1808" /> has been put on demand reduction through education, as other speakers have said, and prevention initiatives.</P>
    <P>The need for this co-ordinated effort is especially apparent to those charged with law enforcement.  The connection between drug dealing, drug addiction and crime is well known.  Addicts need money and crime is one way of obtaining it.  The problem of abuse of hard drugs, which is essentially confined to Dublin, must be faced up to if we are to get on top of crime.</P>
    <P>I would, however, like to begin by placing on the record of the Seanad my appreciation, and that of the Government, for the tremendous efforts of the Garda and the Customs and Excise service in seizing record quantities of controlled substances in recent days.  Last Friday, 31 March, customs officers assisted by gardaí from Harcourt Square, seized 2,000 kilogrammes of cannabis resin in Dublin port.  On Sunday, 2 April gardaí seized approximately 25,000 Ecstasy tablets in Dún Laoghaire port.  These are significant seizures which follow a series of successful operations carried out by the law enforcement agencies so far this year. Since the beginning of January, 13 finds &mdash; some of them very large indeed &mdash; have been made by the Garda and customs. These seizures are evidence that the Garda and customs are successfully targeting the traffickers.  However, as I said in the Dáil last night, nobody is complacent because of these seizures. On the contrary, the scale of the seizures, irrespective of whether the drugs in question were intended for this country or elsewhere, puts the dimension of the drugs problem into perspective.</P>
    <P>International experience has shown that there are no easy answers, and once the problem has developed it is notoriously difficult to reverse.  However, I am not interested in listening to those who shrug their shoulders and say we will just have to get used to the problem.  I do not accept this counsel of despair.  I have no illusions about the scale of the problem but this only makes me more determined to deal with it.  The problem <Col N="1809" /> is not insurmountable; it has to be tackled and it is being tackled.  To do so requires a co-ordinated and integrated approach.  But we have to deal in parallel with the demand for drugs, the conditions which generate that demand and the supply of drugs.</P>
    <P>The Government strategy to prevent drug abuse, which was published in 1991, recognises that the problem is a complex and difficult one.  It proposes a multi-disciplinary approach requiring action in the areas of supply reduction, demand reduction and increased access to treatment and rehabilitation programmes. In other words, the strategy calls for an integrated attack on the problem on a number of different levels. This approach provides the best possible framework to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the broader context, I would like to focus on my Department's and the Garda Síochána's response to the drug problem.  I want to deal with the resources available to the Garda because there has been some misinformed comment recently about numbers in the drug squads being reduced and I heard it again here this evening.  Indeed, some comment suggests that there is only one drug squad. As there would seem to be some confusion about this matter, let me put the record straight.  All Garda drug units throughout the country are co-ordinated on a national basis through the national drug administration office in Garda headquarters which is staffed by full-time gardaí with a detailed and specialised knowledge of the drugs problem.</P>
    <P>In Dublin, which is the main area where heroin is a problem, drug units have been established in each of the city's five Garda divisions and their activities are co-ordinated through the central drug squad based in Harcourt Square.  This approach has enabled the central drug squad to monitor the activities of drug dealers all over the city and it has significantly enhanced the Garda intelligence-gathering capability.  In addition to the central drug squad, full-time <Col N="1810" /> drug units operate in Santry, Cabra, Raheny, Dún Laoghaire, Crumlin, Ballyfermot, Tallaght, Store Street, Pearse Street, Kevin Street and Donnybrook. To sum up, we have never had more specialist drug units operating in the capital city.</P>
    <P>Outside Dublin, there are full-time drug units in Cork, Galway and Limerick. Drug abuse is not confined to Dublin; it is a national problem and the Garda Síochána is responding accordingly. The problem of drug misuse in rural areas is primarily one of cannabis and, to a lesser extent, Ecstasy.  I can assure you that rural areas are not being overlooked in the fight against drugs. This is a national problem requiring a national solution.</P>
    <P>The recent cocaine find in County Clare reminded us of the need for constant vigilance when it comes to drugs trafficking.  As I said in the Dáil at the time, this applies equally to whether drugs are intended for the domestic market or, alternatively, are imported for transhipment elsewhere in Europe or beyond.  It is no comfort to me to think that the drugs found here might not find their way into Irish hands, because they are drugs which can damage and ruin people's lives wherever they live.</P>
    <P>In each case, it is imperative that all possible measures be taken to prevent importation.  I am determined that we will not become a soft touch for drug traffickers who may entertain notions that we are a convenient back-door to Europe.  We have an international responsibility and we take it seriously.</P>
    <P>I am aware that from time to time fears have been expressed with regard to the vulnerability of the south and south-west coastline.  This coastline is very long and has many remote piers, coves and other secluded areas.  For this reason, it has been the subject of special attention from the various law enforcement agencies concerned.  In so far as the Garda is concerned, there is a strong emphasis in the divisions along the seaboard on the problem of drug trafficking <Col N="1811" /> and the Garda has received specialised training.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer to Senator Neville's suggestion &mdash; I have already given an open mind to this &mdash; of having an aerial wing for the Garda.  At the moment, the Garda avail of the services of our Air Corps, but it is not always adequate for its needs, particularly at night when the helicopters will not go out for the Garda.  I have been examining this issue since I came into office.  It is not an issue to which any other Minister for Justice seems to have given any great deal of thought.  I currently have no proposals to make on the matter but I am examining it urgently.</P>
    <P>I know there has been some public concern about the level of co-ordination of the various law enforcement agencies in the fight against drugs.  Indeed, I have been as concerned as anyone at the claims of a lack of Garda-customs co-ordination. All the law enforcement agencies must work together with one central objective, stopping the importation of drugs.  For that reason, I very much welcome the close co-operation between the Garda and the customs in the recent finds, which is a good and positive sign that it is continuing.</P>
    <P>My Department is finalising a report on important aspects of law enforcement in relation to the drugs problem here.  The amendment calls this report the O'Donnell report.  I do not know where the tablers of the amendment got this name from &mdash; it is not necessarily the name of the report being prepared &mdash; but I expect it came from the previous Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I know he does but no report named the O'Donnell report has been published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1812" /> I intend to prepare proposals for Government based on the report as soon as possible.  The main task of the report is to identify the best arrangements for achieving a cohesive and co-ordinated response to the drug trafficking problem by the existing law enforcement agencies and the proposals will be mainly concerned with this aspect.  The report also examines the legal powers of members of the law enforcement agencies and the need for legislative changes to assist the law enforcement response. The contribution in the health and education areas in developing strategies to reduce demand for drugs is also considered. The proposals which I will bring to Government will cover these aspects.</P>
    <P>However, I would like now to comment on the question whether a national drugs enforcement agency should be established.  In this regard, I would refer Senators to what I said in the Dáil last month.  I share my predecessor's conclusion&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that the establishment of such an agency would not be appropriate to the drugs situation as it pertains in this country and for this reason, my proposals will be designed to enhance the co-operation and effectiveness of the existing law enforcement agencies.  I am certain that if Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn was still Minister for Justice, the Fianna Fáil Members of the Seanad would not be putting this amendment down because she was not in favour of a national drugs enforcement agency.  At least Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn was not in favour of it last December; she may have changed her mind since then and that is her prerogative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as the question of resources for the customs service is concerned, I am aware that a case has been made at European Union level for the provision of assistance to enable this country to equip itself better to protect the Irish sector of the Union's external frontier.  That question of resources is being dealt with in the ECOFIN Council of Ministers and I have already had discussions with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, on the issue to ensure that Ireland gets the necessary resources to allow for the removal of the borders.</P>
      <P>Drugs are smuggled into this State by sea, air and overland.  It is neither practical nor possible to search every person, package or item that comes into the State.  For this reason, intelligence-based strategies are crucial in combating the importation of drugs and in this regard, the closest international co-operation is vital if such strategies are to prove effective.  The seizures made last weekend have certainly proved that.  As Senators will know, those seizures arose from very good international intelligence.</P>
      <P>The serious implications for law enforcement which arose from the abolition of customs control on 1 January 1993 were examined in detail.  Drug traffickers do not respect borders and the ending of customs controls posed an additional and serious challenge to those charged with law enforcement.  As a response, the European Drugs Unit has been established.  The unit, which became operational during 1994, is charged with the vital mission of exchanging and co-ordinating drugs intelligence throughout the European Union.  A liaison officer from the Garda Síochána is serving with the unit.  Above all else.  intelligence is the key to stopping the importation of drugs and in this respect.  I believe that the European Drugs Unit will occupy a pivotal role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In enforcing the law, we must target not just the pusher on the street corner but also the so-called &ldquo;drug barons&rdquo; who direct things behind the scenes. The Criminal Justice Act, 1994, provides <Col N="1814" /> for the seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of crime, including drug trafficking.  I have no doubt that this legislation, brought in by my predecessor, will make a significant contribution in the fight against drugs.</P>
    <P>With regard to the implementation of the anti-money-laundering measures contained in the Act, I recently made a commencement order to bring sections 32 and 57 of the Act into operation on 2 May next.  These sections require banks and other financial bodies to carry out identification checks to prevent money-laundering and to report to the Garda Síochána where they suspect that laundering is taking place in relation to their business.  They supplement other provisions of the 1994 Act, in particular the money-laundering offence and the power to confiscate criminal proceeds and to obtain restraint orders to seize and freeze suspected criminal assets, which came into force last year.  I commend the Fianna Fáil Senators to read that part of the speech &mdash; in the Dáil last night, a Fianna Fáil Deputy implied that none of these were available to the Garda &mdash; so they will be aware what is available by way of legislation to allow the Garda to enforce these Acts.</P>
    <P>On a related point, I will shortly be putting proposals to the Government for the establishment of a national bureau of fraud investigation.  This will be a further weapon in targeting the disposal of the proceeds of crime.</P>
    <P>At the outset, I spoke about the Government's strategy to deal with drugs.  The strategy requires a threefold attack on the problem.  We must educate everyone to the dangers of drug misuse, especially those who are most at risk.  We must treat and rehabilitate those unfortunate enough to succumb to drug addiction and, of course, we must relentlessly enforce the law.</P>
    <P>Drug use cuts across all classes of society, as Senators have said, and we must educate everyone about the problem. In keeping with the recommendations in the Government strategy, an emphasis has been placed on demand <Col N="1815" /> reduction through education and prevention initiatives.  These include the substance abuse prevention programme in second level schools, which was developed by the Departments of Health and Education, a pilot project on parent education on alcohol, drugs and family communication, the launch of the Garda mobile drug prevention unit, the development of resource materials on alcohol and solvent abuse, the organisation of community-based training programmes for health and education professionals and the production of educational materials for use by both the public and professionals working in the field.</P>
    <P>At the heart of the strategy is the need to treat and rehabilitate those addicted to drugs.  I know that much has been achieved in this area in recent times.  Three satellite clinics, providing a range of services for drug misusers, have been established by the Eastern Heath Board at Baggot Street, Ballyfermot and Amiens Street.  At present, a total of 420 drug misusers are on methadone maintenance programmes at the satellite clinics and a further 190 patients receive methadone at the Drug Treatment Centre, Pearse Street.</P>
    <P>I am aware that a waiting list for the clinics has built up; it has not just built up in the last few months.  My colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, is anxious to ensure the widest possible use of these clinics and as a first step to deal with this waiting list, the Eastern Heath Board is arranging to open two of the satellite clinics for methadone maintenance in the afternoons. In addition, funding is being made available to the Eastern Health Board to enable it to open additional clinics in Dublin this year as part of the development of a comprehensive network of services.</P>
    <P>It is important to be able to treat drug misusers in their own community as far as possible.  To this end, general practitioners are being encouraged to take on responsibility for the treatment of drug misusers, including the provision <Col N="1816" /> of methadone.  At present, about 240 further patients are on methadone maintenance with general practitioners. The availability of detoxification facilities is essential.  The ten bed unit in Beaumont Hospital has been under pressure and a waiting list has developed.  Again, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, is anxious to address this situation and the Eastern Health Board will, in the near future, be commissioning a ten bed unit at Cherry Orchard Hospital.  I understand that unit will be available shortly.</P>
    <P>In the time available to me today, I have sought to deal as comprehensively as possible with the problem of drugs. In finishing let me say I have no illusions about the problem.  This is an extremely serious problem for our society to tackle.  I believe that the Government's approach, tackling all the components of the problem, is the only way to proceed.  There is no simple answer unfortunately.  For my part I can assure Senators that I will do everything within my power as Minister for Justice to see to it that the law is enforced in a strict and sustained manner and that the issue is dealt with in a comprehensive multi-agency manner in co-operation with my ministerial colleagues on both the demand and the supply side of this deadly menace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to support the motion and will have no difficulty voting for it in preference to the amendment which simply seems to specify some small area of detail.  I would want further areas of detail if I was going to be that specific.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no question about the existence of a drugs problem.  Ireland is not alone and we cannot isolate ourselves from it.  I am on record in this House as stating that it is my belief that until the economic base of the world drug problem is tackled, we will not be in a position to stabilise the situation at all.  Ultimately that means deregulation.  I strongly believe that until the market motive is removed from the main suppliers <Col N="1817" /> of drugs, such as heroin, we will be left with this problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Criminal Justice Act, 1994.  I welcome her clear commitment that sections 32 and 57 will come into operation on 2 May.  I remember that Bill going through the House.  It deals with the laundering of drug money.  May I express some surprise that there was no reference in the Minister's speech to another development which has taken place at the instigation of a person from my constituency, one of my local representatives, Deputy Gregory?  I commend Deputy Gregory's on the ground expertise to the Minister.  I hope it will be taken into account in the framing of proposals to combat the drugs war.</P>
    <P>May I place this in context by saying I have been rereading some information about the drugs problem?  I note that in 1987 the then Minister for Health totally dismissed the use of methadone maintenance programmes, free needle exchange and condoms.  On the very same day the national AIDS co-ordinator, Dr. James Walsh for whom I have the highest respect, was calling for precisely those things.  It indicates how important it is for the Minister with responsibility in this area to keep the very closest liaison with people on the ground.</P>
    <P>The proposal made by Deputy Gregory was for a co-ordinated task force.  It was not precisely the one mentioned in the debate this evening. Deputy Gregory was referring to co-ordination between the Garda, the Revenue Commissioners and the social welfare agencies.  I know of persons in my area who are involved in the heroin trade and making profits, untaxed obviously, of up to £50,000 a week.  They are also collecting social welfare and acquiring property.  The Garda know precisely who they are.  Why is there no co-ordination of information between the gardaí, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare so that these people can be isolated and those very provisions to which the Minister referred brought into operation?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1818" /> I heard Senator Mulcahy's reference to <i>The Irish Times</i> editorial.  I agree with the Minister that this problem did not start on 15 December and whatever castigation of Government is involved in this editorial extends equally to Governments over a period of some considerable number of years.  One of the points made in the editorial is that it is essential to prioritise the battle against drugs. On this basis, the periodic discoveries of cannabis, the court cases involving people caught smoking cannabis and so on are &mdash; to coin an inappropriate phrase &mdash; nothing more than a smoke screen.  If we were honest we would see that the real problem is not cannabis.  I would openly advocate in this House the legalisation of cannabis and the diversion of all the resources of the gardaí to where the real problem is and that is heroin.</P>
    <P>I live in the north inner city and I am aware of the increased levels of crime. They do not come from the smoking of hash; they come from the seriously addictive opiate, heroin.  There are people with heroin habits which cost enormous amounts of money to sustain and it is these people who are driven into crime to feed that habit.  Although the methadone maintenance programme is in existence and apparently will be expanded, it is by no means satisfactory at the moment.  If a heroin addict applies for admission to this programme and is told to wait for a year, during that year he or she will commit further aggravated assaults, burglaries, robberies and so on.  A fundamental plank of any attack on this problem should be the expansion of the methadone maintenance programme to the point where it meets the requirements of the situation.  That is not what obtains at present.</P>
    <P>There is a very serious drugs problem within the prison system.  I wonder if the Minister can do anything about this.  My information is that young offenders go into prison clean and, in the prison, are introduced to addictive drugs.  That is a serious comment on our penal system. People can go in for house breaking, larceny <Col N="1819" /> or whatever and while in prison, far from being rehabilitated, are actually put on the needle and sent out again.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows I have problem which I hope to discuss with her concerning the open female prison it is proposed to locate in Parnell Street.  I say this not because of any prejudice of my own or a NIMBY syndrome &mdash; not in my back yard &mdash; but because I have been approached by many people in my area.  These include the ordinary people from Gardiner Street and Summerhill and business people, including one businessman who was brought up in Summerhill in very poor circumstances and who has created a business.  They tell me that the net effect will be that the open prison will act as a magnet, right into the north side of the city particularly the Parnell Street area, for those trying to sell drugs to these unfortunate people.  If this institution goes ahead, I hope there will be maximum policing to prevent this occurring.  The north side of Dublin has been deprived of many institutions over the past number of years.  It comes as an unwelcome surprise that the only time we get an institution, it is something that is virtually calculated to reinforce the drugs problem that exists in this area of the city.</P>
    <P>There are several problems with regard to the importation of drugs.  One is the importation of drugs for consumption in this country and the other is the use of the country as a transit for hard drugs.  My advocacy of deregulation cannot take place in isolation.  We must get additional resources to help combat the problem of drugs in transit through this country.</P>
    <P>I return to my strong feeling that the principal problem is not cannabis.  If we spend our time talking about cannabis we are simply deluding ourselves and providing a type of cosmetic exercise which comforts people.  They feel the drug situation is under control because so many kilos of cannabis have been seized.  I do not find that particularly <Col N="1820" /> comforting because I know, and I am sure the Minister also recognises, that the real problem is not cannabis but heroin.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment to the House that she will soon put proposals to Government for the establishment of a national bureau of fraud investigation, which, she says, will be a further weapon in targeting the disposal of the proceeds of crime.  I assume and perhaps the Minister will indicate to the House that this will tackle far wider problems that just the question of the misuse of drugs and the proceeds of drug trafficking.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of serious cases in recent years where because we did not have the technical resources in this State, people were allowed to escape the consequences of their fraudulent behaviour.  There was one notorious case in recent years where somebody who had committed fraud in the Republic had to be charged in the North of Ireland.  I welcome the establishment of a national bureau of fraud investigation and I hope it will extend beyond merely the question of drugs.  I do not in any sense see drugs as anything other than a very serious problem. However, the fraud bureau should be more widely based.</P>
    <P>Regarding the composition of any task force on drugs, the nature of which I have suggested, perhaps the Minister might consider including persons such as Deputy Tony Gregory and Mr. Seanie Lambe from Sheriff Street, who has done remarkable work in the area of drugs.  These are the people on the streets who know what the problem involves.  I quote from a report on drugs which indicates quite clearly where the problem is concentrated:</P>
    <P>Those affected are mainly young people, unemployed, with poor educational needs.  They live mostly in local authority flat complexes in the inner city and suburban local authority housing estates.  Ireland's intravenous drug problem is concentrated in these areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1821" /> For this reason, it is very important to involve the people on the ground who know precisely what the situation entails.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a letter I received five years ago in which a series of points were made.  I ask the Minister how much of this has been done.  The letter was from the director of the Anna Livia Drugs Project:</P>
    <P>The problem of illicit drug use is concentrated in a small number of Dublin areas.  For this reason such resources that are available for tackling this problem should be concentrated in those same areas.  [To an extent, the Minister has already answered this.] In each Dublin area where illicit drugs use is prevalent, a community drug team should be set up. Such teams consisting of drug treatment and community health personnel, including doctors, nurses and social workers, should take direct responsibility for the local management of the drug problem within the areas in which they are located.</P>
    <P>3.  A wider range of drug treatments, including harm reduction, methadone maintenance and an expanded number of drug free therapies, need to be offered to drug users within a developed community based service.</P>
    <P>4.  A senior management position of drugs co-ordinator needs to based in the Eastern Health Board area.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil's position this evening is rather facetious, given that three months ago the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, received an excellent response from Senators on all sides regarding the fight against drugs.  At that time she mentioned the crime fighting package she had produced, which met with approval on all sides.  It is rather facetious of Senator Mulcahy to come into the House this evening and attack the Minister when there have been 13 drug seizures in the past three months.  This is probably the highest number of seizures in any three month period in the history of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The drugs problem is not confined to Dublin.  It is also a problem in rural areas.  There is not a town or village in Ireland where drugs are not available. This is why the fight against drugs must be kept going at both local and national levels.  In 1992, in County Donegal, 28 people were arrested and charged with <Col N="1823" /> drug offences.  This indicates that drugs are also a problem in rural areas.  I congratulate the Garda and customs officials on the seizures they made in the last number of weeks.  This shows that these two groups are working very well together.  I also commend the Fine Gael group for putting down this motion.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with the situation regarding the north-west coast.  This area requires increased surveillance. Seizures have been made in Dublin and Cork, but there is much concern about the north-west coast.  There is a number of large fishing ports in this area into which many foreign boats come on a regular basis.  Derry has a main commercial port and a number of major shipping and boat companies operate from there.  It is wide open in terms of drugs.</P>
    <P>Now that the peace process has come about, increased surveillance is required on the Derry-Donegal border.  A large number of major arrests have been made recently in this area in relation to drugs being brought across the Border. The owner of an establishment on the Donegal side of the Border was recently found guilty and sentenced to three years imprisonment for allowing his premises to be used for drugs.  Rave parties were held there on a regular basis. The decision of the court in that case is to be welcomed.  Anybody who went to those rave parties could tell one that drugs were openly on sale.  Ecstasy was available on a regular basis, but five or six different types of drugs were also available.  The people most prominently involved in the selling of these drugs were the paramilitaries.  They are still doing this in Northern Ireland and they continue to bring their stuff across the Border.  Many of them have made much money from drugs and they will continue to do so because it is a very lucrative business.</P>
    <P>I heard a girl on the radio a number of days ago talking about how she started on Ecstasy.  She had a child and was bored, etc.  She found that Ecstasy <Col N="1824" /> gave her a high, but it got so bad that she had to take heroin to bring herself down from it.  She said she needed to do this as it was the only way she could survive.  However, she ultimately sought help, which she discovered was available from the health authorities.  I commend the health boards on the work they do in relation to helping people with serious addiction problems.  They are very well geared for such work, but better facilities should be available. Nevertheless, the boards do an excellent job.</P>
    <P>Regarding the number of gardaí in Border areas, I emphasise the fact that the peace process is now in place.  We in County Donegal and others in Border counties intend to push strongly for the current number of gardaí to be retained. It will not cost any more to keep them there, now that the peace process has come into play.  I recently moved a motion at Donegal County Council calling for the retention of the gardaí.  I also called for increased surveillance of the Donegal coast.  The county has one of the longest coastlines in the country. Given that Donegal is so near to Northern Ireland and that ships come on a regular basis from Scotland, which is approximately ten miles from Northern Ireland, the county is wide open in terms of drugs.  We have every reason to fear what might happen along the north-west coastline.</P>
    <P>We cannot underestimate the determination of the drug barons.  They are making huge profits from human misery and we must do everything possible to meet the challenge.  I call on the Minister to once again examine the possibility of increasing the number of gardaí involved in the fight against drugs on the north-west coast.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulated the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, on her appointment for a number of reasons, not least that it was the first time a woman had taken the portfolio, and I thought a woman would bring to it qualities of compassion and toughness that it needed.  In the <Col N="1825" /> same vein I say to the Minister, Deputy Owen, that the Government took the same view in relation to the portfolio and put somebody as competent as her in the job.</P>
      <P>The drugs war is real, but the war in the House tonight is a phoney.  I do not know who dreamed up this Fianna Fáil amendment.  They can play games with what they like, but they should accept the reality on some topics.  Fianna Fáil have tabled an amendment to the motion and if the amendment is not accepted there will be a division.  Such situations bring politics into disrepute. The motion states:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann commends the security forces on their recent drugs hauls; and urges the Government to give the most urgent attention and the fullest possible resources to the implementation of an integrated attack on the drugs problem at all levels.</P>
      <P>Nobody in their sane senses would disagree with that.  How, therefore, would one amend it if one wanted to play games?  One would amend it as follows:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;hauls;&rdquo;, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and calls on the Government to</P>
      <P>(a)  provide adequate resources to the Garda, the Navy and the Customs and Excise;</P>
      <P>(b)  publish the O'Donnell report regarding the co-ordination of the aforementioned authorities;</P>
      <P>(c)  establish a National Drugs Enforcement Agency; and</P>
      <P>(d)  highlight the horrendous drug trafficking problem in this country at European Union level, with a view to securing European funding to help combat this problem.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil now has a problem.  The financial strategy of the budget was laid <Col N="1826" /> out by Fianna Fáil and Labour and was handed on to this Administration.  The allocations to the Army, Navy and Garda were laid down by the Fianna Fáil and Labour coalition Government. In that sense this is a phoney amendment.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil and everybody else have a duty to raise the issue of the drugs problem and nobody should take it easy on the Government or on Ministers. However, if this is forced to a vote it will demonstrate the salient fact that games which should not be played in this House are being played.  My colleagues in Fianna Fáil, with whom I served with honour and dignity and they with me, would want to reconsider their tactic on this issue.</P>
    <P>I listened with attention to Senator Mulcahy and, quite frankly, his was a mealy-mouthed contribution.  In essence, he wanted the Minister in only three months to build more ships, set up a coastguard, expand the Army and Navy and develop the Air Corps.  I thought Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn a good operator, but not even she could tackle all those problems in the timescale Senator Mulcahy demands of the Minister, Deputy Owen.  In that sense we have another part of the phoney battle that Senator Mulcahy, in particular, waged.  Senator Wright and others put forward reasonable points and the Minister responded reasonably.  Senator Mulcahy finished every remark by asking &ldquo;What have you done about that?&rdquo;. If that is not phoney and playing games, what is?</P>
    <P>We live on an island; we are surrounded by water.  It is, therefore, a haven for every ship that passes.  I remember an Appledore report on Verolme Dockyard which said that about 28,000 ships a year passed off the Cork coast.  Can one imagine the number of ships that pass off the entire coast? Apparently, the Minister is supposed to spot every single one and check them for drugs.  It is a nonsense.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1827" /> There is, of course, a serious drug problem &mdash; deadly serious in Dublin &mdash; but the country is not awash with drugs. I was looking at statistics from the 1992 Garda Síochána report on crime &mdash; I do not know if there are more up to date figures &mdash; and they gave a total of 3,494 persons charged in 1992, and of that number 2,643 were charged with the possession of cannabis resin.  I do not wish to portray a liberal attitude to any drug, hard or soft, but the problem should be put in context.  A total of 91 people were charged with possession of heroin in 1992.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I would take issue with the suggestion that my colleagues and I would play games on this matter.  I take umbrage at the suggestion.  The drug problem is huge and we have had it for the last 20 years.  Previous Administrations have tackled it, especially in the early 1980s, when the problem was very serious in the Dublin area and we thought we had confronted the problem.  However, <Col N="1828" /> there is no confidence in that among the public.  As a teacher, I speak to parents, and other teachers and they express great concern about the abuse of illegal and unacceptable drugs.  They are looking for support and ways to stamp out this problem.</P>
    <P>It is perceived that there is a laid back approach to the drugs problem, particularly with the seizures of the last couple of weeks, which created unrest in themselves.  We are not playing games. There is a real lack of confidence in the present Administration as to what the policy is.  What has been happening?  I can understand that the Minister has had to follow a very successful previous Minister, but we do not have time for transitions.  We have to get to work on the problem, although I know the Minister is overshadowed by her predecessor. However, I do not hold that against her.</P>

      <P>The Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984, state that possession of a controlled drug is a primary offence, but it has not stopped the flood of drugs into the country or prevented thousands of young people becoming addicts.  It is time for a new policy to attack the evil of drugs.  The use of controlled drugs must be made a criminal offence.  We are aware of the knock-on effects of drugs since much of our crime is drug related as addicts steal and assault to feed their habit.  I am aware of the effect of drugs on users and their families.  It may be a cliché but it cannot be said often enough &mdash; drugs destroy lives.  They eat at the fabric of our community. I ask the Minister to review this legislation and criminalise the taking of drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The hauls of cannabis and Ecstasy indicate how vulnerable Ireland is to drug barons and how exposed is our coastline.  We must take measures in that regard; I recognise that the Minister referred to our coastline in her speech.  These hauls highlight the need for new legislative measures and powers of enforcement to ensure that this country is equipped to effectively combat the menace of drugs.  In the past we saw <Col N="1830" /> drug barons use the profits from their crimes to keep them and their families in the lap of luxury far removed from the abject misery of their victims.</P>
    <P>A response is needed at international, national and community levels.  The Government, the Departments of Education and Health, the community agencies, families and schools have a mutual responsibility in the area of drug prevention. We all have a role to play but the Government must take full responsibility and tackle this huge problem.  I recommend a national agency which would bring about an integrated approach.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House; I do not doubt her sincerity in this matter.  In commending the security forces on the drugs haul, we must be conscious that the weekend seizure represents only the tip of the drug iceberg which threatens to swamp our towns and cities.  We faced a drugs epidemic in the 1980s and we must step up our efforts to stop drug imports.</P>
      <P>We must also bear in mind that drug barons would go out of business if there was no demand for drugs.  Until we tackle the cause of drug abuse, our security forces will continue to divert resources to fighting drug smuggling. We will never be able to intercept all drugs because profit is a powerful motivator and drug barons will continue to invent new drugs and ways of smuggling them into the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an urgent need for an integrated approach which would break the vicious cycle of poverty, crime and drugs.  Last year the drug treatment centre indicated that 80 per cent of drug abusers seen at the centre were unemployed and lacked any formal qualifications. We have always argued for a preventative rather than a fire brigade approach to the problem of drug abuse <Col N="1831" /> and drug related crime.  In order to be effective, preventative measures must be taken at the lowest level.  In this regard, I welcome the Government's community based approach reflected not only in the community drugs team but also in the Government programme commitment to the extension of community policing.</P>
    <P>Recently I attended a meeting in my local town in north Cork where I saw the need for an integrated approach involving gardaí, parents and teachers. Perhaps there could be a pilot scheme in an area.  People in towns and villages are conscious of this problem and want to do something about it.  Given the high incidence of drug related crime, drug users should not be released from prison without being provided with the necessary treatment or being put in contact with a methadone maintenance programme.</P>
    <P>The security forces are doing an outstanding job in combating drug smugglers with few resources, but I am aware of cases where officers were pulled from drug squads to serve in other areas. There could be increased co-operation between the Garda and customs officials; there is evidence of such co-operation in my county and it has been very effective.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt the Minister's commitment to remove drugs from Ireland will benefit families who suffer because a family member is a drug addict.  I was delighted the Minister referred to the Departments of Health, Justice and Education.  A prepared programme for secondary schools and third level institutions should be implemented by the Department of Justice. We must start the battle in our schools. While it is easy to say that we must remove the drug barons, we must make each child aware of the torment they will cause their families if they become a drug addict.</P>

    <P>I hope the Minister will implement an educational programme.  We must educate our children on the dangers of <Col N="1832" /> drugs and ensure that teachers and gardaí in small rural towns and villages are made aware of the drugs scene.  That can only be done through an educational programme, which will take more than the three months Members spoke about.  The Minister's commitment to remove drugs from Ireland will benefit family life in Ireland.</P>

      <P>The Minister seems to have become very fond of the House.  I congratulate those involved in the successful drugs find.  I congratulate the Minister on her speech tonight, which impressed me.</P>
      <P>I will concentrate on inter-agency co-operation.  In the best management of a business, there is always concern about co-operation.  It appears that co-operation is needed between three different agencies: the National Drugs Administration Office reports to the Department of Justice, the national customs drug office reports to the Department of Finance, while the Defence Forces report to the Department of Defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the need for co-ordination between the various law enforcement agencies.  She said the main task of the report is to identify the best arrangements for achieving a cohesive and co-ordinated response to the drug trafficking problems.  Because of the need for fewer customs officers as a result of the integrated Europe, a drugs unit was set up within the customs service.  A sensible solution was found by putting surplus officers to work in the drugs area.  Because of their background and training, the main aim of customs officers is through stop contraband coming in to our ports and to seize these goods.  Their main aims, traditions and, perhaps, promotional opportunities are based to a very large extent on how successful they are at this.  The main aim of the Garda and other law enforcement agencies &mdash; it was interesting to hear many speakers talk about the objective of trying to apprehend drug barons &mdash; is not necessarily to stop drugs at ports but <Col N="1833" /> to follow them so that the drug barons can be found.</P>
    <P>On occasions there may well be a difference of emphasis between the different agencies.  The Minister has recognised this and has talked about why she and the previous Minister, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, did not believe that a national drugs enforcement agency was likely to be the correct direction in which to go.  Therefore, it is suggested that the solution lies in the effectiveness of the existing law agencies and the Minister is going to come up with that solution.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister not to fudge this by trying to please all parties.  The big danger is if we make sure that those reporting to the Departments of Finance, Justice and Defence are all happy. It is happened on occasions in the past that there have been almost fudged solutions in the form of committees and rotating chairmanships.  The solution has to be in reporting to the Department of Justice.  This Department must be in charge of the matter.  A solution has to be found which will make sure that all the agencies are co-ordinated under one heading with one objective, and that objective should be the effectiveness of the law enforcement agencies. I urge the Minister, when looking for a solution, to aim in that direction rather than fudge the issue in some other way.</P>
    <P>I am encouraged by the Minister's recent comments on the bail laws, which I believe were correct.  I mentioned this issue a few weeks before the Minister raised it.  A change in our bail laws will require a referendum.  This will present problems and will not be an easy solution. I urge the Minister to continue to strive to find that solution and present it to us so that we as a nation will have to make a decision.  Drug barons are released on bail because we do not have bail laws which are able to incarcerate them when we have enough apparent evidence to hold them.  We should, therefore, make sure we have the correct constitutional changes to enable us to incarcerate them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1834" /> I urge the Minister to take into account the points I raised about cooperation between agencies and about the bail laws and to continue on the road she has already taken.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion. The Garda and the customs service must be complimented on the work they have done in recent weeks, in particular the seizure of many of the drugs coming into the country.  I welcome the Minister and commend her on her speech.</P>
      <P>I believe the Fianna Fáil amendment is redundant.  The Minister stated that the Garda drugs squad is fully supported by the Government and it has active units thoughout Dublin city and the rest of the country.  The situation is constantly being monitored and reviewed.  It is evident from the Minister's speech that she and Government fully recognise the seriousness of the drugs problem and its effect on communities and society and, in particular, on the families concerned.  Families in which there are drug addicts experience huge problems.  I welcome the Minister's commencement order to bring sections 32 and 57 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, into operation on 2 May next.  This is extremely important and the Minister must be commended for acting so quickly on this.</P>
      <P>The drugs barons, who arrange the supply of drugs, are a major source of the problem.  If they can be hindered and arrested and their properties and moneys confiscated, the Minister will be making a very serious effort to deal with the problem.  I welcome that she will shortly propose to the Government the establishment of a national bureau of fraud investigation.  She has been considering this since her appointment and I look forward to her announcement on the details of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1835" /> A number of aspects need additional consideration.  I was delighted that at the weekend the Taoiseach made an announcement that the Government will seek from the EU the establishment of a European coastguard to monitor our coast.  This was mooted over six or seven years ago.  Fianna Fáil was in Government for this period.  What did it do about the issue at European level? The Government should make a strong case for this coastguard to be based in Ireland because of our extensive coastline. The variety of inlets, bays and coves around our entire coast need very close monitoring.</P>
    <P>The Minister is actively considering an aerial wing for the Garda and there is merit in this.  The Navy has acted very well in many areas and can do more. This is a matter for the Minister for Defence to consider.</P>
    <P>Our fishermen should be encouraged to be on the alert for any unusual boating or shipping activities in their areas. A skipper from Carrigaholt, County Clare, Mr Joe Asten, was some years ago of great assistance in detecting a major drugs haul on a boat off the coast of south-west Clare and west Kerry. Skippers should be complimented for the work they quietly do along our coastline.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the European drugs unit is important because the abolition of customs posts in 1993 resulted in a major breakdown in the system.  Drug barons and traffickers do not appreciate any type of boundaries. The establishment of this unit and Garda involvement in it are extremely important.  With Interpol it can work very effectively towards overcoming the drugs problem.</P>
    <P>In view of what the Minister has said, the Opposition amendment is redundant. It calls on the Government to &ldquo;provide adequate resources to the Garda, the Navy and the Customs and Excise&rdquo;.  The Government is doing this. The amendment calls on the Government to &ldquo;publish the O'Donnell report regarding the co-ordination of the <Col N="1836" /> aforementioned authorities&rdquo;.  A report is being prepared in the Minister's Department.  She has clearly explained to the House that Fianna Fáil in Government up to three months ago did not agree with the establishment of a national drugs enforcement agency.  The previous Minister felt that was not the right approach to take.  Fianna Fáil should look at their own policy if they proceed in pushing this amendment. The Opposition should withdraw their amendment because it is redundant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister, the Garda and the Customs and Excise on their recent success.  The Garda has had a very good run of successes in recent times; long may it continue.</P>
      <P>With regard to the treatment of drug misusers, I know there are different views on the methadone treatment, but I have seen heroin addicts being weaned off the drug by methadone. When I spoke here in January on the health aspect of this, there were three satellite clinics which have not been increased since.  Over 100 people per day attend these clinics and I think it is unreasonable to ask the clinics in Amiens Street, Baggot Street and Ballyfermot to look after the problem for all of Dublin.  Each catchment area should look after its own drug misusers.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to use her influence with the public.  Our problem in the Eastern Health Board is not finance &mdash; as the Minister said, the finance is available &mdash; but to get the public to accept these clinics in their areas.  I hope that this debate will help to educate the public that it is very important for local clinics to be set up to deal with people who have this problem.  When people are treated with methadone in these clinics, it is possible under the new Protocol for their own GPs to carry on the good work.  It is essential that we have two extra satellite clinics.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>For the past 20 years the abuse of drugs and drink has been a concern of mine.  I believe that 70 per cent of our social problems are as a result of the abuse of those two demons. We have reached the stage where we have no go areas in this city; an ambassador's wife was mugged recently. That is very bad for tourism and for the country.</P>
      <P>I played golf recently with a detective sergeant who said to me that if every man in the force was taken off road traffic duties and so on and put to work on crime for 12 months, much of the crime would be reduced.  Previous Ministers appointed traffic wardens and civilians to Garda barracks in order to have more gardaí on the beat, but the criminals are keeping ahead of the posse.  Something drastic must be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There should be compulsory Army service for juvenile offenders and homeless youth &mdash; not to punish them but to train them and teach them respect.  We have an excellent Army which is well capable of doing that.  It would not cost us any extra money.  If those young hooligans were put into the Army for two years they would get some training, education and, above all, discipline. Unfortunately, since the do-gooder society began, we have done away with two very important words &mdash; discipline and respect.  When there is no discipline or respect; there is anarchy.  We are now reaching the stage of survival of the fittest and a tribe mentality.  Old people are being robbed for drugs and drink.  In this city old people cannot go up to communion without bringing their bags with them and they are still liable to be robbed going up or down the aisle.  We <Col N="1838" /> must do something serious about this situation.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris referred to drugs in prisons, which is true.  If we cannot keep drugs out of prisons, how can we keep them out of Ireland?  According to the media, university students are making money by selling drugs.  If university standards are dropping to this degree and if this is what students are learning there, it is not a very good training in entrepreneurship.</P>

      <P>Maybe I should not have, but my message was understood.  Have we lost control of our schools?  Teenagers who go to discos tell me that they know exactly where to get drugs, it is not a big secret.  Why is the Garda not able to catch the criminals who are selling drugs?  They tell me that they do not want to catch the small operators but the godfathers.  However, if the market is cut at that point and enough of the small operators are removed, the big operators will soon be caught.  They should start at the easiest point rather than the most difficult one.  That would do a great deal to put an end to the drug problem.</P>
      <P>We have created a drug culture, because everybody who goes to see a doctor gets a handful of drugs.  I have constantly warned people that that is the most dangerous thing that they could do, because many people are now becoming immune to drugs.  I had a fairly serious accident and I was discharged after ten days.  I was told that I had good healing powers, but I never took drugs in my life and I would not take an aspirin unless I was reeling with a pain in my head.</P>

      <P>This drug culture is costing the country millions of pounds.  I do not doubt that many of those drugs are being mixed with illegal drugs such as cocaine in order to make them more plentiful.</P>
      <P>I know that there is no quick answer to combating this problem but it is sad that this whole culture has been created in 25 years.  Why has it happened? Those who went before us had a good system which we tried to improve.  We took discipline out of schools and now a teacher cannot look at a child; the teachers are now suffering from depression and fatigue.</P>
      <P>The Minister should consider community policing.  It would not cost a great deal of money and county councils could levy a service charge to make it self-financing.  I believe that people living in towns and business people would gladly pay £50 or £100 a year.  Towns should be patrolled from 2 a.m.  until 6 a.m.  because the majority of crimes are committed between those hours.</P>

      <P>I will deal with them.  I commend the Minister on her contribution. It is quite clear from the positive aspect and the detail of her speech that she is taking this issue very seriously. She has initiated a programme which is designed to counteract and deal with the problem and reduce the escalation in the level of drug abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with Senator Mulcahy that the motion smacks of complacency. It is a very serious motion; and for the main Government party to urge the Government &ldquo;to give the most urgent attention and the fullest possible resources to the implementation of an integrated attack on the drugs problem at all levels&rdquo; is a very serious approach to ensure that the issue is dealt with <Col N="1840" /> seriously and that we support our Minister in obtaining all the resources she needs to tackle this problem.  One must be conscious of the tensions within the Cabinet for resources from all sides. However, we support the Minister on this issue and are happy with her intentions as outlined in her speech.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy referred to the waiting lists and the difficulties in the Dublin area.  This problem was comprehensively addressed in the House on 25 January 1995 by the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, when he outlined in specific detail the steps he was undertaking and those which he proposed to undertake.  I, therefore, refer the Senator to the Minister's contribution on that date and he will find that some of the Minister's proposals were implemented in early February 1995. Measures will continue to be implemented to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle made a good point when he said it is important that the communities concerned accept that this issue must be addressed, that the relevant clinics must be established to deal with the problem and that these communities should see this as a positive development rather than as a negative reflection on them.</P>
    <P>The first part of the amendment calls on the Government to &ldquo;provide adequate resources to the Garda, the Navy, and the Customs and Excise&rdquo;.

      <P>Regarding the call for the establishment of a drug enforcement agency, no western European country has followed the example of the USA in establishing such an agency.  In this instance we must not ape the Americans because they have failed dismally in this area.  The whole issue of drug abuse is a very serious problem in the USA and it has not been tackled.  Given the existence of a national police force and a national customs service, the likely effect of introducing a special drug enforcement agency would be to complicate and fragment the response of the authorities to drug enforcement rather than uniting it, and such an agency <Col N="1842" /> would not solve the problem.

      <P>I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Allen, for taking this Adjournment Matter on the need for the Minister for Education to outline the action she intends to take on foot of the report on the code of practice for safety at sports arenas, 1991, and the concern of all sporting organisations at this inaction. Many sporting bodies are aware that legislation governing arenas and their use by fans or spectators is urgently needed.  Public liability insurance is now a major problem for many sporting and charitable organisations. Many sporting bodies are investing funds in their stadia.  There is an urgent need for legislation to cover the code of practice for safety at sports arenas, including entrances, exits, barriers, etc.  Charitable organisations are now unable to hold functions at many venues due to the cost of public liability insurance.  These fund raising events are in many cases the sole providers of funding for such charitable bodies.  I ask that urgent attention be given to the implementation of legislation to cover such problems and that the code of practice for safety at sports arenas be used as the basis for same.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Senator for raising this important matter which is of serious concern to me.  Indeed, on the morning of the soccer match against England in Lansdowne Road I told the Dáil that <Col N="1844" /> one of my priorities as Minister for Sport is to publish the code of practice on safety at sportsgrounds.  It is vital that supporters and spectators can attend sporting fixtures without fear of injury of mishap.</P>
      <P>After the Lansdowne Road incident I visited a number of football grounds in England and examined at first hand the various security and crowd safety measures in operation there.  Thankfully, the trouble caused by football hooligans in England does not happen here in Ireland.  Such disgraceful behaviour is alien to our culture and to our sport.  However, the experience and insights I gained in England are proving to be of enormous benefit to me in finalising the code of practice.</P>
      <P>Mr. Justice Finlay's report on the incident in Lansdowne Road on 15 February, which was published yesterday, also provides very valuable information and guidance in this important area.  As the Senator knows, the Hamilton committee, which was set up after the Hillsborough stadium disaster, made a number of varied recommendations.  Among the recommendations was that a code of practice for safety at sportsgrounds should be prepared.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education is designated as the Department responsible for the preparation of the code of practice for safety at sportsgrounds.  The working party appointed to prepare the code also prepared a code of practice for safety at outdoor pop concerts and other outdoor musical events as it was felt that this aspect of crowd control merited consideration in a separate code of practice.  In preparing the codes extensive consultation took place with the major sporting organisations, such as the GAA, the Football Association of Ireland, concert promoters, local authorities, health boards, voluntary health organisations, the Garda Síochána and Government Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The safety of the public in places of assembly is the responsibility of those who organise the event or who administer the ground or venue in which it is held.  This arises from the common law <Col N="1845" /> duty of care by those in charge of the venue to the patrons who pay to attend the event.  It is the joint responsibility of the ground owner and the promoter of the event to ensure that the standards and requirements for safety of the public are strictly observed before, during and after the event.</P>
    <P>The codes are voluntary and are an aid to professional judgment and common sense, not a substitute.  The codes do not attempt to provide a universal standard but set out achievable standards. Although some of the safety standards are likely to apply to all sports grounds irrespective of the number of spectators present, it is nevertheless important to relate them to the needs of each individual ground.</P>
    <P>The codes will apply to all grounds with a holding capacity of 20,000 spectators or more.  Management of grounds at this level will be expected to comply with all the guidelines contained in the codes.  Where grounds do not meet these guidelines it is expected that measures should be taken within a reasonable timescale to remedy safety defects.  In grounds of lesser capacity, ground management should apply the relevant criteria contained in the code to ensure safety at the ground, enlisting professional expertise where necessary.</P>
    <P>Many of the recommendations contained in the Hamilton report have already been put into effect by the relevant authorities.  However, many of them have not yet been implemented. I hope that the code of practice, when published, will encompass the recommendations that have not been implemented and that these recommendations will be of enormous benefit to sports organisations, to owners of stadia and to groups arranging sporting and other events.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the Senator shares my concern that genuine Irish sports fans and their children should be able to enjoy sport in comfort and in safety. The codes of practice will go a long way to ensure the comfort and safety of spectators.  It is my intention that these codes will be published in the very near <Col N="1846" /> future.  They will be circulated widely to sports organisations, to management authorities of stadia and to organisers of events.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Matters. - Legal Action Against British Nuclear Fuels Limited.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and thank him for rushing here.  As the Minister and the House alike know, Sellafield is a time bomb which has been ticking away for a generation less than 60 miles from our coastline.  The claims by the British authorities, particularly BNFL, that Sellafield is safe are not credible.  As Windscale, that site saw one of the most potentially devastating of all nuclear events in peacetime.  That event was kept secret and was the subject of lies and deceit.  It has its effects on both sides of the Irish Sea.  We know of an unexplained series of clusters of Down's Syndrome children born in Louth and of the incidence of leukaemia in Cumbria.</P>
      <P>BNFL and the British authorities may well claim there is no provable connection between the incident and these events.  As we all know, that is a deception which ignores the considerable and compelling body of circumstantial evidence and a growing body of scientific evidence and opinion.  Since the plant has opened it has turned the Irish Sea into a radioactive cesspit.</P>
      <P>The coastal counties of Wicklow, Louth, Dublin, Down and Antrim have all borne witness from time to time to the effects of that cesspit on fish life. Fish abnormalities are regularly found. In <i>The Irish Times</i> today Dr. Reville of UCC suggests that since the THORP plant came on stream, the radioactive dosage for heavy consumers of fish taken from the Irish Sea has increased by a factor of three.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in the coastal counties, in particular the people of Wicklow, are aware of other human tragedies which have been less well documented.  There have been inexplicable clusters of children born with limb defects.  In the last week a <Col N="1847" /> British national newspaper carried photographs of limb defects in Russia similar to those which have occurred in Wicklow.  The newspaper attributed all the defects in Russia to problems in nuclear stations.  The limb defects in Wicklow have been in no way connected to genetic factors or pre-natal accidents; there seems to be no environmental explanation other than Sellafield.  In recent times there has been an alarming and equally unexplained incidence of cancers.  There have been clusters of breast cancer in small areas in the county which cannot be explained by environmental factors.  Concern has also been expressed about cancers in children.</P>
    <P>We cannot be happy with the record of British Nuclear Fuels.  Its THORP plant has become a nuclear dumping ground for the world and the Irish Sea is the main access route serving it.  All Irish Governments have to date been unduly cautious in this matter.  Actions which have been taken at official level can at best be described as limp-wristed and ineffective.  We have been fearful of the wrath of Downing Street, Westminster and Whitehall.  It is time to put this conservative attitude behind us.</P>
    <P>Now, through the courageous action of four private citizens in Louth, a doorway has been opened in the wall of obfuscation which has surrounded the death factory of THORP at Sellafield. I call on the Minister of State and the Government to join the private action taken by those citizens, to fund it and take it further.  I also call on the coastal local authorities north and south, including my local authority, and on Welsh, Scottish and English local authorities to join separately and collectively in the action.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will not tell us he is having the legal case re-assessed.  I hope he will not say yet another Attorney-General will be taking yet more legal advice on this issue.  I hope we will not be told that that great Irish panacea, another task force, will be called into play.  On this issue we in <Col N="1848" /> Ireland are alone.  EU states with nuclear installations will not rock the boat.  The British authorities will not move on this issue.  We know British Governments have ignored our entreaties and diplomatic urgings on this matter.</P>
    <P>Now is the time for the Government to put its money where its mouth is and become involved in this action.  If.  as was suggested last night in the Dáil, the State stands back and waits until this matter goes through the Supreme Court as a private action, it would be an unpardonable act of betrayal, not only of the people of Ireland but of a few private citizens who have bravely taken on the might of the British establishment. The Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, has shown courage in the past and has more than a passing interest in this issue.  I look for action from him tonight.</P>

      <P>It was those dreadful Fianna Fáil people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not that dreadful. Over the years successive Irish Governments have shared a general national concern about nuclear power installations at Sellafield, the continuation and expansion of spent fuel reprocessing facilities on the site, including THORP, discharges of radioactive waste into the marine environment and shipments of radioactive materials through the Irish Sea.  It has been argued that the only way to resolve Irish concerns about Sellafield is to close the plant.  These views have repeatedly been conveyed to the UK Government, but <Col N="1849" /> to no avail.  As a result the Government has decided that something more positive needs to be done to tackle the problems of Sellafield, particularly the threat of pollution and its effect on the health and safety of the Irish public.</P>
      <P>The Government considers the THORP reprocessing plant, which began operations last year, represents an additional and unnecessary risk to the health and safety of the Irish population. When THORP was originally given the planning go-ahead in 1977, nuclear power was still believed to have a prosperous future and reprocessing was thought to be a key factor in the uranium fuel cycle.  Today the arguments for reprocessing are not convincing. The anticipated expansion of nuclear power has not materialised and the plutonium and uranium recovered from spent fuel are no longer required for reasons of economy or security of supply.  Indeed, they are adding unnecessarily to the huge stockpile of nuclear materials which exists worldwide and which is considered by some countries, including Ireland, to be a major security and political problem.</P>
      <P>During 1993 many requests were made to the UK authorities from Ireland and other EU member states to hold a public inquiry into THORP and to have an environmental impact assessment undertaken, but these requests were refused by the UK Government. The decision of the High Court, which established the jurisdiction of the Irish courts to hear the substantive case brought by a group of Dundalk residents against British Nuclear Fuels against THORP, is therefore welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The four plaintiffs from Dundalk are seeking an injunction to restrain operations at the THORP plant on the basis that they maintain it has not fully complied with the EU Directive on environmental impact assessment and also the justification principle under Euratom legislation.  Ireland and the Attorney General have been named by the plaintiffs as co-defendants in the proceedings, on the basis that in their view the State should have intervened to <Col N="1850" /> ensure that EU legislation was fully complied with before the plant went into operation.</P>
    <P>On 22 March 1994, Mr. Justice Carney made an order allowing the plaintiffs to serve a plenary summons outside the jurisdiction on British Nuclear Fuels Limited.  Counsel for BNFL applied to the High Court on 8 December 1994 to have the company discharged from the proceedings.  They put forward a motion seeking to set aside the earlier court order of 22 March 1994 allowing service outside this jurisdiction.  The application of BNFL was heard in the High Court by Mr. Justice O'Hanlon over six days from 9 &mdash; 20 December 1994.  Although Ireland and the Attorney General are named as co-defendants in the substantive case taken by the Dundalk residents, the Government in fact also resisted British Nuclear Fuel's application to have an order allowing service of the summons out of the State set aside.  This is a clear illustration of the Government's commitment to do all in its power to eliminate the threat posed by Sellafield and THORP.</P>
    <P>In his judgment, Mr. Justice O'Hanlon concluded that the original order made by Justice Carney giving leave to serve out of the jurisdiction was validly made and he therefore refused the application to set aside the order giving such leave.  It is understood that BNFL are likely to appeal the judgment to the Supreme Court.  The Attorney General's Office is examining the judgment and will advise my Department on its implications and the further action required on our part.</P>
    <P>There have been many requests that the plaintiffs should be indemnified by the State in respect of their costs of pursuing the proceedings.  It was indicated, in response to two parliamentary questions on 24 January, that it was considered appropriate in the circumstances to await the outcome of the case taken by British Nuclear Fuels before reaching a decision one way or the other upon that request.  The Attorney General's Office will now consider that matter further, but if BNFL appeal to the <Col N="1851" /> Supreme Court, the Attorney General will await that judgment before reaching a decision.  Senators can be assured that in the event of an appeal by British Nuclear Fuels to the Supreme Court, I will instruct the Attorney General and the Chief State Solicitor to strongly resist such an application, as we did in the High Court case.</P>
    <P>It is clear that there is widespread opposition in this country to all operations at Sellafield.  The Government is committed to taking all possible action open to it to secure the objective of the eventual closure of the plant.  Such action includes the possibility of taking a legal action if a sustainable case can be shown to exist, based on sufficient evidence.</P>
    <P>The Government's policy agreement, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> sets out a series of actions which the Government will pursue in relation to Sellafield.  My Department has therefore drawn up a blueprint to implement the various commitments on Sellafield and the Irish Sea, including a reassessment of the legal possibilities of taking a court case against Sellafield and the question of requesting arbitration on THORP's radioactive discharges into the Irish Sea under the Paris Convention on Marine <Col N="1852" /> Pollution.  I have asked the Attorney General to advise me as a matter of urgency on these matters.  The blueprint for action on Sellafield is also being studied by my colleagues, the Minister for the Environment and the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, and I expect the inaugural meeting of a task force of Ministers and official experts to take place shortly.  The aim of this task force will be to develop a concerted strategy for implementing the Government's proposals on Sellafield. This is the first comprehensive initiative taken by any Government to date to deal with the problems of Sellafield and it illustrates the Government's serious intent to tackle an issue that is of major concern to the Irish people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief.  I thank the Minister.  The Government he refers to in his speech was in fact the previous Government and I welcome that.  I suggest to him that the task force is probably not the way to go, but I know that this Minister has commitment and energy in this matter and I look forward to action on it.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.55 p.m. until 10.30 a.m.  on Thursday, 6 April 1995.</P>
