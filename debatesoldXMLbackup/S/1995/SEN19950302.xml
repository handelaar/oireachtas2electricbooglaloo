      <P>I have received notice from Senator Ross that, on the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine to outline the up-to-date position regarding the proposed marina for Greystones, County Wicklow.</P>
      <P>I have received notice from Senator McGennis of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to make a statement regarding the inability of a child (details supplied) to secure a place in a special school for the past year and a half; the action she intends to take to ensure that this child's right to education, as provided for in the Constitution, is provided.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to immediately grant funding to Limerick County Council to alleviate the disasterous situation of the regional and county roads.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator O'Toole of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="378" /> The need for the Minister for Education to make provision from the post-primary building budget to support Cáirde Colaiste Ide, in Dingle in their proposal to retain Coláiste Íde in operation as an all-Irish girls boarding school.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have today selected Senators Ross's and McGennis's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Items 9 and 10; Item 9 until 1 o'clock, with the same time arrangements as were agreed yesterday at the beginning of that debate; Item 10 will commence at 2 o'clock until 4 o'clock; there will be a sos.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition courteously indicated that he would be seeking to have all Stages of Item 9 debated today.  He may have seen sense in the meantime but if he is making that proposal, I will have to oppose it for a number of reasons.  First, the business was agreed last week.  I said last week on the floor of the House that we would debate this on Wednesday evening and Thursday morning.  That was agreed and arrangements were made accordingly and I do not think we should break agreements easily.  Second, it is a bad principle that all Stages of a Bill be taken on the same day.  The Members opposite would be vociferous in opposing any attempt by the Government to put all Stages of a Bill through on the same day, so I oppose that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to meet the Opposition half-way on this issue.  I accepted the urgency of the Bill and have made more accommodation than is normal in dealing with Private Members' Bills.  I suggest we meet next Wednesday at 10.30 a.m.  The only other business that day, apart from the motion setting up the <Col N="379" /> new committees, which need not take long, and the Independent Group's Private Members' time, will be the completion of the Arterial Drainage (Amendment) Bill.  The Whips could meet to see if arrangements could be worked out.  I make that proposal to meet the Opposition's sense of urgency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the principle that no Bill will be passed in one day.  I am sure the Leader would, in future, want me to accept that no Bill will be brought to the House to be passed in one day.</P>
      <P>He has recognised the urgency of this problem by the fact that he provided two weeks to debate this issue.  We, and those who represent the areas affected, are extremely keen that this Bill will be dealt with.  Can I take it that the Leader agrees the Bill will be passed next Wednesday?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>For clarification, subject to agreement between the Whips, the Bill will be completed next Wednesday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>Today we will have statements on the reform of the Seanad.  I know the Leader is committed to reform of the House, as I was as Leader. One of the reforms we spoke about over the years was of having topical debates on Thursday, making the House more relevent to the needs of everyday politics. Surely, flexibility would be part of that.  That is why we, in so far as this <Col N="380" /> problem is so urgent at the moment, felt that it should be dealt with as soon as possible.  However, in the light of what the Leader said, I agree that the Bill will be completed next Wednesday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am much relieved to hear that because I was concerned that the House would be pulling itself apart. I have been pushing hard to get agreement that the Bill would be concluded next Wednesday.  I support the Bill.  Traditionally Independent Members have been opposed to putting Bills through in one day except in the most urgent cases. The Whips can agree to conclude the Bill next Wednesday, whether it passes or not.  To enable the Government to give a fair response and in light of the Whips' agreement of last week that the Bill would be dealt with yesterday and today, I am delighted the matter can be handled in this way.</P>
      <P>I am happy with the business as ordered.  Having agreed last week how to tackle the matter, I felt trying to push the Bill through today would cause problems.  The Leader has shown he is taking Seanad reform seriously, first by having an early debate on this matter and second by ensuring a Private Members' Bill can be dealt with and concluded in this House next Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Finally, on a point of information, it was the founder of the main party on the other side of the House who proposed draining the Shannon over 70 years ago.  Had he done so, we would not have this problem today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Toole obviously has a problem with where he is located.  It is desirable that what the Whips agree should be the business of the House.  Irrespective of that it is the House which decides these matters. Having said that, it would be reasonable in the circumstances to conclude this matter next week and make adequate time available for that purpose.  The amendment to the Order of Business, which was not moved, did not state the Bill would be finished today.  From that viewpoint it would be possible to support the amendment.  The business itself is quite in order.  I will leave it to my colleague, Senator Honan, to speak about the Bill our party has before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I again ask the Leader for a full debate on the VHI.  I raised this matter yesterday and he suggested it was suitable for an Adjournment debate.  However, there is a broader dimension to the VHI question.  Given the proposed increase in subscription charges, the decreased tax concession and the new regulations which will be introduced governing other insurance companies, we should debate the issue. I ask the Leader to afford that opportunity to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I noted the Leader's reply yesterday to the query on Item 13, the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill, 1995.  I am surprised details of the proposed legislation are not available, because according to newspaper reports a Bill has been prepared.  If we have not seen the Government Bill by next week, I give notice that we will proceed with our Bill and expect the same consideration to be given to it as to the Fianna Fáil Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I second what my colleague, Senator Honan, has said.  I will firmly support her in moving this Bill next week if matters have not advanced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="382" /> I welcome the placing on the Order Paper of Messages from the Dáil on the establishment of committees.  We on this side of the House particularly appreciate the increase in Seanad representation on the new Foreign Affairs Committee from five Senators, which was extremely small and injurious to the reputation of the House, to double that, ten Senators.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the agreement on the procedures pertaining to the Arterial Drainage Bill, 1995.  Rather than vote down the Bill, which is what will inevitably happen, I ask the Leader in an all party spirit&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to appeal to the Minister that the Bill be taken in conjunction with the Government Bill, which, it was indicated last night, would not be published for at least three months.  This is an ideal opportunity to give practical effect to the reform we want to see in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>From what the Minister said, it is clear the bureaucracy will take over, irrespective of who is in Government. The Minister's Bill has to be circulated to Government Departments before it can be introduced.  There is a serious crisis in my area and this is an ideal opportunity for the Oireachtas to tackle existing problems and, in all-party spirit of co-operation, to amend the Bill which has been already published, if amendments are necessary.  The Bill should be passed by the House.  By all means that should be done by allowing the Government to adopt and amend it.  It is urgent that we act now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to confirm how many Bills on arterial drainage were introduced in this House in the last ten years and how many Ministers dealt with them.  Will he also confirm that the proposer of the current Bill was one of those Ministers and that when one <Col N="383" /> looked for information from his Department it was like trying to pull teeth?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>We could have done without the last intervention.  In relation to Item 9, the Minister indicated last night that in the legislation he was preparing he did not see the necessity for provisions for compensation.  Without having a discussion on the matter at this time, I draw the Leader's attention to the Minister's statement.  First, he said he would oppose the Bill; second, he said there was no necessity for provisions for compensation.  That will be a major flaw in his legislation.</P>
      <P>I reluctantly accept we will conclude the Bill on Wednesday, but I re-emphasise the urgency of the position.  People have had to leave their homes to stay in rented accommodation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Fahey's proposal, which is responsible and constructive.  It ought to become a precedent for the way we conduct business in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Fahey's proposal also.  If Government is not prepared, willing, able or capable, because <Col N="384" /> of bureaucratic considerations, to produce a Bill on arterial drainage, as Senator Lee said it would be constructive for us as legislators to turn our minds to this end without party bias. The current Bill could be improved by the input of Members from all sides of the House and could be the framework on which Government could build.  This is a helpful proposition and in the context of reform of both Houses this would be a constructive move forward. I ask the Leader to turn his mind to that matter between now and next Wednesday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader of the Opposition for agreeing to the proposals for the conduct of business today and next week.</P>
      <P>Senator Finneran raised the VHI once again.  If he feels an Adjournment debate would not adequately meet his requirements, I believe the wider context of insurance is an issue this House could debate, as is banking.  Along with the Leaders and Whips of the other groups, I will draw up a list of such topics to debate over the coming weeks. Banking has been mentioned on a number of occasions and I agree with the Senator that there is concern about insurance.  Perhaps such a debate will be possible soon.</P>
      <P>With regard to Senator Honan's query, the Government Bill was published this morning so it should be available shortly.  If she would like further briefing on it to enable her to make up her mind on what she will do I can arrange it today.  I accept the points made by Senator Fahey, Senator Daly, Senator Lee and Senator Roche and the spirit in which they were made.  I will do my best to see if there is some means of incorporating them.</P>
      <P>Other points that have been made anticipate the debate that is about to take place.</P>
      <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister back to the House.  I hope his experience in the House will be helpful to his political career.  I wish to tell the Leader of the House that, contrary to press speculation, there has been no attempt by the Fianna Fáil Party to use this Bill to test or to defeat the Government. That has never been discussed in this party and there is no substance in such speculation.  Although the newspapers have highlighted this aspect of the Bill, Senator Daly is sufficiently experienced to draft a Bill that should command the support of the House.  We know enough about administration to realise that the Government could accept this Bill but snooker it thereafter. The general public is concerned about this Bill and will monitor how it is dealt with by the Government and the Minister. The Minister supports and accepts the Bill.  However, he will not have an easy time with it and we understand that he has a difficult job to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week we had an exhaustive debate on flooding.  It is an insult to those who have suffered serious losses to see the Minister being photographed for newspapers and television and implying, in a sense, that such photographs will contribute to solving drainage problems in this country.  To talk about what local authorities should do to solve drainage problems is totally insincere.  As a member of a local authority who has a keen interest in drainage problems, I am aware that local authorities have no funding to provide the services demanded of them not to mention embarking on tackling the drainage problem.  In fact, the local authority in my county has undertaken maintenance of some rivers which have <Col N="386" /> been drained.  However, it is difficult to understand why local authorities should be obliged to carry out maintenance work on drainage because there is no allocation of funding for such work from the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>To go on television and give the nation the impression that £2 million will solve the problem is an insult.  The entire nation is watching the Government's response to this serious national problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to have more time because four minutes is not sufficient to discuss this matter.  This Bill was introduced by a Senator with ministerial experience who is a native of rural Ireland.  It has been accepted for debate in the Seanad in order to prevent hassle and make life easy for the Government parties in this House.  That is not the perception that should be given to the public.  The Government parties should be sincere.  They can waffle as much as they wish when the Bill is passed.  My impression is that the Government will accept the Bill and let it die a natural death thereafter.  I appeal to the Minister not to do that.  He would be better off lighting a bliss candle than adopting such tactics.  The people will not accept them as a sincere and honest attempt to deal with this problem.</P>
      <P>The Minister must not be blown off course in dealing with this important issue.  It affects every section of the community and every local authority in Ireland.  Look at the money we are paying the unemployed throughout Ireland, whether in Tallaght, in Dublin or in Burtonport in Donegal.  We are spending millions of pounds every week paying people not to work.  There must be a positive approach to the flooding problem.  This Bill is an opportunity for the Government to demonstrate its sincerity and commitment to this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister on his fourth or fifth visit to the House and, to use a bad pun, I hope he is not too <Col N="387" /> drained by the experience.  This Bill gives me an opportunity to discuss flooding, an opportunity I missed last week when statements were made on the problem.</P>
      <P>We can adopt three approaches to the problem of flooding.  We must adopt a short term solution and we must look at medium and long term solutions.  In the short term it cannot be denied that the country has experienced flooding which has not been recorded as so bad in living memory.  When Senator Fahey and Senator Finneran, who are immediately affected by the problems in their areas, can record incidents and illustrate cases, it is no longer an academic exercise.  It is an issue which is very real and close to the hearts of both Senators and credit must be given for the manner in which they spoke on these matters yesterday evening.</P>
      <P>There must be an element of compensation for those who have suffered in the recent flooding.  Large businesses and farms have been affected and in his speech to the House the Minister indicated the ways and means by which compensation can be obtained.  There should be no bureaucratic delay in providing the compensation as it has been earmarked in the budget and elsewhere. In addition, all speed should be made in helping those overcome the problems which they face here and now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a danger that, faced with the massive problems which exist and in attempting to overcome the genuine worries which people have, we rush ahead and adopt measures which have dangerous consequences for the future. We should therefore have a medium and a long term strategy to consider the problem of drainage.  For example, a medium term strategy would be the immediate undertaking of a hydrographical survey of the south County Galway area &mdash; a measure which the Minister referred to in his speech to the House &mdash; to ascertain the nature of the problem and establish the efforts required to ensure that if there are <Col N="388" /> heavy rains again next year, the problem will not be repeated.  In addition, Senator Fahey indicated that short term measures can be taken over the summer and into the autumn to ensure that the problems will not recur this time next year.  Similar measures should also be taken on other areas of flooding throughout the country.</P>
    <P>It does not say much for our efficiency as a nation that the areas which were flooded in 1994 were flooded again in 1995 and we are none the wiser as to the exact reasons why this should have happened.  I refer especially the south County Galway area, because in other areas &mdash; for example, the Mulcair &mdash; the causes are not unknown and the problem must therefore be addressed on a long term basis.</P>
    <P>By long term I mean that we must examine the whole concept of drainage in the country.  For example, I understand Senator Finneran has argued that the use of heavy machinery on agricultural land has resulted in the collapse of many of the fragile earth drains &mdash; especially in areas where the soil is very muddy &mdash; which were put down over the last few centuries.  With the co-operation of the farmer's associations and Teagasc, there should be an awakening of interest by farmers in the concept of drainage and maintaining existing drains.  There is no doubt that throughout Ireland much of the drainage from and within farms has not been given the same priority which it had in previous centuries.  Perhaps younger farmers, in the rush to modernise their farmlands, have removed ditches and dykes for the purposes of joining fields, but in the process valuable dykes and drains have been covered over and inadequately cared for.</P>
    <P>Likewise any farmer with a small river running through his land should ensure that he takes care of it and, if it is not already, work such as this should be covered under the REPS scheme.  In addition, small rivers and streams should be considered as valuable parts of our heritage and environment in the <Col N="389" /> same way as ring forts or any other such environmental object.</P>
    <P>Many problems would not arise if everybody took care of their own stretch of river.  However, the problem in Ireland is that we have a tendency to turn our backs on our rivers and there are very few towns which look onto a river.  In our town two streets are unusual in that they face onto a river, but there is another older street where people's back gardens back onto the river and from there I have seen my neighbours pitch rubbish bags into the river.  This does not cause an immediate problem for them, but it does so further down the river when the plastic bags and rubbish build up and add to the debris in the river.  Plastic bags and the like are difficult to break down as they are not biodegradable and in consequence they mount up, causing blockages and preventing drainage from other areas into the river.</P>
    <P>Awareness of the river as a thing of beauty, a source of income from the viewpoint of fishing and as a living thing is something which should be fostered. If we took more care of the small rivers, the problems which we face in the larger rivers would not be so big.  For example, Senator Enright and Senator Finneran spoke of the problems with silt entering the Shannon from the Bord na Móna works.  If Bord na Móna is responsible for a half of the Shannon silting up, efforts should be made to ensure that waters running through Bord na Móna lands should be filtered in some way to ensure that they do not carry masses of silt into the Shannon and clog it.  It is as much the responsibility of a big organisation such as Bord na Móna not to clog up rivers as for an individual farmer.</P>
    <P>The Mulcair area has demanded attention on an ongoing basis.  In a previous debate, Senator R. Kiely said that we were fortunate in County Limerick in that first the Deal and then the Maigue were drained.  The effect of this on people living in both areas has been phenomenal and the relief from flooding has been much appreciated by communities along the banks of both rivers. <Col N="390" /> I spoke last week to a man who worked on the drainage of the Maigue and, while work was ongoing, tests were undertaken on the Mulcair which was the next river to be drained; but policy changed and the river was not drained. It seems unlikely that the entire basin of the Mulcair will be drained because the criteria for the drainage of rivers have changed somewhat, which is a pity.</P>
    <P>There are around 163,000 square acres of farmland in the area, 20,000 of which are subject to primary flooding and 60,000 to secondary flooding.  As we now have an agricultural quota system, it is argued that this land could not be used if it was drained.  However, those living there are more concerned about savings.  Savings of up to £4 million could be made, even with the same quota system, because they could farm more economically.  These figures were produced by Moore Park and various consultants engaged by the Mulcair drainage co-operative committee.</P>
    <P>This committee has been in existence since 1980 and has monthly meetings. The co-operation of all the farmers in the area is assured.  They realise that a whole arterial scheme cannot be put in place in the Mulcair but they are very anxious for some drainage work to be done there.  It could start at the mouth of the river where it joins the Shannon and work upriver.  It does not have to be done this summer but over a period of time.  It will not cost the Exchequer millions of pounds if it is done on a regular, systematic, piecemeal basis.</P>
    <P>Piecemeal work has been done on the Mulcair but it has never been followed through and there has been no continuity of the work done.  The banks of the river were cleaned a few years ago, for example, which helped to prevent the town of Cappamore from being flooded.  However, that work was not continued with the result that the banks became overgrown again and the town of Cappamore was flooded.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the Minister of State has heard stories from other Senators about the trauma which people have had to suffer in the area.  I heard of a <Col N="391" /> woman cyclist who almost drowned in flood water where the banks of the river broke and water flooded onto the road. She fell off her bicycle and broke her hip which meant that she could not get out of the flood water.  A passing farmer spotted bubbles coming from what he thought was a bundle of blankets in the middle of the water and rescued her. That is probably an unusual story but it indicates that when the banks of a river &mdash; and some of the banks of the Mulcair are ten feet high &mdash; break, the water cascades down and can have that effect on people going about their ordinary, everyday lives.  The Dutch were worried about mouse holes and rat holes in their dykes.  In the valley of the Mulcair, where there are ample supplies of other wildlife such as otters and foxes, the holes can be much larger and the danger of a breach in the banks is therefore far greater.</P>
    <P>With regard to Senator Daly's Bill, there can be no doubt that the 1945 Act was in need of amendment in that drainage works could only be undertaken on a whole river.  I compliment Senator Daly on taking the initiative to table this Bill.  The Minister of State's predecessor, Deputy Dempsey, had been looking at this in the Department. Regardless of who initiated the Bill, the 1945 Act had to be amended to allow the type of piecemeal work to which I referred.</P>
    <P>However, I am somewhat concerned about certain aspects of the Bill.  Section 3 states:</P>
    <P>The Commissioners shall, when constructing drainage or flood protection works, take such precautions and make such provisions as the Minister for the Marine and the Environmental Protection Agency may consider adequate for the protection of ...</P>
    <P>That is right, but it should be expanded somewhat.  There are often areas of great heritage value on the banks of rivers, such as ring forts, monasteries and churches as settlements were often built <Col N="392" /> at the confluence of rivers.  Those areas would also be in danger if they were not sensitively handled when drainage work was being carried out and I would like to see that aspect of the Bill strengthened. I know that that element of protection comes under the Heritage Council Bill but this section of this Bill should be strengthened to include heritage areas.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about section 5. As I said earlier, I am not against the concept of compensating people for disasters such as major flooding.  However, the criteria for compensation are not defined in section 5, although perhaps they were in the original Act which I have not read &mdash; I will get a slap on the wrist for that.  Section 3 refers to &ldquo;localised flooding of lands, water courses, coastal and estuarine incursions, including urban lands&rdquo;.  When I was away on holidays during the summer my front room was flooded by a flash flood. Leaves had blocked a drain and the water flew in the back door, through our front room and out the front door.  Our house would be termed &ldquo;urban lands&rdquo; as we live in a town and, under section 5, I could apply to the Minister for compensation. However, I was compensated by my insurance company.</P>
    <P>I cannot see in the Bill where the Minister and the public purse have been safeguarded from people such as me with occasional flooding which could be compensated elsewhere by insurance companies.  People should only be paid compensation which they cannot get elsewhere.  There is only so much public money to go around and if everybody who suffered any type of flooding was to appeal to the Minister for funding, the country would be even more broke than it is at present.  Section 5 would have to be enormously strengthened before I would be happy with it.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that there is an urgent problem that needs an immediate solution.  I urge the Minister to ensure that whatever compensation is necessary is paid quickly.  If people's livelihoods are at stake they need to feel confident that they can pick up the <Col N="393" /> pieces again.  We need to examine solutions to the problem in the medium term, but we also need to look at the long term aspects of drainage and all its features.  This must be a Government priority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have another opportunity to address the problem of flooding.  This is not a localised problem, although many people would have one believe that the only problems are in rural areas in the west, the Shannon basin or the Mulcair.  The problem of flooding extends throughout the country.  The extent of recent flooding has highlighted the fact that in recent years the incidence of flooding has dramatically increased throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I am delighted Senator Daly went to great trouble to examine previous Acts dealing with drainage and flooding to introduce this Bill, which could solve quite an amount of the problems not dealt with in previous pieces of legislation. If the changes proposed by the Bill are accepted it would give the Minister and his Department an immediate opportunity to deal with problems as they emerge.  I am also delighted that the Government provided time for the debate and will allow the Bill to go through the House.  I presume the Government side will vote in favour when the time comes, because nothing in the Bill would create any problems for the Minister.  It would enhance the Minister and his Department and he could probably take over the sainthood bestowed on his colleague in County Kilkenny in recent weeks if he dealt with this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problems of flooding are multifaceted. What has the Department done in recent years to monitor the causes of flooding throughout the country?  Up to date scientific means are available to monitor the sources of flooding and this could be easily done if the Department hired the use of the Spot-image satellite. This would give a picture of the configuration of the source of the water and to where it goes.  This facility is available <Col N="394" /> for hire in Ireland and is being used by county and city councils and corporations to examine the configuration of land in the long term planning of houses and industrial areas.  Given that this has been used previously, there is no reason why it cannot be used to discover the source of flooding.</P>
    <P>If a satellite picture had been taken at the beginning of the recent floods it would have given a better indication as to how to the problems could be resolved rather than waiting and going through a long and detailed study.  This would have to be carried out by surveyors on the ground.  Even if a team of 1,000 surveyors was sent out over the next two years, one would not get an accurate indication of what should be done in the global sense.</P>
    <P>Problems arise in dealing with localised floods because difficulties could be created for others in areas away from the flooded parts.  Last year's Roads Bill gives county councils a chance to force farmers to take water off flooded roads by opening water courses.  There is no doubt that flooding on roads has been a major source of concern.  Road flooding is non-river oriented and there is probably more of this type of flooding in the country than river flooding.  The Department must allocate more funds to local authorities to deal with this work, which was done in the past by gangs of men opening water courses in ditches.</P>
    <P>Due to the heavy loads carried on rural and county roads, it is particularly difficult to maintain roads in the condition in which they were maintained in the past.  Large vehicles from huge coops in the southeast, Munster and various other places go around the country collecting huge amounts of milk; but these vehicles do not damage the roads as much when they are full as they do when they are a quarter full.  When they are not full, all the milk goes to one side and damage is done on the offside of the vehicle.  This is causing problems.</P>
    <P>Various matters must be addressed. In the past there was a large number of mills and weirs on most rivers in the <Col N="395" /> country.  There has been much contention about the ownership of these weirs and who should be responsible for their maintenance or elimination.  Apart from their aesthetic value, in many cases the removal of mills which are not being used could eliminate quite an amount of flooding.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to suggest simple ways of dealing with flooding.  In the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, dykes were built in south Kilkenny because the river was at a higher level than the land in the Nore-Suir valley.  Dykes were built along the River Suir near New Ross, and close to Waterford and these have lasted for hundreds of years.  Even though the land is ten to 15 feet below the level of the tidal river, there has never been flooding in those areas.  It was a simple means of eliminating a problem.</P>
    <P>In County Kilkenny, during the flood two years ago, an engineer, Mr. Harry Shine &mdash; a man who would know more about water and flooding than anybody in the country &mdash; had just retired from the Office of Public Works.  He built a simple dam of clay and eliminated flooding from 17 houses in the quay area of Kilkenny.  It was a simple job but it eliminated the flooding.  Sometimes one does not have to spend a huge amount of money to eliminate localised flooding, but one has to be careful to ensure that one is not transferring the flooding problem from one area to another.</P>
    <P>In the recent statements made on flooding in this House, I criticised the fact that the budget allocated compensation of only £2 million for farmers whose land had been flooded.  While this figure is a welcome addition to the flood relief programme, few people will be able to qualify under the criteria set. What value will that figure be after it has been spread among all of those affected around the country?</P>
    <P>We had a major flood study done for the Kilkenny city area in 1986, which cost us £225,000.  The solutions presented by the experts would, by the time everything was put in place, have <Col N="396" /> cost in the region of £7 million.  The corporation, in conjunction with various other people, came up with an amended proposition which we felt would deal as effectively with the problem but would cost only £355,000.  This figure only deals with what we would call a five year height flood; it may be extended to a ten year period.  However, we do get also what is called a 100 year flood.  The last such flood in Kilkenny was in 1947, when people had to be taken out through the roofs of their houses.  It washed away two bridges and did a lot of damage.  No amount of money could eliminate the problems such a flood would cause, and the same would apply to other regions throughout the country. We are not talking about eliminating these unpredictable major floods, but the normal flooding that is reasonably predictable.</P>
    <P>An early warning monitoring system &mdash; it is not in the Bill &mdash; should be put in place by the Department.  If a small river floods at a certain time one is guaranteed that the bigger river will burst its banks a few hours later. Although the Office of Public Works has monitors in rivers to detect changes in the river flow, it is not co-ordinated with any central system.  Why not computerise these monitors so that a signal is sent to a central point which would at least give time to those under threat of flooding to get their protection measures into place and their property to a safe place.  This Bill gives the Commissioners of Public Works, in conjunction with the various other agencies, an immediate way of doing something specific and fast.</P>
    <P>Last night, the Minister suggested that the Bill is flawed in the sense that if certain localised efforts were made to alleviate flooding, it may have a bigger impact on a broader scale.  Section 3 (2) of the Bill states that &ldquo;The Commissioners shall have regard to the impact on the entire catchment of any works undertaken in a local area&rdquo;. Obviously, the Commissioners of Public Works would not do something that would cause problems elsewhere.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="397" /> I welcome the Bill and ask the Department, the Minister and the Government to take it on board.  No one is looking for <i>kudos</i> from this, but a solution to a major problem that will not go away.  Allocating large sums of money will not solve the problem in the long term either.  The more pressure debates like this put on the Government, the better.  It should be kept up until the moneys necessary are made available.  Emergency moneys can be made available for other areas. However, while needing short term compensation, we also need a long term solution.  This Bill provides a method whereby long term solutions can be found for some of the major problems that have arisen through flooding and drainage schemes.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the Mulcair river.  We have a few small rivers in Kilkenny which border on Tipperary and Laois.  The Goul drainage committee meets once a year.  Councillors get together for about ten minutes to discuss the progress made in this scheme from last year.  The meeting takes ten minutes, which is about the length of time it takes to sign the attendance sheet.  Unfortunately, nothing has been done and the Goul drainage scheme is now as far from complete as it was when it was established in 1923.  That is no different to many other schemes around the country.</P>
    <P>This Bill, if passed, would strengthen the Minister's hand in seeking funding. For that reason the Minister should take the advice of his Government colleague, Senator Kelly, and allow it to go through.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to extend a warm welcome to the Minister, Deputy Higgins. It is the first occasion I have spoken here since he returned to this House as a Minister.  The Minister was a distinguished and effective Member of the Seanad and I had the privilege of serving with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has always impressed me as a person of action and integrity. That fact weighs strongly with me when <Col N="398" /> he suggests or requests that it would be advisable for the House to await the presentation of his Bill.  The Minister has said that the Bill will be before the House in a matter of weeks and will be introduced in the Seanad.  For these reasons it is better to wait and have a comprehensive measure with the full support of the Government.  It is the sincerity that I know the Minister possesses that is encouraging me to support that line of action.</P>
    <P>I have reservations, which I will mention during the course of my contribution. However, before referring to them, I want to pay a special tribute to my constituency colleague, Senator Daly, for bringing his Bill before the House.  He has responded to what is an urgent need and has played his part in focusing public attention on an extremely serious matter and I support the concept of the introduction of legislation and Private Members' Bills in this House.  However, because of the arguments put forward by the Minister and from what I know of him, I am prepared to support his contention that it is a better proposition to await the Government's Bill.</P>
    <P>Of all the contributions I have listened to &mdash; and I have been here for the entire debate &mdash; Senator Fahey's impressed me for a number of reasons. I know Senator Fahey for a long time and he can be as party political as anybody. When it comes to firing the shots, he can do it; but his contribution last night was in an entirely different vein. It seemed to be a cry of frustration at the difficulties he encountered with others, to which I will refer, in the past year when attempting to get aid to homes and farms flooded in his constituency. He said he was successful in getting a promise of aid from the Minister for Finance but that it was frustrated by the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>It was known that these farms and homes would probably be flooded-again this year.  I always regarded the public representative, the Member of the Oireachtas, as the last bulwark between the affected citizen and bureaucracy. <Col N="399" /> There is a history of bureaucracy attracting to itself more power as time progresses without accepting responsibility when that power is used to the disadvantage of a citizen.  As legislators, we must face up the fact that if bureaucrats utilise that power to the disadvantage of a citizen, against the advice of those who know the risks involved, then bureaucracy must accept the responsibility to the point of being personally sued for negligence in these matters.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonagh, who has yet to speak, is from that particular area.  His frustrations will be similar to those of Senator Fahey.  Public representatives in that area, including Senator Fahey, Senator McDonagh and Deputy McCormack and others, have endeavoured to resolve the position there.  The role of the public representative <i>vis-á-vis</i> bureaucracy has been crystallised by the situation which has been allowed to develop.  I will be interested to hear the Minister's response to that.</P>
    <P>What we are facing today is the result of years of neglect.  Action has been forced on us because of the difficulties we have encountered in recent months.  I accept that there have been record levels of rainfall this winter and that countries throughout Europe have faced similar problems.  Nonetheless, there has been a history of neglect and a scaling down of work begun centuries ago, but intensified in the 1930s to the 1950s. Valuable work was done in that period as regards river drainage, estuary embankments, the protection of coastal areas, etc.  During that period there was an understanding between the authorities and those concerned of the relevance and importance of that drainage work.  The works to which I refer were essentially carried out by pick and shovel. We are now in an era of modern machinery which could undertake and complete that work in a short period.</P>
    <P>We should reflect on a statement made by Fr. Harry Bohan, a person of national repute from my county, when flooding occurred in the village of Sixmilebridge and eight families were forced <Col N="400" /> to leave their homes on two occasions.  He referred to the fact that a flyover was being constructed over the dual carriageway a few miles from Sixmilebridge. He asked what kind of a warped economic system allows for over £3 million to be spent on a flyover on the Limerick-Shannon road when four miles away eight families were flooded out of their homes because there was no money to open a drain at the back of their houses.  I emphasise the word &ldquo;drain&rdquo;, because that is all that is involved, not a stream or a river. Because of neglect and the failure to keep that drain open, eight families have been twice forced to leave their homes.  We would do well to reflect on the words of Fr. Bohan in relation the warped economic thinking which pumps millions of pounds into a flyover a few miles from these unfortunate people.</P>
    <P>I refer to Senator Daly's Bill and the proposals in the Minister's Bill.  Both place the responsibility on and express a lot confidence in the capacity of the Office of Public Works to resolve the difficulties.  I do not share either their optimism or confidence.  The Minister in his speech referred to the great achievements of the Office of Public Works as regards drainage in the 50 years since the Arterial Drainage Act was passed. He said: &ldquo;In excess of 650,000 acres have benefited from works on a total of some 7,300 miles of river channels and coastal and estuarine embankments.&rdquo; He referred to expenditure of £500 million and £140 million.  The important figure is the 50 years.</P>
    <P>I have taken the trouble to read the Dáil debates on the passing of the Arterial Drainage Act in 1945.  The timeframe envisaged for the completion of what was intended in that Act has long since passed.  The Act designated 28 major catchment areas; work is now underway on area No. 13.  At that rate of progress and, indeed, at the way progress has slowed down, we are not talking about another 50 years but at least another century.  That is not the answer to the problems we face.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="401" /> Some time after 1945, 30 minor catchment areas were identified; work is now underway on area No. 8.  I say to Senator Daly and the Minister that the Office of Public Work's performance represents neither a record of achievement nor urgency.  Perhaps I have been hard in what I said; I would gladly accept an adequate answer.  I assure the Minister and Senator Daly that the views I expressed are widely shared by many in the community, particularly victims of flooding.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly and the Minister indicated that there would be a move away from the concept of the entire catchment area and the drainage of it.  I support the proposal that attention be now given to the improvement of stretches of rivers and blockages.  I am not sure whether those affected by flooding will be confident that their problems will be resolved satisfactorily by the Office of Public Works in view of the pace of performance and the results since 1945 to date, but if there is an answer to that we should get it.</P>
    <P>Other factors contributed to the flooding.  We cannot ignore the affect of forestry.  There has been extensive planting of mountainsides and uplands generally which requires extensive drainage and open drainage in most parts.  The result is that heavy rain floods downhill much faster than before the forestry had taken place.  The water pours down into valleys, and into drains and streams that have not been maintained for years; they are overpowered and flooding occurs.</P>
    <P>I am moving into delicate ground now, although I do not hesitate to do so, but over the past 15 or 20 years environmentalist and other groups have been successful in mounting a campaign for the preservation of wetlands as a habitat for migratory birds.  Questions of flora, fauna and areas of scientific interest also arise.  Some of these groups' campaigns have been so successful that we have reached a stage where drainage can be seen as unpatriotic activity.</P>
    <P>These groups have a tendency to go overboard on issues they adopt. <Col N="402" /> However, try to explain to a family that has been flooded out of its home that there is an area of fauna or flora a few miles up river, or that a bureaucrat has decided there is an area of scientific interest and that the preservation of those areas of scientific interest is of greater importance than the family home.  I repeat Fr. Harry Bohan's comment that it is a warped mentality which supports that attitude.  The success of the efforts of those groups has created the feeling that it is unpatriotic to be involved in drainage affecting wetlands.</P>
    <P>These are factors in the difficulties we now face.  These issues which are of concern to some &mdash; the preservation of the areas to which I alluded, the habitats of migratory birds and the preservation and development of fisheries &mdash; can be accommodated in a sensible arrangement. The will is there to protect and it can be done in conjunction with a will to protect homes and farms from the devastating flooding of recent years.</P>
    <P>My county has suffered greatly from flooding.  I referred to what happened in the picturesque village of Sixmilebridge and I tied that in with Fr. Bohan's comments. There is a drain which has not been opened or attended to and the effect of that neglect is the flooding of eight family homes.  The front garden of one of these homes had been a national prize winner in competitions.  One can imagine the strain, frustration and anger of people affected in that area.  In my own town of Ennis housing estates that never knew flooding have been hit in a devastating way in recent months and people have been forced to leave their homes.</P>
    <P>Ennis is in the River Fergus catchment area and the Fergus was No. 20 on that famous list of 28.  If we are depending on the rate of progress to date, moving to No. 20 from No. 13 would take another 50 years.  In the light of that, how can we get people to accept that we are serious in attending to the tragedy that has hit their homes?  Rural areas of the county have been hit particularly badly.  Many roads have been closed and traffic has been diverted, <Col N="403" /> often into another flood.  People have had to leave their homes.</P>
    <P>Coastal erosion is another serious matter.  Other Members have referred to the work that has been done in regard to coastal erosion over the centuries. The need to do this work was recognised many years ago and it was successfully undertaken with picks and shovels.  We are now in the era of modern machinery and we are still faced with problems.  We are not protecting or preserving embankments and we are not maintaining river drainage.  We are not doing the work that has been recognised through generations as necessary to keep our rivers flowing.</P>
    <P>People have referred to particular difficulties we have due to the physical shape of the island.  Look at what the Dutch did; they kept out the North Sea. We are not expected to keep out the Atlantic Ocean or any sea; all we are expected to do is provide a sensible system that enables the water from our rivers to flow into the sea.  If one reads the discussions which took place during the passage of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, it is interesting to note the timescale envisaged and, given the equipment then available, that they were confident the work could be done successfully in that period.</P>
    <P>I urge early action, or we will be looking at relocation.  We will be faced with massive costs unless we deal now as a matter of urgency with the problems that have been outlined.  In areas such as south Galway and in towns such as my own we are also facing the massive cost of relocating families and rehousing them on higher ground.  I welcome and admire the Minister of State's commitment and sincerity and I am sure he will bring before the House in a matter of weeks the legislation that will deliver what is needed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Ar dtús, ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire go dtí an Teach agus fáilte a chur roimh an Bhille seo.  No one has more experience of flooding in the west than the Minister of <Col N="404" /> State.  He is familiar with the situation and he will do his utmost to ensure the flooding is alleviated as soon as possible. I congratulate Senator Daly on introducing this Bill.</P>
      <P>In County Sligo we have had problems for many years with Lough Arrow and the River Owenmore, which borders on the Minister's constituency.  The real problem with drainage is getting cooperation and unity among conservationists, the fishing fraternity and the farming community.  It is not easy to get those groups to pull together.</P>
      <P>The Arterial Drainage Act does not help because under its provisions one either has a big scheme or nothing.  This meant that a job could be held up for years while feasibility studies etc. were carried out to satisfy interests.  The biggest cause of flooding in many cases is lack of maintenance and this Bill sets out to remedy that problem.  People believe the only way to relieve flooding and drainage is a large scheme with large machinery and piles of spoil put on the side banks.  However, that can often cause its own problems.  For generations men with shovels and drags kept the waterways clear and kept flooding at bay.</P>
      <P>While I agree this is one of the wettest years we have had &mdash; my own land has never been as wet &mdash; I see nevertheless that watercourses and main rivers have not been maintained.  In my area of Drumcliffe the council is the agent for the Office of Public Works and it does some work.  However, we do not have the funds needed to do the work to alleviate flooding in Drumcliffe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a tree falls across the river, we can cut it and take it out.  If something blocks a bend, we can send a few men out and get the water running.  But that does not amount to servicing the river. The side banks need to be pared down. In the summertime, when big floods come, large stones come down and block up the river.  The water flows each side of the blockage and eventually there are islands in the middle of the river.  All those obstacles create flooding <Col N="405" /> later on.  If we had a sensible scheme whereby some authority would make a certain amount of money available for the removal of all those obstacles from the river, the flooding would be alleviated and many of our problems would be solved.</P>
    <P>It is important that this Bill go through the House.  The Minister may add whatever amendments he wants to it, but I do not like this talk of a Government Bill because there is a grave danger that this will push the resolution of this problem further down the road.  Over the years we have seen similar problems put on the back boiler. There has been flooding in my county, but thank God no one has been left homeless.  Land and crops were destroyed and good fodder land was destroyed earlier in the year &mdash; they could not get in to cut the meadows &mdash; but it is not as bad as the flooding in Galway, Roscommon and other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>I do not know how those people whose homes have been flooded will get back into their houses again.  I have seen the flooding on television and the cost of the damage will run into thousands of pounds.  We must have some way of compensating those people.  We will be asked where the money is to come from. That question is always asked at county council level as well.  We never seem to have money, but if a big court case or inquiry comes up we can get plenty of money.  If someone takes an action against a local authority and the case goes to the High Court, as happened in my own county, £0.5 million can be found; but we never can seem to find money for the necessities of life, for the drainage of land, which is so important.</P>
    <P>This flooding will cost the local authorities a large amount of money.  Many, county roads have been destroyed and will have to be built from the foundation again.  The county councils cannot carry out this work without money.  Both the county councils and the farmers must be compensated.  Many people have insurance, but insurance may not cover all the damage.  Some farmers have to <Col N="406" /> all intents and purposes been put out of business.  We must ensure that those people are compensated and are given a chance to get back into business again. If we cannot fully compensate them, then perhaps very low interest loans could be made available to help them rebuild their lives and their livelihoods.</P>
    <P>If this Bill was passed we could begin the work.  To date no effort has been made to drain even one gallon of water from the floods that are all over the country.  No one has a machine in, no one is doing any work to drain the flooded land.  We cannot do it under the present Arterial Drainage Act.  Feasibility studies are being done in my own area and we are told they are almost ready; but when we are ready, environmentalists, fishermen and farmers must be reconciled and again there are problems.</P>
    <P>Another serious problem in my county, as a result of all this flooding and damage, is coastal erosion.  I do not know how we are to come to terms with that.  In addition, deposits from erosion are blocking the outlets of rivers in flood.  This is another serious problem. Sluice gates are needed in some places. If these were provided they could be closed and opened whenever necessary and maintenance would clear the way in front of the sluice gate if deposits piled up.  In this way drainage problems would be solved before they arise.  Many protection walls were knocked and those walls were in many cases protecting the roads.  In my own county a number of roads have been washed almost completely away because the walls protecting the road are gone.  This is another problem we will have to look into.</P>
    <P>There are many problems associated with flooding.  This Bill represents the first serious effort to bring responsibility for drainage within the ambit of the local authorities and to bring local authorities and the Office of Public Works together to put a mechanism in place to alleviate the serious flooding and the loss of homes and livestock resulting to farmers.  So far I do not believe anyone <Col N="407" /> has set out to do a survey or an assessment of the cost of flooding.  When we had similar flooding in north Sligo, within weeks we had accounts done of the cost.  I wonder whether the councils in those counties affected by flooding are doing any costing at the moment, or whether they have been asked by the Department of the Environment or anybody else to assess the damage, because unless we assess the damage we do not know how much it will cost to rectify it. We are told that money may be available from Europe.  Holland got money almost immediately from Europe.  Why is Ireland getting nothing?  Are we making a case to the European authorities to get compensation for farmers?  The outlook as I see it is very bleak.  I do not see anyone coming up with figures and I do not see anyone helping the flooded areas.</P>
    <P>This Bill is about trying to alleviate suffering and to help people in trouble. We do not know whether insurance will cover the full cost of damage to households. Some houses are very badly damaged. We all know perfectly well that it will cost a large amount of money to refurbish those houses.  The occupants of one house that is now flooded won the garden of the year award last year. A lot of work was put into getting the garden done and winning an award and now all that work is six foot under water.  That is one of the saddest stories of this flooding that I recorded.  Have we made any efforts to face up to those realities?</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan told the Seanad what was done in Donegal some years ago where machines which had been standing idle were made available to the local community by the Office of Public Works.  The local community became involved and collected money.  With the use of a machine at a nominal fee of about £1 a day, they did a great job to alleviate flooding.  The Government should look at how we could involve communities, councils and the Office of Public Works in a joint effort.  If local funds have to be raised to supplement <Col N="408" /> those coming from the Department and from Europe, we would be making a genuine effort.  Many people in local communities would gladly contribute towards helping to alleviate this flooding.</P>
    <P>In circumstances like this, when things are so bad in the west, it might not be a bad idea for the Government to consider making national lottery money available for alleviating flooding.  This is a serious emergency.  A number of families are in rented dwellings because their houses and homes are flooded. Surely in an emergency like this we should do something.  If houses were burned down all kinds of services would be made available to rehouse people. What is the difference between a house being made uninhabitable because of a flood and it being made uninhabitable because of a fire?  When certain problems arise we have no trouble rising to the occasion and providing services and help, but when there are other problems which have disastrous effects on people we do not seem to rise to the occasion at all.  The national lottery is another source of funding.  It will take a great deal of finance to solve the problem.</P>
    <P>The first thing that must be done is to try to get flood waters flowing.  We must start at the lowest point by providing machines to reduce flood waters.  The only way we can do this is by passing a Bill similar to the one proposed by Senator Daly.  If the Minister is not happy with this Bill we have no objection to him introducing suitable amendments. If such amendments are put to the House we could have the Bill passed by next week and could have the first real and sincere effort made to alleviate flooding, get water flowing again and enable families to move back to their homes.  I appeal to the Minister to do this at his earliest possible convenience.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Arís cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire go dtí an Teach agus caithfidh mé a rá go bhfuil comhgháirdeas <Col N="409" /> tuilte aige.  Bhí mé ag caint leis cheana in a lán áiteanna agus, i measc na n-áiteanna sin, i ndeisceart na Gaillimhe nuair a bhí sé ag féachaint ar an tuilteach.</P>
      <P>It is sad that the terrible trauma experienced by families as a result of the recent flooding has to continue as the heavy rain continues and the floods fail to subside.  There seems to be no sign of the bad weather and terrible conditions abating because of a deluge of heavy rain.  During last night there was heavy snowfall in Galway which will make matters worse.  People continue to suffer.</P>
      <P>The most severely affected area without any shadow of doubt is the area in the hinterland of Gort.  Other areas in the country have been affected, but most focus has been on this area.  The Minister will be familiar with other affected areas such as Creggs in the Williamstown area, where, despite the unceasing efforts of people like the local councillor, Mr. Tiernan Walshe, flooding continues and more work needs to be done.  I come from Turloughmore, which means dry lake, but this year it is not dry.  A road in the Canteeny area has been under water for about six weeks and the national school has been forced to close for periods during this time.</P>
      <P>I recently asked Galway County Council to do some work in this location and was told it would cost £50,000 to raise the road and rebuild and restrengthen the walls and that this money is not available.  Lack of adequate finance is a key problem and unless it can be found very little will be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing with a natural disaster. Flooding has occurred continually over the years, although not to the extent of this year, and, regretfully, very little has been done.  There has been a great deal of discussion and many reports have been commissioned.  For the first time ever we now see a real <Col N="410" /> commitment, particularly from the new Government, to look at and alleviate the problem and make sure there will not be a recurrence.  There is also a very committed, co-ordinated local effort, particularly in the Gort area, to implement a remedial policy.</P>
    <P>The fundamental problems can be identified.  One is related to the capacity of rivers, which are not able to discharge the huge amount of rain.  There have also been problems due to high tides and prevailing winds.  The Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, Deputy Jim Higgins, is to be complimented on the way he is tackling the problem.  The interdepartmental committee, which he will chair, will oversee and co-ordinate the various suggestions from different Departments and agencies and ultimately, I hope, find a solution to the ongoing problem.  His initiative in setting up this committee must be greatly welcomed.</P>
    <P>In a discussion of any proposed Bill or amendments we should recognise the efforts of the Government so far to help people suffering from flooding.  Some £2 million has been made available to the Department of Agriculture to compensate farmers for loss of fodder and stocks.  I hope some provision will also be made to help people who have been forced to buy in fodder &mdash; I have stated this publicly already &mdash; and to cover people for loss of land which has been flooded for a considerable period.</P>
    <P>Some £4 million has been made available for county roads.  This will bring a sigh of relief to county managers, county engineers and councillors because a great deal of money from emergency funds has been used since Christmas to help raise roads in an effort to alleviate and prevent flooding on them.  This is a welcome development.</P>
    <P>The supplementary welfare allowance administered by health boards can be used to assist those affected.  An advertisement seeking consultants to carry <Col N="411" /> out a special study of south Galway will soon be placed in the papers and I am sure this will be welcome news to the people of this area.  The interdepartmental committee will meet in the next week or so and will be chaired by the Minister.  This is a very significant initiative.</P>
    <P>European officials have been invited to visit and assess the situation.  The Minister of State will be visiting Brussels &mdash; if he has not done so already &mdash; to highlight the problems.  Cases have already been made in the European Parliament for funds for areas in France and Italy which have been affected by flooding.  I hope we can also go down this road and that money like that which the people in France and Italy have called for will be forthcoming.  I understand that funds of this nature will be provided for remedial action to prevent reoccurrence rather than for compensation or current problems.</P>
    <P>I can identify and sympathise with the people who have suffered losses in south Galway.  I welcome Senator Daly's Bill and commend him for it.  I only just realised that it is Senator Daly's Bill because, from reading the newspapers at home in Galway, I was under the impression that this was Senator Fahey's Bill.  Senator Daly must be complimented this morning on his initiative.  I know Senator Fahey contributed and I commend him for that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a positive initiative and I commend all those involved. We also had a big contribution from the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works when he said last night that a Bill will be initiated in this House.  This Bill will provide a great opportunity for a long, meticulous and detailed discussion and there will be room for amendments and attention to <Col N="412" /> detail.  It will be open and transparent and everybody will have an opportunity to speak and make suggestions.  I commend the Minister of State for accepting an Opposition party initiative and allowing the forthcoming Government Bill to be initiated in this House.</P>
      <P>Deputy Higgins is no slouch; in fact, he is quite the opposite, a live wire.  He will not stand on ceremony.  He will not wait or be given to delay.  Of all the people who could deal with this crisis, there is no better man to react.  He can identify with the problems and the terrible situation that prevails in the west of Ireland because he comes from the west and there is flooding in his own area.  He is very familiar with the situation and his intention and commitment are clear.  The Office of Public Works will control and take responsibility for all aspects of drainage including local drainage works.</P>
      <P>I believe the intentions are good.  The Minister of State has pinpointed certain defects or concerns in this Bill.  I say to the Opposition party who introduced this Bill that there can be no defects as the matter is too serious.  Let us get it right now as people's futures depend on it.  Consultation is already underway on the proposed designing of schemes to prevent further flooding.  Waiting for the Government Bill to come into this House will not deter progress.  Progress or remedial action is not inhibited or delayed in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For a number of years I have served with Senator Fahey on Galway County Council, in the Seanad and on various other bodies.  I have never publicly disagreed with him but I must pose a number of, albeit rhetorical, questions.  His utterances in the House last night were steeped to a certain extent in political tones.  Of course, I sympathise with the people of south Galway and their plight. I have been monitoring the south Galway situation with consternation.  I was in the area during Christmas week and I have kept in constant touch with it.  I <Col N="413" /> want remedial action now and I agree with the grim picture Senator Fahey painted.  I never want to see a recurrence of the south Galway flooding problems, but making a political football out of the people's problems is not helpful.  It was not correct to cast aspersions on the speech of the Minister of State last night.</P>
    <P>Over the years we have heard much talk about what should be done and what could be done but I have to pose the question: what has been done?  We have had studies and now we have a proposal for another detailed study which is to be followed by remedial action.  Very little came out of the other studies.  It is obvious that the torch has been passed, thankfully, to a new Administration which is committed to action.  The days of words and pious platitudes are over.  The current Government is committed to replacing words and verbiage with action.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Fahey and commend him on the picture he painted in this House last night.  It is grim and true and he has my support in everything he says.  However, the first drainage scheme of any type, albeit small and local, directing water from the flooded source to the sea was established through local initiative born out of frustration and strongly backed by the Fine Gael organisation in the area.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to Deputy McCormack and the local Fine Gael councillor, Toddie Byrne, who went far and beyond the call of duty in trying to find a solution to a desperate problem in south Galway over the last number of months.  We got very little support and encouragement from Senator Fahey and the local Fianna Fáil councillor.  Like other Fianna Fáil activists in that area they became doubting Thomases.  Now, of course, when they see positive results coming from the Fine Gael way of thinking, they seem to be saying that this scheme is working based on action rather than words.  At last the people of <Col N="414" /> south Galway and other parts of the country where floods have created havoc see hope and a concerned Government.</P>
    <P>I would like to see certain things happening. European funds should be provided to help householders.  It is obvious that past Governments, and possibly this Government, cannot procure funds for this type of situation.  I agree with Senator Farrell that lottery funds could be provided on a once off basis to help people.  A sum of £1 million could be provided on a once off basis to help the people of south Galway in an area which, without any shadow of a doubt, should be called a disaster area.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the lottery people, whom we have all supported and who have a marvellously viable structure, to provide on a once off basis the £1 million which is urgently required to help the people of south Galway in their hour of need and their great plight.  Perhaps this is the road we should be going down.  If a proposer or seconder is required, I will make the proposal in this House that we seek £1 million.  I will also propose that the area of south Galway, if it is possible for the Government to do so, would be declared a disaster area.  As a response to that, if European funds cannot be provided, the national lottery should come to the aid of the people in that area.</P>
    <P>I would also like to see the introduction of payments for fodder where land has been under water for a considerable period of time.  I would also like to see support for local initiative.  Funds should be provided for cash starved councils to raise roads.  Councils which have used up a lot of their funds over the past number of months should not be penalised or punished.  The Department of the Environment should provide supplementary grants for councils to help them to raise roads in order to stop a recurrence of flooding in many areas throughout the country, particularly in the areas closest to my heart.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="415" /> I welcome certain sections of the Bill, particularly section 8, which calls for a representative of the General Council of County Councils to be included on any proposed committee.  I welcome and support this suggestion.</P>
    <P>A number of schemes have been introduced since the Arterial Drainage Act was enacted in 1945.  As someone who comes from an area which was successfully drained in the 1950s and 1960s as a result of the 1945 Act, the Corrib and Clare catchments, it would be remiss of me not to mention the legendary Minister of State &mdash; I understand they were called Parliamentary Secretaries in those days &mdash; and former all-Ireland Galway footballer, Mr. Mick Donnellan, who introduced this scheme and whose work will never be forgotten in the River Clare basin.  Members will recall that Mr. Mick Donnellan was replaced in later years by another great member of that dynasty, Mr. John Donnellan, who also performed heroically for his county.</P>

      <P>The Office of Public Works has expertise, strength and <Col N="416" /> organisation to undertake effective schemes to alleviate flooding, including that at local level.  I understand that proposals have already been prepared by the Office of Public Works for the amendment of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, to provide it with the necessary powers to undertake works for the relief of localised flooding caused by rivers. I am sure the proposals will also involve discussions with the Minister for Finance and will soon come before the Dáil.  As the Minister said, they will also come before this House.  At the end of this discussion I hope we have a Bill to enable us to implement proposals and policies for a reasonable solution to the flooding problems which have bedevilled the countryside this year.  I hope the EU will respond positively to helping the people who have suffered flooding in their houses in recent weeks.</P>
      <P>While I welcome certain aspects of the Bill &mdash; and I have already commended Senator Daly &mdash; it should be given further consideration and flesh should be put on its bones.  I look forward to the Government's Bill which will be introduced after consideration and work by various experts and which will be of great substance.</P>

      <P>It gives me great pleasure to support Senator Daly's Bill, which is an amendment to the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  I commend him for introducing this Bill to the House and I am sure it will be passed unanimously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Drainage has always been a problem in this country and for a 100 years prior to 1945 drainage works were carried out on a piecemeal basis and dealt with drainage problems in localised areas of river catchments.  Several hundred of <Col N="417" /> these minor schemes were carried out under various statutes in what became known as drainage districts, the maintenance of which became the responsibility of the local authorities.  Some 165 of these are still in existence.</P>
    <P>The inadequacies of this piecemeal approach to drainage problems was highlighted by a number of drainage commissions, especially the Browne Commission, which met between 1938 and 1940.  It commented adversely on the haphazard creation of individual districts without consideration of the interests, problems and requirements of river basins which was repugnant to the idea of a planned drainage policy.  Lack of maintenance was also a feature and in many cases schemes deteriorated to such an extent that works had to be redone on more than one occasion.</P>
    <P>Among the main recommendations of the Browne Commission was that there should be a central drainage authority based in the Office of Public Works with responsibility for the construction and maintenance of arterial drainage schemes on a catchment basis.  The Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, gave effect to the recommendations of the Browne Commission.  It is now the sole basis for the commissioners' statutory authority for arterial drainage, which benefited agricultural land.</P>
    <P>I live in the catchment area of the River Deal and work was carried out there between 1962 and 1968, which benefited 11,900 acres of land.  The Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, was put on the Statute Book by a Fianna Fáil Government in 1945.  I am sure this Government was responsible for successfully constructing these arterial drainage schemes in places where they were needed.  The Maigue catchment drainage scheme is also in my locality. This work was carried out between 1973 and 1986 and it benefited 13,500 acres of land.  This scheme was also funded by the EU.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="418" /> Senator Farrell spoke about spoil and he said that if there is drainage without spoil it will cause flooding.  However, in the Deal drainage scheme the spoil was left in heaps and the local farmers had to level it off afterwards.  Because of EU funding the Office of Public Works is now able to spread the spoil.  Environmentalists are also worried about interfering with the environment, but the environment is enhanced by the work done by the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>Flooding has taken place because of the heavy rainfall and although it is widespread, Galway is severely affected. The rain this year has been the heaviest since rainfalls were recorded, twice as much as in previous years.  This has contributed greatly to the flooding we have experienced throughout the country over the past three months.</P>
    <P>Galway has figured highly in this debate and it is only natural that people mention their own areas.  I must also be parochial and refer to the Mulcair, which has been flooded many times over the past years.  The Mulcair has broken its banks at least four or five times since Christmas and pumps and fire brigades had to be brought in on each occasion to relieve the flooding. Recently a woman almost drowned and had to be removed to hospital.  This shows the damage and distress which the Mulcair flooding has caused to the people in the immediate area.</P>
    <P>It was number one on the arterial drainage list and it was promised the work would start as far back as 1971. Many areas of the Mulcair have banks like dykes in Holland where houses and land are below the level of the river.  I often passed through that way and I see the flooding.  Roads and some houses can be flooded and if the bank bursts they will be washed away.</P>
    <P>I understand that the arterial drainage work on the Mulcair has been put in abeyance or abandoned.  The reason the Mulcair has not been drained is the cost benefit analysis problem and the <Col N="419" /> Mulcair Drainage Society believes the economic assessment has been done wrongly; it was based on increased output. Today we have quota farming so the assessment should have been done on reduced costs rather than increased output.  These points were raised before the assessment was carried out but they were not heeded.</P>
    <P>The Mulcair Drainage Society Limited undertook a study with the co-op in their area and Moorepark which showed a cost saving of £2.5 million per year on dairying and £1.5 million per year on stores and beef, based on Teagasc estimates.  This shows there would be a total saving of £4 million per year on dairy and beef alone.  This would pay for a lot of flood relief, boost employment in the area, keep families in rural areas and stop the terrible stress, social pressures and financial ruin.</P>
    <P>It is most upsetting that misleading figures have been given out about the cost.  The Mulcair Drainage Society Limited request that the scheme be started at the mouth of the river; there is a fall of 117 feet to the main problem area so it would be easy to drain.  We must ensure that that number of miles would not be flooded again.  This is probably a most deserving area in the country, although Galway might be more deserving because it has been flooded many times.</P>
    <P>This Bill will definitely help the drainage of the Mulcair and would put drainage schemes in operation there soon. The Bill provides the required powers for the Commissioners of Public Works and also influences compensation and other studies.  Section 3 (1) (a) reads:</P>
    <P>The Commissioners shall, without the necessity of preparing a scheme, execute drainage works for the relief and prevention and maintenance of localised flooding of lands, watercourses, coastal and estuarine incursions, including urban lands, buildings <Col N="420" /> and properties as shall appear to them to be necessary or expedient.</P>
    <P>This subsection will give the Office of Public Works power to quickly alleviate localised flooding without preparing schemes.  If they had such powers, I am sure the flooding problems in the Mulcair area would have been alleviated long ago.  I commend Senator Daly for introducing this Bill which was badly needed to help alleviate these problems.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he was&mdash;</P>
    <P>... asking the House to oppose the Bill on the grounds that, in the first case, the Government will introduce, as quickly as possible, its own legislation to permit work to relieve localised flooding and second, the proposed provisions are unnecessary since there are already adequate provisions and mechanisms in existence for paying compensation where that is appropriate.</P>
    <P>I cannot see how the Minister's legislation can improve this Bill to permit work to relieve localised flooding.  If he has ideas for its improvement, he can always amend this Bill and have it passed as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I am surprised to hear that, &ldquo;there are adequate provisions and mechanisms in existence for paying compensation where that is appropriate.&rdquo;  To my mind, there are no such adequate provisions. The Minister mentioned that this Bill was flawed but if he brings in a Bill without such provisions it will have even more flaws.  I appeal to the Government Senators to support Senator Daly's well thought out Bill which will be whole-heartily welcomed by the Mulcair Drainage Society and other concerned societies because it will ensure that the necessary work to alleviate flooding will be carried out as soon as possible in their immediate areas.</P>
    <P>I listened to Senator Fahey's account of the trouble in Galway where a factory that makes hurleys &mdash; and the making of hurleys is dear to my heart &mdash; will <Col N="421" /> be out of business until next June or later and they experienced similar problems last year.  This is a serious problem which should be tackled very soon.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke referred to slurry in farming and I know it is a problem, but there are pollution control schemes that could deal with that adequately.  I appeal to the Government to provide good grants for farmers who need to engage in pollution control and the building of slurries, etc., because this is a problem that must be tackled.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke also mentioned water flows down from the hills due to overgrazing. Whether they are undergrazed or overgrazed the water will flow down anyway; it will hardly flow uphill.  A severe flood will cause damage to hillways. Recently I saw a road and a hill gutted by a severe flood.  No matter what growth there is, water will flow anyway.</P>
    <P>I commend Senator Fahey on his contribution but I was disappointed that Senator McDonagh criticised him.  He said Senator Fahey was making a political football of it.  I do not know about Senator Fahey but Senator McDonagh made a political football out of it today and he had more than one kick at it because he was trying to win.  He also praised the Minister as a man who did not go in for ceremony.  I hope he will not bother with ceremony now and will accept this Bill and introduce whatever amendments he likes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and I want to thank my colleague and cousin Rory for allowing me to share his time.</P>
      <P>I was amused when I heard the story of the hurley factory having to close down.  Maybe now he will go back and look at where he got the hurleys for the All-Ireland; maybe that is where the mistake was made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is spending a lot of time in this House, and rightly so, because this is a serious national problem.  We come here every week thinking the <Col N="422" /> worst is over, but when we return to our constituencies we find it is just as bad.</P>
    <P>I commend Senator Daly for his courage in introducing his Bill.  The Minister should seriously examine it rather than saying he will introduce his own legislation. As the other Senator Kiely said, if the Bill must be changed we can amend it in the House and put it into action rather than putting the matter on the long finger.</P>
    <P>This Bill will strengthen the Minister's hand with the Minister for Finance. Rather than waiting for the drafting of his own legislation and then putting it through the Houses, he will be able to get money more quickly for this serious problem.  The Bill gives absolute powers to the Office of Public Works, who have done good drainage work through the years.</P>
    <P>People have been local and parochial in this debate.  This is as it should be because if a person cannot look after his own how can he look after others? There was flooding on the Feale and the Cashen in the 1960s and I commend the Office of Public Works for handling that problem.  The flooding in my area at that time was as bad as it is in Galway, Roscommon and Clare now.</P>
    <P>At that time there were many protests from anglers about the damage that would be done to the Feale, which was called the second best salmon river in Europe.  If anything, the fishing on that river has been improved.  If drainage work is properly supervised it will improve the fishing amenities and facilities along these waterways.  If fish stocks in rivers are running down it is not because of drainage.  Perhaps we should look at the Atlantic, where the problems are really caused.</P>
    <P>I support Senator Rory Kiely's criticism of Senator McDonagh's comments about Senator Fahey.  Senator Fahey came here with an open mind and there was no mention of politics in his contribution. He was concerned about the people he represents.  All political parties <Col N="423" /> must work together to help the victims of the flooding.  Something must be done.  No one should say it was an act of God or it did not happen in the last 100 years, because it might happen again.</P>
    <P>Two weeks ago we spoke about flooding. I returned to my constituency to a meeting in Ballyduff, in the Cashen catchment area.  The main streets in that town were severely flooded.  In Kilmoyley a young man was building a house; he had not put in the windows or doors and there was three feet of water in the house.  He will not continue building his home and I do not know who will pay for it.</P>
    <P>All the houses in the area were flooded and no compensation was put in place for those people.  A sum of £2 million was allocated to compensate the farming community for fodder and damage to livestock.  What about the people who have been forced to move out of their homes to live in guesthouses or with relatives or neighbours until their lives return to normal?  No compensation has been put in place for those people and the Minister must see if a scheme can be set up.</P>
    <P>Money was made available when the Dodder flooded.  When flooding occurs in places with a large population, and with RTE cameras close by, a big commotion is made; helicopters, ambulances, etc. are provided.  However, in rural areas where a small number of people will be flooded, unless those people and we as their representatives highlight the problem, the media would not go near them.</P>
    <P>The west of Ireland is a disaster area in terms of flooding.  This has been happening for a number of years and must be tackled.  Main drainage schemes provide the answer.  Some people said new types of drainage have led to pockets of water gathering in areas where they cannot evaporate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="424" /> I had a drainage problem in a premises I owned in partnership with my bank until it took the property from me. I was flooded once a year until my neighbours and I formed a community group and started a drainage project under the local improvement scheme.  If more money was given through that source, water could be diverted into the major waterways and the Office of Public Works could do the main drainage works.  That would alleviate the problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister should examine this Bill, amend it if he wishes and put it through the Houses.  This is not a political football, it is an answer to a problem for many people.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister and his officials back to the Seanad, only a week after our debate on flood damage.  It is good that this Bill has been put down because it allows debate of the issues involved.  The present flooding is concentrated in the west.  If the Minister and his officials hear much more on the subject they will become waterlogged.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, but I ask Senator Daly to do the logical thing.  Senator Kiely quoted one section of the Minister's contribution but he took it out of context; the Minister clearly stated his Bill is ready.  It has gone through various Departments and is ready to come to this House.</P>

      <P>The Minister said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will deal first with the argument that the Bill is unnecesary.  When I first addressed this I indicated that I was confident that the proposals for the amendment of the Arterial Drainage <Col N="425" /> Act, which have been prepared by the Office of Public Works on the instructions of the previous Government, would shortly be cleared by him for submission to Government.  I am happy to be able to inform the House tonight that the Minister for Finance, after careful study of the proposals, has now cleared them. They are being circulated to the relevant Government Depatments for observations in accordance with standard procedure.</P>
    <P>Nothing could be clearer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>

      <P>Whether it takes six months or three months, it is in preparation. We should do a good job.  We represent rural constituencies, which have taken the brunt of the flooding over time.  I remind Senator Daly that for the past nine years Fianna Fáil was in office as the larger or only party in Government and did not introduce any Bill.</P>
      <P>Flooding did not first happen in January 1995, it has happened down through the years.  I remember debates which took place in these Houses when the Minister was the late James Dillon. Much good work was done at that time, but for the last 20 years little arterial drainage work has been done.  We must return to that work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not make the main points of my speech now as there is only one minute <Col N="426" /> left before lunch.  There has been a great deal of repetition, because the statements on flooding took place a week ago.  The Minister must be bored listening to the same points being made all the time.  The issue of coast erosion must be examined.  I will seek amendments to the Minister's Bill to deal with that problem.  Wexford has 140 miles of coastline and there is a huge problem with coast erosion.  This is an island and almost all areas of the country, including the Minister's constituency, have been affected by it.  It is a serious problem and we should include a provision in this Bill to deal with it.</P>

    <Title>Role of Seanad Éireann: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason we are having this debate today and are entering this process arises out of a commitment I gave when I was appointed Leader of the House.  In my first statement to the House as Leader I said that priorities would be the reform of Seanad procedures in the widest possible sense and a search to ensure that Seanad Éireann was as relevant as any second House can be as we move into the new century. I also said that I would consult widely with other parties in the House to try to achieve these ends, that I would do so within a fairly short period of time, that I would not unduly rush the debate, but nor would I allow it lie on the Order Paper for a long period of time.  These were commitments which I gave and today we are beginning this process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset I wish to indicate the nature of the debate and the way in which it should proceed.  I am very conscious of the long debate we had in the last Seanad and very conscious of the contribution of so many speakers from all parties to that debate.  It lasted a number of months and covered virtually <Col N="427" /> every aspect of the historical role of the Seanad and its role as it should be in the years ahead.  That debate generated a large number of interesting ideas which I intend to put on the record of the House today as the basis and guideline for discussion to ensure that people will not spend their time reinventing wheels or going down well trodden paths and that there will be at least a structure to the debate.</P>
    <P>There are two reasons why we should spend some time on a general debate, starting today.  The first of these is that almost one half of the Members of the House were not Members of the last Seanad.  The turnover in both Houses of late has been, for those of us who have been here a while, uncomfortably high. All of us are very conscious of the fact that we are tenants of time in whatever House to which we have the privilege to be elected.</P>
    <P>There are almost 30 new Members of the House and it is important that they be given an opportunity to contribute to this debate.  There are many young Members and Members of great distinction, such as Senator Lee, Senator Quinn, Senator Henry and Senator Wilson. There are therefore many new Members who have now had two years in which to observe the way we do our business in the House.  They have joined the House with fresh eyes and it will be interesting to hear their contributions as to how they believe the role of the Seanad should be defined.</P>
    <P>During this time there has also been an unprecedented degree of change in the other House.  The Dáil went along for decades almost without change and the procedures and practice were for many decades those which were established at the foundation of State.  There was a burst of reforming activity in the 1980s when we saw the establishment of wide range of committees, but with the beginning of the last Fianna Fáil/Labour Government we saw the beginnings of the putting in place of a fairly wide range of reforms in the other House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="428" /> To a great extent these reforms have bypassed this House and, specifically, we have found ourselves excluded from a majority of committees.  I lobbied very hard with the Government to ensure that as far as possible any new committees would be joint committees, and I can say with some satisfaction that virtually every one of the new committees is a joint committee which will ensure that there will be representation for Members of the Seanad.  In addition, as Senator Norris pointed out this morning, the membership of the Seanad on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs has been doubled.</P>
    <P>Progress has been made, therefore, but we should also be seeking ways in which the Seanad has its own distinctive part to play, because we are not a carbon copy of the other House and we were not intended to be such.  We were intended to make a distinctive contribution.</P>
    <P>The procedure I propose we follow is that today I will outline most of the main points &mdash; taken from a synopsis comprehensively prepared for me by the staff of the House &mdash; made in the previous debate to ensure that they are on the record and that the ideas and changes proposed are available, allowing people to examine them at their leisure without having to go through a further reiteration or lengthy debate on them.  Following that I want the debate to stretch over not more than a couple of weeks and, if need be, we could invite submissions from outside groups, former Members, academics or members of the public who have views as to how the Seanad should operate and the role it should play.</P>
    <P>People may wish to give us their views in written form, or we could invite them to attend to make submission.  For example, people such as former Senator Jim Dooge, a man of great experience of the Seanad, and former Senator Eoin Ryan &mdash; and I only wish the late Willie Ryan was still with us &mdash; who loved this House can also take a critical look and tell us how we might change our procedures or undertake things differently.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="429" /> We should be very open if there are people from outside who wish to come and talk to us &mdash; and we can arrange for this procedurally &mdash; or who wish to make written submissions, because one of the things which has changed the nature of both Houses is our friend up in the corner, the television camera.  Over the last two years we are, for the first time, going into the homes of people, because &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; is watched to a considerable extent.  Many of us now find that we are being recognised in the streets, perhaps in places where we do not wish to be recognised, by virtue of people seeing us on the screen.  The House has therefore opened up, as have the procedures, and it should be a two way process.  If people have views which they wish to put about how these Houses should operate let us hear them.</P>
    <P>I then propose to establish a small all party committee.  In the past questions of reform have been handled by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. From my experience, and with no disrespect to the committee, of which I am privileged to be a Member, it is not the right vehicle to push through reforms of this kind.  It is too big and many of its Members are very busy in other respects.  I wish therefore to establish a small all party group comprising of perhaps one person from each party. It is not a question of people being represented according to size; this is a committee whose purpose is to consider proposals and come back with ideas.  This small all party group will go through the various proposals which have been established and I will ask the Government to provide some secretarial back up for the duration of the committee. It will examine what has been said by Members or by outside people and will report back to the House, hopefully within a reasonable time.  I hope it will report back by the end of this session, which would not be a bad rate of progress. Perhaps over the summer we can define and refine the proposals.</P>
    <P>In any discussion on reform of the Seanad, we have to be very conscious <Col N="430" /> of where we are starting from.  We are starting from within the confines of a Constitution which is very specific in relation to the role and nature of the Seanad and imposes constitutional limitations on the Seanad.  We are not the dominant House.  The dominant House is the Dáil, to which the Government is accountable and which elects the Government.  We were never meant to be in competition with the Dáil.</P>
    <P>None of us was a Member of the first Seanad which in 1934, because of the different timing of elections, found itself in conflict with Mr. de Valera.  There was a non-Fianna Fáil majority in the Upper House and a Fianna Fáil Government in the Lower House.  The then Seanad, which could hold up legislation for 18 months, rejected a number of Bills which Mr. de Valera wanted to put through.  He replied with the expedient of introducing a Bill in the Dáil to abolish the Seanad, which was passed by the Dáil but, unsurprisingly, not by the Seanad.  Eighteen months later the Seanad was abolished.</P>
    <P>As a historian, I have no doubt that Mr. de Valera was completely right in what he did.  There is no contest if there is a conflict between a popularly elected Lower House and an indirectly elected Upper House.  The voice of the people is reflected in the Lower House and there can only be one winner.  It is very clear in the Constitution that we are not intended to be in competition with the Lower House or to obstruct its will.</P>
    <P>That does not mean that there is not a variety of other extremely useful and important roles for this House, such as the obvious ones of the scrutiny and initiating of legislation.  Senator Daly's Bill is a very good example of what I hope will be an increasing feature of this House over the coming two years. Whether Private Members' Bills are accepted or rejected is a matter for the House, but the very fact that a Bill is debated carefully in the House opens up public debate, puts on pressure and is part of the work which we should be doing.  There is a whole range of ideas and topics which we should discuss.  We <Col N="431" /> have only begun to scratch the surface of what is possible.  However, it must all be within the confines of the Constitution, which is master of us all.</P>
    <P>Another very distinctive fundamental aspect of the Seanad, from which we cannot shirk, is its vocational nature. The vocational concepts upon which this Seanad are based may have been very particular to the 1930s, especially the dominant Catholic social thinking of that time, and may not be relevant today.  The vocational representation of our State today may be found in bodies such as the NESC, the employer labour talks and the various structures which have in some senses almost turned this into a corporate State, where business is done by the various sectors dealing directly with the Government.</P>
    <P>After examining the vocational underpinning of this House we may decide that it has no great reality, which I do not think it has, and that it is not a particularly good idea anyway.  Perhaps we could, within what is available to us, start looking at other categories which might be represented here or other roles for the Seanad.  I look forward in particular to Senator Lee's contribution on this question.  Everybody's views will be of interest and value but, as a historian, he may have a special insight into the way in which the Seanad should move on this question.</P>
    <P>There are other questions which we need to look at.  We are not alone in having a second House as at least nine of the current 15 EU member states have an Upper House.  I can say with certainty that eight of the original 12 have an Upper House, although I have not checked on Austria.  Finland and Sweden.  Upper Houses are the norm in the majority of EU states and, with one or two exceptions, they all have a somewhat similar role to ours.</P>
    <P>I find this interesting because occasionally criticism is made of the electorate of the majority of Members of this House, that is, that elected county councillors elect the majority of Senators.  That, in fact, is the norm in <Col N="432" /> different forms in many EU member states.  Most members of the French Senate, for example, are elected by the councillors and mayors of the small towns of France.  In Spain, most members of the second House are elected from regional councils.  There is nothing too different about the way in which the majority of the Members of this House are elected.</P>
    <P>We are unique in that this is the only Parliament where Members are elected by university graduates; but, however indefensible this may be in democratic theory, the reality is that some of the finest Members of this Seanad came from the university constituencies.  I do not think that anybody would seriously suggest that this should not be an ongoing part of the Seanad.  I would say to Senator Farrell that some of them may occasionally say things which drive us all mad.  However, that is very valuable in a House such as this which needs elements of difference.</P>
    <P>The question arises as to what sort of model we should have for a second House.  We should commission somebody &mdash; or I could do it myself &mdash; to look at second Houses in the other EU states to see if there is anything which we can usefully learn from them. However, we should not be circumscribed by what people do elsewhere. We have an opportunity now to put a distinctive shape on how we do our business and on the role of the Seanad. We could look at new ideas, but we should also try to adapt what we have. We forget too easily that we in this House are the inheritors of 70 years of tradition.  We have had two very different Seanads but this House has been in existence, with a short break, since 1922. In all of that time we have learned to do some things right and we should try to build and adapt where we have had some degree of success.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, the only real criteria when we come to evaluate what we want to do are whether we are effective and efficient, whether this House gives value to the taxpayer for the moneys which are expended upon it and whether this <Col N="433" /> House makes a real contribution to Irish public life.  Whatever we do, we must seek to answer these questions.  The only ultimate justification for a Seanad is that it is a good one.  &ldquo;Good&rdquo; can be defined in a wide variety of ways such as making a real contribution to public debate.</P>
    <P>I become very impatient with people who refer to Parliament as a mere talking shop and a place for hot air.  Such people forget that the origin of the word &ldquo;parliament&rdquo; comes from the word &ldquo;parley&rdquo;, meaning &ldquo;to talk&rdquo;, where people came together to exchange views and resolve differences by talking rather than by resorting to knocking each other's heads off.  A Parliament is often at its most effective when it is the forum and sounding board for ideas about the shaping of future society and different aspects of legislation, where people are conducting a national debate on issues that matter to the people of the country. If this House can be more effective as a forum and talking shop, we need make no apology.  It is one of our most important and vital functions.</P>
    <P>There are other areas which we have not begun to investigate.  Parliaments are increasingly becoming the interface for different groups in the public arena and Members of Parliament.  People are given an audience and the right to put their case.  It is often broadcast on television and the changes they want are put on record.  This has a very valuable function.  People have a sense of not being alienated.  They are listened to and given a chance to put across their views.  They are given a respectful and careful hearing and it may be that those sitting in the ministerial chair will learn from what has been said.</P>
    <P>I wish to open the debate by putting forward some of these ideas.  I do not want this to be a long process, but I want the ideas to be discussed and examined in some detail.  A small committee will be set up, which can, if necessary, take outside submissions.  We will move on from there and we may be in a position to come forward with real proposals by the end of the session <Col N="434" /> which will have the backing of all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>It is important to stress that it is not the job of the Government to reform any House of Parliament; it is the job of the House itself.  The only worthwhile reforms will be those which have the support of all parties in the House.  We must all go ahead together on this matter. The more effectively we do our business and the better value we give to the public, the more it redounds to all our credit, enriches public life and enhances the public's view of parliamentary institutions.</P>
    <P>I intended putting on the record the synopsis of the recommendations from the last debate.  However, it is a long statement, containing approximately 12 pages.  I will just indicate the areas covered by it and then arrange to have it circulated to every Member of the House rather than reading it all into the record now.  It deals with the Order of Business, which all Members agree needs to be changed, adjournment debates, the possibility of Question Time, topical issues and Standing Order 29.  All these areas are covered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>It was done at the end of the last Seanad.  It also covers the way in which we deal with legislation on Second and Committee Stages, research facilities, amendments, guillotine motions, allocation of non-Government time, Private Members' Business, the contribution of Ministers, Private Members' Bills and parliamentary committees. It also deals with another area which many Members would find very useful.  This is a development of the European dimension.  Even though there are proposals for a joint European Affairs Committee, only a small number of Senators will be on this committee.  I am not pre-empting anything, but it <Col N="435" /> would be useful if we could have a full debate on European matters one day a month.  What I would have in mind is inviting a Commissioner, a Member of the European Parliament, an academic engaged in research or a practitioner to raise issues and to hold a discussion &mdash; without votes, motions or statements &mdash; in the House on European matters.</P>
      <P>The European dimension is sadly lacking in the House.  We all realise how seldom we have debates on reports on developments in the EU.  We did not have debates on the accession of new members or the enlargement of the Community and we have not discussed defence policy or neutrality.  The range of issues arising from our membership of the EU is enormous.  There are agricultural issues, for example, and we simply have not got around to addressing them.  It may be that a special dedicated time, perhaps one day or two days set apart each month, could deal with this matter.</P>
      <P>The recommendations also cover the whole question of the vocational nature of the Seanad, elections and the register of nominating bodies, qualification of candidates, university panels and Taoiseach's nominees.  With some degree of prescience, there is also a section dealing with emigrant representatives. There are sections on research facilities, the status of the Leader of the House and the appointment of Senators as Ministers and Ministers of State.  This document is the essence of the previous long debate in the House.  We will arrange to have it circulated and it will hopefully form the basis of our discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In opening this debate I am honouring a commitment I gave at the beginning of the session.  I also wish to make it clear that I want this to produce results quickly, not on the basis of rushing something through but on the pooled wisdom of Members of the House.  This will result in practical proposals, upon which there will be a wide measure of agreement to start <Col N="436" /> implementing them, perhaps in the autumn session.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is probably presumptuous of me to suggest Seanad reform, given that I am a relative newcomer to the House.  Nevertheless, sometimes somebody new in an area can take a more objective view than others who have been there quite a while.  I welcome the Leader of the House's statement and I assure him of Fianna Fáil cooperation in working to find meaningful ways to make changes which will be relevant and in the best interest of the House.</P>
      <P>This debate is timely, given that reforms have been introduced in the other House.  As Senator Manning said, the Seanad has not kept pace with those developments, although there has been a welcome indication from Government in recent times that legislation will be introduced in the House.  Nevertheless, the Seanad affords an opportunity, even within the constraints at present, for the introduction of certain Private Members' legislation.  In this context I emphasise the importance of the availability of research facilities to help Opposition parties in particular deal with complex legal matters, such as the drafting of legislation.</P>
      <P>Somebody asked me yesterday &ldquo;Who drafted that Bill for you?&rdquo;&mdash; the Arterial Drainage (Amendment) Bill &mdash; as if after 22 years in the Oireachtas I would not be in a position to draft a Bill, good, bad or indifferent.  However, this is a reflection of an attitude abroad that the Seanad is somehow a House of secondary importance and that key decisions are not made here.  The Seanad can make a very meaningful contribution towards changing the public perception of the House by adopting procedural reforms, new methods of dealing with issues that require attention and the initiation and introduction of legislation which would be of benefit to the community at large.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate is also timely, given yesterday's discussion of the Framework Document.  In the next number of years <Col N="437" /> we all wish to see hopeful signs of development and co-operation between ourselves and political colleagues in the northern part of Ireland.  There is now a widespread belief that we are facing a new era in Irish politics and a new dimension in Ireland between North and South.  New cross Border institutions have been mentioned and new dialogue in under discussion.</P>
    <P>In the debate on Seanad reform it would be timely to examine ways in which we could introduce reforms which would strengthen the bonds of communication between us and our colleagues in the new Assembly which will be established in Northern Ireland and perhaps also with our colleagues in the UK.  I am not certain &mdash; perhaps the Leader of the House knows &mdash; whether the Seanad is represented on the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>These are welcome signs that the Seanad is playing its part in the dialogue.  I was a member of the last Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs &mdash; I hope a new one will soon be established. Senators have had in that committee the opportunity of expressing the views of this House on the important international issues of the day, whether that be difficulties in the former Yugoslavia, problems in Rwanda or in Africa generally or the South African elections.  The Seanad was able to make a contribution to these important international areas and have it recorded through this committee. It would be my wish to see that expanded.  I fully support the views expressed by Senator Manning.  I welcome the establishment of an all-party committee and would wish to see it get down to business fairly quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be unwise to extend the reform into too many areas that would take up a lot of time and run into some public controversies.  We might find at the end of the day that after a period of discussion and dialogue we still have not come up with any real meaningful changes.  My preference would be to see <Col N="438" /> the House target a few key areas and reform them in a speedy fashion so that by this time next year we could see the results of this new initiative.</P>
    <P>We recently had a discussion on emigrant representation and how that might be addressed.  As the Leader knows, the Government has indicated some discussion on Seanad representation &mdash; either by way of direct election or by some form of nomination, perhaps through the Taoiseach's nominees &mdash; for our emigrants.  This was welcomed by all sides of the House.  It should be urgently put on our agenda as a priority area to be examined.  In debating that issue we suggested that an all-party Oireachtas committee might be established to look at it.  We would certainly need to put that on the agenda as an area where positive action could be taken.</P>
    <P>I have already suggested to the Leader that we should put in place in this House a forum where we would have an opportunity to hear the views of some of the vocational bodies, perhaps on a three or six monthly or an annual basis.  The leaders of the IFA and the ICMSA could come here in the same way as a Minister, make a presentation and engage in dialogue on issues relative to the vocational item on the agenda.  I am sure the representatives of many of the vocational bodies who have representation here would only be too glad to see the leaders of their organisations have an input to our debates.  A formula could be established quickly to make that kind of arrangement.  I would like the leader of the IFA to come to the House and talk to us on a regular basis about problems in the farming area.  People in the other farming bodies could also join in this debate.</P>
    <P>This type of arrangement already exists in the European Union institutions. Once or twice a year organisations like COPA, the European farmers' organisation, have an opportunity to meet with the Council of Ministers and the Commission in a tripartite dialogue which has been beneficial to the European Union, both at Council of <Col N="439" /> Ministers level and in the European Parliament.  It would be possible to have a day set aside here, maybe once or twice a year, when two or three bodies, such as the teachers' organisations, farmers lobbies or organisations representing women's issues could attend.</P>
    <P>Women are still under represented in this House and they are still being discriminated against nationally.  The last time discussion took place on this issue here four to five years ago, many Members made the point that there was a necessity for more female vocational bodies to get representation so that they would be given nominating body status. I am aware that the list of nominating bodies is revised every year, but I am not so sure that the general public knows.  Before I was elected to the Oireachtas I worked for a public body. I drew their attention to the fact that they could nominate people to the nominating bodies panels and that was done by that organisation at the time.</P>
    <P>It would be desirable to have a forum in this House for members of the European Parliament to come here, as well as experts from the Commission.  This could also be arranged in a similar way to what I have suggested for members of the vocational bodies.  If we could have a debate a few times a year on developments in the European Union, which we are obliged to debate anyway, we could invite a representative number of parliamentarians from the European Parliament.  From my dealings with them, both nationally and during my experience there, I know that they would be more than willing to come here, speak to us and keep us abreast of developments in the Union.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that the European Union is expanding, enlarging and developing.  It is strengthening the bonds within existing member states. The Union is likely to expand in a significant way, further down to the Mediterranean countries and into the former Soviet Union.  At a time of enormous change in the Union, I think it is essential that we would have both in this and <Col N="440" /> the other House the assistance and advice of the people who are at the coal-face &mdash; the members of the European Parliament.  It is essential that we have the opportunity to hear from them about the current state of play on enlargement, the impact it will have on our economy and the political dimension involved.  It is timely that we look at the possibility of putting some arrangement in place to have members of the European Parliament come here on a regular basis, speak to us and put forward their points of view so that we could have dialogue and a permanent communication link between them and this House.</P>
    <P>This would also afford an opportunity to have communication with the Commission and the institutions of the European Parliament.  I suggest that as the occasion arises here, when we have a debate on important matters like, for example, the Regional Development Fund &mdash; Fianna Fáil Members have a motion on the agenda to discuss the question of funding for regional development, especially with regard to Border areas &mdash; it would be important for us to have the ability to bring the Commissioner responsible for the Regional Development Fund to the House.  In the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, at Dublin Castle, we have seen European Parliament members successfully address and put forward their points of view in a forthright way on North-South developments and between ourselves and Europe.  It is important that we would keep that dialogue, not only with members of the European Parliament but also with the administration at the level of Commissioner. I have no doubt whatever in my mind &mdash; I am sure Senator Farrell would fully agree with me on this &mdash; that no one would be more welcome to address the House than Commissioner Flynn, who has a key role to play in the development of European policies on unemployment and such matters.</P>
    <P>I do not want to talk about the constituencies. There will be differing views about the electorate and on how one <Col N="441" /> would deal with reform of that.  I believe representation should be on a provincial basis whereby representatives would be elected in each province rather than from the 26 counties.  That is something which could be considered by the committee. Somebody suggested that this could be done on the basis of the European Parliament constituencies.  I have always argued about dividing them into single seats, so I am not sure if is the best way to do that.  The possibility of elections on a regional basis should be considered.  It would not change the electorate or the number of Members, but it would confine elections to provincial areas.</P>
    <P>This is a timely opportunity to look at procedures.  I support the call for a type of Question Time in the House.  I was glad to hear that the Minister for the Marine offered to reply to questions in the House, which is a break with tradition. It would be advantageous, from the point of view of representing the interests which put us here, that we would have the opportunity to raise questions relevant to the vocational bodies we represent or speak for.  I was elected on the Agricultural Panel and since then I have had many representations from people concerned about agricultural issues.  I have endeavoured to raise them within the confines of the procedures of the House.  A Question Time, along the lines as that in the other House, but perhaps a tighter arrangement. would be useful.  If there was a regular Question Time once a week on a Thursday afternoon, we could deal with a number of Departments in an efficient way, with strict time limits and procedural arrangements so that it would not be an opportunity for political debate.</P>
    <P>This is a welcome debate and I assure the Leader of the House he will have our full co-operation.  I suggest the key areas to look at are representation. communication and dialogue with the European Parliament, North-South arrangements, the new political arrangements <Col N="442" /> there which will involve us more as parliamentarians in discussions with the new administrative or political structures in the Six Counties, and the opportunity for vocational bodies to come here on a regular basis to brief us on relevant issues which would make a contribution to the development of our political institutions and economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to voice my opinions on the recommendations on Seanad reform.  I have been a member of a local authority, Dáil Éireann and now Seanad Éireann, which I have found to be a fulfilling experience.  The level of debate, the wide-ranging interests and the matters discussed in the House have always given me great satisfaction.  The Seanad is an important part of our democracy.</P>
      <P>At times we get involved in the cut and thrust of party politics when legislation is going through the House, but other debates are more relaxed and responsible, and this has been highlighted on many occasions in regard to the debates on Northern Ireland. Members have made worthwhile contributions on that subject because the Seanad provides them with a great opportunity to express their views and to add another dimension to the various approaches.  The Seanad has contributed much to the national question and to the restoration of peace on this island.  I have always found it to be worthwhile in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal to allocate three Seanad seats to emigrants is welcome.  Plans for the implementation of this proposal have yet to come before us.  As a former emigrant, who spent three or four years in London, I was involved in the Longford County Association there.  The Irish living abroad have highlighted this country and have built up many contacts through business, sport and voluntary organisations.  They have become unofficial ambassadors who represent everything <Col N="443" /> that is good about this country. From a tourism point of view, emigrants have done a lot to boost the image of Ireland, to sell it as a tourist destination and to encourage investment.  This proposal would be worthwhile if implemented and would give the Seanad a new dimension in that regard. There has been much talk about this subject over the years; it is now time to follow it through and put the proposal to provide three seats for emigrants.</P>
    <P>Over the years the Seanad, as the second House of Parliament, has not been given sufficient status, and back-up facilities, for example, are not what they should be.  In other parts of the world democracy is not enjoyed by all and some have given their lives for it. For a long time tyrants and dictators have dominated people who longed for democracy.  This part of the island has enjoyed democracy for 75 years and the Seanad is an important part of the workings of our democracy.</P>
    <P>Members of the Seanad were not given their full status and full recognition of the important role they play in the working of democracy and passing legislation.  All Members would agree that more secretarial facilities, office space, etc., should be available.  It is not that they want to be selfish or to make themselves more important but it is a necessary back-up facility.  In all walks of life one has to have back-up facilities, and we all agree that improvements in that area would be of enormous help.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased this issue is being debated.  It is important that it should be although it will appear abstract to many people outside and, perhaps, even to some in the House.  I agree with what has been said by the Leader, Senator Daly and Senator Belton, and if a fair proportion of what has been said can be acted on, it can make a significant difference to the way we conduct our proceedings and to the <Col N="444" /> value of those proceedings for a wider public.</P>
      <P>I will begin by taking up what has been said about research resources.  I am an admirer of the quality of debate in the Seanad.  In my brief period here I have been impressed with the quality of contributions.  I am even more an admirer in the light of the handicaps under which Senators labour in trying to contribute constructively to debate.  The absence of research resources and facilities is scandalous if we are remotely serious about trying to ensure that public representatives can make their most effective possible contribution to discourse.</P>
      <P>I am in the relatively fortunate position in that I come from an institution, a career and a background where many of the issues discussed here would be part of what I think about professionally. I would hate to be in the position of party spokespersons on particular topics, and more so Members who are not spokespersons, if I wanted to make a worthwhile contribution, often at very short notice.</P>
      <P>An unfortunate feature of the way we conduct our business and the way we have to conduct a certain amount of it, is how little notice there is of when issues will be on the agenda.  A way should be found in which that can be improved and more notice can be given from time to time of some topics &mdash; I appreciate that others have to be taken at short notice.  I urge that the maximum possible notice be given of the agenda for the whole session rather than on a week to week basis where one may only find out a couple of days in advance what is to be debated, although it may have been possible to notify Members much further in advance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one does not have the back-up resources required &mdash; and virtually nobody in this Chamber does &mdash; when preparing a speech on a complex topic at very short notice it puts an enormous strain on Members to contribute effectively. <Col N="445" /> I am not sufficiently familiar with all the procedures by which items come on the agenda, but whatever can be done ought to be done as a matter of urgency &mdash; and I hope it will be done in the course of this session &mdash; to give Members more notice so they can prepare adequately, which they could do if the research and administrative resources were available.</P>
    <P>It is scandalous &mdash; and I do not use the term loosely or rhetorically &mdash; to expect Members to be able to debate issues effectively without the required back-up.  That leaves the public representatives at the mercy of the ministerial contribution which, in many cases, means at the mercy of the civil service contribution.  I am not for a moment decrying the calibre of the Civil Service or of Ministers &mdash; perhaps I should not say &ldquo;of most Ministers&rdquo;&mdash; but there cannot be an optimum exchange between the official mind, as reflected at Civil Service and ministerial level, and the mind of Members of the Oireachtas if the information and research stakes are so unequal.  We will not be able to maximise our contribution until something significant is done about that.</P>
    <P>Senator Magner and the Leader of the House reported to the House about a year ago on improving research and information resources in the Oireachtas as a whole.  I do not know what has happened about that.  One of our problems is feedback as to what has happened about proposals which have been approved here.  We do not know if anything is happening; if it is not happening, why not; if somebody is consciously blocking it, for whatever motive, or if there is some objective reason the principle is rejected or, if it is accepted, why it cannot be implemented for reasons beyond immediate control.</P>
    <P>The lack of feedback is one of the more depressing aspects of service in this House &mdash; feedback on proposals <Col N="446" /> such as that mentioned and feedback in terms of what difference this House makes to legislation.  I know that at the end of the year we may get a list from the Leader of Bills that have gone through the House but that is different from being able to identify what difference their going through the House makes.  While one does not wish to conduct a <i>post mortem</i> in detail on the events of a session, it would be useful for our own self-education to find out what difference, if any, we have made over the year to the bulk of legislation.</P>
    <P>There should be a way of monitoring the implications of our input or what notice has been taken &mdash; if the slightest blind bit of notice has been taken &mdash; of many of the contributions made here.  It is not &ldquo;accountability&rdquo; in the way in which the term is normally used but an attempt to keep ourselves informed of the role we are playing, apart from going through the formalities of debate in the House.  If an approach could be made to that it would be useful in focusing our minds on how we could contribute more effectively and in focusing the minds of others as to whether they are paying attention to what is discussed here in terms of the formulation of policy, whether in Bills initiated here or Bills coming to us from the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I hope the Leader will have an opportunity to consider that, in terms of assessing feedback and impact and of trying to foster a sense that we make some difference.  It is easy to get the impression &mdash; and many have the impression &mdash; that we make no difference whatsoever.  We need to have an assessment of whether we do.</P>
    <P>With regard to our back-up facilities, I was disturbed to hear that our secretaries do not have the opportunity for retraining or for in-career development, even to cope with new computer programmes; that is, or it ought to be, normal in the Civil Service.  Apparently, they are privately hired and are not regarded as civil servants for the purpose <Col N="447" /> of being able to develop their skills and capacities.  If that is the case, it should be considered unacceptable.  The Oireachtas should not have a less trained staff at its disposal, and facilities available to civil servants ought to be available to Members of the Oireachtas in terms of providing back-up in their offices, even as they are at present, and much less in terms of the provision of research facilities.</P>
    <P>The issue arose of particular topics that might be debated at greater length here and I agree with the proposals made.  I would stress Northern Ireland and Europe in particular.  In a sense we have perhaps had a phoney peace on Northern Ireland in this Chamber, as indeed in the Dáil, over the last couple of years.  We have had statements on Northern Ireland from time to time as the new documents and declarations have come out and they have been very worthwhile.  However, they have not been debates.  They have been a mobilisation of support for the general thrust of policy on Northern Ireland.  That is very desirable, I am not in the least complaining about that.  Some very impressive contributions have been made, but in regard to Northern Ireland we are now, I hope, entering a period where we should be able to go beyond simple statements of mutual support and begin to look a little more closely at the specific issues that arise in the context of the negotiations, discussions and debates that will, we hope, inevitably follow from the Framework Document.</P>
    <P>This Chamber might think of developing an expertise on North-South relations and the implications of proposed changes.  North and South, but not in a party adversarial way because it would be extremely unfortunate if Northern Ireland became a major party political issue.  We should not have to rely entirely on the work of civil servants, however valuable that work is, has been and will be.  Contributions by <Col N="448" /> politicians should not be confined to statements of high moral purpose.  I hope it may be possible to think of this Chamber as having a role to play on the debating of Northern Ireland and North-South issues.</P>
    <P>Likewise in regard to Europe, with the potential enlargement of the East, Maastricht, the Troika &mdash; which means we will have an input into Presidency matters from the beginning of 1996 and not just in the second half of 1996 and continuing into 1997 &mdash; the Seanad ought to become a forum for regular discussions of European affairs.  I fully support the proposals made in that direction.  To some extent, I hope we can play an educational role in that respect, provided of course that we manage to achieve the type of publicity for discussion in this Chamber which is so conspicuously lacking at present, unless it happens to be of a sensationalist variety or of a highly adversarial variety.</P>
    <P>None of us has worked out how to solve the publicity problem because there is a great discrepancy, as we are all aware, between the impression conveyed in public of the work of this Chamber &mdash; indeed of both Houses of the Oireachtas &mdash; and the unsung work that goes on here.  Unless one deliberately sets out to court the media by performing in a way which can be guaranteed to command headlines, one will almost certainly be ignored.  Perhaps that problem cannot be resolved but it ought to be confronted.  If there are ways of improving the assessment of what happens here and of drawing greater attention to it, then we ought to take cognisance of them.</P>
    <P>I mentioned Europe but there is a third area we should find a way to discuss more regularly.  It arises to some extent from the emigrants' issue that has been discussed.  I am speaking of the Third World affairs area, on which we have had discussions and about which we express our very genuine concern when a particular atrocity or tragedy arises, but these discussions tend to be a one off as each new problem arises. <Col N="449" /> We should be striving to balance our natural involvement in and concern with European affairs to preserve a certain sense of balance as to Ireland's historical role.  We should also be striving to develop expertise and make regular contributions in the area of Third World affairs.  It may be difficult to organise this in a coherent manner, but we should try to keep that in mind, whether in the context of a discussion on the United Nations or in any other way.  In focusing more on European affairs, we should not forget that we have connections which the President has been very fruitfully developing.  We also have connections which this Chamber might well want to try to discuss in a more systematic way from time to time.</P>
    <P>In general I welcome the Leader's proposal that there should be a committee of appropriate people to look at this matter.  Submissions should be taken from outside, whether from ex-Senators, from people who have experience of this Chamber or from people who would like to contribute, who have sufficient interest in what goes on here to be willing to take time to suggest how we might conduct our affairs more effectively and how we might contribute to the improvement of public discourse and public understanding of numerous very complex issues.</P>
    <P>To conclude I will come back to the point about resources available to Senators to enable them to master their briefs and not to oblige them to be the prisoners of whatever the fashionable thinking of the moment may be or whatever the media may be presenting as consensus opinion at a particular time. If the resources are not available to enable Senators to focus their thinking on these issues, then however worthy the issues, our contributions will fall far below what contributions we could be making if the affairs of the Oireachtas were adequately organised to enable us achieve our potential.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate and I particularly welcome the proposal <Col N="450" /> by the Leader of the House that a small subcommittee should be set up to discuss the reform of the Seanad.  As he rightly pointed out, this is something with which a small number of people can come to terms, taking on board all the various suggestions that are made in this debate, in the previous debate and by people from outside.  It needs that kind of small committee to bring forward definite proposals.  I welcome that.</P>
      <P>As other Senators have said, there has been debate on the reform of the Seanad from time to time, probably almost since its foundation.  Following a proposal for the abolition of the Seanad in 1957 a commission was set up; it reported in 1959 and made proposals. This is a debate we had over the years which it is very useful to have from time to time.  Reforms following on from previous debates have improved the effectiveness of the Seanad and I sincerely hope this debate will also result in practical reforms that will improve our functioning as Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>It is important to realise that we are bound by the Constitution and therefore there is a limit to the kind of reforms that can be brought in.  I support the suggestion that we look at how we are elected but that is obviously bound by the Constitution so I do not know whether there is any scope for change in the area of vocational representation, an area that has been discussed outside this Chamber.  A large number of Labour Party Senators, including myself, are new to the Seanad so my opinion does not draw on a great length of expertise.  However, I welcome the fact that I may express my views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Lee made an important point in relation to having as much information as possible on forthcoming legislation and the business we are going to discuss here, but the practicalities are such that sometimes we do not know very far in advance exactly what legislation will be available to us at particular times.  We have a general idea of what legislation is forthcoming and the House gets an indication from time to time, but being more precise is difficult. <Col N="451" /> Nevertheless we should be as precise as we can and give Members as much notice as possible of the business that will be discussed.</P>
    <P>Senator Lee's point about having research facilities is very important.  To some extent, for those of us who are in political parties, I assume it is the duty of the party to provide us with research facilities but there should also be general access to research facilities for all Members.  We should invite contributions from bodies and individuals outside the House to give us their views on issues coming before the House, and the suggestion that such bodies should have a direct input into the subcommittee is a good one.  I would particularly welcome an input from the Youth Council of Ireland in view of the survey which was published last week.  This was done in Arklow and indicated that young people have a very scanty knowledge of politics and politicians.  This House might be a vehicle for listening to what the representatives of young people have to say about why young people do not engage with politics and politicians in a way we would like.  There may be something we can learn from that.  This House may be an appropriate vehicle for channelling the complaints I presume young people have about politics and why they see it as not being very relevant to their lives.</P>
    <P>Debates on Northern Ireland and the European Union are important.  We have had a number of good debates on Northern Ireland and should continue with this. I would support more direct contacts with the EU.  If it were possible to bring Members of the European Parliament or EU Commissioners to the House, it would be a very worthwhile development. People generally feel they do not have enough contact with their MEPs and MEPs probably feel they do not have the channels needed to make what happens in the EU more relevant and accessible to people.  If we can perform a function in this area we should do so.</P>
    <P>Other Senators referred to the possibility of having a Question Time in the <Col N="452" /> House and this is a good idea.  Having debates with short speeches is a good idea.  This happens in some Parliaments. Speeches would be for only three or four minutes but it would be possible to have a large number of speeches on issues and there could be the facility for people to reply to points made.  For example, if Senator Cassidy made a point and I responded to it, he would have the opportunity to react to what I said about the points he made.  This would facilitate debate rather than speech making.  A debate should give people the right to react to what other people say, and this is one method we should investigate.  I would find this much more effective than long speeches followed by other long speeches, some of which are prepared in advance of what other people say.  This kind of interaction would provoke real debate between Members and would be very useful.</P>
    <P>There is a function for the Seanad to air minority causes and issues which may not get to the floor of the other House very often.  We should be able to fulfil this function and it has been done in the past.  I am not too sure about the cause being advocated outside the gate at the moment.  Some causes are overstated. I am thinking of issues on which a relatively small number of people would have expertise and be concerned about.</P>
    <P>In the last few weeks I did research on the history of my party in the Seanad.  I presume what I found would apply to other parties.  The Seanad has been very useful in terms of Private Members' Bills, amendments to legislation and being able to air the detail of legislation and current issues in a way which is not as confrontational as it sometimes might be in the other House. This may be because Ministers and the Front Bench spokespersons of parties do not sit in this House.  Members tend more to leave partisanship aside than the Members of the other House.  Sometimes this means we can have more wide ranging debates and deal with details of proposed amendments and current <Col N="453" /> issues in a way which is less confrontational and, therefore, more constructive.</P>
    <P>I welcome this debate.  Discussing the issue in the House is one aspect of it. Inviting views from people outside the House would be another useful aspect. I hope we will be able to set up a subcommittee and return to the issue again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the debate and congratulate the Leader for bringing it forward.  In the last debate on this issue he suggested that emigrants should be given representation in the House and this will be achieved.  It is a tribute to him that he was the first to advocate this and that the Government now intends to implement it.  This proves that this House can succeed in doing things.  I also agree with him that we should obtain advice from outside bodies and people who have no vested interest but who might see how best we could operate.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the Minister for the Defence and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, because he was the first Minister I know of to take questions and give answers to them.  This was very good and if it happened more often it would create a better relationship between Members and Ministers and would give us a greater understanding of issues than we have when Ministers come here with prepared speeches.  At the end of debates Ministers reply, but if a Member does not agree with a reply he or she does not have much chance of responding to it.  This type of reaction would improve debates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One must do one's own research.  We may put too much emphasis on research because most of us who speak on Bills are familiar with the situation on the ground.  We talk to people, have been involved for a number of years with local authorities and know exactly what we want to say from our hearts rather than reading from research scripts.  I agree with Senator Lee that our staff should have the opportunity and be given time off to retrain and keep abreast of modern technology.  Good secretaries <Col N="454" /> who are abreast of this &mdash; I know this from my secretary, who is excellent &mdash; can be very helpful, do research, obtain information from the Library rather than one having to waste one's time doing this oneself, and obtain a great deal of information on computers.</P>
    <P>This is important, but I would not like to see too much research because if we all use the same researcher we would all have the same kind of speeches and become brainwashed too quickly by this type of attitude.  The great thing about the Seanad is that people speak from their own perspective and what they know.  This gives us a greater overall view of the subject being debated because we listen to others as well as expressing our own views and this leads to a higher quality of debate.</P>
    <P>More Bills should be introduced in the Seanad.  When a Bill comes from the Lower House the Government parties, whether they like it or not, have to support it.  Some Bills were amended here for the better during the last term.  If they came here first there would be a freer debate.  As the former Senator, Mr. Harte, said when he spoke on this issue, being not entirely in agreement with the views of one's Government on a certain subject does not mean one will vote against it, but one could express one's views more easily if Bills were debated here first rather than having to rubber stamp them after they have gone through the other House.  I recall the former Senator, Professor Conroy, saying that there are many Bills which are not party political in any sense and which any reasonable Government could forward.  If non-contentious Bills &mdash; and even perhaps contentious Bills &mdash; were debated here first, we could all contribute to them.  This would avoid the glut in the period before the summer or Christmas recess when there is a rush of Bills.  Some Bills could be passed by this House earlier and then wait to be dealt with by the second House.  This would eliminate much of the rush and the perception that we take business too quickly and do not debate it properly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="455" /> We depend on the media and they depend on us.  However, they are not always sincere and do not always highlight the important debates and speeches.  It is the frivolous or outlandish statement made in jest across the floor that will make the headlines.  We are careful about that now since the debates are televised.  Television has done a great job for politicians because people can see their politician speaking and hear what he has to say.  It is much better than reading it in the paper.</P>
    <P>In light of the publication of the joint Framework Document we should take note of the establishment of new systems in the North.  People from the North have been great contributors in this House and have educated us.  There should be some reciprocal arrangement whereby members of both Government structures, when elected, could have joint meetings to debate issues of mutual benefit.  I speak not of political issues but economic issues such as tourism, fisheries, agriculture and so on.  It would be important to involve both them and Members from this House.</P>
    <P>The new regional committees are getting off the ground.  We should have more debate with them on a regional basis and link them into the political framework.  I do not know exactly how we could do it.  County councils are linked into the system through elected Members in the Seanad and also in the Dáil but the new regional councils seem to be out on a limb.  We have not linked with them in any positive way.</P>
    <P>New committees for the regions will be sitting in Brussels or Strasbourg.  I do not know if they are fully operational, but the Leader, when replying, might be able to tell us what is happening and give some details about their role.  We should in some way participate in that scheme.  This would enable an exchange of views.  The European Parliament is becoming the dominant Parliament, whether we like it or not, and we should have more contact there.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Leader that we should send some people to examine <Col N="456" /> Upper Houses in other countries.  I suggest it should be the Leader himself, the Leader of the Opposition and someone from the Independent benches or a representative from each party.  They should go from this House.  Our expertise is as good and maybe better than many other outside bodies.</P>

      <P>We have brilliant men here.  We represent all strata of society from ordinary humble &ldquo;tech&rdquo; boys like myself to university lecturers, graduates and professors.  We have a great cross section representing all the people of Ireland.  We are a representative body. Some groups shout about representing people but no one represents people as well as the local county councils.  We represent them at national level.  We have people from every group and we are elected not selected.  We are not self-appointed.</P>

      <P>When one is in contact with every part of the country one can ring people to ascertain their views on problems which are to be debated in the Seanad.  This would not be possible if we were regionalised.  It is a national Parliament and I am happy with the current system of election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every day the Cathaoirleach reads out a number of motions but can take only two.  He should be able to take <Col N="457" /> about four and we should allocate two hours to them.  Somebody recently had a motion on the North Western Health Board and no one else could have a say. I was not entirely happy with what was being said but had no right to reply.  A half hour debate would give someone else an opportunity to speak.  No one should have a motion all to themselves where no one else can contribute.  The motion should, therefore, last about half an hour and we should deal with four.</P>
    <P>The motions could be debated at 6 p.m. each evening to make it possible for Ministers to attend.  At present, if we finish at 2 p.m. we want to take the motions at 3 p.m.  It is not fair to Ministers as they do not know what time we will finish.  Those with motions are in Dublin anyway and will not be going home late on Thursday.  There should be a set time of 6 p.m. every week. Every Minister will know that motions are at 6 p.m. in the Seanad and there should be no deviation from that time. That is another reform I would like to see.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased that the Leader mentioned an all-party group because committees are becoming hackneyed and do not come up with any results.</P>

      <P>A small group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>A small informal group of not more than five and not less than three, which gives an odd number to keep the balance if there is a vote, would be important, helpful and welcome. I would support the Leader in organising a group to discuss the situation as it would have a beneficial effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much good work is done here and there are many good debates.  There is however another message we must get across to the public.  Someone looking in tonight will see just three of us here and say there was no one in the House. They do not realise that we are all sitting in our offices watching monitors and listening to every word.  One often hears the debate better in one's own office.  We make notes and study the contributions.  If we are contributing <Col N="458" /> later ourselves we are interested to hear the views of others.</P>
    <P>The myth that nobody is listening if nobody is here is one which we should dispel, but I do not know how we will do it.  People believe it should be like a county council where one goes to the meeting and sits there until it is over, but that is not so.  I would welcome a provision for shorter speeches with five minutes to reply if someone misunderstood what one was saying.  Whether one was in the Chamber or listening in one's office, one could come back, highlight the misunderstanding and rectify the situation.</P>
    <P>Those are my proposals.  I have no doubt the Leader will listen to our views and eventually establish a group.  I support his proposal to form a small group to examine other Houses.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the House and the Chief Whip should be recognised for the amount of work they do.  He or she not only works during the Order of Business; they must also talk to Ministers and try to organise the week's work. The Leader will be in his office tomorrow, on Monday and on Tuesday preparing work for Wednesday and Thursday. It is grossly unfair that the Leader of the House and the Chief Whip, who also has a lot of work to do, are not given remuneration.  An old neighbour once said: the more cost, the more honour. They are entitled to compensation because one should not work in Parliament out of the goodness of their heart and get the same salary as everyone else who attends and contributes for two days.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important debate and I concur with comments made by previous speakers.  I have been a Member for almost 13 years and I have seen great improvements in backup facilities and in the way we conduct our business.  It is a great honour to be elected to the Seanad by the people of the 26 counties.  One or two people from the six counties were involved in the election of a Senator.  When I was elected in April 1982 I was delighted at <Col N="459" /> the honour bestowed on my family and on my village of Castlepollard in County Westmeath.  I am delighted to carry on the tradition of the party and of the late Mr. M.J. Kennedy who was a former Parliamentary Secretary &mdash; or Minister of State as they are now known &mdash; and who represented Castlepollard for 38 years.</P>
      <P>On my arrival I was met by the former Clerk of the Seanad, Mr. Jack Tobin, who outlined the regulations.  I was then told to go to a certain room where I would be allocated a secretary. I was astounded &mdash; I know this also happened to the Acting Chairman, Senator R. Kiely, because he is here longer than I am &mdash; that I had to share an office with four other Senators and two secretaries. I come from the private business sector where everyone has an office and a secretary to conduct their business and to meet various lobby groups and organisations involved in sport, cultural activities or business.  It is an insult to expect people to conduct their business in a room with four other Members and two secretaries.  Some 13 years ago there were five Members to one secretary, but as a result of efforts by a previous Taoiseach, Mr. Charles Haughey, party leaders and Ministers there are now two Members to one secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are serious about reorganisation we should give Members the facilities to conduct their business properly.  During the last Government, the Leader, the Chief Whip and the Deputy Whip were in one office with two typewriters.  They were committed to making the Seanad more effective and they did their job with credit.  Thinking time is a person's greatest asset.  I can do more work from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. or from 7 p.m. to 9 or 10 p.m. when telephones are not ringing, typewriters are not clicking and when I do not have to watch the monitor to see what is happening in the Seanad Chamber.  I respect the Leader as an excellent politician and person who is more than suitable to represent us.  He, the Cathaoirleach, the Minister for Finance and the Committee on Procedure <Col N="460" /> and Privileges must try to get offices and secretaries so that we can conduct our business properly.</P>
    <P>The public perceives the Seanad as a part-time position.  While that may have been true in the past when the Seanad only sat for a certain number of hours per week or days per year, it is different today.  Westmeath County Council's business is done on a Monday.  On Tuesday I travel to Dublin to prepare for the Seanad on Wednesday and to make representations on behalf of constituents for most of the afternoon.  The parliamentary party meeting takes place on Wednesday mornings and we are in the Seanad in the afternoon until late in the evening.  We came in this morning at 9.30 a.m. to prepare for the Order of Business which is sometimes put to a vote if it is contentious.  We then contribute to the afternoon's debates.  On Friday we go back to our constituencies once representations have been made, because if one does not deal with the problems received last week one will have another 70 or 80 problems the following weekend when one goes home. It is a never-ending process of meeting the demand.</P>
    <P>The better the public representative is, the more work he or she will get. There is an old saying that bad news travels fast, but good news travels as fast. If someone says during a conversation in the local pub or during a meal that a public representative was successful in his efforts for a certain family, one can be guaranteed that three people will make representations to that public representative during the following seven days.  That is the nature of our work. This is a fact of life.  To compound all that, a Senator brings 70 to 80 representations to Dublin and has to deal with them in an office where two typewriters are shared with three other Members. This cannot continue.</P>
    <P>The public does not realise this and, if they did, they would not praise us for it.  Senators do not have the same facilities they would have in their offices in their constituency.  At home we do not share our offices with anyone else.  This <Col N="461" /> problem must be addressed as a matter of urgency.  This is a basic requirement and I am appalled the position has continued for so long.</P>
    <P>I support the Leader's suggestion that a small committee undertake this work, adopt the points highlighted today, see how they can be progressed and present its findings.  The first item on that report should be the provision of basic facilities to Members to carry out their duties efficiently and effectively.</P>
    <P>Senator Lee mentioned secretary training which, it goes without saying, is a must.  In the private sector secretaries must be familiarised with the operation of departments in their working area. When a Member comes here for the first time and is unfamiliar with Oireachtas procedures, he or she also needs a course, perhaps for four hours per day for four days.</P>
    <P>New Members could be introduced to the Secretaries of the various Government Departments.  I was here for almost eight months before a long serving Members told me that because my party was in the Opposition I would find it hard to get results.  He said the only way I would succeed would be to find a friendly official in a Department who would process matters for me.  If Members do not meet the Secretary of the Department, they should meet the person in the Department who deals with their representations.  They then know with whom they will be dealing, and if they prefer they can also address points to the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the various Ministers and Ministers of State.</P>
    <P>I have known Members who were in this House for years and never met the Secretary of a Department.  That is not good enough.  Senator Farrell is a distinguished Member who has given a lifetime of commitment to representing local authorities in a voluntary capacity, as do all of our county councillors, although that goes unnoticed.  The 60 Senators in this House should be introduced to the people they will be contacting in the various Departments and <Col N="462" /> should be given briefing on the various matters they will need to know.</P>
    <P>When I had been in the Seanad for three weeks I was dealing with two major problems in my area, one of which related to a factory.  The people from my area were relying on my representations to highlight the problem facing them.  Were it not for the assistance of neighbouring TDs from Longford and Cavan and my counterpart from Westmeath, I would not have known where to go to solve that problem. However, if I had been introduced to the Secretary or the person in the front line in each Department, I would have known to whom I should make representations.  I suggest that to the Leader.</P>
    <P>The proceedings of the Seanad are not made known to the general public. If the Oireachtas was a PR company and paid for its performance based on what appeared in the media, the company would have gone bankrupt a long time ago.  Excellent contributions are made by Senators from all parties and I have never seen the media show as little interest in anything as in the proceedings of Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to criticise, but how can we improve the position?  Telefís na Gaeilge will begin in the not too distant future and there will be a lot of free viewing time on this channel.  It has been suggested at other levels that &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; be placed in this available space.  If Dáil Éireann's coverage on the programme is to be increased to 40 or 45 minutes, that means time is freely available and we should look at this.  Given the contributions made in this House, Seanad Éireann should be allocated 30 minutes of edited footage on the channel.  It is fairly widely known that the Oireachtas will be covered on it.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell made a proposal about the Order of Business.  Every day we see you agonising, a Chathaoirligh, trying to get the Order of Business agreed.  It drags out everyday and the Clerk of the Seanad and everyone else is assisting you in this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Committee on Procedure and Privileges is doing the same. Every day Members wish to raise items relating to their area which they feel are important.  The flooding in the Galway area over the last number of weeks is an example.  If a Member could put down a motion on which he and others could speak, Senators would feel they would have an opportunity to make their points.  The motions could be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Wednesday and Thursday evenings, with 30 minutes allocated to each motion and the Minister given the opportunity to reply.  If that was in place, the Order of Business would be speeded up.</P>
      <P>The items mentioned on the Order of Business should be discussed that day or the following day.  However, as a result of legislative business and Government pressure on the Leader of the House, the Leader cannot accede to such requests.  Urgent items could be discussed between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. and on Thursdays or between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. on Wednesdays.  As Senator Farrell said, four motions could be dealt with during those times.  How many times have we listened to An Cathaoirleach read out a list of 16 or 17 matters on the Adjournment although he can accept only one or two such matters?  That is a proposal the Leader of the House and the subcommittee could examine.  It would mean that rather than just one Member being involved, a number of Members with an interest in the topic could speak as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members have said that Europe should be accorded more relevance in the Seanad.  The subcommittee should examine that proposal.  It has also been suggested that EU Commissioners could address the Chamber.  I have an open mind about that suggestion and also the suggestion that MEPs should address the House about the committees on which they serve in Europe.  The subcommittee should examine such suggestions.  The Dáil is not in a position <Col N="464" /> to accommodate those proposals but the Seanad, particularly if it has television time available to it, could make itself more meaningfully implementing them.</P>
    <P>During recent weeks I have proposed that former Taoisigh should become Members of the Seanad on retiring from the Dáil.  Perhaps the subcommittee would consider my proposal.  I have received good feedback in response to it.  Former Taoisigh have important contacts and enormous experience of making difficult decisions at crucial times. Their expertise could be availed of through their membership of the Seanad.  I would envisage that they would receive no salary for being members and that they could never become Leader of the House or Cathaoirleach.  Instead they would make available to the nation the experience they gained from the time they served as Deputies and possibly Senators to when they were elected to the most powerful office in the land.</P>
    <P>I had experience of visiting America with a previous Taoiseach and of meeting with him top executives such as the president of Chrysler and Wall Street bankers.  All Taoisigh have such experience as a result of holding that office.  It should be borne in mind that in America at present one third of the chief executives of the top 500 companies are first or second generation Irish.  They represent a wealth of goodwill towards Ireland and they have built up a magnificent rapport with previous Taoisigh. I make my proposal so that we can use that expertise and goodwill.  I have received a positive response from all parties.  Former senior Members of the Oireachtas who never reached the office of Taoiseach also considered it a good idea.  It is also very sad that when a Taoiseach ceases to be a Member he is never consulted and kept in the Oireachtas so that his expertise can be utilised.  I hope the subcommittee will examine the proposal.  I will say no more about it until the subcommittee offers its opinion.</P>
    <P>I wish the Leader of the House and the subcommittee well in its work and I <Col N="465" /> hope that some of the proposals we have heard today will be implemented. The Leader of the House wishes to be perceived as somebody who will improve the operation of the Seanad. We are looking forward to him improving the facilities of the House so that we can implement his recommendations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not regret the fact that the previous speaker made a long contribution because it was a good contribution. Senator Cassidy has more experience in this Chamber than I, so I was more interested in hearing his contribution than in contributing myself.</P>
      <P>However, I would be failing in my duty as a new and younger Senator if I did not express my opinions on the role of this House.  We should not see ourselves as a mirror of Dáil Éireann.  It is not our function to introduce and debate legislation in the same way as the Dáil.  Our function lies in the mature, calm, philosophical and reflective discussion of issues and legislation which is not possible because of time constraints in the Dáil.  Debate in the Seanad is, and must be, more distant and less urgent because we are trying to ensure that legislation passed in the Lower House does not contain fundamental errors, mistakes or inaccuracies or provisions that will lead ultimately to bad results.  Our function is different to that of the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In re-examining our role we can look to the east and to the west.  To the east there is the House of Lords.  If we conducted a straw poll as to whether people would like the Seanad to imitate the House of Lords, they would reject such a suggestion.  Most people seeing the proceedings of the House of Lords on television simply see many well-intentioned ladies and gentlemen dozing in big leather armchairs.  Looking west, the US Senate is entirely different.  It is composed of directly elected members for a six or seven year term and it has great powers.  We must fit in somewhere between the two models.  We should adjust our working methods to make <Col N="466" /> ourselves relevant as Ireland approaches the 21st century.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that I should not exceed my time limit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>When I bring up this subject I cannot help wondering what the people of Greystones ever did to successive Governments of this country. They are ordinary, law abiding and peaceful people, but for some reason <Col N="467" /> they are neglected, kicked around and treated in a way in which no other town in north County Wicklow is treated.</P>
      <P>Greystones has been looking, with a modesty characteristic of the inhabitants of the town, for the DART for many years and no Government has given it to them, for reasons only known to the Government.  The town was left out in the seaside resorts pilot scheme which was announced by the Government in the budget, again for reasons which are only known to the Government and it has only at last managed to achieve a civilised, modern sewerage scheme, which any town in Ireland is entitled to in the 20th century.  In addition, Greystones has been looking for one or two other things and I am asking the Minster to hasten the process whereby the town becomes more prosperous and whereby the marina, which was proposed as far back as 1987, is hurried up, thereby giving the long suffering people of Greystones a break, and prosperity.</P>
      <P>In 1987-88 a study was commissioned by the county council on the feasibility of a marina for Greystones.  This study had two purposes.  The first was to promote tourism and the second was to solve the problems associated with Greystones harbour.  The commission, undertaken by McCabe Delaney, architects, made very strong recommendations that a marina should be installed in Greystones and that this was in the interests of the people of the town.  Following this, the county development team proceeded to make presentations to the county council and to the town commission strongly recommending this project.  It was approved by both bodies at a public meeting afterwards and was overwhelmingly endorsed by the people of Greystones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Discussions then proceeded with various companies, and with one in particular, which broke down, and in 1993 Kirkham Enterprises entered into negotiations with the county council and the Department of the Marine on the possibilities of establishing a 400 berth <Col N="468" /> marina and which would have a hotel, a leisure centre, residencies and a retail unit.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, although this project would provide at least 200 full time jobs to Greystones, negotiations appear to have broken down and my problem is to find out exactly why and how they have broken down and to ask the Minister to do everything he can to hasten them.  Agreement in principle has been made with the county council, but no planning application is before the council, because no such application can be put to it until the foreshore licence has been agreed with the Department.  I understand that a land swap has been agreed in principle with the county council, but the problem is the difference in price for these foreshore licences between the Department and the developer or proprietor &mdash; or whatever one may wish to call him&mdash;Mr. Albert Gubay, who has been considering the matter very seriously.</P>
    <P>I make a plea to the Minister to relieve this terrible log jam, to hasten up the procedure &mdash; discussions have gone on for far too long &mdash; and to give the boost to Greystones, the most neglected and forgotten town in north County Wicklow, which it so badly needs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Ross for sharing his time with me.  I am in a rather unique position, because many years ago, as a young civil servant, I worked in the section&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr Roche Mr Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of the then Department of Transport and Power which issued the foreshore licences.  At that time foreshore licences were issued freely and the idea of charging for them is a relatively new one.  The problem with this case, however, is that the Department does not seem to see any urgency whatsoever in coming forward with foreshore licences and we have hit a log jam which needs to be released.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal to build a 400 berth marina in Greystones is a very good one <Col N="469" /> and it has been put before the town commission and accepted unanimously. It has also been supported unanimously by the county council.  Most importantly, the proposition was brought before the people of Greystones when there was an enthusiastic support for it at a public meeting, which, as then chairman of the town commissioners, I had the honour to chair.</P>
    <P>It is important that the entire project be proceeded with.  At one time, Greystones was a very prosperous tourism town when there were seven hotels operating in and around the town.  It had a tremendous and vibrant tourism trade from the North of Ireland.  All of this died in the 1950s and 1960s when sun tourism came in and in the 1970s the final <i>coup de grace</i> was given to tourism in Greystones by the troubles in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>The situation pertaining today is that the town has grown, but there is one major resource which is undeveloped and completely neglected, the Greystones harbour.  The harbour has been kept <i>in situ</i> for the past 30 years by voluntary effort through the town's civic association.  Over the past number of years the harbour has taken a huge battering from the elements and the harbour itself, the harbour wall, the outer wall and the inner breakwater are almost completely wiped away.</P>
    <P>What is required to preserve the harbour and to use and develop this facility, for the economic, social and recreational benefit of the town is the kind of development proposed by the developer in this case.  It would undoubtedly bring a considerable number of jobs into the town at the stage of development and it would be of great benefit, especially on the north beach area of Greystones, in that it would it prevent a degree of coastal erosion which is both a danger and a cost to public funds at present.  However, above all else, it would give us a new tourism product from which the whole of north east County Wicklow would benefit.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances it is extraordinary that one of the problems appears <Col N="470" /> to have been with the Department of the Marine.  Part of the Department's remit was that the whole issue of marine recreation would be developed.  It was to be a forward looking and progressive remit, yet the Department appears to have taken the view that this case is a revenue item.  I am sure this is a view which is not shared by the Minister of State or the Minister and that it is probably dictated by the Department of Finance. In view of this, will the Minister use his good offices to break such log jams as exist in order to allow this project to proceed, because venture capital is a very fluid commodity and if a firm has the capital for a project at a specific time it will not wait around?</P>
    <P>As Senator Ross pointed out, there is one other blow which has been struck at Greystones recently in terms of tourism and development &mdash; for a reason I cannot accept because no adequate explanation has been put forward &mdash; which is that Greystones, Arklow and Bray have been excluded from the traditional seaside resort tax break announce in the budget.  Between the money which the Department of the Marine is seeking and the money and benefits which are denied to us by the decision in the budget, we are being penalised in a way which is quite unacceptable.  I therefore ask the Minister to use his good offices in his Department to resolve this matter and let a worthwhile and progressive development go ahead.</P>

      <P>An application for a lease of foreshore for a marina, apartments and support facilities in Greystones, County Wicklow, was received in the Department last September.  Drawings showing the concept and proposed occupation and reclamation of the foreshore have been furnished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before proceeding with a departmental examination of the proposal, the applicant requires a budget figure for the cost of leasing or purchasing the foreshore areas&mdash;purchase is not an immediate option.  The Department is <Col N="471" /> advised on rental matters by the Valuation Office, which has been consulted in this case.  Before producing its rental figure, the Valuation Office has requested additional information relating to the detailed works which will be carried out on the foreshore if the project proceeds. This information is awaited from the applicants.  When this information is received and passed to the Valuation Office it should then be possible to furnish a rental for the foreshore being sought by the applicants.  At this point the applicants would have to decide whether they wish the Department to continue with a detailed examination of the proposals.</P>
    <P>This examination will consist of technical assessment of the project from engineering, navigational, environmental and other aspects.  Local authority planning permission will also be required.  I understand that the local authority is looking at the project favourably.  If the project receives a positive technical assessment in the Department, a public consultation process will be by advertisement in the newspapers.  There is also a possibility that an environmental impact statement may be required.</P>
    <P>In summary, the up to date position for this proposal is that additional information is awaited from the promoter of the project.  A time scale for examination of the foreshore aspects of this project can be furnished following completion of the promoter's own assessment of the project's economic viability and their decision to proceed.  I assure the Senators that when that information is furnished to the Department the matter will be expedited.  I will take a personal interest in ensuring that that happens.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his helpful reply.  Could he give me a time scale, provided that the applicants produce the information which he is quite reasonably looking for?  He stated that a technical assessment has to be made from &ldquo;engineering, environmental <Col N="472" /> and other aspects&rdquo;, which suggests a long time.  Could he give me an indication of how long it will take the Department to make a decision after the information is received?</P>

      <P>I am reluctant to give a specific time scale but I have undertaken to produce one when the information is received.  It will then be possible to assess the likely length of time needed for the various technical, environmental and other assessments. As soon as that information is received we will be in a position to give an outline of the time which will be involved.</P>

      <P>I raised this issue because a father of a young family called to my constituency advice centre last week.  He is a lone parent trying to do the best for his family under quite difficult circumstances.  He contacted me because he had failed over a period of almost a year and a half to have his son placed in a special school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the child was born the family lived in the inner city where he attended a special school.  They moved to the Blanchardstown area because of family problems as it was felt that it would be better if the children moved out of the inner city in the circumstances.  Since <Col N="473" /> they were housed in the Blanchardstown area the father has tried unsuccessfully to have the child placed in a special school.  The father insists that the boy does not have a history of disruption but is just in urgent need of special educational facilities.</P>
    <P>I hasten to add that I was his last port of call.  He may have contacted the Department of Education and I also received a copy of a letter from the local senior social worker who had tried on his behalf five schools which provide the required type of educational facility. The last line of the letter states &ldquo;To date, none [of the above five schools] have agreed to offer Raymond a place&rdquo;. There was a chance at one stage that the boy might have been placed in a particular school, but the father later found out that this institution was for badly emotionally disturbed children and those with a history of disruption. Therefore, he decided that it was not an option for his child even if it was offered to him.</P>
    <P>I was his last port of call.  I cannot believe that in this day and age a child has been left for a year and a half without any opportunity to avail of his constitutional right to an education.  Those are the circumstances as the father has outlined them to me and I can only take them at face value.  This child at 13 and a half years of age has secured a FÁS placement, to which he may not have been entitled, but at least they have tried to meet some of his needs.</P>
    <P>I think that the Minister of State and the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, would readily agree that this is the worse possible start in life for a child who has had already suffered the disadvantages of a broken marriage and the associated trauma.  They live in an area, which I represent, with 60 per cent unemployment.  All Governments realise that a child has absolutely no chance unless they get a basic education which they can take as far as possible.  I hope that the Minister of State has good news for me today and I ask that somebody urgently take this matter up in the Department of Education.</P>

      <P>The boy referred to in Senator McGennis' matter attended Rutland Street national school for two school years from 1985-8 and Marlboro' Street national school from 1987-90.  In September 1990 he was enrolled in St. Laurence O'Toole special school, which caters for children who have become involved in minor delinquency and alienated from the mainstream school system.  He remained at this school until March 1993.</P>
      <P>The boy appeared before the Dublin Juvenile Court in March 1993 on a charge of malicious damage to a motor vehicle.  He was referred by the court for a three week assessment to St. Michael's remand and assessment centre, Finglas, from 9 March to 30 March 1993.  The assessment process includes medical, social, psychological and educational reports, which enable the court to make informed decisions in each individual case coming before it.  In the case of the boy referred to, the assessment report indicated that the boy has severe behavioural difficulties.</P>
      <P>The report recommended short term placement in a suitable health board facility.  The assessment report also recommended that this be followed by a long term placement in a special school for mildly mentally handicapped boys with behavioural problems.  In April 1994, the boy was accepted at the Eastern Health Board short term intervention centre at Warrenstown House. He was discharged from that centre on 12 August 1994.  As the boy has not been at school since, the Department's primary inspectorate, in conjunction with the appropriate assessment and referral authorities, is endeavouring to have a suitable long term educational placement made available to him at the earliest possible date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard a special case conference is to be held at St. Laurence's special school, Finglas, on Monday, 6 March 1995, in an effort to ensure that an appropriate placement will be found, where the boy's educational and other special needs will be met.  After that <Col N="475" /> case investigation takes place next week, the Senator is welcome to contact my Department and I will give her an update on the position.  It is a serious case, which needs to be attended to sooner rather than later.  I thank the Senator for raising this matter.</P>

      <P>I am pleased with the Minister's reply, but perhaps he could refer one point to his officials in relation to the special case conference.  The legal action mentioned by the Minister involved the area in which they lived and the boy has caused no trouble in school.  The father has expressed concern that if the boy is placed in a specific school, the name of which I will give to <Col N="476" /> the Minister later, his behaviour might get worse instead of improve.  In a letter to the father from a constituency colleague from a different party, the public representative stated that the placement in this institution might not help the boy's situation.  The father is very concerned, if this specific location is chosen and a placement is found there, that it might make the boy worse rather than improve him.  I will give the Minister the name of the institution in private.</P>
