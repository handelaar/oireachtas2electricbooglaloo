      <P>I have received notice from Senator Neville that, on the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to immediately grant funding to Limerick County Council to alleviate the disastrous situation of the regional and county roads.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator O'Toole and Senator Fitzgerald of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to make provision from the post primary building budget to support Cairde Coláiste Íde in Dingle in their proposal to retain Coláiste Íde in operation as an all-Irish girls boarding school.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Wall of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to outline the funding, framework of operations and rules concerning the home-help scheme as operated by the health boards.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Roche of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="478" /> The need for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to make every effort to have a report by his Department's designated official into the affairs of the companies associated with the retirement village brought to a conclusion at the earliest possible date, and if he will make a full statement on the matter.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator McGennis of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to purchase the site which has been reserved for a regional technical college in the Blanchardstown area, bearing in mind that a private developer has a two year option on this site.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senators Neville and O'Toole's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

Items 1 to 8 will conclude by 1 p.m.  Item 9, the Arterial Drainage (Amendment) Bill, 1995, will start after the sos and will conclude not later than 4 p.m.  Senator Daly will be called to speak on this item not later than 3.40 p.m. while the Leader of the House will be called not later than 3.30 p.m.  Item 10, Statements on the Role of Seanad Éireann, will be taken if item 9 is concluded and will be taken between the conclusion of item 9 and 6 p.m.  Item 20, Motion No. 5, Private Members' motion, will be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. and there will be a sos from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>That sounds ominous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of recent robberies, armed and otherwise, and the announcement by Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, that as a result of the peace process gardaí will be dispersed throughout the country, I am sure the Minister would welcome the views of the House on where best to disperse those gardaí.  I hope the Leader will find time in the near future for a debate on law and order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call by Senator Wright for a debate on law and order.  The House will note that item 6 on the Order Paper refers to attacks on a journalist.  As regards items 1 to 8, may I ask when the Committee of Selection will meet?  In the light of the useful debate on the banks which we had in a previous Seanad, would the Leader consider a similar debate on another of our great institutions, the Gaelic Athletic Association which has been referred to as the real Government of Ireland?  It has taken a political line from time to time and it is also gets special tax provisions. We have just received the booklet on national lottery allocations where I am sure we will find substantial sums of money being allocated to the GAA, which is in many ways an estimable organisation.  It would be healthy for us to look at one of our great institutions, not necessarily in a negative or critical way, given that we fund it to such an extent.  In the light of the present troubles, perhaps we could ask, if not require, the GAA to be sensitive in its handling of issues such as RUC membership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Leader had any success in getting the Minister for <Col N="480" /> Health, Deputy Noonan, to come to the House to discuss the VHI?  I know he will be here next week to discuss the Regulation of Information (Services Outside the State For Termination Of Pregnancies) Bill, 1995.  We would certainly like to see him here, which I am sure he would be glad to hear.  I would like to hear his response to the report of the Kennedy review group which highlighted many of the problems about which the 1.3 million members of the VHI are concerned.  As the Leader indicated last week, it would be useful to debate that.</P>
      <P>Could we have a debate on the implementation of the Child Care Act, 1991, and the fact that mandatory reporting of child abuse cases has not yet been implemented?  We tend to drag out these issues.  Much concern was expressed after the report on the Kilkenny incest case, but nothing has happened in regard to this matter and it is vitally important that it is addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Honan's request for a discussion of the VHI, which is an issue of grave concern. Perhaps the Leader could find time for such a debate.  I am sure these concerns are shared by Members on the other side of the House.  Could we mark discussions in another jurisdiction as regards its prevention of terrorism Act? We discussed the Irish diaspora in the House last week, as did the President in an enlightening address to both House of the Oireachtas some weeks ago.  This odious legislation has most vehemently borne down on Irish people in the United Kingdom.  Could the Leader advise me if there is an appropriate way to deal with this matter or indicate the concerns felt by Members on all sides on the way this legislation has odiously oppressed Irish people?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House ask the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, to initiate the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill in this House?  Most Members welcome the proposed changes.  People in rural areas <Col N="481" /> will be able to live in comfort from now on.</P>
      <P>With regard to the request for a debate on law and order, I ask that details would be provided to all Members on the seriousness of the problem and how it has escalated over the last ten years.  It has reached an alarming level in areas around Dublin, including my county, and these crimes are happening daily.</P>
      <P>I would also ask you, a Chathaoirligh, for guidance as to how I could raise an issue relating to the award of a Government contract to somebody who had no tax clearance certificate and who went broke half way through the building of a barracks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to find time for a debate on currency. The turmoil in the currency markets is ignored in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I asked for a debate on this subject some time ago and I commented that this issue tends to be put on the long finger until a crisis occurs.  We are now likely to be in a crisis in that this week alone the punt has exceeded sterling on a couple of occasions; there has been turmoil with the peseta and the <Col N="482" /> escudo and now with the US dollar and the Deutsche Mark.  This will cause a crisis for our exporters and will bring into debate the issue of the single European currency which is timed for 1999. If we are not ready, perhaps it will be a two speed currency.  We should debate this matter ahead of time rather than wait until there is a crisis and then we will have to debate it on the spur of the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>And most certainly the Progressive Democrats.  Would the Leader of the House bring to the attention of the Minister of State with responsibility for sport another sporting organisation, namely the FAI, which still resolutely refuses to hand back the money which was paid for a game that did not take place?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Consumer Credit Bill is going through the other House.  It deals with charges on credit cards, ATM cards and all bank charges.  We had a debate some time ago on bank charges but the matter is rearing its ugly head again.  We could recommend that the banks delay introducing the rise in mortgages because as a rule they are too quick to move in that direction.  I call for a debate on ATM charges, credit cards and bank charges in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Wright's call for a debate on crime.  It is serious when a garda is shot in a Dublin street in the course of his duty.  We should include the abuse of drugs in that debate.  Listening to Joe Duffy on the radio this morning, drug abuse seems to be the reason most of the women prisoners are in gaol.  To feed their habit they were shoplifting, they hurt people and they damaged property.  I support the call for the debate on crime.</P>

      <P>I take the opportunity to wish all my colleagues a happy International Women's Day.  Some time ago we had a very good debate on the Report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women and we suggested that we should monitor progress.  I suggest that we find time to go back to that report and see what progress has been made since its publication.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EddieBohan" hpid="Mr. Bohan Mr. Bohan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bohan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say a couple of words on the road traffic legislation. The people I represent are reasonably <Col N="484" /> pleased with the Minister's intention to change the penalties but would he consider substituting a fine for a three month suspension for the first 80 mg &mdash; 100 mg?  We asked for this before the previous Bill became law.  I thank the Minister and compliment him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I reply to the Order of Business I wish to put the record straight.  I had indicated to the House that the Minister for the Marine would be in the House tomorrow to speak on marine matters.  Unfortunately, due to his departure for the Lebanon, tomorrow is not convenient for him but he will come into the House on the morning of Thursday, 23 March, to take that debate and he will take questions as well.  I had given that commitment and wanted to indicate to the House why we are not having that debate tomorrow.</P>
      <P>On the Order of Business, Senator Wright and others raised the question of crime.  The Minister for Justice would welcome an opportunity to come into the House, hear the views of Members and indicate what her plans are.  I will ask her, as a matter of urgency, to come into the House to discuss this issue about which everybody is concerned. Senator Norris asked about the Committee on Selection.  This committee will probably meet on Tuesday, 14 March.  If the other House were not preoccupied it would probably meet this week but because of pressing legislation it will not meet until next Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The GAA and a number of sporting issues were raised this morning.  The importance of sport in all aspects of our life could provide the basis for a major debate in the near future.  I will ask the Minister for Sport if he would be prepared to come to the House; I am sure he would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Honan and others mentioned the VHI.  I have conveyed to the Minister the point made in this regard by Senator Finneran last week.  He is preoccupied this week and next week but it is a major issue and he will come to the House to address it.  Senator Roche also <Col N="485" /> raised the question of VHI.  Everybody in the House shares the Senator's view on the British Prevention of Terrorism Act.  I am not sure what the appropriate way for us to discuss it here would be, but I will convey his views, which I believe are the views of the House, to the Tánaiste.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrelly asked about road traffic legislation.  I will see if the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill can be taken in this House.  I share Senator Quinn's sense of impending crisis on the question of the currency and I will see if something can be done tomorrow.  I cannot guarantee anything but I will make a request to see if we can have a debate at some stage tomorrow, as we do not have time today.  Senator Magner's point about the FAI was covered. Senator Fitzgerald also raised the question of currency, I will convey Senator Bohan's views to the Minister.</P>

    <P>I am very pleased to have the opportunity to move these motions because they mark a further step along the road to parliamentary reform.  All of us are aware of how difficult it is to change major institutions, whether they be universities, sporting organisations, churches or whatever.  The inertia and difficulties of managing change are formidable. In these Houses of Parliament we were in years past ironically exhorting other institutions to update their procedures and practices to gear themselves for change but we were certainly not leading by example.  It is only in the last decade or so that parliamentary reform has become a major topic in these Houses.</P>
    <P>In saying that, we are not that much in insolation.  We lagged behind a number of parliaments but virtually every parliament in the world has had to face up to problems of change and, more especially, the need to carve out new roles.  Parliaments everywhere have been beset with a range of forces competing for the grounds once held by them.  This can be seen in the form of international organisations and the ceding of power to bodies like the European Union, the growing importance of television and radio as the fora in which <Col N="498" /> much national debate takes place and the growing power of pressure groups who are frequently able to get direct access to Government to influence legislation. Competition has also come from the increasing scope and size of Government, its enormous complexity and the sheer range of its activities.  With all of these developments taking place.  Parliament tended to be left out.</P>
    <P>Political scientists and parliamentarians throughout the world have for some time been concerned with the eroding power of parliament.  Various proposals have been made and some parliaments have adapted more quickly than others.  More modern parliaments, especially the Bundestag, have been examples of this.  The Bundestag had the advantage of coming into existence not cumbered by any great legacy of parliamentary history, it was a new institution. It emphatically put the committee system at the very centre of its activities.  There is a realisation that it is through committees that parliaments will function most effectively.</P>
    <P>I am a great believer in plenary sessions and in this and the other House acting as Houses in full session, especially for the playing out of the great issues.  Parliament to a great extent is the people talking to itself.  It is expected to have an element of drama about it, to touch upon the lives of people and to influence and affect them. However, Parliament in plenary session is not always suited to detailed discussion of a wide range of topics.  The plenary session is not sufficiently flexible. It does not allow for focus, for Members to exchange views in an informal way, for the questioning of witnesses and for civil servants to participate in debates where their input is requested.  Thus, the plenary session has a great number of limitations which are certainly met by the committee system.</P>
    <P>The committee system, from the point of view of ordinary Members of either House, has two very important roles. The first is job satisfaction.  Through the committee system Members can specialise in particular areas and develop <Col N="499" /> expertise in them.  They can make contributions which are informed and backed up by research.  The level of debate can be higher than is often the case in more general debates and Members can feel job satisfaction.</P>
    <P>I have often said that the most frustrating time of my life as a Member of Parliament was during my years on the Government backbenches in the 1980s. There is no more frustrating role than that of a Government backbencher.  If one expresses independent views one can be accused of being disloyal, rocking the boat or seeking undue attention. If one supports the Government line one is accused of being a lackey and the statement &ldquo;He would do that wouldn't he&rdquo; is the response.  It is a difficult role and the level of frustration I personally experienced during those years made me question whether I wanted to stay in politics.</P>
    <P>The committee system is an antidote to that type of frustration because it allows the Member to become involved in specific projects and issues where, if the committee is working well, the Member feels that he or she has a meaningful role.  There is a general acceptance in these Houses that the committee system should be at the core of any major reforms of our parliamentary system. In the 1980s we saw an experiment with committee systems introduced by the then Leader of the House, Deputy Bruton.  Some of these committees worked and others did not.</P>
    <P>The key factor in the success of those committees was the chairperson.  An effective, dedicated, intelligent chairperson will lead the committee, set the agenda, drive the other Members and ensure the committee is heard.  Where the chairperson lacks these qualities the committee is likely to be less effective. The committees need leadership.  If one goes back and examines the committees that worked and those that did not, the common factor will in almost all cases be the quality of the lead given by the chairperson.  There was also an element <Col N="500" /> of hit or miss in the committees of the 1980s as to whether or not their terms of reference were appropriate.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of Members, I would also draw attention to the educational function of committees.  One of the most effective committees in the 1980s was the Committee on Overseas Development and Overseas Aid.  It allowed people who did not have a background in overseas aid to get stuck in, learn a great deal, travel, see problems for themselves on the ground and interact with the agencies and the people involved.  By the end of that session there was a strong lobby in both Houses for greater Government and national commitment to overseas aid.</P>
    <P>There was also a body of people who had become highly educated on the complex issues involved in overseas aid. Educating ourselves and the wider public is important.  It is also important to show to the various voluntary groups which are doing good work that people in the Houses of Parliament are prepared to listen to them, learn from them and represent their points of view.  It is important to show them that they have a place in Parliament where they will be listened to and where their points of view may well influence Government policy.  This interface between Parliament and the bodies that make up the wider public is often achieved better through the committee system.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil/Labour Government introduced a wide range of committees. The general agreement is that they have functioned well.  I am not one of those who takes the view that the Select Committee on Legislation and Security, which inquired into the events surrounding the collapse of the last Government, failed in its job.  I believe it succeeded because the wisdom of Solomon would be required to know the exact truth of those events.  Truth has many shades and aspects, and in many cases the truth depended on the position from which one observed the events.</P>
    <P>The committee has put on the record for all time the almost contemporaneous accounts of the people involved <Col N="501" /> and it will be for history to judge.  Few historians looking at past parliamentary events will have such a rich body of material at their disposal when they come, in the fullness of time, to write of the events of those days.  I believe that committee did a very good job and I do not think it was the job of the committee to be judgmental where the evidence did not warrant it.  If one compares the cost of that committee with the cost of the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Processing Industry, the taxpayers got very good value indeed.</P>
    <P>We are all learning about the potential of committees.  We were not sufficiently included in the 1993 reform of the committees; we were excluded from three of the four major committees.  In the committees proposed today there is an extension of Seanad membership on the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs.  The new committees will be joint committees; therefore Members of the Seanad will have a greater role in the new committee system.  However, these proposals are not the end of the story.  These Houses are at the early stages of parliamentary reform.  We must look at a range of other ways to do our work.  That is why I initiated the debate on the reform of this House and I hope Members will contribute to that discussion in the coming weeks.  I also announced my proposals to establish a small all-party committee to see how we can refine our ideas, set firm time targets and focus on the things we want to do in the short term.  This House will look at and update its own procedures and practices over the next ten years.</P>
    <P>Item 1 deals with the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs.  This will be a flagship committee and that is why I am pleased that the number of Senators on it has doubled.  This committee will have the power to establish subcommittees, to deal with Bills on Committee Stage which have been referred to it by either House, to monitor, as will all committees, the impact of legislation on equality and to ask civil servants or other groups for information when necessary.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="502" /> I draw the attention of the House to the question of privilege.  As we remember from last November and December, privilege was at the centre of the preparatory work of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security.  Privilege of witnesses and people appearing before committees is an area which needs clarification. The Government hopes to introduce at the earliest possible opportunity the Houses of the Oireachtas (Privileges and Compellability) Bill, which will provide privileges for witnesses and others in connection with proceedings of Oireachtas committees as well as compelling witnesses to attend before these committees.  This important issue is at the centre of the successful working of the committees.</P>
    <P>The committees will also have the power to engage specialist assistants. When we spoke last week on the reform of the Seanad, Senator Lee, whose views on the role of this House are interesting, confessed that the level of debate in this House is superior to that in many of the academic fora he attends. I hope I did not misinterpret what he said.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I confirm the Senator's impression of academic life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I also agree with that view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I must be talking to my friends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>He made the point last week that the absence of expertise is frustrating.  Knowledge and information are power and we are often not in a strong position to deal with people who are narrowly focused and experts in their own area.  We need help in this regard and the committees will have the power to engage expert assistance.  I despair of the word &ldquo;consultant&rdquo;, but the committees will be able to engage outside expertise when necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="503" /> It is interesting to note that under section 16 of this proposal Members of either House and members of the European Parliament and other parliamentary groups are free to attend and speak at the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs, even if they do not have voting rights.</P>
    <P>I will not go into great detail on the committees because others wish to speak.  Those being established today include one on the family, which will consider the impact of social change and State policies on the family in both its extended and nuclear form.  There will be particular reference to the protection and enhancement of the interests of children and the elderly and measures which can be taken to support them, including child care &mdash; raised on the Order of Business this morning by a number of speakers &mdash; education, juvenile justice and care of the elderly.</P>
    <P>The Committee on Small Businesses and Services will examine how to improve the operating environment for such firms, following the reports of the various task forces in these sectors.  This highlights a great lacuna in the way we do our business.  Few countries produce as many task force and commission reports as this country.  The Law Reform Commission and NESC publish reports every two months or so.  These reports land on our desks with great regularity, but then lie there.  The committees will be in a position to consider these reports in detail, to see whether and how they are being implemented, and how they should be implemented, and to ensure they are followed up, because this is lacking at present.</P>
    <P>The Committee on Sustainable Development will identify measures designed to maximise the advantage to Ireland of environmentally sustainable sectoral policies, bearing in mind the national sustainable development strategy being prepared by the Government. It will consider, by way of case study or otherwise, the extent of Irish participation in the growing world market for environmental goods and services and <Col N="504" /> means by which this market share can be increased.</P>
    <P>These are the three new committees which will have an important advisory and information gathering function. They are intended to enable Members of both Houses to put their views to Ministers in anticipation of legislation, to ensure Members of either House are not seeing legislation for the first time when the Minister introduces it after a long process.  Members will be in a position at an early stage to put forward good ideas, force Ministers to listen to them and where appropriate see those ideas put into legislation.</P>
    <P>We are at an important stage in the life of this Parliament.  The measures proposed today will enrich and enhance the lives and work of Members during the remainder of this session.  The committees have been carefully thought out, although I do not suggest there is no room for improvement or that they are the last word on the subject.  There may be room for changes and for new committees as time passes.</P>
    <P>I ask Members to support the new committees and give them a chance to prove themselves.  I hope the committees will be pro-active and not simply react to events, and that they will quickly establish their authority. Through the committees I hope we can put pressure on Government to ensure that the resources needed for the proper working of these Houses are supplied.</P>
    <P>The report Senator Magner's committee prepared on the Library services should now be re-examined in the light of the new committees, and he and I will put pressure on the Government to ensure ensure the report is implemented in full. It is no secret that the idea for this report came from the then Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Bruton.  He is now in a position to do something about the report.  I am reminding him of this fact on the record and I will also do so when next I talk to him.</P>
    <P>I commend these motions to the House.  This is an important day and I look forward to hearing the views of other Members.</P>
    <Col N="505" />
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important set of motions which gives us the opportunity to consider the parliamentary committee system again.  It is well known from the public record that I am a strong, even passionate, advocate of a full working parliamentary committee system.  However, although I do not wish to be negative, I am somewhat disappointed at the focus of these proposals. I will offer criticism of the proposals which I hope will be viewed as constructive and will be taken in the context of the improvement of the committee system in general.  I could score the odd political point but I will avoid that temptation today.</P>
      <P>My party will not challenge these proposals as it is much better to record progress on the committee system than to continuously talk about it and do nothing.  However, we will press in the forthcoming period for improvements in the way the committee system is structured and the focus of the committees in order to improve and enrich them and, in particular, to improve the contribution that can be made by Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  This applies in particular, as Senator Manning said, to the hapless Government backbenchers who find themselves committed to being criticised either because they are on a leash or because they are getting off the leash.  However, that is a debate for another day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There can be no doubt that the Houses of the Oireachtas require reform.  We have been talking about that in a variety of fora for the best part of 20 years.  Equally, there can be no doubt that a great deal has been achieved in recent years, although I contend with some impatience that not enough has been achieved.  The systems, procedures, working arrangements and, in part, working conditions in which Members of both Houses work are antediluvian and archaic.  They are not in any way focused on efficiency or effective representation.  The Houses are not only out of date but in many ways they are a fraud on the Irish people.  We come to both Houses with great promise <Col N="506" /> and hope invested in us.  In reality, however, we know that the amount we can achieve, particularly as backbenchers or in opposition, is really quite limited. Power resides with the Executive and over the years our form of Government has become highly centralised and Executive driven.  Today's debate affords us the opportunity to say how things could and should be different.</P>
    <P>I agree with all the points made by Senator Manning, although my emphasis might have been somewhat different in a couple of them.  We need a strong working system in both Houses because the advantages of the working system of committees are self evident.  They are so self evident to people both outside and inside the two Houses that I am mystified why we have not made more progress and been more radical.  That applies not just to these proposals but also to proposals introduced by the last Government and previous Governments dating back to the late 1970s.</P>
    <P>A properly constructed committee system, in which committees are focused on functional areas of Government, could achieve a huge amount.  It could revolutionise Irish politics overnight. We could change the way Irish people look at politics and, if we had enough political will to do so, we could change the face of Irish politics forever.  If we had, for example, committees focused on the functional areas of Government, such as the activities of either individual Departments or groups of Departments, we could achieve much in a short time. My criticism of these proposals is that they are focused in a somewhat <i>ad hoc</i> way rather than in a functional way. That said, the work these committees will do and the experience people will gain on them will help us in the longer term to re-orient the committees.  They will educate people and show how fruitful committee work can be.</P>
    <P>If we had properly focused committees we could progress the business of both Houses rapidly.  If, for example, we had five functional committees &mdash; committees dealing with agriculture, with industry, trade, commerce and tourism, <Col N="507" /> with energy and transport, with welfare and health and a committee dealing with education &mdash; they could process five separate Bills at the same time. Senators and backbenchers in the other House could play a far more meaningful role in the processing of legislation if the committees were focused on the executive actions of Government in a functional way.</P>
    <P>The greatest single advantage of the committee system is that it allows us to approach the issues of public policy and, most importantly, law making in a less partisan, divisive and stupid way than we do at the moment.  Most of the show acting and posturing which goes on when legislation is being debated is just a piece of theatre.  There is nothing wrong with a piece of theatre but when one is supposed to be progressing the work of the nation, theatre should be limited to the odd plenary session.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>It is happening in the other House today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is quite right and it will happen here next week because we will not have consensus and a meeting of minds.  I agree with Senator Magner; that is the point which I am seeking to make.  We could have a far less partisan debate if more of the early stages of legislation were given to committees. The only way we can do that is to functionally focus the committees and to have committees dealing with the major executive areas of Government as well as critical areas such as European affairs, public accounts and State enterprises which require specific committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most important point in this regard is that the committee system allows Members to concede points.  It means that we do not always have to posture and take the extreme opposite view; the Government is not committed unequivocally to one particular course of action as if it was the sole possessor of all knowledge and the Opposition is not committed to arrogant, wasteful <Col N="508" /> opposition for the sake of it.  We can concede points in committees.  Properly focused committees are a marvellous way for Members to sit around the table and use their best efforts to progress the life of the nation.</P>
    <P>We have had a number of committees over the last few years, for example, the committee on company law which achieved a huge amount in a short time. Members from all sides contributed and Ministers, who would not normally be prepared to concede even a point, a comma, a decimal place or a hyphen in a debate in the Dáil Chamber, listened carefully to what the Opposition had to say and changed and improved the legislation on that basis.</P>
    <P>Members can also, as Senator Manning said, make far better use of their expertise, knowledge and experience in the committee system than they can in the nonsensical arrangements which exist in the plenary sessions.  It is wrong that legislation should have to go through the high farce or theatre of a plenary session when, at the early stages, committees could consider the legislation and Members could utilise the vast wealth of talent which exists in both Houses.  I do not say this in a patronising way but Members of both Houses have, despite all the cynicism which surrounds politicians, an extraordinary wealth of experience which we should be prepared to use.  It is wrong that we have a parliamentary system which ignores that experience or consigns it to a secondary role because there is not sufficient talent in the nation to waste any of it.</P>
    <P>Members could play a far more active role, as Senator Manning said, in the committee system and both Houses could also play an alternative role to their current one.  They could lead the nation in a way which they currently do not if we had a properly focused and functioning committee system with the proper staff and resources.  We could win back much of the respect of the nation which has been eroded by cynicism, which sometimes has been well deserved in recent years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="509" /> What needs to be done to improve the present system?  I have believed, and have said for a number of years, that the committees need to be focused in a different way than these committees are focused.  I am not suggesting that small businesses, for example, do not deserve a committee but the issue of small business would be better dealt with by a committee looking after industry, trade, commerce and tourism.  This is my view; perhaps other Members will differ. Obviously, I respect and am prepared to listen to those views.  However, a mistake is being made in the way the committees are being focused on a rather <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  The full range of Government is not covered by these committees and the first thing we should do in a network of committees is cover the full range.  If this was done we could then have a situation where every Bill would be initiated in a committee and the only issues which would come to plenary sessions of the Dáil and Seanad would be those of major political difference, which must be discussed and aired on a political basis.</P>
    <P>I have had some experience as a chairman of an Oireachtas committee for a number of years and I found that the committees are appallingly funded. When I was chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies there was a budget of £48,000 for all the committees.  We were looking after billions of pounds of the nation's patrimony in that committee and I recall that when we carried out the first examination of the national lottery, we did not have enough money to bring in any consultants.  Work was done on a voluntary basis, and that is wrong and ridiculous.</P>
    <P>The committees are not properly staffed.  The staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas simply do not have enough hours in their day to cover the existing committee system, let alone an expanded system.  We have no research facility on an ongoing basis and I very much welcome the suggestions made about Library improvements.  These are long overdue.  The Library serves us <Col N="510" /> extraordinarily well, with a very limited range of resources, and I look forward to co-operating with the Leader of the House and others to improve matters.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a point to Senator Manning which I have made to my party.  There is something extremely bizarre about the way both Houses of the Oireachtas are funded, let alone the committees.  Why should the Department of Finance control the budget of these Houses?</P>

      <P>Why should the Department of Finance control the budget of Dáil Éireann?  Constitutionally, Dáil Éireann controls the finances of the nation.  We should be similar to other Parliaments and have our own budget. This would be established by the House, which is charged constitutionally with the task of protecting the public purse. The budget should be sufficient, no more and no less, to meet the needs of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We &mdash; not the officials in the Department of Finance &mdash; represent the people and the diversities of the people.  I served for many years in the Department and I know the officials there.  Although they regard themselves as having come from some higher place, I do not necessarily think that they should have the right to usurp the constitutional role of Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <P>We should carefully examine the reform of establishing, between the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, the Ceann Comhairle of the Dáil and the leaders of the parties, a budget committee as exists in other Parliaments to determine the parliamentary budget and the work which should be done within it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The work of the committees is largely ignored in the press, with the exception of <i>The Irish Times.</i>  There is little coverage <Col N="511" /> of committee work, even in <i>The Irish Times</i>, and it is largely ignored by national radio and ignored almost in its entirety by local radio.  It is even ignored within the committee system.  This House is consigned a couple of miserly seconds in &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; every day.  Politics is about publicity and we should not shy away from the fact that members of committees will work hard if they believe they will get some return for their effort.  However, if they are totally ignored by the media, the public will not know what the members are doing and the committees will quickly wither away.</P>
    <P>When I was chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies, there were superb members of that committee, but I remember having to scurry around the House looking for a quorum. People were so annoyed by the fact that they had been ignored in their entirely that they simply did not turn up.  It is not just the media which is responsible for this.  How many times have we discussed in the Dáil or Seanad the reports produced by committees? We all know that in the 16 years the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies existed, only two of its reports were ever discussed in the Seanad and only one in the Dáil.  This is a scandal.  Why set up a committee, give people a task and then ignore their reports?</P>
    <P>There is impossible pressure on Members.  One of the fears I have for this particular arrangement is that there will be problems for the committee chairman in getting a quorum.  It has to be accepted that Members in the Dáil and from country areas will have the gravest difficulties providing the time needed for service on committees. There are only a limited number of Members in both Houses who have the time or inclination to serve on committees. A significant proportion of the talent of the House is taken up by front bench duties in Opposition or by serving the Government, by the Members who <Col N="512" /> are Ministers or Ministers of State, or the people who fill officer positions in the House.  At any time there are Members in both Houses who are considering that they are nearing the end of their political careers.  There is a relatively small number of people who are willing to serve on committees.  This is an issue we will have to address.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning has addressed the problems which exist and the Government will, in the near future, be introducing legislation regarding the compellability of witnesses and the thorny issue of privilege.  That matter has dragged on since 1972.  It is crazy that it has gone on for that length of time and there has been so much discussion of reform but little actual reform.  I look forward to that legislation being introduced and the Government side can be assured that we will do all we can to constructively assist in its progress.</P>
    <P>The Houses of the Oireachtas, as I have already said, ignore the committees. The Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies is seldom discussed.  Not only do the Houses of the Oireachtas ignore the committees but the Executive also ignores them.  If we take, for example, the reports produced by the Committee on European Affairs, we find the same points being made over the years and time and again those points and recommendations being ignored.  Many recommendations were made by the Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies which have been largely ignored.  There has been little willingness on the part of the Executive or the public service to implement the recommendations of committees.  That should not be accepted by either House of the Oireachtas, it is intolerable.  When a committee makes a recommendation there should be a time limit for the Executive to respond.  Ministers have to respond to the Committee of Public Accounts and they should equally have to respond to recommendations made in a committee report.</P>
    <P>There is another issue on which both Houses should take a strong view.  The <Col N="513" /> Houses of the Oireachtas have no right to punish a person who treats a committee or the Houses themselves with contempt. I am not suggesting we build a tower and incarcerate people in it, but I recall many years ago, before I was a Member of either House, that the Committee of Public Accounts went to inspect a premises operated by Telecom Éireann and they were locked out.  The national media thought this was great crack.  It was a joke.  In any democracy which takes itself seriously that would not have been tolerated.  Imagine a Senate or Congressional committee in the United States going to a public building to examine what was happening to public funds and being treated with contempt by the chief executive of a State enterprise.  They would not get away with it, they would not last ten minutes. Yet, because it convenienced people, an Oireachtas committee and its chairman were pilloried and forced to answer cynical comments.</P>
    <P>The same thing happened when the Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies was examining the affairs of the Irish Sugar Company.  Strong allegations were made to me at that time as Chairman.  We were in the process of examining that company and our committee was thrown off the scent by false allegations made about the previous chairman.  We spent six months on a false trail laid by senior executives of the Sugar Company which perverted the work of that committee.  It is a fact and a matter of record &mdash; neither House of the Oireachtas took any action &mdash; that summonses to appear before that committee which were sent to every board of the company, were intercepted by senior management &mdash; senior management who left the public service in some ignominy later &mdash; and destroyed.  They were never given to board members.  That is a serious interference with the work of the Houses of Parliament and is something which should never be accepted.</P>
    <P>Neither House has moved to improve the level of media coverage given to committees; I have made this point on a <Col N="514" /> number of occasions.  We have a broadcasting committee; I do not believe that the current broadcast has enough time allocated to it.  The people involved do excellent work, they have to put the broadcast together in a tightly edited fashion.  No matter how ingenious they are there is no way they can cover the diversity of views expressed here.  It is often suggested that the Irish people have a narrow attention span in these matters and that is what determines how much time RTE allocates to the affairs of both Houses.  The extraordinary popularity of the subcommittee investigating the collapse of the last Government meant it almost became prime-time viewing.  Those who decided in RTE how much time should be devoted to television programmes might give a little more consideration to how they would represent the views of Parliament in an expanded format.  I am not suggesting every word recorded here is of such wisdom that it should be elevated but they are sincere views of those elected by the public and they should get more airing than at present.  I believe that forced, tight editing gives a false view and must, of its nature, highlight what is dramatic as opposed to what is more thoughtful.</P>
    <P>What should we do?  Both Houses should take the issue of committees more seriously than in the past.  We should aggressively support the committee system, demand proper resources for these committees and demand the respect they are entitled to.  At the same time the committees should operate in a manner which will win the public's respect.  In fairness, I do not think any committee has ever been found wanting in that regard.  The committee system should operate on a functional basis, focused on the executive activities of Government.  I hope that in the year ahead, particularly in Senator Manning's initiative with regard to an all-party committee to look at the way we operate in this House, we could address that issue.  Proper funding, proper resources and proper staffing are absolute requirements and the committee <Col N="515" /> system will not work without them.  In the not too distant future, in the all-party committee initiative suggested by Senator Manning, I will be making the proposal that a budget for each House of the Oireachtas, controlled by the Oireachtas, should be considered.</P>
    <P>The final issue to be addressed is that we cannot talk about parliamentary reform in isolation from other important reforms.  Dáil reform cannot be discussed in isolation from reform of the electoral system.  The proportional representation, single transferable vote, multi-seat constituency electoral system is a fine one in terms of representing the views of the people but there is a high cost.  It produces a form of public representation which has been referred to as high paid &ldquo;messengerboyism&rdquo;.  I do not agree that is necessarily the way we should view the kind of representation we get, but it is a representation almost exclusively focused of the constituency service.  We get a type of representation, particularly in the Dáil, from our electoral system which is extremely competitive, and frequently competing on the same cases.  I had a case yesterday from the housing section of Wicklow County Council where the letter I received had been sent to six other public representatives in the county, in other words there were seven people chasing one public representative about the same issue.  That is crazy.  It is wasteful, it is duplication and it is not proper representation.  As long as we have the PR-STV multi-seat constituency system we will have that kind of representation. If we are serious about parliamentary reform, and in particular about Dáil reform, we will have to look sooner rather than later at some system, perhaps a continental list PR system, which will allow legislators to operate as legislators and to have a balance in the way they operate their time.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to make a few comments on specific committees.  I have made this comment on a number of occasions, even to Ministers in the last Government.  The Joint Committee <Col N="516" /> on State-Sponsored Bodies is focused on the commercial State-sponsored bodies. The non-commercial State-sponsored bodies were specifically set up so that an area of public policy could be taken out from under the dead hand of ministerial responsibility.  Currently, those bodies are above parliamentary review, and that is wrong.  The time has now come for the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies to look at the commercial and non-commercial State-sponsored bodies.  The non-commercial State-sponsored bodies dispense a huge amount of public funds.  They operate in place of Government Departments and in important and critical areas of public policy, but not always in the most efficient manner.  I ask &mdash; I am not a member of that committee &mdash; that perhaps the committee should take a view on that issue.</P>
    <P>It strikes me that the Committee on Small Business and the Committee on the Family are essentially task force committees as opposed to long term ones.  If we are to focus on a specific issue and establish a committee, it should have some responsibility and time horizons before it, because otherwise it would become an arid talking shop and I would hope that would not be the case.</P>
    <P>We are not opposing these motions or calling for a vote on them.  I offered those views &mdash; they are my own views and that of many members of my party &mdash; in a constructive sense and I hope that they will be seen in that light.  They are not intended to be destructive.  I wish all of the committees and their chairpersons well, because they have a fairly daunting task before them.  Rather than knock them, we should celebrate the potential contribution that they can make to the life of our nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally, I support the motions establishing these committees. The Seanad is fortunate at this stage to be led by Senator Manning, who has a record of innovation and commitment to reform.  The Seanad is well poised, not only under his leadership but also <Col N="517" /> because of the attitude of the Opposition as expressed by Senator Roche, for the possibility of real reform.  It is forgotten that these committees were hard fought for by many people who now occupy other positions.  When Deputy Michael D. Higgins was a Senator, he demanded the establishment of a foreign affairs committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>We again come back to Senator Roche's point.  One is either the political master or servant.  I do not blame the people in Iveagh House.  The people with the political mandate either listened to or were browbeaten by the permanent Government and the committees were not established.  I am sure that Deputy M.D. Higgins is smiling to himself, now that he is occupying a seat in the Cabinet, that these committees were established.</P>
      <P>Senator Roche made many points with which I would totally agree.  Of course, the Houses of the Oireachtas should organise and regulate its own budget.  It is a nonsense of immense proportions that somebody&mdash;faceless, nameless or whatever&mdash;would decide its needs from their perception, cut it by half and then supply the money.  It is a nonsense.  I do not think this is done anywhere else; it is certainly not done in the House of Commons because I had occasion to visit and study it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had the honour of chairing the Joint Services Committee.  I took the strong view that the level of services this House required was not to be dictated by either the offices of the House or the Civil Service but by the needs of the Members.  I got great co-operation from many of the offices and personnel in this House in making the small changes I <Col N="518" /> was able to effect, but I am far from satisfied that we have even begun the task of reforming this House as far as support services for Members are concerned. The Library has been mentioned both by Senator Roche and the Leader of the House.  As the Leader well knows&mdash;he was the author of the report on the Library&mdash;it is inexcusable in 1995, when we are faced with powerful business, environmental and other lobbies, that the legislators should be the least able to defend their position because they do not have that expertise.</P>
    <P>Senator Roche referred to the miserable allocation of consultancy money.  I remember the case of a chairman of a joint committee on an important sector of State endeavour, which was responsible for looking at the expenditure of hundreds of millions of pounds, not having an allocation sufficient to buy a cup of coffee for some of the groups he met, never mind having a budget for consultancy. It was simply a nonsense.  I am in favour of the establishment of these committees because they have proved their worth, not only in this House but in other parliaments throughout the world.</P>
    <P>Senator Roche made the important point that a completely farcical situation is being played out in the other House today.  The Leaders of the Opposition in truth agree with the legislation proposed by the Government.  It is the responsibility of those now in office to bring forward legislation to conform with the referendum.  That was common cause among us all.  Then the teams on the pitch changed, and so did the rules. This is simply an instance of where false conflict is generated for reasons other than the legislation itself.  We cannot afford such conflict, our island is too small for this.  There are enough real wars to be fought between the Government and Opposition on real policies rather than on this charade of tipping at the edges of legislation because it is politically expedient to do so.  I know well that some in the Opposition side would fully agree with these points.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="519" /> I am part of the system and a Whip of the Labour Party.  One has to &ldquo;take the shilling and carry the gun&rdquo; in many cases.  I am responsible in part for party discipline.  I have often voted for measures in this House that I did not agree with and I am sure I will again. As somebody said in reference to a free vote, join the free vote party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a different consituency, Senator Norris.</P>
      <P>I am conscious that other Members want to contribute on this issue, but I want to touch on another point that was mentioned by Senator Roche&mdash;the public perception of what we do.  We are the worst in the world for putting what we do before the public.  We currently have an information officer.  I hope that officer, when she gets her portfolio together, will supply material to schools that explains precisely what this House is about&mdash;the workings of not only the Dáil and Seanad but its various committees and sub-committees and how it deals with the whole process of government. There should also be competitions in both primary and secondary schools.  This should also be the case for third level students.  It is beyond me how some of these people get through university because they are as thick as a ditch when it comes to knowing how this country works.  I am not saying this in a joking way.  Some of them are appallingly ignorant of the way in which they are governed.  Most of them just seem to be happy to get their grants.  They do not care how they are governed.  As we know from the voting patterns, those that ought to be voting &mdash; those aged between 20 and 30 years of age&mdash;are not voting and this is disgraceful.  If the committee work is to be fulfilling for the Member, it must be relevant to the public and must be publicised.  This was the point Senator Roche made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a dilemma.  Newspapers are commercial entities and newsprint and reporting is expensive.  They would say <Col N="520" /> that they are performing a public duty by giving the amount of space that they believe is adequate.  Those of us in the House would believe that it is totally inadequate.  Some way must be found to encourage newspaper proprietors to give committees more publicity; perhaps by reducing VAT on newsprint, for example.  If we want people to use money their own money for in-depth reporting of committees, perhaps that is a legitimate cost we may have to address.  The same can be said of television and radio.  There is no excuse for RTE; it broadcasts enough rubbish. There is positive proof that the public is interested in what goes on in both Houses.  The committee to which Senator Manning referred&mdash;I concur with his remarks in that regard &mdash; did the job it was asked to do at a minuscule cost.  That is the way committees of this House should be set up to investigate specific cases in the future.</P>
    <P>As Senator Roche said, the more publicity committees can get, the better. There is nothing worse than somebody who cleverly gets publicity by making a few statements at strategic times in the ear of a reporter whereas a person on a committee painstakingly working on sometimes tedious legislation may get no publicity.  Whether we like it or not, that person suffers at constituency level, and one cannot afford that.  That is something we must look at in terms of the reform of this House because it also involves the media.  There must be an encompassing discussion if we want to effect real change.</P>
    <P>I come from a school of thought which believes in fixed terms for Parliament. The notion that the Government could fall if somebody breaks their leg is nonsense.  Could one imagine a company operating on the basis that if somebody gets sick the whole edifice falls?  It is outdated nonsense.  It may have been proper to have a change of Government in the House of Commons if a Tory sire fell off his horse, but it is totally inapplicable to a modern democratic society.  Fixed terms would cut out a lot of nonsense.  As somebody once <Col N="521" /> said, dictatorship tempered by assassination is a perfect form of government.  I support the committee system and the reforms of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Now that we are talking about reform of the Seanad, perhaps we could discuss the public perception of what we do and the impact we should have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to recognise the considerable interest which not only the Government and Opposition benches have taken, but which the Independent benches have traditionally taken in the establishment of committees. Senator Magner referred to Deputy Michael D. Higgins and the establishment of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  I was a junior colleague in that battle and the Leader will remember that on three occasions I raised the issue of the establishment of a Foreign Affairs Committee on Private Members' Time.  I followed the gyrations of the political parties as they changed their views on the establishment of a Foreign Affairs Committee, depending on whether they were in or out of Government.  It was entertaining to look at the reversals which took place, but eventually such a committee was established.</P>
      <P>On the third occasion I raised this issue in Private Members' time.  After discussions with Members of all parties, I knew there was a genuine feeling that Ireland should end its isolation in Europe by being the only EU country not to have a Foreign Affairs Committee. Since the Government was reluctant to establish one, we decided to go ahead and do so.  I was modest enough to realise that I was not sufficiently eminent to be chairperson.  Deputy Michael D. Higgins became chairperson and I became secretary.  We attracted membership from all parties in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I like to believe that that little ginger group played a role in the establishment of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not always believe it when people pay tribute to the Seanad and <Col N="522" /> say that the standard of debate is higher than in the Dáil or in academia, although I agreed with Senator Magner when he made that point.  However, the three speeches we heard this morning were excellent, informed and informative, which is exactly what this Chamber should be about.  It is pity that more members of the press are not here.  I am, however, glad that a number of young citizens, a large group of school children, were in the Chamber earlier. When speaking to my colleague, Senator Quinn, we both realised that as school children or university students, we were never in either House of the Oireachtas. It is a shame that we do not reach out and educate people more, particularly in relation to the type of consensus and intellectually driven debate we had today, where partisan points were not scored. That is one of the most important things I discovered about the committees of the House on which I have served.  The Oireachtas Committee on Women's Rights worked well.  It ceased to be partisan, people represented genuine interests, made valid points and were prepared to reach some degree of consensus, which was useful.</P>
    <P>Some Members mentioned the importance of involving schools. Senator Magner mentioned the production of a leaflet.  In the past couple of days I received an excellent package of leaflets from the Department of the Environment.  One leaflet described the Seanad and the method of election.  I would like to see such an information pack being sent to schools.</P>
    <P>As regards consensus, we have been extremely well served by the former and current Leaders, Senator Wright and Senator Manning respectively.  Both have attempted to work towards consensus and the non-confrontational operation of this House, which is the way we should work.  I commend Senator Manning for culling important points from our previous discussion on reform of the Seanad.  I have read the recommendations, which are useful and which will inform the continuing debate in this area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="523" /> While I do not want to appear partisan, although I praised Members from the Government parties, I would like to say that Senator Roche's contribution was fascinating.  Like Senator Magner, I am sure Senator Manning in summing up will agree with some of the practical suggestions he made.  A number of the elements of his speech were trenchantly expressed, consistent, coherent, well thought out and would have my support. It is ludicrous that there is no budget committee and that we, as Members of the Oireachtas, elected Members of a democratic Parliament, are subject in the conduct of our business to the housekeeping provisions of anonymous civil servants in the Department of Finance.  That must end and a budget committee should be established. Senator Roche made a well argued point when he stated that the Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies dealt only with commercial State-sponsored bodies and that it should be extended to include the work of non commercial state-sponsored bodies, which should also be subject to parliamentary review, that they should not be immune to investigation.</P>
    <P>The Independent group welcomes the establishment of these committees on which we will seek representation.  I hope there will not be a grudging mechanical operation of an archaically derived mathematical system for the allocation of places.  We can swell our numbers artificially and use the rule book.  We are not grudging the chairmanship of the committees, but we want to play an important role on every committee. It was a source of sadness to me that some of my highly qualified colleagues on the Independent benches, such as Senator Quinn, with his experience in business and commerce, his interest in the family, his interest in a whole range of affairs and his capacity to speak on these matters, were not given a position on any of these committees. Similarly, Senator Henry was a clear choice for the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights, on <Col N="524" /> which I served for two terms.  I pushed myself onto the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and I am glad I did.  There were only five Members from the Seanad on that committee.  I also managed to get onto the bureau and my colleagues have agreed with me &mdash; tentatively and without obligation, as they say in solicitors' letters&mdash;that I should be nominated again.  I hope and seek to retain my position on the bureau if I am so nominated.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, I welcome the expedient way in which the motion is framed &mdash; that we have the power to send for people.  I note Senator Manning said the issue of compellibility will be addressed and that legislation is promised. That is very positive.  However, I note with regard to foreign affairs that there is a select committee which is only a Dáil committee.  Members of the Seanad are precluded from membership of it and voting at it because, under the Constitution, we are not allowed to issue Exchequer Bills and spend money. Virtually all the other committees have a provision to permit Members of Seanad Éireann to attend, take part in the proceedings but not to vote.  I ask the Leader that an amendment be made so that Members of Seanad Éireann have a right of participation on the select committee.  The financial provisions would be met by our not being allowed to vote.</P>
    <P>I could say more but my colleague, Senator Quinn, would like some time and I will yield to him if that is in order.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Norris for his kind comments.  I would correct a point he made about my not being involved in committees; I am a member of the Joint Services Committee, which Senator Magner has admirably served as chairman.  He has shown an ability to get things done around the Houses of the Oireachtas&mdash;in the Library, for example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure Senator Norris would agree with my first point that small is beautiful; <Col N="525" /> I am not talking about our heights. Smaller groups have a better chance of getting things done than larger groups. From that point of view, if these Houses are to earn respect&mdash;I emphasise &ldquo;earn&rdquo;&mdash;they will do so because we find a better way of getting things done. As Senator Manning and Senator Roche have said, the steps being taken with these resolutions represent a manner of getting things done by re-engineering how one does things in order to achieve better results.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw attention to the issue of the ability to empower people and groups.  If we can empower these groups with the ability to specialise in certain subjects&mdash;this is clearly the objective in these resolutions and in the legislation introducing privilege and compellibility the Leader has promised &mdash;we will be able to achieve better results than in the past.  It will mean that people can specialise and the expertise that individual Members of the Oireachtas have can concentrate on particular areas to achieve better results.</P>
    <P>The skill and ability of chairmanship is important.  When I became chairman of An Post 15 years ago I had no experience of chairing committees.  I went to an Irish Management Institute course on how to chair and my eyes were opened at the abilities and methods which there were.  I suggest that the Irish Management Institute be invited to provide a course for the chairmen of many of these committees, particularly if they have not had experience in the role.</P>
    <P>I have been impressed by the ability of a chairman to achieve a great deal, particularly in regard to time, action and standards of management.  How does one achieve in a committee?  One of the criticisms of boards or committees is that they become talking shops.  One of the problems in this House is that when Members are allocated 20 minutes to speak they often feel obliged to spend 20 minutes talking so as not to let the side down.  We should emphasise that speaking for a long time does not necessarily mean saying more.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="526" /> I proposed previously that action groups should have a number of rules. First, there should be no chairs; meetings should be held standing up, and that would make them a little quicker. Second, they should be held very early in the morning; not breakfast meetings but before breakfast meetings.  There is a fair possibility that the lack of food will cause an urgency to get things done. Third, in arranging the next meeting it should be agreed that it will not take place until what was agreed at the previous meeting has been finished.  In other words, it should not become a talking shop which meets again although it has not done what it was to do.</P>
    <P>There is a variety of skills and abilities dotted among the 60 Members of this House.  While everybody cannot be a member of every committee, it seems a shame that we do not find some formula for those who have a particular skill or expertise to be able to concentrate on those areas, no matter from what party or group they come.  It may not be easy or possible to do.  It was possible to find a place on the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation for Senator Wilson.  We all agree that his was a voice that needed to be heard and if the seats on the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation had been distributed on another basis it is possible that Senator Wilson's voice would not have been heard.  However, because there was a need it was possible to find a place for him.</P>
    <P>Similar thinking may be possible in regard to these committees.  I am not sure how it could be done, or if it is possible to achieve it under normal traditions. Perhaps this is a time for discarding some of the normal traditions and the old rules that applied.  In accepting these motions this House is ready to throw away some of the past traditions where they are recognised not to be useful in the future.  I encourage and support the motions for these new committees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the motions and the decision to expand the committees. We have had a number of opportunities to speak about reform of the House and, on a previous occasion, I referred to the lack of representation for this House on the previous committees.  This is now being remedied and that is welcome.</P>
      <P>I would generally be critical of the number of committees.  If there are too many committees, with fragmentation, overlapping and duplication, they lose their impact, and the public perception would be scattered rather than focused on a smaller number of committees.  I cannot see the need for a Joint Committee on European Affairs separate from the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs. I know that European affairs are important and will have a great impact in the coming years, but they could be dealt with by the subcommittee of the Foreign Affairs Committee.</P>
      <P>I was critical at the Foreign Affairs Committee of the breaking up of the committee into subcommittees, which at times found it difficult to get a quorum to enable a meeting to proceed.  That would be a mistake.  It would be preferable to have a limited number of committees with good representation which focus their work and create a public awareness of their work by sending out the message that valuable work is being done.</P>
      <P>Very few people out in the streets today know what goes on in Oireachtas committees, what they do or what their purpose is.  They do not know a lot about what goes on in the House or who their representatives are, but that is another matter.  It will be more difficult to explain the work done by committees to the public if there are too many committees. They will be less useful to the Government if they are fragmented in a way that will lead to duplication of work and to a lack of clarity in the message which they send to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These committees are very important for the Government.  If committees work well and suggest amendments to legislation, they can be very worth while <Col N="528" /> for Ministers.  They can be a very good sounding board for Ministers who wish to tackle divisive issues.  The committee system is an ideal way to tease out issues on which there might not be general agreement.  The committees proposed here give Members an opportunity to formulate a general view that would be less contentious and less difficult to get through the Houses of the Oireachtas at a later stage when legislation is brought forward.</P>
    <P>I welcome in general some of the committees proposed, especially the Committee on small Businesses. Another committee deals with Government development plans.  Those two committees could be amalgamated so as to reduce the number of committees overall.  The Government proposes to establish a committee dealing with natural sustainable development strategy and the small businesses committee could be incorporated into that dealing with business generally.  The best part of the objective of that committee is that of maximising the advantage to Ireland of environmentally sustainable policies. It will be concerned with getting a market for environmentally friendly goods and how the environmentally friendly image that we have here in Ireland can be promoted.</P>
    <P>I am contradicting myself in saying this, but a committee could be established to deal with the environment generally, because environmental issues are more important now.  The proposed Committee on the Environment is to deal with environmentally friendly production of goods, capitalising on our image here and maximising our opportunity in the market.  But we have seen in numerous cases the damage that has been done to the environment through various Government policies, we have seen the discussion and controversy that has arisen in relation to environmental issues and we have seen the huge support from the public for parties which support environmental issues.</P>
    <P>There is no proposal before us here for a committee which would deal with the environment generally.  Legislation <Col N="529" /> was recently enacted to establish the Environmental Protection Agency and its responsibilities were clearly defined. There is an opportunity for a committee of the Houses to look at the environment generally, to look at both the national and international issues that affect us and formulate a clear policy. At present there is no clearly defined policy in relation to many environmental matters and this has many implications for business and for the economy generally.  While I am critical of the number of committees, there is no forum in which to raise some matters such as the environment and we could deal with these matters on an all-party Oireachtas committee basis.</P>
    <P>The Committee on Women's Rights has been re-established.  I compliment the members of that committee for the work they have done over the years; but in spite of that work and in spite of a large amount of EU legislation on women's issues, we still find a lack of women in the decision making process and to a very large extent that has not been remedied.  Women are still at the lower end of the salary bracket, and that situation has deteriorated rather than improved over the last few years.  The establishment of the committee will continue to focus the attention of the Houses of the Oireachtas on the necessity to further proceed with the elimination of discrimination against women and the encouragement of more women into decision making, whether it be in the courts or in the European institutions.</P>
    <P>Women are underrepresented in the institutions of the European Union.  It is staggering that the European Union has been to the forefront in the campaign to eliminate discrimination against women, but women are very seriously discriminated against in the Courts of Justice and in the Commission and in various other institutions of the Union.  Nevertheless, this committee will offer a further opportunity to eliminate the discrimination against women in our society.  I compliment the members of <Col N="530" /> the former committee for the work they have done in that regard.</P>
    <P>Overall the motion is timely.  It is opportune to emphasise the necessity to further streamline and modernise our operations here.  An opportunity has been afforded to members of the Parliament and others to address committees, and this is welcome.  I would like to see fewer committees, less overlapping and duplication, which would lead in turn to better use of limited resources.  There are complaints about limited resources in committees; and if there are too many committees, the Government will find it difficult at times to get a quorum to hold a meeting.  Apart from those comments, I welcome this proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I have mixed views about the motions before us today.  It is a bit like the curate's egg, it is good in parts. I do not welcome some parts of it; but, having said that, I do not envisage voting against the motion.</P>
      <P>The committee system as it operates, and as it is proposed to be expanded, means that we will wind up with 17 committees for a membership of 225 people between both Houses of the Oireachtas. Contrast that with the situation across the water where, if I am correct, there are 38 committees standing in the Houses of Parliament at Westminster where membership of the House of Commons is 650.  Membership of the House of Lords is indeterminate but a couple of hundred probably attend on a reasonably regular basis, so the ability to man those committees is much greater than it is in our case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the expansion of the committee system nothing more than just a way of finding jobs for the boys and the girls? We have chairpersons and convenors who receive generous allowances.  Is this just a way of compensating people for their disappointment at not reaching higher office?  We already passed legislation to create two extra Ministers of State.  We have a lean-to Minister to the Cabinet.  He sits on the high chair at the Cabinet table and can listen but not vote.  There seems to be a trend towards <Col N="531" /> a creeping bureaucracy which becomes all pervasive.</P>
    <P>This is not to say that committees are not needed; of course, they are needed. The questions arises as to whether there are too many of them and whether they could be operated more effectively.  Perhaps the need for committees could be reduced if attention was given to the fundamental reform of parliamentary questions.  If such questions could extract meaningful information, there might not be such a need for the committee system.  It was remarked during the course of the beef tribunal, and very widely reported, that Mr. Justice Hamilton said that had questions been answered properly in the Dáil there might have been no need for the tribunal.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to the expansion of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  There are aspects of this expansion which I welcome, two of them in particular.  One is that it can engage the services of persons with specialist or technical knowledge to assist it or a sub-committee for the purpose of particular inquiries.  This is to be welcomed, as is the provision that Irish members of the European Parliament and of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe can attend and be heard at the committee's meetings, even though they cannot vote.  These are welcome developments and within the context of Oireachtas reform&mdash;I do not want to stray into the debate on Seanad reform which will take place later&mdash;are matters at which we could usefully look.  In the previous debate on Seanad reform there was a fair degree of support for the view that MEPs and members of the European Commission would have rights of audience in and access to the House when we are debating matters relevant to EU activity.</P>
    <P>There is provision for joint meetings with the proposed Committee on European Affairs.  I am not too sure about the need for a separate Committee on European Affairs.  I realise these are extremely important matters and that a great deal of detailed work has to be <Col N="532" /> done in this area, but it may be more efficient to do this by the establishment of a subcommittee of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs to deal with European affairs.  There is provision for the establishment of such subcommittees in the proposals before us.</P>
    <P>An important matter for the Committee on European affairs to discuss&mdash;I am assuming it will be set up, even though I think it can be questioned whether it would be better to establish a subcommittee&mdash;is the preparation for the Intergovernmental Conference in 1996.  This will be crucial and very important during the coming year.  We need to have a fairly coherent view about Ireland's future within Europe in terms of foreign affairs, defence and so on.  These are matters the committee could tease out.</P>
    <P>I would recommend to this committee that it should examine how Europe can be made more relevant to our citizens. Rotary clubs in Ireland run a leadership competition to send young people&mdash;24 from the North and the South went on the last occasion&mdash;to Strasbourg to visit the European Parliament and to work for a few days as if they were a parliament, with their own committees. I met a young person from Kildare who was fortunate enough to win a place on this trip.  He made a very telling point by saying that European young people of his age&mdash;that is, in the mid-teens&mdash; had a much better understanding of how Europe worked and the roles of the Commission, the European Council and the European Parliament than their Irish counterparts.  He believed this was because such understanding was a formal part of the educational curriculum in those countries.  While he had a civics class once a week, these children were given ongoing teaching on European affairs.  there has been talk about the so-called information deficit.  The Committee on European Affairs could look at how we can make Europe more relevant to citizens, who are also citizens of the European Union under Maastricht.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="533" /> Senator Daly made a point which I wish to reinforce and which I had intended to make.  This relates to the Committee on Sustainable Development. When we read what this committee of 15 Members of Dáil Éireann and four Members of Seanad Éireann are asked to do, we need a translation of this.  They are asked to identify, in prospect of the national sustainable development strategy being prepared by the Government, measures designed to maximise the advantage to Ireland of environmentally sustainable sectoral policies and, in particular, to consider, by way of case studies or otherwise, the extent of Irish participation in the growing world market for environmental goods and services and the means by which this market share can be increased and to report thereon to both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I am not sure I know what this means. Are we talking about consultancy companies which are touring the world, or will we ask <i>The Rainbow Warrior</i> to dock in Dublin basin so we can have a look at it?  I want to reinforce the point made by Senator Daly.  The environment and the maintenance of a clean environment are of such importance economically to this country that they should be the focus of the committee rather than being this woolly unspecified beast.  I cannot nail down the matters with which it will be involved.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the Committee on Small Business and Services and the Committee on the Family.  I have more difficulty with these committees than with the one on European Affairs because I do not see any justification on policy grounds for their establishment and I am not sure what they will do.  The Committee on Crime sat for nine months and produced a report in July 1992, which recommended that as a matter of urgency a Juvenile Justice Bill be presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas but we are still waiting for it. These committees need to be focused on what they are doing so that the reports they produce will be acted on. This leads to the area of parliamentary <Col N="534" /> efficiency and Oireachtas reform, which I do not want to stray into too much because I realise there is an ongoing debate on it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Leader's statement that a privileges and compellability Bill will be introduced at a very early date. This is at the core of the whole efficiency of committees.  It is no good having them unless they have teeth, can do the job and ensure that the people they need to hear have to appear before them.  There must be legislation to achieve this.  We have seen the deficiencies when the Dáil Select Committee on Legislation and Security produced its report.  I do not criticise it for the work it did or the report it produced, but the constraints under which it had to operate made it very difficult for committees to work effectively. Even taking into account constitutional constraints in terms of the rights of individuals attending committees, some vehicle must be found within the context of reform to ensure that committees can be effective and work well.</P>
    <P>There is an argument that in the case of senior State appointments we should have a committee system on the lines of that in America.  People should be subject to examination by a committee so that what needs to be made public about them is made public.  They should be subject to public scrutiny and once they pass this they would be suitable for appointment to State positions.</P>
    <P>Another matter which arises is the membership of the committees.  It is proposed that 28 Senators sit on committees. There are ten on the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, six on the Joint Committee on European Affairs, four on the Joint Committee on the Family, four on the Joint Committee on Small Business and Services and four on the Joint Committee on Sustainable Development.  That amounts to nearly half the membership of the House.  It is getting to the point that I wonder how it will be possible to man the committees effectively.</P>
    <P>Having said that, it is absolutely essential that all parties and those who <Col N="535" /> are not members of parties are represented on committees.  The committees should represent the Houses of the Oireachtas and I do not mean on a proportional basis.  If there are groups such as the Progressive Democrats, the Green Party and the Independents which offer a different perspective on the matters the committees are discussing, they should have audience at those committees.  They should be at the table and they should have a vote.  The difficulty is that if this is done on a strictly proportional basis, one could have up to 40 members on a committee, and that is not desirable.</P>
    <P>I do not have a ready answer to this problem but it is essential that all opinions are articulated.  My experience is that this House has always been reasonable in that respect.  There are times when I and my colleague might not have the right to be heard, but the House has always been accommodating in trying to let each shade of opinion be represented and articulated.</P>
    <P>There are three Opposition representatives on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies.  Due to the change in Government and size of Fianna Fáil, this excludes the Progressive Democrats from the committee, which is not desirable. Originally we were not going to have a place on the Joint Committee on European Affairs but that has been resolved and a place found.  The Leader is aware of the point I am making.  It is important and one with which he would agree in principle.  Those of us from the minority parties or who are non-party should be adequately represented.</P>
    <P>The question of resources has been mentioned.  I can only reinforce the arguments made.  It is essential that the committees are properly resourced to do their work and bring the necessary people to the meetings.  There is also the question of research.  In that respect it has to be acknowledged that the Opposition are at a disadvantage in terms of access to information and officials.  The dynamic nature of politics in the last <Col N="536" /> couple of years has brought about change on both sides of the House. Those who are now in Government can readily recognise the difficulties the Opposition confronts.</P>
    <P>It is not just a question of providing ammunition&mdash;if I may put it in those terms&mdash;for the Opposition; it is a question of improving the level of debate and improving the input.  If the committees are to work effectively, it should be on the basis of the consensus model rather than the adversarial model of parliament which we have observed in Westminster.  There are lessons to be learnt from looking further afield to Europe, where politics are based very much on the consensus model.  Differences can be resolved within the committees, providing a coherent approach which can go forward to Government.</P>
    <P>There has to be some check on the Executive, because in recent years the power of the Executive is becoming totally disproportionate to the power of Parliament.  I have spoken before about fundamental parliamentary democracy and the fact that the Executive increasingly seems to treat the Parliament with a degree of contempt which, in my view, is not acceptable.  Frequently, we are just here to rubber stamp matters.</P>
    <P>In fairness, both the current and former Leaders of this House valiantly attempted to prevent that from happening. At all times there was and is an attempt to reach consensus in the way we do our business.  Obviously, we have our political differences and they remain fundamental at times; but a reasonable attempt has been made to accommodate some of the criticisms I made in the past.</P>
    <P>It is desirable that lobby groups would have access to the committees.  It would be far more preferable to have lobby groups brought in on a formal basis to put their case to all parties rather than have a tour of each person. In the present context there might be something to be said for that as it would prevent the type of phone calls which we have received and which I received most recently this morning.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="537" /> I worry about the proliferation of committees.  There is a role for them, but it has to be focused and efficient. I have made certain recommendations which I hope can be taken on board at some point.  I note that Senator Manning said this would not be the last word on the issue.  I was glad to hear him say that.  I hope we can progress towards a more efficient Parliament and a more efficient committee system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators who participated in what has been a constructive and well informed debate. It was one of the best debates to which I have had the privilege of listening for some time.  I will be slightly invidious and single out Senator Roche.  I do not like praising somebody in their absence, but Senator Roche's speech was one of the best speeches I have heard on parliamentary reform.  I can only do him the ultimate compliment of circulating it to my students at UCD who are studying the workings of Parliament.</P>
      <P>Every Senator made a valuable contribution. There were a number of points made from the Opposition benches with which I find myself in some agreement.  The English in defining the objectives of the Joint Committee on Sustainable Development is somewhat difficult to penetrate.  Clarity is certainly not the first word that springs to mind when reading the functions of that committee. There may well be a strong case for a major environmental committee and that is my honest reaction to what was said on the opposite side.</P>
      <P>There is a difference of opinion as to whether there should be separate committees on European Affairs and Foreign Affairs and subcommittees.  The important thing is, as Senator Dardis said, that it is up to us to make the rules as we go along.  It is up to the committees themselves, if they find they are not working, to suggest changes.  For too long we have all have waited for big brother or big sister in the Government to tell us how to organise our affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A telling point made by Senator Roche, and supported by Senator <Col N="538" /> Magner and others, concerned the absence of a separate budget for Parliament, leaving it to depend on the whims of the Department of Finance as to what it can or cannot do.  A self confident Parliament should be the best judge of what it needs to do, how to do it and how much it will cost.  Similarly, it is really up to us to say whether the committees are working, how they can be changed and to demand those changes.  It is to a certain extent in our own hands and that is why I said at the beginning that this is not the last word. I hope we are at the beginning of a process of change in these Houses and that today is just a first step.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis raised the question of representation for smaller groups. There are formulae which are used to allocate places and these can be unfair to smaller or non-party groups.  I will certainly try, at the Seanad Committee of Selection, to meet the points made by Senator Dardis as far as possible.  I know I will have the support of Senator Wright and Fianna Fáil in seeking, with Senator Magner, to get the widest possible range of representation.  We all know it is not always possible to please everybody, and some committees are perhaps more glamorous than others, but we will do our best.</P>
    <P>I conclude by thanking all Members who contributed.  The points of criticism as well as the points of support will be noted.  I am happy that the House will support the motions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated the previous day I would speak on coastal erosion. That is my main reason for speaking on the Bill because this debate and the statements on flooding a fortnight ago have featured the same points.  Before doing that I have some points on arterial drainage.</P>
      <P>One of the most familiar events in Ireland through the centuries has been flooding.  Unfortunately, our rainfall varies greatly from one year to another and there is always panic when rainfall increases and is concentrated in a specific area.  The latest rainfall is concerntrated in the west but there is also severe flooding in the east and south-east.</P>
      <P>In the last week of January I made a journey from Galway to my constituency of Wexford via Clare, Limerick and Portlaoise.  When I reached Carlow there was three to four feet of water at a bridge and I had to make a diversion through Athy.  I saw at first hand the consequences of flooding not only in the west but through the midlands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has always been severe flooding in Wexford along the River Slaney, especially since Christmas last year.  The flooding results from a lack of maintenance <Col N="574" /> over a long period.  Many smaller tributaries cause local flooding and although in Galway the case is somewhat different, local flooding has caused hardship to a large number of people. I sympathise with those in Galway and Clare who find themselves and their farms under two to three feet of water for an extended period.  Unfortunately, the news today is not good; we are due to have further rainfall in the latter half of this week.</P>
    <P>Some people may not realise the awful damage occurring as a result of flooding.  Apart from flooding in farmyards, which is devastating because people cannot carry on their normal farming duties, there is flooding damage to grasslands.  I have first hand experience of this and where such land is waterlogged for an extended period practically all the grassland needs reseeding, which is an expensive operation.</P>
    <P>The Minister should bear these matters in mind when considering compensation. No other part of the country, aside from Galway, Clare and parts of the midlands adjacent to the Shannon, has such extended periods of flooding of grasslands.  I ask the Minister to convey to the Minister for Agriculture our concern that this problem be taken into consideration for compensation.</P>
    <P>According to a recent television report the present weather is the worst we have ever had in this country.  There was an increase of 200 per cent in normal rainfall, particularly in the Shannon region, and increases of 117 per cent in the Waterford and south east regions. There has been an increase of 200 per cent in normal rainfall in other areas.  It is clear that flooding is not new to this country but this year has been particularly hard in the context of overall rainfall across the country.  Another report in the newspapers warned that there will be 30 year cycles of this type of rainfall as a result of global warming. If that is true the situation will be very serious.</P>
    <P>There is no quick solution to this problem &mdash; we will never see the problem <Col N="575" /> of flooding solved in our lifetimes. It is an ongoing problem which requires ongoing maintenance of tributaries and our large rivers.  I compliment the Minister, Deputy J. Higgins, and his predecessor, Deputy Hogan, on their quick response to the flooding problem.  The Minister has stated that the Government has decided, in light of the information available, on a coherent, coordinated response to the problems facing individuals and communities in the aftermath of flooding.  I welcome the establishment of an inter-departmental committee, which the Minister will chair.  It will oversee the response and co-ordinate input from various Departments and agencies which have responsibility in this area.</P>
    <P>We as a community have an obligation to maintain tributary rivers. There has been flooding in Wexford since 1 January this year and the cause of that local flooding is readily visible. It is caused by the numerous tributaries of large rivers being unable to accommodate the vast quantities of rainfall that have occurred during the past two months.  All that is required is attention to overgrowth and undergrowth.  There are huge numbers of people unemployed. The current SES schemes could work to great effect in rural areas. People could be employed through the SES schemes by the county councils &mdash; they have the equipment, engineering staff and supervisors &mdash; to clean up these small tributaries at little expense to the taxpayer.  There is not a parish in this country that does not require the cleaning of its tributary rivers.  During January this year I was contacted about this issue by a number of people.  I spoke to the engineer who was available at the time and he told me that the small tributaries are unable to take the large volumes of water.  It is most depressing for people to find that not only are their farmyards flooded but also their dwelling houses.</P>
    <P>The most important issue I wish to discuss, however, is the protection of our coastline.  The national plan for the <Col N="576" /> first time contains a provision for coastal protection.  While the sum of £5.5 million is quite small relative to national requirements, the fact that investment in coast protection work has been recognised in this fashion must be welcomed. The national study carried out by the county engineers' association a number of years ago identified the sections of the coastline at risk.  It highlighted the fact that about £125 million would be required to alleviate problems in the critical sections of approximately 490 kilometres.  Wexford has the longest length of the most sensitive coastline in any county &mdash; approximately one fifth of the national critical coastline.  This country's submission to the EU regional committee suggests that approximately £60 million would be required to deal with the most vulnerable sections of coastline in County Wexford.</P>
    <P>In response to requests from the Department of the Marine the council has named four priority schemes &mdash; Courtown, Cullenstown, Cahore and Duncannon &mdash; and has submitted proposals to the Department for funding.  A major beach nourishment programme, which will result in approximately £1 million being spent in Rosslare, has been undertaken during the past winter. It is being co-funded by the Department of the Marine, Iarnród Éireann and the county council.  I can give some examples of the situation regarding coastal protection.  This is not just a problem for Wexford &mdash; it is a national problem that has not been tackled.  I will ask Senator Daly to withdraw his Bill to allow a longer and wider debate to take place.</P>
    <P>The city and county engineers' report of 1991 indicated that approximately £125 million was necessary to carry out emergency repairs and protection works, particularly after the storms of 1989 and 1990.  The report was given to the Government, of which Senator Daly was a member, six years ago but not one penny was provided to deal with that situation.  That was a serious flooding situation.  We can talk about inland flooding but flooding is also caused by <Col N="577" /> the sea.  A sum of £5.5 million is allocated in the national development plan for coastal protection until 1999.  A programme costing £5.5 million is completely inadequate for a period of approximately five years.  I will seek that the Government Bill will include provisions dealing with flooding on our coastline.  The sum of £5.5 million is not adequate in the context of the requirement of £125 million.  That is a large sum, but even £10 million or £14 million per year would be useful.  We cannot expect the Exchequer to invest huge sums in one year, but a reasonable amount could be provided.  It could be divided among the county councils of the coastal counties. That would achieve results.</P>
    <P>In Courtown there has been severe erosion in recent years.  There is danger to the beach and sand dunes and that the sea will undermine Courtown canal. Courtown pier is in danger of collapse in the event of a large storm like Hurricane Charlie.  The funding requirement to alleviate these problems is approximately £1 million.  North County Wexford is heavily dependent on major tourist resorts such as Courtown, where the population can increase tenfold during the holiday season of June, July, August and September.  If that resort is affected by a very bad storm, the damage I have mentioned will occur.  This information is based on the engineer's report.</P>
    <P>In Cahore there is severe erosion of the beach.  There is a danger of flooding of holiday homes and a danger to the drainage scheme in Cahore.  Cahore pier is in need of urgent repairs.  The cost of work in that area is approximately £75,000.  The figures I am quoting are not huge; they are reasonable.  In Cullenstown, another holiday resort, the amenity beach has been almost washed away.  The River Cull at Ballyteige changes course due to erosion.  There is severe erosion of cliffs in the area and an urgent need to stabilise the Cull estuary in order to halt further beach erosion. That is another sea resort which is in danger of collapse.  The approximate cost for Duncannon, which is one of our <Col N="578" /> blue flag beaches, would be in the region of £120,000.  There is severe erosion at the southern end and the golf course, public roads and strand are in danger.  The approximate cost of this would be in the region of £75,000.</P>
    <P>The county council has an annual programme under which it provides X amount of money and which last year was in the region of £30,000.  The local people provided about £35,000.  Much work has been done with rock armour, which is where very large stones are brought to the beach, a ditch is made along the beach to stop the sea coming in and the sands build up around the rock armour.  This has been extremely successful and if rock armour had not been put in place in Courtown very serious damage would have been done.</P>
    <P>There is urgent need for a national coastal authority.  There are too many agencies involved at present &mdash; local authorities, the Department of the Marine, CIE, the Office of Public Works and the Department of the Environment. A Bill of this type should include that type of development and essential repairs.</P>
    <P>I will not criticise Senator Daly's Bill in the slightest as I think that it is timely. Nevertheless, the Minister stated in this House that he is prepared to bring a Bill before the Seanad to which we can make amendments.  That is a very fair offer.  Senator Daly's Bill contains compensation rather than protection, although I know that protection comes under the 1945 Act.  I appeal to Senator Daly to do the logical thing by withdrawing his Bill and awaiting the Minister's Bill.  We could ask the Minister of State today to give us some guarantee of a timescale when he will introduce his Bill in this House.  That is all that we can ask for.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and this debate on this very important issue.  I wish to express my sympathy to all those who have had to endure flooding for the last few months. Appalling damage has been done to their houses, livestock and family life.  I <Col N="579" /> must be one of the few Members with constituents who are flooded in other countries, as some are flooded in the Rhine valley at the moment.</P>
      <P>As a member of the Red Cross, I am very aware of the work which its committees have done in helping to distribute compensation to victims of previous serious floods.  However, they have a mammoth task to undertake this time.  I hope that as well as giving them money to help to compensate the victims, the Minister will also give the Red Cross itself a major grant to help in the distribution of what has to be brought to the victims.  It is a voluntary organisation whose members give of their time very freely and honourably.  However, the structures behind the organisation may need further bolstering if it is to undertake a mammoth effort on behalf of the Government as it has done in the past.</P>
      <P>I have some concerns about the Minister's committee, which seems so wide as to include virtually everybody &mdash; the Departments of the Taoiseach, Foreign Affairs, Finance, Justice, the Environment, Defence, Agriculture, Food and Forestry, the Marine, Social Welfare, Transport, Energy, Communications and the Office of Public Works. I think that only Health and Education have been left out and I cannot see why they were as children are going to school in boats and the health situation would be quite appalling in those areas. It is a very big committee, which always worries me.  I know that the Minister of State intends it to have an all embracing view of what has happened, but I feel that this is the sort of committee which when asked to design a horse would come up with a camel.  I wonder how the European Union will regard such a committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, I have constituents who have been flooded elsewhere.  In modern times flooding of rivers has become extremely serious because we have built on and tried to use areas which are natural flood lands.  This has been a major problem in Holland, where the area between the summer and winter <Col N="580" /> dykes seems to have been one of the worst affected areas.  In the past building did not take place on that land.  We have to look at this very seriously when we examine arterial drainage.  The Rhine has been greatly shortened by about 80 kilometers from Basle to the sea.  That change in the whole watercourse has tremendous potential for hydrological and engineering problems. We have to look very carefully at why the problem has arisen in some areas which in the past were mainly marshland, such as the Shannon marshes.</P>
    <P>I got the impression from the Minister of State's speech that he is going to take on board the best engineering advice in this regard.  This is not simply a matter of boring holes in the ground and trying to get the water out, because this has become a recurrent problem in various areas.  It is also important to remember that some of the richest lands in the world are alluvial plains which had regular flooding episodes.  I know that this is no comfort to the people of Gort at the moment.  All of those international areas with flooding problems such as the Mississippi valley, the Po valley, the Rhine valley and the Ganges have a tradition of flooding.  However, it has got a great deal worse now, due largely to industrial development, which has not taken into account the best interests of the whole land mass.</P>
    <P>I know that after two or three years trees are a great help in soaking up the ground water.  For example, the flooding in the Ganges area has been caused by the deforestation of the lower hills. With regard to our afforestation programmes, we should examine if planting trees in a line makes any difference.  The rivulets run down rather like a ploughed field.  I have often wondered if anybody has done any research on that and if it would be better to plant the trees in diagonal lines &mdash; there is a Ph.D. project for someone if they are listening.</P>
    <P>This is a many faceted issue and involves far more than installing drains. We have had very serious environmental problems to deal with, such as blocked drains, and a tremendous <Col N="581" /> emphasis had to be put on maintenance. The weather conditions have been very bad, but it is also important to look at the industrial and residential development of lands near rivers, which are very charming places to live and very useful places to build industrial projects. We need to look at this very carefully to see if we are putting an unbearable strain on the environment from a hydrological point of view.  Maintenance must be stressed, and not just individual maintenance by farmers but also by the county councils.  Perhaps we have not been careful enough about this and it has been a contributory factor.</P>
    <P>I strongly support all of those who are looking for some sort of national policy on coastal erosion.  In parts of this country it seems as if we have thrown in the towel.  There has been such severe coastal erosion that one wonders how a large amount of the problems there can ever be reversed and they probably cannot. I urge the Minister of State, in addition to his concerns about arterial drainage, to also accept the fact that this is a very serious problem for the whole island.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I compliment my county colleague, Senator Daly, for introducing this Bill. He recognises the significance and seriousness of the recent flooding. However, this begs the question why Senator Daly and his party did not present this Bill three months ago when they were in Government and had the opportunity to do something.</P>
      <P>Flooding is not a new phenomenon. There have been flooding and drainage problems since the foundation of the State and Senator Daly and his party have been in Government for the most of that time.  Perhaps this Bill was on a shelf in the loft of the Office of Public Works and Senator Daly took it with him when he was leaving office because his colleagues were not prepared to put it through Government.  Perhaps this is why it is now before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Nevertheless, I compliment the Senator for his initiative. It is a response to the existing problems. There are some valuable and laudable sections in the Bill and I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Higgins, and the Government will be in a position to consider certain aspects of this Bill and incorporate them into more extensive legislation, which the Government may bring forward soon.  I am delighted to hear the Minister hopes to have his legislation ready and published within four to six weeks.  This is a record time in terms of the production of legislation, particularly legislation of this nature because there is so much involved.  It is a phenomenal task to have a Bill ready in that time and I congratulate the Minister and all the Departments involved.</P>
      <P>Unlike Senator Henry, I think the establishment of the interdepartmental committee is extremely wise and highly commendable.  I say this because those of us who have dealt with flooding problems over the years have always found it extremely difficult to identify one particular Department which will take responsibility for flooded areas.  The position with regard to flooded roads is the only one which is clear.  The local authorities are responsible if a road is flooded and damaged in their area.  In other cases one gets the runaround between the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, the Department of the Marine and the Office of Public Works.  The bucks keeps circulating between the Departments because nobody is willing to take responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By establishing this committee, the Government has pulled together the key Departments which traditionally had some element of responsibility. When this committee produces a report, I hope it will be in a position to identify clear areas of responsibility within Departments.  It is up to the committee to decide but I hope, when a problem arises in the future, that one will be able <Col N="583" /> to clearly identify who is responsible and get that Department to act because, heretofore, this has not been the case.</P>
    <P>There are particular responsibilities, for example, in relation to the Department of the Environment and local authorities giving planning permission. In my constituency recently a field was bought by a local authority.  This field has been repeatedly flooded over the years but there are plans to build a number of properties on it.  One wonders what will happen if houses built on that field are flooded in ten years.  Who will take responsibility?  Some of the things that happen in the public sector are highly questionable.  One wonders what people are about and when common sense should prevail.</P>
    <P>If county councillors proceed, as we on Clare County Council and other councils have done at different times, with section 4 resolutions, they are always advised by the county manager that, as councillors, we are personally liable if something goes wrong as a result of the granting of that planning permission.  These aspects must be teased out and examined in the context of the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry takes responsibility for certain lands, due to the traditional responsibility of the Land Commission which is now incorporated into the Department.  There is a need to identify clearly the responsibilities of that Department across the country and I hope this will be done.</P>
    <P>One of the problems addressed by the Bill and in the previous debate on flooding two weeks ago is the position with regard to forestry.  Senator Henry referred to the drainage systems put in place for reafforestation.  I attended a meeting in Connolly in my constituency two weeks ago where the people discussed the change in their local environment due to large vertical drains on the side of mountains in areas of reafforestation. Water gushes down the drains and onto the roads, which results in erosion.  This is causing havoc and <Col N="584" /> somebody must take responsibility for the forestry section of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry. Some order must be imposed as regards what lands are reafforested.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it is outside the Bill's remit, but there are lands being reafforested which should be used for agricultural purposes.  There are areas of marginal land where afforestation should proceed, but there should be some restriction where there is good land and people anxious to farm it.  At present, if a person has land they can plant trees, regardless of its quality.  Some parameters and direction need to be given in relation to the afforestation programme. A clear policy and a development plan for agriculture and forestry must be drafted to impose some order in this area.</P>
    <P>The bulk of reafforestation taking place uses coniferous rather than deciduous trees.  There is land suitable for each type.  Where land is suitable for deciduous trees, people should not be allowed to plant coniferous trees.  In the long term, these aspects have an impact on soakage of water, drainage and the environment.  This can also be looked at in a global context, because there appears to be a change in seasons.</P>
    <P>I remember a former Minister for the Environment, Pádraig Flynn, introducing legislation in the Dáil some years ago which dealt with the ozone layer. He mentioned the difficulties it would pose in relation to climatic changes worldwide; there appears to be a knock-on effect in this area too.  There has been unprecedented rainfall of almost 27 inches in the west in the past two months and it has had a huge impact on agriculture, roads, etc., which cannot be minimised.  The interdepartmental committee must closely examine all aspects of this issue.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Marine has responsibility for specific areas of the coastline.  As an island nation, we must realise that we are in a vulnerable position, especially in certain parts of the country where coastal erosion is ongoing.  Unfortunately, in the first submission <Col N="585" /> made by the Government for Structural Funds five or six years ago, no section was included for coastal erosion purposes.  As a result of pressure brought to bear by Fine Gael in the last submission, an application for funding for this area was included.  This aspect must not be minimised or overlooked.</P>
    <P>For example, in my constituency, near the Shannon estuary, a major section of a wall was damaged in the recent storms but it is impossible to get any Department to take responsibility for it.  There are about six or seven farmers in an area where hundreds of acres have been destroyed by salt water.  This land cannot be used for approximately a year and these farmers will suffer as a result. They should be considered for compensation in terms of fodder because there is actual damage.  The grass will not grow and the farmers will not be in a position to cut silage or save hay.</P>
    <P>Gort, Sixmilebridge and Ennis are good examples of what is happening in certain towns.  In these three towns, within a short distance of each other, homes and businesses have been flooded and there is need for compensation. There is a section in the Bill that deals specifically with compensation and I wonder if the Minister will consider this for his own Bill?  Section 6 deals with compensation in respect of flood damage out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, but it would be very difficult at this stage to say that everybody will be compensated for damage to their houses and property.  The reality is that within the next two or three weeks we could have up to ten inches of rainfall.  While there might be a large number of properties flooded at present, there could be many more if the flooding worsens and the situation deteriorates.</P>
    <P>The Minister needs space to take everything into consideration because until the situation levels off, nobody will know the full extent of the problem. There are a definite number of cases involving real hardship that will have to be considered for compensation.  The level of distress and the damage that have affected some people's livelihood <Col N="586" /> is phenomenal &mdash; their residential property, farmyard, machinery and lands, etc.  It is a disaster for these people. There are a number of farming families who are facing disaster.  Many of them would have raised money from the banks for farm development purposes or building a new house.  They have major commitments and repayments to make, having believed that things would remain normal but a very abnormal situation now exists.  Something has to be done for them.  I do not know how this will be achieved because there are financial restrictions.  The previous Government had no specific allowances or money in their Estimates for flooding or for special compensation purposes, no more than the current Government. We are talking about two Governments in office within a few months of each other.  That is the reality but something must be done for the real hardship cases.  There is another problem.  The owners of houses which had been previously flooded &mdash; and were also flooded recently &mdash; cannot insure their properties.</P>
    <P>Overall there is a major problem which crosses all Departments.  In relation to rivers in County Clare ten years ago £200,000 was spent yearly by the county council on the maintenance of rivers.  That is no longer the case.  If one leaves aside inflation that is £2 million &mdash; £2.5 million with inflation &mdash; of river maintenance which has not been carried out because the council felt obliged to put the money into road development, and we all know the condition of our roads.  There is a difficulty there.  It comes down to the fundamental issue of finance, a difficult issue for any Government to address but this Government will have to address it.</P>
    <P>The Minister's legislation will be before the House in a matter of weeks and it would be wise to withdraw the current Bill so that all aspects could be considered in detail because&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>You do not have to legislate for compensation because an emergency Estimate is sometimes introduced and money is provided in this way.  That happens where there is disaster or hardship.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry has already gone part of the way towards that when the Minister, Deputy Yates, made an announcement in relation to further compensation.  I am sure that once this interdepartmental committee examines, in fine detail, the difficulties and cases of serious hardship which arise in particular instances special cognisance will be taken and special consideration given.  I have every confidence that the Minister will do this.  It would be prudent for Senator Daly to allow the Department, with the Attorney General, to fully examine every aspect of this situation.</P>
      <P>Flooding is a monumental problem, particularly in the Gort area where there was a natural drainage system, with underlying limestone rock and water seeping through into swallow holes and underground rivers.  There is a belief in that area that some of the minor swallow holes and drains which go into the underground rivers have been blocked off.  Some would argue that this is because of extensive land reclamation in recent years and because of a change in the surface topography which has generated a change in the underlying topography.  From a geographic and topographic point of view, it will be difficult for the Department to identify the difficulties there because there is a natural drainage system which has never been investigated.  It will be difficult to find the source of the problem but I have every confidence the Minister will ensure this is sorted out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="588" /> There is a need for an immediate reaction to the priorities which exist at present.  There are emergencies that need to be dealt with and there is need for an immediate action plan.  There is a need for a long term strategy prioritised in relation to the drainage of rivers, coastal protection, sluice gates along the estuaries of smaller rivers flowing into larger rivers and sluice gates in bays along the coastline that are literally defunct or obsolete and cause flooding on hundreds of acres of land.  These matters must be examined in detail.  The onus is on the Minister to have a national action plan, a priority list drafted and to ensure that a progressive approach is adopted.  I do not believe all our drainage problems can be sorted out with one stroke of the pen.  That is not going to happen.  We have problems because this issue has not been addressed for generations.  If we start to address them now we may make some impact.  I urge the Minister to take action and to recognise in the short term, the real difficulties that exist in particular areas and respond in a positive fashion.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister.  I welcome him to the House and wish him every success in his new portfolio.  I have every confidence that, being from the west, he fully understands the difficulties discussed in this debate.  Coming from a rural constituency he knows what those difficulties are and if anybody can provide the action needed, this Minister can.  I wish him well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add my support for Senator Daly's Bill.  This matter must be tackled immediately and I appeal to the Government to take action because time is not on our side. We have a habit of putting something off until there is an inquiry.  With no reflection on the present Minister, this is one of the problems we face.  We rely on Departments and local authorities to look into such matters.  There are enough reports in various Departments, local government offices and the Office of Public Works to wallpaper all the <Col N="589" /> houses in Dublin, and the number of reports has increased with successive Governments.  It is a stalling process.</P>
      <P>This Bill is a sensible one that would get on with the job in hand and give power to the Office of Public Works and local authorities to deal with these problems.  They may not be major problems, but if they were properly dealt with they would prevent a lot of the major flooding problems.  The hardship that is created, the damage done to homes and the health hazard and cost of repairing their homes is the same, irrespective of whether the flooding is in an urban or rural area.  Sometimes when claiming for compensation you may find that your insurance company may not cover flooding.  They call it an act of God.  We can blame God for many things, but the Government are often at fault as well.</P>
      <P>I would like to refresh Senator Taylor-Quinn's memory when she asked what the last Government did about flooding.  It did more than the rainbow hurricane we now have.  It had to clear up a national debt built up over five years by the irresponsible Government before it.  When our party came to Government in 1987 this country was on the verge of national bankruptcy and despair across the board.  It had to tackle more important matters than drainage streams.  We had to drain the national debt and bring back some of our responsibility and credit-worthiness&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We will have a flooding problem with all our roads if such small amounts of money are handed out to our counties.  The Government came out with many pious platitudes around both this and the other Chamber over the last three to four years.  I do not know where this Government is spending all of its money, but they have savagely cut the funding for county and main roads.  It is a national scandal and I condemn the Government for it.  It will cost more in a few years time to undo this lack of progress.  My party had to pick up the tab in 1987 when virtually nothing was given to local authorities for county roads.  We had to begin from a low base and the same thing is happening again.  It will cost twice as much to repair these roads next time and there will be more flooding problems as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is little co-operation under successive Governments between various State bodies, whether it is the local county council, the Department of Agriculture, the Office of Public Works or any other body.  They are all little independent republics; they will not even phone each other.  You may resurface a street with tarmacadam today, Bord Telecom may tear it up tomorrow and the county council may put down a sewerage scheme through it the day after.  One would not see such lack of co-operation and squandering of public money anywhere else in the world.  We are not a country that can continue with that type of duplication and waste of public funds, whether they came from <Col N="591" /> Europe or from the national taxpayer. It is sad to see it happening.  With a little co-operation and planning, it could be avoided.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Taylor-Quinn when she referred to flooding in parts that have never experienced it before. This is due to bad planning.  Of course, most of the people who made these decisions have gone to higher posts and no one is responsible.  However, the people in the town, village or rural area have to put up with the flooding.  Even our motorways and by-passes are continuously flooded, and I am not referring to the downpours we are getting at the moment.  That would not happen if they were designed properly.  The water is a traffic hazard if it freezes over, but nobody seems to care.  We cannot even build a bridge across a stream, even though we might have 30 councils, without bringing in a consultant &mdash; maybe a retired county engineer &mdash; to design it. We are going backwards.  The taxpayer is being ripped off and it must stop.  We are not getting value for money and I do not care what Government is in power.  For every pound a local authority gets from central funds, whether local or European, there is approximately five pence left to do the work. The rest is spent in red tape and in maintaining the overstaffing of many Departments and that is not good enough.</P>
    <P>We are the laughing stock of Europe. We are throwing money away.  There is lack of supervision and no imagination. The older generation had more commonsense and foresight when they were maintaining roads.  The local county council would work on the county or main road and the Department of Agriculture would try to clear the ditches and drains that were blocking up watercourses, but there would be more flooding on the road.  As I said, these bodies do not speak to each other; they never did.  It would make too much sense to do that.  Then consultants are brought in to find out what is wrong.  Much bad <Col N="592" /> planning was done over the years by those bodies and it should stop.</P>
    <P>I referred to Coillte two weeks ago.  It is a law onto itself and the problems it is creating are unbelievable.  Great damage has been caused to public roads due to flooding and heavy machinery.  While that body may create a few jobs, it is destroying others and is causing unnecessary expense for local authorities. Senator Henry named the various bodies involved.  They do not cooperate with one another; they are all independent republics.  It is time some Minister got them to act in a co-operative manner to solve this problem and not be going around in circles; we have been doing that for a long time.</P>
    <P>I pity those people who have suffered from this flooding.  It is a terrible thing to have one's houses and property damaged. In rural areas, fertiliser has been washed out of the land and this creates a danger to livestock.  This could also create a greater risk of fluke problems. One cannot then bring machinery onto the land.  It is not just confined to winter months.  This is happening in many parts of the country.</P>
    <P>While there is a problem, if we had more commonsense and there was more co-operation between some of the Departments, maybe some of the problems could be avoided.  There is a village in my constituency called Ardfinnan which is flooded twice a year by the River Suir.  That river, like the Shannon, has been drained many times over the last 40 years.  Important work was carried out 40 years ago by local authorities, but many court cases arose from it.  We drained the River Anner outside Clonmel and it nearly broke the local authority; there were High Court cases taking place for three years.  While we may complain about problems, the minute one tries to solve them, many people will say &ldquo;Stop, you cannot do that.&rdquo;  It is sad to see that happening and there should be more commonsense and co-operation.  Gort has also suffered heavily in the last few months and my heart goes out to the people there.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="593" /> There must be more co-operation between the various authorities.  This would save a lot of money, energy and time.  They use JCBs to remove bends on county roads which results in flooding on the road.  I cannot understand why a senior inspector from a Department cannot ask these so-called experts and highly qualified people why something was done a particular way and why it was not supervised properly and then tell them that they have lost their job as a result.  All that happens is that they are moved to another section.  That day is over.</P>
    <P>Young people will not put up with these smug little arrangements in Government Departments and in local government.  They see it as a closed club where nobody can question anybody and where the buck does not stop with anyone in the Departments, local authorities, Coillte Teoranta, the Office of Public Works or elsewhere.  It is a cosy arrangement, but the people and the taxpayers are suffering because they are not getting value for money.  I appeal to the Minister, who has been in public life for a long time, to get the heads of these Departments together and lock them in to a room until they decide to do something together in the national interest.</P>

      <P>Those experiencing difficulties because of the flooding have suffered <Col N="594" /> a lot of stress.  We must empathise with them and do what we can.  From his statements in the House on flooding and on this Bill, I know the Minister is doing everything he can to alleviate the problems and to reach a solution.  I heard the Minister speak at a party meeting in Athlone recently and I was impressed by his sincerity in trying to obtain a solution to these problems, which some said were not fixable.  I know the Minister is concerned and is determined to do everything he can.</P>
      <P>The winter of 1994-95 was one of the wettest in decades.  Rainfall in February was 249 per cent of the average, while in January it was approximately 170 per cent of the average.  The effect of this has caused devastation in many areas, including Clare, Galway and parts of Limerick and west Limerick.  The Mulcair area of Limerick has received a high profile because of the seriousness of the problems there, but there are lesser problems in west Limerick, including county roads which were already referred to.</P>
      <P>I welcome the establishment of the interdepartmental committee to coordinate the response to the bad weather and the effect it has had on people.  It is a response to some of the things which Senator Byrne spoke about.  The Government is concerned about co-ordinating the Departments and services responsible for alleviating the situation.  That is a positive step, because too often Departments work alone like independent republics.  The Minister has taken a decision to ensure co-operation and co-ordination in the activities.  The Government has responded by establishing the interdepartmental committee to deal with the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we share the objectives of this Bill, I welcome the announcement by the Minister that he intends to introduce a Bill which will cater for most of the situations outlined in this one and which will extend to other important areas. We should compliment those who have worked since 8 December.  Some 25.5 milligrams of rainfall were recorded in <Col N="595" /> the Shannon weather station on 7-8 December.  It was from that date that our problems started.  We should compliment the various organisations and services which have assisted people over that period, including the Garda and local authority workers who, despite criticisms made by Senator Byrne, have worked extremely hard in all areas of Limerick day and night; I am sure the same applies in Clare, Galway and other areas.  The Army, the Air Corps and the voluntary Civil Defence must also be complimented.  We saw spectacular pictures on television of the work which the Air Corps did in more seriously flooded areas.</P>
    <P>A feature of this debate has been that everyone ensured that their area was highlighted, so I would like to refer to mine.  The problems of flooding are confined to two areas in west Limerick, Foynes and Shanagolden.  There is a unique problem in Foynes in that there is flooding from the hills and also tidal flooding.  I would like to draw the Minister's attention to that so that money be provided from the special fund to relieve the situation.  Maybe he could impress upon the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, the need to provide funding for a proposed sewerage scheme in the village because that would relieve many of the problems in the Foynes area.</P>
    <P>As regards tidal flooding, work on this could be co-ordinated with the Foynes Harbour Trustees to ensure that any development in the future in the harbour will prevent the tide from reaching the town.  This does not happen regularly and I understand it is 40 years since a similar situation occurred in Foynes.  That highlights the unique situation we face today as a result of the high level of rainfall, flooding and wind. We cannot blame the Government for that because it is an act of God.</P>
    <P>The problems in Shanagolden are not as great and the local council, which has looked at the situation, believes it could take care of them with perhaps £25,000, which is not a considerable amount.  The <Col N="596" /> previous speaker spoke about county roads, which I will raise on the Adjournment tonight.  I want to use this opportunity to draw the Minister's attention to the concerns in County Limerick about the devastating condition of county roads and the inaccessibility of rural areas.  We welcome the initiatives of this Government and the Leader programme which, I hope, will be of benefit. We are looking closely at the initiatives which Minister Carey is taking in developing rural areas and his pilot studies.  However, if one talks to people in County Limerick at present they will say they need access to their houses, school and villages.</P>
    <P>I take exception to Senator Byrne, who said this Government is not providing for county roads.  Last year his party contributed £83 million to county roads; we have allocated £103 million this year. The tax amnesty, which was debated at length, made £20 million available. Some £5 million became available during the European Parliament elections. More money was available last year, but if we had a tax amnesty, we too would give £25 million.  Effectively we have increased the base line from £83 million to £103 million.</P>
    <P>I refer to the Mulcair drainage scheme, an old hoary chestnut, which I spoke about two weeks ago.  Since the debate I have discussed this with various people, including the IFA.  This scheme will cost £40 million and, while it is necessary, it is unrealistic to ask the Government to fund it.  I ask the Minister to introduce a phased system.  The first £1 million, which is the most important, would provide the greatest relief because there is probably a return to scale as one spends money.  If we spent £1 million plus each year, the situation could be improved over a period. The people would see the State authorities responding to a difficulty they have.  They would see relief &mdash; although limited initially &mdash; and that should be the approach.</P>
    <P>All the work has been done on the Mulcair drainage scheme, including environmental studies.  I draw attention <Col N="597" /> to it although it is not in the constituency in which I live, but it is in my county and is of extreme concern to those who live there.  It is as serious for the people in Cappamore as for those in Sixmilebridge and Galway.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Minister's Bill. I compliment Senator Daly.  I have introduced Private Members' Bills and got a certain response over a period of time and I know how Senator Daly feels.  I withdrew Private Members' Bills when a Minister promised to introduce similar Bills.  We did not put the Bill to a vote; I withdrew Bills on the basis of a commitment from a Minister.  That happened during the period of this Seanad and I urge Members to act in the same manner.  They should wait and see what the Government draws up with the help of the draftsman and its support systems.  I know what it is to draw up a Bill without those supports and the consequent limitations.  Senator Daly is in a similar position to that which I was in on several occasions.  When I knew a Bill was to be introduced I withdrew mine.  I look forward to the Minister's Bill.</P>

      <P>The Seanad has done the country a service over the past two weeks because of the attention it has focused on the devastation caused by the recent floods. Senator Daly has done the country a service in bringing forward this important Bill.  It focuses on getting something done about the problem and after all the talk there must be action, some of which will need legislation.  We are all agreed that action is necessary but within that consensus differences have emerged as to what exactly should be done and how it should be done.</P>
      <P>I am not an expert on drainage and I do not come from an area that has been affected by drainage problems. However, over the past two weeks I have studied carefully what many of my colleagues have said and I am beginning to learn something about the difficulties being experienced.  Let me declare a clear preference: the best course of action is for the Government to adopt this Bill and then address whatever flaws they find by way of amendment. That was proposed by Senator Fahey last week and I congratulate him on it.</P>
      <P>Apart from the obvious political one, I do not see any good reason the Government cannot accept it as it stands and then have a pause before Committee Stage so that the input from various Departments can be incorporated into the final result.  Accepting the Bill would be widely welcomed as a non-partisan approach to a serious national problem and it would reflect the constructive nature of the debates in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accepting the Bill now would also send a message about the urgency the Oireachtas attaches to getting something done.  It would offer some encouragement to the many people suffering hardship as a result of the floods.  On the other hand, rejecting this Bill now and asking us to wait for a Government Bill at some later time would run the risk of reducing that urgency.  Instead of action we would be delivering yet another promise in what has been a long <Col N="599" /> history of promises.  It is my preference that the Government should accept this Bill.  However, it is not prepared to do so and I regret that as it would be the best way forward.</P>
    <P>What should the House do in the light of the Government's unwillingness to adopt this Bill?  Should we shelve the Bill and wait for the Government's Bill or should we pass this Bill in defiance of the Government knowing that the victory would be pretty empty in terms of getting something done about the problem?  The key issues here are action and urgency.  The country wants action and wants it now.  I suggest that in deciding how to vote on this Bill we should ask what decisions will result in action, what action and if the action will be soon enough.</P>
    <P>It comes down to speed.  I went to the Minister today and put it to him how important I felt this matter was.  He has told me the heads of the Bill went to Cabinet yesterday, and were approved, and to the Parliamentary Draftsman today.  He has given me a commitment and asked me to pass it on to the House that the Bill will be published before 30 April &mdash; I asked for a specific date not a vague indication.  He also gave me a commitment that it will be introduced here before 31 May.  I would prefer to have it here next week but I will accept that the Minister's timeframe is realistic enough.  It is an appropriate enough response to the pressure from the debates in this House.</P>
    <P>I suggest we give the Minister and the Government the benefit of the doubt and then we should watch like hawks to make sure they deliver.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I have indicated clearly to the Government side and to the Fianna Fáil Members that I will support this Bill for a number of reasons.  I have seen and felt the alienation of people in rural Ireland which is understood by many in this House.  I saw the look of optimism on people's faces when the Minister visited them last week; his visit was appreciated.  Putting through this <Col N="600" /> Bill will not of itself bring action.  I ask the Government to accept this Bill in its totality, to defer Committee Stage and to introduce whatever changes they require and intend making in the proposal outlined to Senator Quinn.</P>
      <P>I have discussed this matter with my first cousin who is cathaoirleach of Galway County Council.  He has conveyed to me the sense of alienation people feel there; they feel cut off.  We need to show a sense of solidarity with them.  In fairness, the Minister has done that with his visit.  My vote in support of them is telling them that we have seen the brain drain out of the west moving east and, in many cases, have seen communities being denuded.  I want my vote to be seen as a gesture of solidarity with them. That is not to take from those on the Government side who would have the same commitment to that area.</P>
      <P>I am glad this Bill was initiated in the Seanad.  From what I know of the Gort area I do not see the solution to the problem.  If the problem is underground drainage, I do not see how that can be cleared; if the problem is opening up a drainage passage from Coole to the sea, for example, there are huge decisions to be taken.  I do not pretend to know the answer to emptying out the excess water in that area.  It is important for the Seanad to show solidarity with the people there: telling them that we are with them; if they need to be compensated, that will be given within reason; if work is needed we will do that within reason.  There are two ways of doing that, either by a vote in a gesture of solidarity or, better, by the Government saying that it will accept this Bill and take it over on Committee Stage.  The procedure is there to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment Senator Daly.  As with everyone on both sides of the House, my sympathy is with the people who have been flooded.  It is heart wrenching to watch what they have put up with and I will vote with them today in the same way as I voted when the Government proposed to establish a Ministry to deal with rural and western development.  Those people need that <Col N="601" /> sense of solidarity, they need our support and my gesture and vote today is with them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Ar an gcéad dul síos, the hardship caused by the flooding must be addressed by the involvement of the State in two ways.  Immediate financial aid must be given to those who have been flooded out of their own homes and holdings over the past couple of months.  It was pathetic to see instances where people could only see their homes across a sea of water.  The television pictures brought it home to us that action is needed in this regard.</P>
      <P>There are many points of view as to the cause of flooding.  The heavy rainfalls were mentioned, the harvesting of trees and other causes are being debated.  The action that has been taken by the interdepartmental committee in bringing together the various arms of the State and bodies and the appointment of consultants to bring in a report is definitely the way to go forward in this regard.  The commitment to bring in amending legislation in the near future that would embody the reports that come in is a very definite line of action which should be some encouragement to the people in the areas, and that action should be supported by this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand why this Bill is being opposed today.  So many people have congratulated Senator Daly today that I cannot believe that there is opposition to this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This issue has been debated here for the last two months, both in Fianna Fáil time and in Government time.  The issue itself is one of a disaster for the west. That is recognised by the Leader giving Government time for this debate.  Someone said earlier that because this is an Opposition Bill it is a bad Bill.  I do not agree with that.  Whatever action or lack of action there may have been in the past, the fact is that Senator Daly reacted in a positive way and should be supported.  I was made aware of this disaster <Col N="602" /> by Senator Daly, Senator Fahey and Senator Finneran.  As the Leader knows, we tried to make sure that this was the top priority on the Order of Business every day and here we are after two months.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn has looked for action. We cannot stand up here today and say that we have not seen action.  I will not list every Minister who has been to Galway to see the situation.  They have to speak for themselves.  All I know is that Senator Daly and the Fianna Fáil Party responded to the crisis that they saw at the time by bringing forward a Bill that will in the main be part and parcel of the Government Bill.  I wonder what the response of Government would be if this was an east coast problem, if this was a Dublin problem?  If there was flooding in Malahide or Howth, what would the issue be?  There would not be two months' debate or worries about a Bill to be brought in on 30 April.  We may not see the Government's Bill before the summer.  The last time we had a problem in Dublin we had an immediate response from the then coalition Government under Garrett FitzGerald, and rightly so.  Compensation was duly paid.  Why are we being delayed in this instance?  Why is there so far no real commitment to payment? One must find the difference between the east coast solution and western one. I wish to knock one thing on the head. The Bill is not an open cheque book, it is strictly tied to the Department of Finance in any compensation payments.</P>
    <P>I wish to mention Seanad reform.  I mentioned last week on the Order of Business that Senator Manning is absolutely committed to Seanad reform.  If we are talking about the Seanad playing a meaningful role in political life, surely there is an ideal opportunity to do so today by allowing this Bill to be passed here today and put on the Dáil Order Paper to show that we really care about the issues on the ground.  Everyone here today agrees that something has to be done.  My colleague has brought something forward and Senators have an <Col N="603" /> opportunity of showing today that the Seanad has a meaningful role to play.</P>
    <P>I wish to mention to our independent colleagues that many of their voters in universities are from the west.  Senator O'Toole rightly said that today is a day for all of us to stand four-square with those in the west.  Many of those voters may have left the west now, but still have strong family ties and very much feel that there is a need for political action to solve this problem.  Senators have an opportunity to show their support in a meaningful way by supporting this Bill.  The independent Senators have the opportunity today to nail on the head once and for all the suggestions in recent articles that there is a lack of independence in their vote.</P>
    <P>I ask them to support the Bill as all of them have by their contributions today made it quite clear that they support all of what Senator Daly is trying to achieve.  The best way to achieve that, if we really mean that the Seanad has a role to play, is for this Bill to be passed and put on the Dáil Order Paper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Norris, you have four minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you very much, Sir. I doubt that I will need the four minutes, but I am very grateful to have the opportunity to say a few words on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, with regard to what my distinguished colleague, Senator Wright, said in reference to Senator O'Toole's contribution, I do not think it is necessary for us to analyse the constituency and see whether or not we have a preponderance of votes from the west.  If we do not have a preponderance we certainly have some votes there, but we do not need to have that kind of connection. We are a small island and everybody on this island has been moved by the plight of people stricken by the recent flooding.  Gort has been principally mentioned, but there has been flooding all around Carlow which has not had quite so much mention.  Very <Col N="604" /> serious difficulties have been created for people.</P>
    <P>Two points arose from the general discussion.  I was struck, for example, by references made to swallow holes.  It is very easy to make a mockery out of these features of the landscape; but the reason it struck me as significant was that, among the arguments I listened to from environmentalists and farmers, I heard that the impact of modern farming technology, silage and so on, led to the use of a lot of black plastic and that many of these natural drains had been blocked by plastic, so it gives us a very salutary reminder of the impact of industrial and domestic pollution even on natural features of the landscape. The second idea may be a little fanciful and far fetched but I put it forward simply because among other things today I heard somebody from Dublin who had no connections with the west saying that he had been to Gort and was so impressed by the hospitality and decency of the people and their difficult circumstances that he had taken out &mdash; this is a man on disability pension &mdash; an advertisement in the newspapers costing him £91 asking people to spend a weekend there and now I gather that the bed and breakfasts are almost full up.  That is a very practical, decent show of solidarity indicating how important tourism is.</P>
    <P>One of the suggestions in the Gort area was the development of a large arterial drainage canal.  This may be naive, but I wonder if that could not also become some kind of tourist feature.  I do not know how large these things are, whether there could be an ornamental or a boating aspect to it.  Perhaps that is naive or fanciful, but it could be looked into.  With regard to the Bill, I will display my independence in the way in which I vote.  In particular I want to show my independence from Senator O'Toole.  We have all over a long period demonstrated that we are genuinely independent.  When Fianna Fáil was in Government, sometimes I voted against it, sometimes I voted with it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="605" /> I commend Senator Daly for his foresight and initiative and the Fianna Fáil Party in bringing this matter to a head by introducing legislation.  It is exactly what this House is all about and I congratulate them on it.  But I would also have to say I have spoken to Senator Manning and Senator Cosgrave and am happy that the three requirements in which I was interested &mdash; that the most valuable suggestions made by Fianna Fáil in the Bill would be accepted and introduced by the Government in its legislation, that this legislation would be introduced in the Seanad and that there would be a realistic time scale within which this legislation would be introduced &mdash; have been satisfied as far I am concerned and I will, therefore, have no difficulty in voting with the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I will begin where the last few speakers finished.  Senator Quinn got to the nub of the matter when he said that the Seanad and Senator Daly have done a national service by allowing us have this detailed debate over this period.  This debate has put pressure on the Government to respond.  This pressure is very much welcomed by the Minister, Deputy Jim Higgins, who is only a short time in this post but already has shown a grasp of what has to be done and a commitment to do it.  All the pressure on him from the commitments he has freely and willingly given in this House will be used to speed up even further the process of the legislation he has promised.</P>
      <P>I have no worries about Private Members' Bills and hope that during the remainder of this session we will see such Bills.  The sky does not fall down if a Private Member's Bill is accepted and passed by the House.  It is part of our function to be legislators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I oppose this Bill because I have been advised &mdash; like Senator Quinn I am a novice to questions of arterial drainage and have tried to study the factors relating to it &mdash; that a more comprehensive Bill is needed.  In the spirit indicated by Senator Fahey last week and advocated <Col N="606" /> by Senator Lee and Senator Roche, specific sections, in particular section 4 but also other aspects, of Senator Daly's Bill will be incorporated in the new legislation.</P>
    <P>We are all used to promises and waiting; but people, especially in the west and in my own county of Carlow, cannot wait any longer.  The Minister has been very specific.  He has given Senator Quinn a time commitment.  Nobody gives a commitment unless they intend to honour it.  That commitment will be honoured and legislation will be introduced in the House which will take the best out of Senator Daly's Bill and address the other problems which need to be tackled.  It will be in the House in the time indicated by Senator Quinn.  It will begin its life and will be given priority in this House.  I hope that Bill will be on the Statute Book in time for work to commerce on clearing up the problems which the Bill is designed to deal with.</P>
    <P>An additional sum of £4 million is being made available for county roads and £2 million for agricultural compensation. The interdepartmental committee is meeting at the moment on the problems.  The Government is committed to tackling the major black spots this year as soon as the legislation is enacted.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to introducing a Supplementary Estimate for the Office of Public Works this year. This will cover the cost of the study in the south Galway area, the fees for a number of commissions which the Office of Public Works will shortly place for the design of a number of flood defence schemes to protect areas where sufficient data are available to allow designs to be prepared, the cost of installing data collection equipment in other areas known to be subject to periodical flooding so that a programme of work, for which several Senators called, can be prepared and will also cover the cost of any schemes which it may be possible to commence this year.</P>
    <P>This House has highlighted the problems, which have been well and fully <Col N="607" /> discussed.  We have had proposals from the Opposition and a Bill, which has many worthwhile aspects, presented by Senator Daly.  We have the proposals of the Minister which will include many of the aspects of Senator Daly's Bill but will be more comprehensive.  We have a time commitment and a pledge to put into the new Bill what the House thinks is worthwhile in Senator Daly's Bill. This is a joint effort here today.  Senator Quinn got to the nub of the problem. Commitments have been given.  I know that everybody on the other side of the House will watch like hawks to see that these commitments are honoured.  I would do the same if I were on that side and will do so from this side.  All parties and Members of this House want to see action quickly.</P>
    <P>The House has seen that the Minister, Deputy Jim Higgins, has the will, determination, commitment and ability to have this legislation here in the timescale outlined, to get it enacted and start the work, about which Senator Quinn talked, to ensure that as far as possible &mdash; acts of God are outside the control of all of us &mdash; the sort of situation which is the culmination of years and years of neglect can be tackled.  This party has been in Government for only the last eight or nine weeks, so this is an issue with which no one can afford to start playing politics and is one which we as a House and a country must tackle. When the Minister's proposals are in the House before the end of May, we will see that the work which was done here today and has been going on for the past few weeks will be successfully completed.</P>

My intention in introducing the Bill was to respond to the crisis which has been caused by the unprecedented flooding which has taken place in localised areas since the <Col N="608" /> end of 1994, to put in place a formula which would enable action to be taken to alleviate it and to pay some compensation in deserving cases where flooding has occurred and is occurring at present.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed with the Minister's response.  He more than anyone else is fully aware of what is required to resolve these problems.  I had expected that he would be far more positive in his contribution.  I can fully understand his reluctance to accept the Bill and to spell out how he proposes to deal with the shortcomings identified in it.  I cannot understand why he is not convinced of the necessity to put in place a mechanism to enable claims for compensation to be examined and either paid or rejected.  The suggestion that he does not need such powers is, in my view, a basic error of judgment on his part and one I think he will later regret.</P>
      <P>My proposal would focus all claims in one direction and would probably at the end of the day be more efficient, cost effective and satisfactory for all the parties involved.  The present arrangement, whereby various Government Departments and agencies will be involved, will result in disparities from area to area in the response and delays in dealing with the problems because of the involvement of several Departments and agencies. This is a chaotic arrangement from an administrative point of view, no precise cost or estimate will be available, the need for urgency and action to deal with the problems will be further frustrated and delayed and the grievances people have will be continued and exacerbated.</P>
      <P>I strongly recommend to the Minister that he should review his decision with regard to the payment of compensation and come forward with a proposal, even at a later stage, if he is not happy with the measure I have proposed.  With regard to his criticism of the Bill, which was nit picking, we are prepared to look at any amendments which he may propose and which would strengthen the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned two aspects of the Bill which he was concerned <Col N="609" /> would make the situation more difficult to resolve.  One of these is already provided for in that in looking at localised flood problems I have inserted a provision that the total catchment would be taken into account lest damage might be caused elsewhere because of the remedial work undertaken.  That was one of the Minister's concerns and we have catered for that in the Bill.</P>
    <P>A small amendment to section 8 would rectify what the Minister sees as a shortcoming in the legislation.  I am sure the Minister has decided to reject this Bill but he has already given some consideration to how these problems can be solved.  I suggest that the approach I have adopted is one way, but perhaps there are others.  He said there is a major deficiency in the Bill but that is not an issue because it could be rectified with one small amendment.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a long speech but it was short on specifics.  It is appalling that he has spent weeks talking about a trip to Brussels to seek financial backing. He should have made this trip weeks ago and shown his concern not only to the people affected but also to those in Brussels as well.  The Commission will not be awaiting his visit.  It has already had numerous discussions and involvement with other member states with difficulties.</P>
    <P>It shows an extreme lack of urgency that, at this late stage after all the discussion, debate and dialogue and the introduction of this Bill, the Minister has not made that important trip to Brussels.  I know he has to get a certain amount of information together. However, if he is trying to convince people in Brussels that there is an urgency about this problem and that money is required to come to grips with it, he will need to show more urgency in his dealings with Brussels than he has shown up to now.</P>
    <P>I am sure that they are aware of the situation.  From my experience with them, the Commission officials will want precise information from the Minister on the nature of the problem here, the <Col N="610" /> extent of financial hardship and the amount required to remedy it.  His arguments in Brussels will not be convincing if he is prepared to tell the people there what he told us, that is, that the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, the local authorities, the State agencies and communications departments and the Irish Red Cross are all responding in their own way.</P>
    <P>We welcome the response these bodies have made.  I take the opportunity, as many others did, to put on record the appreciation of the community for the work done by State agencies in so far as they can deal with the situation.  I especially mention local authorities which have endeavoured to deal with these problems in the best possible way and with the most immediate response available to them.  Both legislative and financial shortcomings have limited their response.  I put on record our appreciation for the efforts they have made.  All local authorities would agree that it is beyond the bounds of their financial abilities to tackle these problems. They need financial support from the Government, backing from the European Union and a co-ordinated approach.</P>
    <P>By not adopting the proposal in this Bill for set legislative arrangements to deal with problems, the Minister will be left with a haphazard and directionless arrangement.  He will not be able to determine the full extent of the problem without having a huge bureaucracy deal with it.  The impact in Brussels of endeavouring to highlight the emergency here and the necessity for urgent remedial funding to deal with it will be weakened.</P>
    <P>When the Minister has the opportunity to meet officials of the Commission, they will specify the need for the establishment of a more focused administrative arrangement before they sanction any money.  I strongly urge the Minister to adopt the proposal in this Bill.  It would not only strengthen his hand with the Government and the Minister for Finance but it would also strongly strengthen his position in Brussels <Col N="611" /> when seeking funds from the Commission and the European Parliament. It would be a more streamlined, efficient and cost effective way of dealing with the matter and would be far more beneficial in endeavouring to establish the case.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to some of the comments made here; I took notes on every speech.  Each person mentioned an aspect of the problem which was relevant to their own area and was important to them.  Some points overlapped because the nature of the problem is the same in many areas and constituencies. This underlines the seriousness of the problem facing us, the urgency of dealing with it in a comprehensive manner and the necessity to make the firm commitment that, apart from the legislative changes that will be put in place, the necessary financial measures will also be taken.  There has been no evidence of that up to now.</P>
    <P>Senator Fahey outlined in graphic detail the misery and hardship his neighbours have suffered during this flooding, especially in the south Galway and Gort area.  He, more than anyone else in the House, has seen the results of the floods on his own doorstep and no words of mine could express the deep feelings of frustration he expressed last week.  The situation in Gort and south Galway is unacceptable and must be remedied now.  The only way we can demonstrate our support for the community there is by passing this Bill, completing urgent remedial work to resolve the problem and paying reasonable compensation to those left without insurance or any prospect of assistance from any quarter.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on the advertisement in today's paper relating to the study in Galway.  However, I believe it will be a long time before we will see any results.  Where environmental matters and issues of that nature are to be taken into account, it will be a long time before we will get a consultancy report on how to deal with the Gort problem. I reiterate what Senator Fahey said and <Col N="612" /> what has been repeated by spokespersons on behalf of the community in Gort that this is now a disaster area and should be treated as such.  Pending the outcome of consultancy studies, reports and examinations of the nature of the problem and how it should be dealt with, as a matter of extreme urgency, some remedial action should be taken so that people will have some prospect of salvaging their homes and property.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke raised the question of slurry disposal and problems of pollution which are typical in many areas. He referred to Sixmilebridge where flooding in the local river backed into the sewerage system.  People found raw sewage in their private dwellings and were forced to leave their homes.  He outlined this in graphic detail and there is no necessity to repeat it.  The problems of pollution and overflows from flooded streams running into septic tanks and sewerage systems is not only creating a hazard by damaging property, houses and public systems but is also creating a serious public health hazard in many areas.  This could be of immense dimensions unless it is dealt with quickly.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran highlighted the problems in the Roscommon and Shannon basin.  He outlined how 37 acres of a 40 acre farm were completely covered in water and the highest flooding levels ever were recorded in Shannonbridge. He was rightly critical, as many Senators were, of the lack of maintenance over a long period which has brought about a very serious situation in many areas.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan made a number of suggestions as to how flooding problems in every local authority area could be tackled.  He stated that millions of pounds were being paid out every week in unemployment benefit.  The unemployment problems in some areas could be resolved by providing work in social employment schemes and co-ordinated schemes organised by co-operatives, local authorities and local farming communities. This could probably be done at less cost to the Exchequer than Government schemes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="613" /> Senator Kelly said that the floods this winter were never seen before and most people would agree with that statement. She supported the payment of compensation to those affected, but it must be given to those who deserve it and not to spurious claims.  This theme ran through many of the contributions.  Special hardship cases involving people who have been devastated by the flooding and who have no insurance cover must be dealt with immediately.  That is the basic flaw in what the Minister is asking us to accept.  I have no hesitation in withdrawing my amendment to the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, provided the Minister gives us a commitment to deal with compensation by way of legislation. However, he is not prepared to do that. On the first occasion we debated this issue, he said he was not prepared to put a legislative measure in place for the payment of compensation.</P>

      <P>That is my main difference with the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members on the Government side said that we should withdraw this measure because the Minister will introduce his own Bill, which will be well thought out and more comprehensive, and that consultations will take place with various Departments.  I know the process well; I have been through it many times and I also know that one does not always get the desired result from legislation.  The Minister indicated that he saw no necessity for compensation <Col N="614" /> legislation.  That is the basic flaw in his proposals.  This afternoon people said they were not familiar with the complications in this area.  One or two speakers said they were not experts in arterial drainage and that they knew little about how the law worked.  The Minister is not dealing with compensation, which we have done in this Bill.</P>

      <P>We are proposing that compensation will be paid and that there will be an independent committee under the Minister's guidance, with two commissioners from the Commissioners of Public Works who are experts in decision making and in the administration of this area, where claims, spurious or otherwise, will be made, but which will only be paid in genuine cases of hardship and where people can demonstrate that they are not in a position to provide for themselves.  A provision in this legislation allows a person who is dissatisfied with the way their payment is being dealt with to appeal to the Minister for Finance.  I am satisfied that while the Government may vote against this Bill on the basis of the Minister's proposal, he will not introduce a legislative arrangement for the payment of compensation and he will not introduce an appeal mechanism.  His suggestions are short changing this House.  While we may be foolish at times, we are not naive enough to think we are not being taken for a ride.  The Government will not get away with this approach.</P>

      <P>Senator Howard mentioned Sixmilebridge and Ennis, which demonstrate the ineffectiveness of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  Flooding has been a problem here for many years.  The Fergus catchment was on the famous priority list, which was a never ending list of flooded catchments.  The River Fergus never moved from its position on the priority list, apart from minor remedial works which were undertaken by Clare County Council. Business, private houses and shops in the town were also flooded because the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, could not be used to deal with the local problem in Ennis and could only deal with the whole Fergus catchment.  The Ennis problem will never be dealt with under present legislation.</P>
      <P>Senator Farrell gave details of the projects in his area.  Most of the contributions dealt with problems in local areas and there was general agreement that something should be done.  Senator Henry spoke about coastal erosion and provisions are included in this Bill which will not be in the Minister's legislation. Is the Minister giving us an assurance that coastal erosion will be dealt with in the Bill which he proposes to introduce here on 30 April?</P>

      <P>Senator Byrne spoke about the need for co-operation between the various agencies and I repeat his sentiments. Many Senators availed of the opportunity to compliment the Army, the Air Corps, Civil Defence, local volunteers and local authorities for the work they do.  However, they are working with their hands tied behind their backs because they are short of money and this has been borne out in several cases in the past few weeks.</P>
      <P>Last night at a meeting in Gort a discussion took place about an offer from the Bishop of Galway to use the weekly collections to try to remedy the problems in that town.  There is little indication of a meaningful or worthwhile commitment by the Government to deal with the serious situation there.</P>
      <P>I commend this Bill to the House and I urge everyone to think carefully before voting about the misery and hardship which thousands of people have suffered in the past few months because of the serious situation they face.  On Monday night I spoke to the Shannons from Carran, which is one of the most attractive parts of Ireland in the heart of the Burren, who have not lived in their homes since Christmas.  They have suffered hardship and misery because of these conditions.  Their neighbours allowed them to stay in their bed and breakfast accommodation which is used in the summer.  I can see no prospect of support to redress their plight; they have no insurance and no one to compensate them.  Like many others, they are looking to this Government to deal with these matters and we ask the Government to do so by adopting this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader of the House for his usual courtesy and cooperation in allowing me to resume this debate although it was the turn of the Government side.  Like Senator Manning, since I became a Member of this House I have attempted to put forward proposals and opinions for the improvement of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly pleased that Senator Manning holds a pivotal role in the House because he has expressed, both inside the House and outside in the course of his academic career, specific proposals on how the House should conduct its business and how it should progress in the future both in the constitutional context and in the legislative context.  I would ascribe much of the <Col N="619" /> inspiration for the debate on reform of the Seanad to Senator Manning.  His integrity as an academic and as a politician of stature has carried considerable weight outside the House.  I do not make these remarks in a patronising sense but primarily to convey the view that we in this House sometimes underestimate and undersell ourselves and, as a result, the wider public perception of what we do is downplayed.  It is only by constantly reminding the public through newspaper articles and media appearances that we can convey the importance of our role as an equal member of the constitutional trinity, as it were.</P>
    <P>I will not offer radical proposals other than to add my voice to the well researched debate that has taken place thus far.  Obviously, the electoral system is an old chestnut at this stage.  Irrespective of how much I look at the system, I find it hard to arrive at an alternative that would be accepted by us as Members, by the public and by the Government of the day.  The Government of the day, as I have discovered since 1987, is reluctant to tamper with the Seanad.  It is sometimes forgotten that any changes in the role, structure or operation of the Seanad would require constitutional amendments.  I am not referring to how the Seanad orders its business.  However, its role in the constitutional sense would require constitutional amendments and no Government really has the stomach for that.</P>
    <P>Some years ago, when a new Senator proposed at a meeting that all Senators should have word processors, a former leader of our party, who shall remain nameless, rounded on him and said that if a poll was taken in the morning the public would vote to abolish the Seanad. The retort was that if a further poll was taken the following morning the Dáil would also be abolished.</P>
    <P>People feel dissatisfied, marginalised or cynical about the political structures which govern them and most people would say that a dictatorship would be best for this country.  People in developed democracies have a strange <Col N="620" /> view that democracy is the worst system. Those opinions are usually expressed by people who have no experience of totalitarian regimes or have not even read history books about fascism, totalitarianism and dictatorship. Our democracy, flawed as it is, is the best system we have.  I would stoutly defend its right to exist and we should build on it.</P>
    <P>I have very little to offer in the context of electoral reform of this House. Regionalising the voting structure would be an easy road to take.  As matters stand, there is an electoral college of 970 members which elects 43 Members of the Seanad through the five vocational panels; six are elected through the university panels and the remaining 11 are nominated by the Taoiseach of the day.  Any debate on changing the system of election tends to focus on the 43 Members elected by the five panels.  When these panels were set up they were intended to reflect in a general sense the main vocational activities in this country &mdash; industry and commerce, culture and education, labour and trade unions, administration and agriculture.  Those priorities have not changed much since 1937.</P>
    <P>I would like to see more direct input from the vocational bodies.  I am a nominee of the Library Association of Ireland.  There is a common error in the public mind that Senators are appointed and not really elected.  These are perceived as purely political appointments where the parties in power decide who is going to be in the Seanad.  I wish that were the case as it would make life much easier for us all.</P>
    <P>I have represented the Library Association since 1987 but somehow, despite my best efforts, it feels marginalised to a degree from the political system, which is not right.  It is, effectively, a lobby group and Governments' response to lobby groups depends on their importance in society.  For example, farmers and the trade union movement are seen as the most powerful lobby and, in recent years, IBEC has increased its muscle.  They are seen as <Col N="621" /> strong lobby groups to which Governments seem to respond within minutes of an issue arising.  However, there is a range of other activities and interests, from the libraries through to the voluntary sector, which do not always get the same response from the Government, partly because they are not perceived as representing major activities.  However, they are important and essential to the overall life of the country.</P>
    <P>Perhaps there could be some way of addressing this issue of a balance between the vocational and political sectors.  I know that de Valera's Constitution, in its theoretical sense, thought that it had addressed this issue, but the reality is that politics took over very quickly.  Any vocational body which has wished to have one of its representatives elected to the Seanad has found &mdash; cruelly, in some cases &mdash; that unless its appointee is a political activist he or she has little real chance of being elected to this House.  It is a courageous action to go before an electorate, irrespective of its size.  Irrespective of party or ideology, one must admire anybody who stands up to be counted in the cruellest test of all.</P>
    <P>I remember an incident where a vocational body nominated one of its own members &mdash; I will not name the body or the individual to save him the embarrassment.  It was either my first or second election and the gentleman concerned embarked on a very sophisticated marketing and advertising campaign to local councillors.  Enormous sums of money were spent on this mail shot.  I am not sure if he went around the country shaking hands and meeting councillors.  If he did, I was not aware of it, although he was on a different panel to me and, as Senators will know, they are five separate elections.  At the end of the day an enormous amount of money, time and energy were expended and he got one vote, which was probably from his mother-in-law or a personal friend. He is a very able individual in his chosen profession, which is why his professional body nominated him.  They must have been cruelly disappointed <Col N="622" /> that not only was their man not elected but he got only one vote in what was supposed to be a vocational election.  I do not wish to labour the point but there is a need to balance the needs of the vocational sector and the political realities.  How the two can be married is a question which we may need to debate separately.</P>
    <P>I am on record as being in support of votes for emigrants.  I am unequivocally and unambiguously in support of the right of emigrants, with certain conditions attached, to have a vote in our elections.  Having said that, I fully understand &mdash; perhaps better than most &mdash; the fear particularly of TDs, of enfranchising thousands of the Irish diaspora.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste made a very telling comment that he would hate to be waiting for the results from the box in the Bronx to decide the outcome of the election in north Kerry, He was not joking as, after all, he was elected with only four votes to spare in a recent election. My colleague, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, told me at the height of a debate on this issue some time ago that when she was in Boston during her ministerial stewardship she was told that there were more people in Boston from the Galway West constituency than were living in the constituency.  Most of them were emigrants who would be eligible under a ten or 15 year rule if the legislation was introduced.</P>
    <P>For every approach which has been made to me because of my continuing contacts with emigrant welfare groups in the UK asking about the vote, I have received other representations from long term emigrants saying that they do not wish to have enfranchisement.  In other words, they do not want power without taxation as they live in their adopted country and do not want to be involved here.</P>
    <P>I am raising this mainly because it is relevant to this Seanad and, under the proposals put forward by the Government, it will become even more relevant. I understand why the Government responded in the way in which it <Col N="623" /> did.  On one hand, it did not wish to ignore what it saw as a very significant, relevant and powerful lobby, as every family in this country has somebody who has emigrated.  On the other hand, it has taken a soft option in channelling it into this House.</P>
    <P>The last thing people lobbying for representation ever thought was that they would be represented in the Seanad.  They want direct voting rights in this country.  In the order of their priorities, Dáil elections come last on the list because they recognise the PR system and its vagaries.  Their first priority is to have the right to vote in presidential elections and I see no problem with that.  They also seek the right to vote on constitutional amendments, which might open a different debate.</P>
    <P>I am not sure three Senators, purportedly representing emigrants' interests in the House, will go even a short distance towards satisfying the lobby which is primarily made up of young emigrants, those who left this country in the last ten or 15 years.  The older the age profile among emigrants, the less likely they are to look for voting rights.  In narrowing it even further, the main thrust of the lobby comes from our near neighbour and the Irish in Britain, who are closer to what is happening here because of better and less expensive access in recent years.  They now see their sojourn in England as of a temporary nature and even if they decide to live there for a considerable length of time, they can fly back to Ireland.</P>
    <P>We all know of people who regularly fly home or take the ferry.  They are in constant touch through Irish newspapers, local and national, and as a result of RTE's initiative, people across Europe can now receive that station as clear as a bell if they have a satellite channel; they can hear the news on the radio and there are plans to broadcast RTE television programmes through the European satellite network.</P>
    <P>A mix of Irish television programmes will be available to the Irish diaspora in Europe; this is happening already in the <Col N="624" /> United States.  The world has become a global village perhaps much faster than even McLuhan recognised.  There is a clear split in the Irish diaspora between the younger element, who are looking for enfranchisement, and longer stay emigrants, who do not care one way or the other.  I am not sure that the Government's proposal is a good idea and it may take time to reflect before the move is implemented.</P>
    <P>Apart from votes for emigrants, there are other more mundane matters.  The right of audience has come up in this House on several occasions.  Some years ago, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in its wisdom introduced limited right of audience for distinguished visitors but I would like it to go further. I do not understand why this House should not be in a position to invite distinguished visitors to the country, not just to sit in the Distinguished Visitors' Gallery but to address the House.  There is no reason this cannot be done; it has happened previously in the Dáil.  As Members know, the Protocol is that a Head of State addresses a joint sitting of both Houses, while a Prime Minister, who is not a Head of State, addresses only the Dáil.</P>
    <P>In a sense, this marginalises the Seanad.  It happened during my time in the House, where distinguished visitors have addressed only the Dáil because of their status in their own country.  Why cannot the Seanad invite people to address the Seanad?  It may be that, in the normal event, the invitee would be asked to address the Dáil.  It does not necessarily follow that it would have to be the Prime Minister.  It could be a Foreign Minister or anybody who would enhance the workings of the House by their presence, and their speech would inform, educate and hopefully entertain us.  There are many areas that could be examined in this regard.</P>
    <P>In the context of Europe, there is no reason an initiative could not be introduced which would allow Members of the European Parliament a right of audience and a right of contribution in the House.  Why not have a European <Col N="625" /> question time?  There is no facility at present, nor has there been since the first directly elected Parliament in 1979, to allow right of access to MEPs beyond the barrier in Dáil Éireann and the Distinguished Visitors' Gallery in the Seanad, even if they were former Members of the House.</P>
    <P>This is an area the Committee on Procedure and Privileges should examine. It is a decision that the Government would have to ultimately make because it would involve a change which might not be within the remit of the House. However, of all the points I have raised, the question of MEPs being given a right of audience could be addressed in a practical manner.  It would enhance the House because so little about events in Europe is filtering through to the average person.  I am not sure if Senators remember the most famous survey of all carried out during the Dublin South-Central constituency by-election, in which the current Taoiseach, Deputy Bruton, was identified by a percentage of the population as a Member of the European Parliament.  Other well known politicians were similarly identified but I use that as an extraordinary example of people's indifference to what is going on in Europe.</P>
    <P>They consider it as that far country, which Chamberlain once talked about in the context of Czechoslovakia.  It is still endemic in this country that foreign affairs are foreign and do not matter. However, what happens in Europe matters greatly, and what will happen in Europe matters even more.  One way of addressing this problem is to ensure that MEPs come into the House and give an account of their stewardship in their areas of expertise, and there could be a short question and answer session.  This could be done not every week but perhaps once a month.  This might be within the remit of Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    <P>On a completely different level, there is the question of facilities provided for Senators.  I understand that a number of my colleagues, Senator Cassidy in particular, have already requested that <Col N="626" /> Senators be provided with similar secretarial facilities to TDs.  As the matter stands in most cases, a Senator is entitled to a one-third share of a secretary. This is inadequate.  Senators have an enormous amount of constituency work, and I mean constituency in the broadest sense.  Our electorate is national and we must respond to it.  I am a career Senator and I value this House. I am honoured to be a Senator and I have no aspirations to be elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The current position is no longer acceptable if a Member is to achieve what I believe a Senator should in responding to his or her constituents, such as county and municipal councillors, TDs and the myriad of lobby groups now writing to us because of the increasing amount of legislation initiated in the House and the increasing number of debates on current topics.  It is unacceptable that a Senator should have only a one-third share of a secretary. We should have the full facilities which are available to TDs.  This matter may not necessarily come under the reform of the House but it should be put on record; I know Senator Manning would not be against the idea if it were within his gift.</P>
    <P>To summarise, I do not agree with the proposal regarding Seanad representation for emigrants.  I agree in principle but it is not the way to proceed.  The status of MEPs arises in the context of right of audience for distinguished visitors. There is an obligation on them and on us as legislators to continually update ourselves on what is happening at European Parliament level.  Facilities for Senators should be on a par with those of Members of the other House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss Seanad reform.  I place on record my appreciation to the Leader of the House, Senator Manning, and the former Leader, Senator Wright, for facilitating this type of discussion. We have been most fortunate in that Leaders of the Seanad in the recent past have been more than open to change <Col N="627" /> and reform and to making the whole system more effective.</P>
      <P>When the founding fathers of America described their own parliamentary system, particularly the Senate and Congress, they used the imagery of the cup to describe the Congress or House of Representatives &mdash; which is elected by the people &mdash; and described the Senate as the saucer that could take a reflective look at legislation and deal with it outside the heat of the moment.  I think it has worked extremely well in the United States.</P>
      <P>People on all sides of this House are increasingly becoming more open to honestly and objectively look at various issues.  We are all prisoners of our own parties in a way, willing prisoners but prisoners nonetheless.  We listen to a contribution on one side of the House and somebody is saying things with which we agree and would love to support and vote for, but because of the nature of the parliamentary system we cannot.  This is the downside of that system. All the good arguments could not conceivably come from one side of the House.  We had another indication of this in an earlier debate today when Senator Daly introduced a worthy Bill. In a better ordered House Senator Daly and the Minister, Deputy Jim Higgins would have gone through this legislation together, agreed it would become the Daly/Higgins Bill and brought it into the House and had it passed.  In a sensible society that is how it would have been done.</P>
      <P>This Government will have to accept that some Opposition legislation should be passed into law.  That will be a fact of life.  There will be an onus on the Opposition to forego the straightforward political play, to accept that the Government has to do certain things and can only go a certain part of the way.  If that spirit begins to permeate this House, we may make real progress in terms of passing legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been many suggestions made about the role of Seanad Éireann and it is only possible to look at this in <Col N="628" /> an <i>á la carte</i> manner.  Some discussion took place regarding the Order of Business and the way it can get out of hand but in the absence of Question Time the Order of Business is a very important ritual in this House.  A suggestion was made that in relation to the Order of Business, written notice would be given. That would be the death of the whole thing.  There is nothing wrong with put-thing the Leader of the House on the spot every morning.  It keeps him fit and it keeps his brain active and, more importantly, it enables him to put the pressure on the Executive.  It hits him without warning or notice, he has to go to a Minister for answers.  It is a terribly important mechanism that should not be distilled out of existence.  If we have to give prior written notice that distillation process will render it ineffective in the long run.  I believe that, in the cut and thrust of parliament, it is better that people can stand up and ask questions of the Leader of the House without any prior notice, written or otherwise and the Leader has to instantly respond to the queries raised and then come back later with a more substantive reply. That is a good system and ought to remain.</P>
    <P>I would like to see Question Time in this House with Members of the Government present.  The only caveat I would put in is that it seems to be an enormously costly business.  Whenever a question is put down in the Dáil in relation to the cost of Deputies' questions there seems to be a horrific amount of money spent on research. Frankly, in this age of the information super highway, how could it cost so much money to get what seems to be basic information out of the system?  I simply do not understand that.  I cannot understand that an American company can do its business from Fermoy using this information super highway and yet it costs a small fortune to have a simple question answered by the Civil Service through the question system in the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>They probably do not have to dot &ldquo;i's&rdquo; and cross &ldquo;t's&rdquo; for <Col N="629" /> Ministers and say: &ldquo;In the event of being pressed, Minister...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I take your point.  The problem sometimes is that they give too much advice and not enough information. I believe that if we had Question Time in this House, for instance, a lot of the debate which took place on flooding would have been unnecessary because we would have put the Minister through his or her paces.  It gives a Member a greater feeling of being involved.  There is no question, in my mind, in relation to Seanad reform but an attitude of reform must happen within every political party.  We all attend parliamentary party meetings and know full well that we have to push to be heard and for our views to have weight.  Everybody knows that in each parliamentary grouping the views of Deputies predominate over those of the Senators.  That is an attitude of mind which changes dramatically when the Minister of the day loses his seat in the Dáil and appears in this House.  Suddenly this House becomes all important, but when Ministers have the power to respond rapidly to Members of this House they are slow to do so.  There is a mindset which has to be corrected within the body politic before we can begin to convince the public that this House is worth keeping and worth looking at and listening to.</P>
      <P>As I said many years ago while in Brussels looking at the system, we created this tier of parliamentary representatives called MEPs and did not bother to integrate them into the political system in Ireland.  We just shot them into space, or wherever they go, and that was the end of it.  It is inconceivable that they could relate to their constituents given the size of the Munster constituency, the Leinster constituency, etc. It is difficult enough in the Dáil&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>My offer does not entail your return.</P>
      <P>On the serious point of the MEPs that system was never integrated.  I believe that the right of audience in this House, perhaps by invitation, would be a change which would allow the Seanad to become the watchdog on European legislation.  Somebody spoke earlier about committee reports that are never debated.  Masses of European legislation are shipped through the bureaucracy in Strasbourg and Brussels and simply rubber stamped in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Ministerial orders are just as bad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  The whole system works by default.  There is no real or intensive scrutiny of what is going on particularly now that European legislation frames and dictates, to a large extent, the shape of the economy and of the social map in Ireland.  The Seanad could play a very important role as the watchdog on Europe.  We deal with the legislation as it comes from the Dáil and specialise on European legislation. Many debates in this House which are very worthwhile have not the same relevance to citizens as the impact European <Col N="631" /> measures have on their daily lives. I believe we could do that with great effectiveness.  The right of important persons to address the House is something we should have the courage to introduce.</P>
      <P>I would love to have heard Jim Molyneaux speak in this House.  I would love to have somebody like Mr. McMichael address the House.  It does not have to be a combatitive thing.  The Seanad is a reflective type of Chamber &mdash; to use the softer analogy of the US system &mdash; and they could come here without any side being taken.  We would simply listen to what they have to say.  We should be proactive in that area.  This year we should all sit down in an all party way, perhaps by way of the Committee of Procedure and Privileges or a Seanad group, and make out a list of people we would agree should come to address us on important topics, not necessarily of the day but of the long term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was also made to the fact that the closing dates for Dáil and Seanad nominations should be locked together.  I strongly disagree with this proposal.  I have been involved in this business for approximately 30 years.  I have seen people stand for election, lose their businesses and being defeated.  I have also seen both them and their families in tears and with nowhere to go. This House is part of the political system and that system should not be closed off in any artificial way.  There is no reason to stop somebody of vast experience who has served in the other House other than that of malice.  In a business situation it would be considered criminal not to ensure that such a person was brought back into the business. It seems that there is something not quite right about doing this in politics, but that is a nonsense.  If people &mdash; unlike myself, I was nominated to this House &mdash; have to seek election through the Seanad panel system, they are more than entitled to come into this House. We should not put any artificial barriers before people who fail to get elected to the Dáil.  There is only a limited number <Col N="632" /> of seats and there are a lot of candidates.</P>
    <P>Members from this House have in my lifetime made enormous contributions to Irish public life.  Former Taoiseach, Garrett FitzGerald, the current Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, and other distinguished Members were Members of this House.  If there were no avenues for these people to continue their public service careers, the country would be at a serious loss.  We should not try to pander to those who, as Senator Mooney said, would abolish the Oireachtas overnight anyway.  That is the way this country operates as regards begrudgery.</P>
    <P>The possibility of the Government nominating Ministers from the Seanad was also mentioned in the course of the contributions.  That has been used in the past, again with great distinction.  Ex-Senator Dooge was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs to the overwhelming approval of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought it was a good precedent, but unfortunately the Taoiseach did not listen to me this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>If that happened, I am sure it would receive the same unanimous approval.  Senator Dooge brought great credit to that position and to this House.  Nobody but the most begrudging person would have said that he was not the best person for that post.  All of us live in hope that some of us in this House would get the nod in becoming a Minister or Minster of State, but of course the competition and pressure to appoint people for the other House is overwhelming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My last point concerns accommodation. In this day and age no Member should have to share an office with two, three or four other people or even with a secretary.  People come to see Members about all sorts of private and delicate matters and it is a nonsense that Members must find a corner of the bar, the restaurant or one of the interview <Col N="633" /> rooms to do their public business.  They are entitled to some privacy.  There are buildings which are part of the campus of this House that could be put to use and reallocated.  The quicker that is done, the better.  It was done with great success in regard to Government Buildings, for which the much abused ex-Taoiseach, C.J Haughey, deserves the greatest of credit.  He had the vision, foresight and courage to put in place something that is now admired by all as a wonderful innovation.  It was criticised by all parties, including my own, at the time, but we were shortsighted.  It is a credit to him that this building was used in that manner.  Without naming any institutions, there is room here that can allow us to expand and provide proper facilities for Members.</P>
    <P>On the question of remuneration &mdash; Senator O'Toole has mentioned this on a number of occasions &mdash; we are paid far less than a general operative in almost any industry.  The Seanad salary is meaningless in terms of an income. The last increase given, while welcome, came nowhere near making it a salary that one could live on or could call reasonable in any shape or form.  We should look on 1995 as an opportunity to bring into this House real reforms that will last into the future and that will also bring credit to the House.  We should try, as best we can, to ensure that the public understand that we are trying to do the best possible job, in most cases under enormously difficult circumstances.</P>
    <P>The sort of debates we have had largely reflect the maturity of the Irish political system of late.  There has been much more common cause among us recently to try to prepare the best possible legislation for this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the fourth debate we have had on this issue in the last seven years.  I do not think I will raise anything that has not been said before; there is an element of going on the record here.  Over the last number of years I have found that the debates have led to a more consensual approach <Col N="634" /> to the issue.  While people may have hardened in their positions, there is also a general movement towards a more open approach.  The fact that Senator Manning is now the Leader of the House is a positive step, because his views on this matter are well known. Even within the constraints of leading on Government business, there are many matters that he could permit us to examine.</P>
      <P>I am speaking without a time limit.  I could stay on my feet and contribute as long as I like, but I will not because I would bore the House to death; I did that on one famous occasion until 3 a.m. Since then I have taken the view that there should be a time limit on every contribution.  I know that Senator Manning and all of the Leaders of this House I have worked with since 1967 would take that view.  It has increasingly become the position in the last five years that if one cannot say what one wants to say in 15 minutes, one cannot say it at all.  That has been accepted, even on important issues, and has been implemented under the leadership of Senator Manning and, previous to him. Senator Wright, in an open and flexible way.  If there was a need to take time from other Members so as to give a Member with a real concern or interest in the issue a few extra minutes, it could be done.  It has been proven to work effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the last seven years I have changed my view that the Dáil and Seanad nomination dates should be the same.  The first time I spoke on this issue in 1988, I was strongly in favour of having the nomination dates for both Houses at the same time so that candidates would have to give a commitment to both Houses.  I said this, not in the hope of keeping defeated Dáil candidates out of this House but of showing commitment to one House or the other. I would not support that line anymore. I have consistently held the view that I felt it in order for Members of this House to aspire to becoming Members of the Dáil if they wished to.  There is <Col N="635" /> nothing wrong with that.  People can contribute to both Houses.  I have always rejected the purist line which many Members on my benches have taken.  People who are prepared to give to public life should be encouraged. Members of this House have had aspirations to the Park, third leg of the Oireachtas, and to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>This House has often been described as a platform for young hopefuls who wish to be elected to the Dáil and, conversely, as a retirement pasture for those who failed in the other House.  I do not subscribe to either view, although misinformed Members on both sides of the House have often accused me of holding that view.  The House benefits from the experience of politicians who have been Ministers, whether I agree with them or not; I tend to disagree with most of them.  I see the value of their experience being brought to bear.  This House often provides an entrée for many into national politics. Some uncharitably refer to their youthful inexperience.  It is a good thing to be shoved into the milieu of this House as an instrument of change.</P>
    <P>Some Members are committed to this House.  I have no wish to become a Member of Dáil Éireann &mdash; that is not to demean Members of that House &mdash; but I believe that I can best make the contribution I want to make in this House.  That is not a statement about either House but about myself.  It also relates to an issue which I will deal with later &mdash; the way we fail to reward our public representatives.</P>
    <P>Constitutional reform is required as regards the method of election to this House, which is unrepresentative and undemocratic.  I do not want people getting up on their high horse; I am not pointing a finger at anybody.  I find it extraordinary that I am elected by university graduates.  I am grateful for their support over the past seven or eight years and I hope they will continue that support.  But the idea that the rest of the vote is purely in the hands of county councillors is not good.  This may be <Col N="636" /> interpreted by people as being anti-county councillors, far from it; I hold county councillors in the highest regard and they are entitled to participate in the voting system here.</P>
    <P>If I had my way the inner and outer panels in each election would be separate. The inner panel would be elected by county councillors and public representatives, while the outer panel would be elected by popular vote.  That could easily be done without constitutional change; it would simply require an amendment to the legislation.  The Agricultural Panel, for example, would involve those in the agricultural industry, farmers or their representatives, and the Labour Panel would involve those in Labour, including trade unions, businesses and those representing the view of registered members of certain organisations. The partners in education should make an input into the Educational Panel, while fishermen or their representatives should have a vote on the relevant panel.  I believe it would add considerably to the sense of participation in the Seanad and could ensure universal participation.</P>
    <P>My constituency needs to be reformed and my views are well known in this regard.  Before I was elected to the Seanad I suggested that graduates of all third level institutions should be able to participate.  Graduates now form a large percentage of the population; it is still a privileged percentage.  That they are able to elect people is useful and should be maintained.  Third level institutions which do not have a vote on this panel are being demeaned or diminished to certain extent.  The constitutional change which would allow this was brought in by Gemma Hussey in 1979 and it should be implemented.  Like any politician I do not like anyone tampering with my constituency and it is a challenge which politically would be better if it passed me by.  However, I cannot see any justification for excluding those people at this time.</P>
    <P>As regards the constitutional power of the Seanad, I do not agree with those who believe its powers should be <Col N="637" /> extended.  The balance in the Constitution is correct and if it is used to its limit, it is good enough as far as I am concerned.  I like the idea of a bicameral Legislature where the second House does not have the absolute authority to overturn or undermine the decisions of the people as articulated in the Lower House.  I do not like the American model where Governments must fight in two Houses and face the possibility of losing major planks of policy which they were elected to implement.  It is a difficult issue, but I believe we have enough power.</P>
    <P>I do not believe we are doing business correctly in terms of legislation.  The consolidation of legislation should be the function of this House.  It should be done by a special committee with a lot of advice.  It should move forward and put existing legislation into consolidated Bills and then Acts.  Its power to modify legislation should be more open.  One of the great attractions of the present situation in the House &mdash; however tense and stressful it may be for the Leader &mdash; is that it will allow for changes in legislation.  People will come to terms with that and it will not be a big deal. We have all had amendments accepted to legislation, so it is not a huge move forward.</P>
    <P>This issue of a Question Time should be put on the agenda.  It has been used before in debates on education.  At the conclusion of each debate it was agreed that questions would be taken.  The novel aspect was that it was without precedent in the case of Deputy Seamus Brennan and had only one precedent in the case of Deputy Niamh Bhreathnach. There was an understanding among the Whips that it was not an occasion to bury the Minister and that questions of clarification and information should be asked.  It worked well and saved the cost of Parliamentary Questions &mdash; Senator Magner was correct in that regard.  This week I needed to get statistical information from a Department.  It refused to give me the information unless I said what I wanted it for.  I refused to say and I said that I would have ten Parliamentary <Col N="638" /> Questions put down seeking that information.  I said I would point out to the Deputies who would ask the questions that this is where there are inefficiencies in the public service.  The Department faxed me the information an hour later.  A Question Time in the House would make life a lot simpler.</P>
    <P>As regards our business, I believe there should be a four pronged approach to issues.  The Seanad is a good forum for dealing with international issues.  We will be discussing East Timor shortly, an issue which was first debated in Ireland in the Seanad &mdash; it was raised back in 1988.  Many other issues have also been dealt with, such as the Middle East and South Africa.  This is a useful forum where Ministers can come and test out ideas and have debates on international issues and certain issues, such as neutrality, would be better debated here than in other places.</P>
    <P>We can also deal with the business of Government rather than legislation; the topical issues of Government and Irish life.  As I mentioned we can deal with legislation.  We could also deal with individual cases, such as the issue we discussed today under the Arterial Drainage (Amendment) Bill, or individual problems which have national import.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of inviting speakers.  We all agree it should be done and we have agreed a procedure as to how it might be done but we need to take the next step.  All of us who have been involved in pushing the issue to this point want to make sure that we get it right the first time we do it.  A European Commissioner might be a reasonably neutral person to invite for a discussion on a European issue.  Granting a right of audience to MEPs for particular debates might also be useful.</P>
    <P>The question also arises of the resources we provide for our public representatives. I agree with Senator Magner that the representatives in this House are not properly rewarded.  I speak as somebody who is not dependent on the Seanad salary.  For five years it was my only source of income. It is impossible to rear a family or to <Col N="639" /> operate on the Seanad salary alone and Deputies are in an even worse position in many ways.  Many Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas have refused to grasp this nettle.  I am the only Member of either House who has consistently called for the implementation of the Gleeson report in this House and in the negotiations for the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i>  Before we signed the agreement in January 1994, I insisted on a commitment from the Minister that the Gleeson report would be brought in within six months.</P>
    <P>The Gleeson report is badly needed but it does not nearly meet all our needs.  We should be able to argue and defend anywhere the office and secretarial needs and the salary and expenses of Members.  The people will never jump up with delight when politicians travel abroad or get an increase in salary or expenses nor will they for any other group because it is not just an anti-politician feeling; teachers must get a better deal and I do not see people jumping up to support them.  There exists a certain element of begrudgery in society.</P>
    <P>I have ranged softly over a number of issues.  I hope to contribute to the subcommittee, when it is up and running, to bring forward changes.  Many changes have taken place over the past few years.  There has been an increase in Private Members' time, an increase in the number of Adjournment Matters and the option of grievance time.  The opportunities and the sitting times have also increased.  It is significant that in recent discussions on the Order of Business there have been fewer demands for debates on long lists of subjects because it is readily agreed that we should debate important items.  I look forward to playing a part in improving the role of the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak with little knowledge and experience of this subject, but I am a good listener.  I have listened to some of the debate and I wonder if I can contribute any more to what <Col N="640" /> has been said.  I looked through previous reports of debates on this matter and the old arguments are being repeated.  Why are we repeating what has been said when nothing has been done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information, I could enlighten the Senator.  I announced at the beginning of the debate, and to this end I circulated a copy of what was said last time, that I wanted to have a short debate before setting up an all party committee to put matters into effect.  Half the Members of the House are new to the present Seanad and I felt they might want to bring their views to bear before we get down to specifics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Miss Ormonde Miss Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that. Having listened to what has been said I am at my wits' end to see what I can contribute to the debate.  Have I anything new to say?  When I was elected here people asked me how I liked the Seanad.  I replied that I liked it a lot. &ldquo;What do you do there?&rdquo; they would ask.  I replied that it was a debating forum; we discuss issues which may be current or that come to us from the Dáil, and sometimes deal with legislation initiated in the Seanad.  I did not really grasp what the Seanad was about.</P>
      <P>I would like to think it is a debating forum and I would love to have discussion here.  However, I make a contribution on an issue, I sit down and that is the end of it for me.  The next person then contributes, and the process is repeated for the rest of the debate.  At this stage my part is over.  I have made a speech but I have not discussed the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sometimes I make a contribution and another idea is put forward later by someone else.  It would be useful to be able to come back into the debate and respond.  We are lacking in that respect. The Seanad should be about seeing debates through but I do not get that impression.  I walk away from the Chamber having done my bit and I go back to my office.  Where does that get <Col N="641" /> me?  Have I done anything with the speech?</P>
    <P>I would like to think there would be a follow through.  If, for example, I am spokesperson on education I will not know everything.  I would like to think I should make a good contribution but I will welcome other ideas so that we can discuss them and devise a worthwhile policy or solution.  We should not play politics all the time, although I accept we must play politics because this is a political forum.  Senator Daly's Bill should have been combined with Government policy instead of playing the politics of &ldquo;I can do better than you on compensation&rdquo;.  Such issues deal with people's lives.  We were dealing with the whole country and we played politics.  If we are talking about reforming the Seanad, are we going about it in the right way on issues such as Senator Daly's Bill?</P>
    <P>I would look for Question Time, more discussion and an opportunity to contribute again on a topic.  That, to me, is discussion or debate.  I am not debating at present.  I put forward my ideas and then somebody else puts forward their ideas, but at the end we do not get together on it.  As I was coming in here I wondered what I could say on this. Maybe I should have discussed the issue somewhere else first.  Perhaps we should sound one another out on things, use ourselves as a sounding platform before we come into the Chamber to discuss issues, or perhaps we should use the Chamber as the sounding platform.  I do not know.  I was having some problems with whether I should do it elsewhere or say what I am saying now in here and getting somewhere with what I have said on it.  That sounds very confusing, the more I think about it.</P>
    <P>I would like, perhaps, to have a Question Time, to be able to come back in on a debate.  Perhaps the spokesperson on the particular area could come back in, follow it up and take the points made rather than the Minister.  Perhaps there could be a debate with the Minister <Col N="642" /> rather than he or she making a presentation. That is the first point.</P>
    <P>We could extend the time spent dealing with European issues now that we are moving more into European thinking politically, socially and educationally. There are many other areas in which we need to feel that we are part of Europe, yet I feel we are isolated, so we could forge a stronger link with Europe and perhaps allow our MEPs and representatives of other European bodies to have access to the Seanad and put forward suggestions to us.  We could debate with them as to how best we can form better links.  I know that we have started our committee system which would complement that idea, so perhaps that is a move in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I wish to mention the electoral systems used in the Seanad.  Having gone around the country, having got myself elected the hard way, I have no difficulty with the easy way; but perhaps the European constituency concept would make it easier for Senators rather than going around the country looking for votes, particularly in the winter.  I would look for a change in that, but we should not move from the present electorate, the councillors.  The people they elect to this House reflect very well on them and it is certainly democracy at its best, there is no doubt about that.  We have five vocational panels, perhaps from time to time we should invite a representative of the areas covered by the panels to address us on a particular issue where the spokesperson from each party would participate in a full discussion with them so that we are reaching out more to the public.</P>
    <P>We are not reaching out enough to the public.  They do not really understand what we do in the Seanad.  Colleagues of mine at work ask me when I am going to bring them into the Seanad. They tell me that they do not know how it works.  They really do not know what Senators do.  These are all people with a third level education, yet they are lacking in knowledge as to exactly what we are at.  The reform will have to reach out more to the public.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="643" /> I advocate an improvement in our research facilities.  When I came in here first I did not have a clue where to go, how to act, how to put down a motion or what the procedures were.  We need more back up from civil servants; indeed, I compliment the ones we have, they are excellent.  However, having said that, we do need a system working for us to show us how to put down motions and how to word them properly, to help us with how to do research or to go about our business rather than we alone trying to find somebody to give us a bit of information.  Most Parliaments today have a back-up research facility for Senators and that would be welcome.</P>
    <P>The situation in relation to our secretarial assistants is appalling.  It keeps changing all the time.  I sometimes feel that I have just moulded a secretary and I am very pleased with her and suddenly she is whipped away from me and I am given somebody else.  That is a pity because I have allowed myself time to get to know the person and then suddenly the system is telling me that it does not work that way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator should put her foot down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Miss Ormonde Miss Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I do it all the time with the result that I am getting whingey about it.  I do not want to be like that in anything I do, but we need better secretarial assistance and a system that is consistent, not one that changes with the mood of whatever Government is in or whenever the musical chairs start again.</P>
      <P>Finally, in relation to salary, I feel sorry for those who live down the country. It takes three or four hours to come up from the country, so that is a day up and a day back.  It is a full time position and the salary does not meet the needs of public representatives in that regard and should be reviewed as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that I am just not re-hashing what others have said.  I do not want us to feel that in two years' time there will be another debate on the reform of the Seanad and we will start all over again. <Col N="644" /> I would love a bit of action in relation to the reform of the Seanad.  It is a great Chamber.  I am delighted and privileged to be here.  I want to stay here if I am not somewhere else.  I love making contributions to the best of my ability.  I want to help make the Seanad an effective platform, so that all of us participate in any way we can in implementing the best reforms of this Chamber.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of contributing to the discussion on this issue.  I confess that I have been engaged in other meetings, both last week and again today, so I have not heard previous discussion except that of Senator Ormonde.  Since Senator Ormonde came into this House two years ago, all her contributions have been extremely informative and very well researched.  She has made a very fine contribution to the Seanad. Although she is being very humble in what she has to say, she has made her mark in this Chamber.  People like her are of great value to the Seanad.</P>
      <P>The original reason for the establishment of the Seanad was to highlight and to bring on board the various vocational interests.  It was not meant to be politicised. It was meant to be a body truly representative of the various and wide vocational interests, hence the panel system.  All members of political parties know how we, the political parties, have hijacked that panel system since its foundation.  The Seanad is in a sense a replica of the Dáil, although through a different method of election &mdash; basically through the method of election of county councillors across the country in addition to the 11 Seanad nominees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Ormonde's point in relation to the panel representation. I agree with her suggestion of highlighting and reflecting that representation in the Seanad more accurately and affording opportunities to the various interests to come in here and interact with the Seanad on points of interest to them.  That may be unconstitutional. I am sure the Leader of the Seanad will investigate that aspect of it, but there is <Col N="645" /> an opportunity to open up a wider forum for maybe one day a month, where this could be considered and where the various interest groups could present their case.  It could be considered if that is possible constitutionally; it would reflect the wider interests of the Seanad and the representative interests of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Interestingly, this Government is making a very welcome recommendation that three Members would be elected to the Seanad from the emigrant group.  I hope that that will be put in place for the next election.  Whether that means we will have three additional Senators, or whether we will have one fewer Senator on the Educational and Cultural Panel&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Three from the Taoiseach's nominees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is even better and is highly commendable.  That is a good breakthrough and must be welcomed because it is making the Seanad more relevant to the current difficulties we are experiencing in our community, so many of which are outside the State.</P>
      <P>I was a Member of the other House for ten years and was then elevated to the Upper House.  Senator Ormonde might not wish to stay here too long and I would like to get back down there. This is a confession and open confession is good for the soul sometimes.  We recognise the difficulties in securing seats there.  Since I came to this House two years ago Senator Wright did an excellent job as Leader and Senator Manning has done the same since his appointment to that post.  Both have, within the limits imposed on them, accommodated Senators as far as humanly possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the differences between the Order of Business in the Dáil and in the Seanad is that in the Dáil one can have a good go at a Minister or the Taoiseach. I know, a Chathaoirligh, that this would be totally against your instinct.  In the Dáil, if a Taoiseach or a Minister is present for the Order of Business, one <Col N="646" /> feels that one has direct accountability from Government.  This is no reflection on the Leader of this House.  To have the Cabinet answerable to the Seanad, it would be good at least once a week to have a Minster present in the House to answer questions and interact with Senators, as happens in the Dáil between its Members and the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>The only opportunity we get to question Ministers in detail is on the Committee Stages of Bills or on the Adjournment.  The Cathaoirleach has always been very accommodating in affording us as far as possible opportunities of questioning Ministers on the Adjournment.  There is a real opportunity here to do something novel and different and not have a Question Time similar to what takes place in the Dáil, where there is an Order Paper for the day, with a list of questions.</P>
    <P>I visited the Australian Parliament seven or eight years ago and was impressed with the spontaneity of questions. There were no lists of questions on order papers.  Individual Ministers were open to spontaneous questions from members.  Speaking from this side of the House, I may be audacious in suggesting that a Minister &mdash; say the Minister for Education &mdash; should come to the House and leave herself open to questions which would not be on an Order Paper.  Ministers should come to the House to test this system.  It could be useful for Ministers and Members and could make this House more relevant to what is happening.</P>
    <P>In recent times this Government and the last one have used the Seanad far more effectively than previous ones. The Taoiseach and his predecessor have come here a number of times, have made formal and very important national announcements here and have made the Seanad more relevant by doing so.  Ministers in this and the last Government initiated Bills here; and a continuation of that by this Government would be extremely welcome, because legislation gets clogged up in the other Chamber.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="647" /> There is an opportunity to initiate and pass legislation here before it goes to the Dáil.  More of this could and should be done.  Within the media over the years there has been criticism of the relevance, necessity and usefulness of the Seanad.  It is up to Senators themselves, of all persuasions from all sides, to use the Seanad more effectively.  It can be made more relevant by more active participation and involvement in debates. This needs to be examined by all political parties.</P>
    <P>The House is a forum which should be respected.  It was set up as a constitutional entity and we should value and recognise it for what it is worth.  We should use it to the full under the guiding principles which exist at the moment.  We should be prepared to be daring and push out the boat in different areas and try other ways by which the House can be made more relevant. I suggest to the Leader that some form of Question Time, not necessarily every week but occasionally, would be very useful.  The presence of a Minister occasionally on the Order of Business could also make the Seanad more relevant. It is up to us to use it, make it relevant and not allow it to be subjected to the types of criticism which have been levelled against it in the past.</P>
    <P>Traditionally the Seanad has been highly respected for the constructive amending of legislation and the level of debate which has taken place here.  A very fine tradition has been established and we should ensure that it is not allowed to slip in any way.  We should take example from former very esteemed Senators.  I speak particularly of the former Senator, Alexis Fitzgerald, who used this House very effectively in amending legislation in a very thoughtful and constructive fashion. Senators should not lose sight of the ability of Senators to do this.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that this debate has taken place.  I have every confidence that Senator Manning, who has proved to be a very effective Leader, will be able to put ideas like this to the Government <Col N="648" /> and encourage Ministers to involve themselves more in the activities of the Seanad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with this point. I believe in the role of this House and that we should have more input into the running of the entire Oireachtas.  Not one Senator was represented at the meetings of the recent Dáil Select Committee on Legislation and Security.  Any legislation which goes through the Lower House must be debated and approved here.  If problems arise of the magnitude that arose on that occasion, both Houses should be involved in dealing with them.  Every Oireachtas committee should have Seanad representation to give the Seanad more strength and make it more useful.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole spoke about the structure of the Seanad.  I am pleased at the way Senators are selected.  People from every walk of life, such as fishermen, farmers, teachers, trade union representatives and business people are represented in this House.  They can be elected to panels from which they can be elected to this House.  This works fairly.  They can make their views well known.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the decision of the Government to appoint three Senators from the 11 Senators nominated by the Taoiseach to represent emigrants.  That is a very good and positive step and I <Col N="649" /> look forward to seeing how he intends to select or elect these people.</P>
    <P>People may get the opinion that this House is very refined, that we are all very dignified and that we do not have the same banter as the Lower House.  I have seen the trend change in this House and the odd good tussle takes place now and then.  The main emphasis is on the Lower House because if the Government lose a vote there it is faced with a vote of confidence and the ultimate possibility of a general election.</P>
    <P>Since the new Government took office the emphasis seems to have shifted to this House.  Suddenly, there is much interest in seeing if we, on this side of the House, with the support of the Independents could defeat the Government on a particular issue.  That is a little unfair because an Opposition is there to oppose legislation in which they do not believe.  If the shoe was on the other foot, Senators on the other side would do the same.  I look forward to an interesting period in this House over the next year and a half to two years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be no harm to focus the attention of the public on this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On numerous occasions people have spoken on the Order of Business about the coverage the Seanad gets on RTE's &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; and so on.  We seem to play a very small role in the running of the affairs of this country.  At the same time, all legislation which goes through the Lower House has to come before the Upper House.  It is debated in the same way and amendments are put down.  It is a very good structure because if the Government realises that it has made a mistake in the other House, it has a chance to correct it in <Col N="650" /> this House.  The Opposition can also propose amendments.  If the Government feels the pulse of the people, it can further amend legislation.  That is why this House is so relevant.</P>
    <P>Once during my term of office &mdash; and I know it happened before &mdash; a Minister was appointed from the Seanad by a member of a Fine Gael Government. This was good for the House.  It gave recognition to this House.  I would go a step further and say it should be mandatory that a Minister and one or two Ministers of State be selected from this House.  Then one would really put&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  That would put real power into this House.</P>
      <P>As Senator Ormonde said, members of the public ask us what we do in the Seanad and we tell them we participate in debates and so on.  We are legislators and another House of the Oireachtas. Many people think we are just a rubber stamp but that is not true.  When legislation is introduced one can stand up and speak against one's own Government if one does not believe in it: a person might even be lucky enough to have an amendment accepted by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I am glad to see the changes in the committee system.  It is good for this House and it is high time Senators were regarded as legislators and involved in all the activities in the State.  We are not elected directly by the public but those who elect us are.  We go through a similar process as any person elected to the Dáil.  It is fair, even though it is a difficult election.  The election should be regionalised.  We should explore the possibility of a new system because at the end of the day it would work out the same way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the debate.  I thank the Leader for the way he is handling his job in this House and my own leader for the way he handled it when he was Leader of the House.  I compliment <Col N="651" /> them both and I also compliment you, a Chathaoirligh.</P>

Because I am non-partisan, I must say that his predecessor, Deputy Andrews, also showed characteristic courage, forthrightness and decency in handling this scandalous situation.</P>
    <P>The debate is aimed at getting all party support for a strong resolution already passed by the Portuguese Parliament in condemnation of the crimes committed by the Indonesian dictatorship against a defenceless people in East Timor.  The Portuguese Parliament is constantly in touch either with myself or with the East Timor Ireland Solidarity Campaign.  It passed on this resolution to me, which we translated and which comprehensively covers the situation.</P>
    <P>The situation in East Timor is a painful case &mdash; to use the title of a James Joyce short story &mdash; involving the collaboration of nations whom we regard as friendly and as allies in Europe, such as Great Britain and France and also, most regrettably, Australia, with which we have so many ties of history and blood.  Australia has been arraigned this past month at the International Court of Justice in The Hague for its gross violation of international law and morality in its illegal determination to join forces with the Indonesian dictatorship in plundering the helpless people of that small neglected island.</P>
    <P>I visited the IPU conference in Canberra a year ago and I spoke about East Timor in the presence of the then Foreign Minister, Mr. Gareth Evans.  The reaction was interesting because many Australian parliamentarians were also horrified by the foreign policy objectives of the government.  I did a series of radio and television interviews subsequently and I got an overwhelming response from the ordinary Australian people.  There is a clear divide between the feelings of ordinary decent Australian people and politicians and the cynical economically driven motivation of Australian foreign policy in this area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="653" /> Recently in this House we held a moving and dignified commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz.  At the time of the Holocaust politicians throughout the world feigned ignorance of what was happening to the Jews of Europe.  We now know that such claims of ignorance were ill founded.  Policy makers in key positions in the Allied Governments were fully aware of exactly what crimes were being perpetrated, but cynically chose to bury such information.  As a result, it did not get out to the population.</P>
    <P>In the case of East Timor, as a result of the work, not of governments &mdash; although Ireland can claim to have a reasonably honourable record &mdash; but of individual journalists like Mr. John Pilger, who is getting an honorary degree in Dublin City University on Saturday, and of groups of ordinary citizens like Mr. Tom Hyland of the East Timor Ireland Solidarity Campaign, no Government in Europe or throughout the world can make any credible claim to be ignorant of the genocide still being committed against the people of East Timor.  It is estimated that one third of the civilian population of East Timor has been exterminated by the Indonesian forces.  Once again we are confronted with the self-importance of a Machiavellian elite within European, Australian and Japanese Governments which place their understanding of the long term armaments, economic and foreign policy interests of their country above the clearly expressed wishes of their people and of the claims of the most basic appreciation of human rights codes, common decency, morality and international law.</P>
    <P>Not alone do we have the bloody reality of the Dili massacre, there is also the moral squalor of the Timor Gap Treaty.  This treaty was signed in 1989 by the Indonesian Foreign Minister, Ali Alatas, and his Australian counterpart, Mr. Gareth Evans.  The treaty allows Australian and international oil companies to exploit the seabed off East Timor.  It is estimated that there are several billion barrels of oil in this region <Col N="654" /> or, in the words of the Australian Foreign Minister, Mr. Gareth Evans, &ldquo;zillions of dollars&rdquo;.  One must ask what is the price of decency and of the self respect of the Australian nation.</P>
    <P>The Australians will get another buffeting in UCD almost contemporaneously with this discussion in the Seanad because it is being discussed at a meeting of one of the major societies there.  I understand that officials from the Australian Embassy will attend and I doubt if they will be satisfied with what they hear from the audience, if I know the students from UCD, which I do.</P>

      <P>The Timor Gap Treaty was signed during a flight over East Timor.  When Mr. Evans was questioned about the internationally accepted principle of not recognising territory acquired by force, his response was: &ldquo;What I can say simply is that the world is a pretty unfair place&rdquo;.  This is a strange principle on which to base the ethics of foreign policy.</P>
      <P>The degree to which attitudes are tailored to suit circumstances can be gauged from the fact that before the invasion of East Timor by Indonesia, Mr. Gough Whitlam, the then Australian Prime Minister, declared that East Timor would be too poor for viable independence.  Before the invasion and before they realised that there were vast economic resources to be exploited, the justification for the invasion by the Indonesians was that it was too poor to survive on its own.  Quite the contrary now appears to be the fact.  It is now too rich to survive.  East Timor is, apparently, too well endowed in natural resources to be allowed independence by powerful and greedy neighbours.  It seems that the world, in terms of most of its foreign ministers, is prepared to stand idly by because of the economic significance of the Pacific rim nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="655" /> Professor Roger Clarke of Rutgers University in the United States is one of the leading experts in maritime law.  On the subject of the Timor Gap Treaty, he says:</P>
    <P>it is acquiring stuff from a thief.  If you acquire property from someone who stole it, you are a receiver.  As far as I am concerned the Indonesians are in the position of someone who stole territory, and the Australians are dealing with them as though they had some kind of legitimacy.  I find that that is complicity.  The fact is that the Indonesians have neither legal, nor historical, nor moral claim to East Timor or its resources.</P>
    <P>Moreover, the obligation not to recognise the acquisition of territory acquired illegally is reflected in a significant 1970 resolution by the General Assembly that was co-sponsored by Australia on the 25th anniversary of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>The human rights record of the Indonesian invasion forces in the military administration of East Timor is a world scandal.  It is highly significant that in the last week the findings of the Indonesian Human Rights Commission have contradicted publicly the stated position of its own Government.  I salute those brave people who are opposing a dictatorship from within on those very grounds of moral principle which have been so clearly abandoned by so many Governments in Europe and throughout the world.  We are shamed by such courage, as we are by the courage and determination of the Timorese people.</P>
    <P>For many in western society the economic reality of the modern world has become so complex we are deterred from facing simple facts and the consequences of our investment choices. No doubt many little white-haired old ladies in Cheltenham buy unit trust bonds or invest in Indonesian companies because of a sentimental attachment to the Orient without realising they are funding the bloody machinery of war.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="656" /> The ESB is involved in two projects in Indonesia and we should examine that.  Also, as Senator Maloney said last week, Aer Lingus is peddling fluffy toys, innocuous and delightful in themselves, but made in Indonesia.  Simply from the viewpoint of public opinion, it would be useful if Aer Lingus withdrew those toys and if the ESB withdrew from the area.</P>
    <P>Auschwitz and its accompanying death programme would not have been possible without the massive collaboration of German industrial concerns such as Krupp, Thyssen and I.G. Farben.  British, French and other industrial concerns have made cold, detached, financial decisions to sell the Indonesians the instruments of death with which the defenceless people of East Timor are being obliterated.  These companies should be isolated and targeted for they are moral lepers of the same variety as the manufacturers of Zyklon B gas.  One does not have to look further than British Aerospace to find a prime example.</P>
    <P>The French President, Mr. Francois Mitterand, prior to his election said: &ldquo;One people has been killed in Kampuchea, another is being exterminated today in East Timor&rdquo;.  In the light of this clearly expressed knowledge by the French Government, why does it continue to supply Alouette and Puma helicopters, used by the Indonesian forces in waging an aggressive war against the civilian population of East Timor?</P>
    <P>When I raised this issue with Mr. Alain Juppé at the meeting of Cosac in Paris last week his reply was to the effect that EU members should not keep torturing themselves about human rights issues.  The EU, according to Mr. Juppé, had a good human rights record and in any case it was not a human rights organisation but had to face reality.  I would like Mr. Juppé to face some of the human realities with which his Government continues to collaborate.</P>
    <P>Interestingly my trenchant and controversial contribution, critical as it was of the conduct of our host State, was the only intervention of the morning that, <Col N="657" /> according to the official report, drew applause from all sides of the house.  I hope Mr. Juppé noted that fact.  It is clear, therefore, that ordinary citizens, ordinary politicians and the principled non-governmental organisations throughout Europe are united in opposing the policy of collaboration.</P>
    <P>When will those in power listen to the increasingly urgent demands made upon them to recognise the legitimacy of moral concerns in this area?  When will foreign policy cease to be conducted along the lines advocated by the former junior Minister at the British Ministry of Defence, Alan Clark, MP, whose support for Compassion in World Farming contrasts so oddly with his clearly expressed indifference to mass murder carried out with weaponry supplied by the British munitions industry?  Can we afford this level of moral imbecility in our so called statesmen?</P>
    <P>The Indonesian dictatorship has attempted to prevent news of its infamy travelling abroad.  In the last three months ten foreign journalists have been deported from East Timor.  A court in Indonesia recently sentenced an East Timorese man, José Antonio Neves, to four years in jail.  His crime was to write to the United Nations Secretary General, Mr. Boutros Boutros Ghali, about the human rights situation in East Timor.  How can any member nation of the United Nations tolerate this form of behaviour?</P>
    <P>In January the official Indonesian news agency, Antara, carried a report that six East Timorese guerrillas were killed in a clash with Indonesian forces. The East Timor Ireland Solidarity Campaign checked this with Catholic Church sources in East Timor.  I am sometimes critical of the Roman Catholic Chuch, but not always; I like to balance that with praise.  I cannot speak highly enough of the conduct of bishops, priests and administrators on East Timor and especially that remarkable and courageous man, Bishop Belo, who is so consistently misquoted in advertisements by the Indonesian Government <Col N="658" /> in US mass circulation newspapers.</P>
    <P>The church sources confirmed the six were in fact civilians who had been tortured and murdered by the Indonesian army.  Intense pressure was then put on the international community from East Timor groups.  The Governments of the US, New Zealand and Canada then issued a statement expressing concern at the Indonesian version of the killings.  It has now emerged that those killed were civilians and when the relatives went to collect their bodies they were also threatened with execution.</P>
    <P>In a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> in the last week a Catholic Church source said:</P>
    <P>Indonesian special forces were conducting sweeping manoeuvres throughout East Timor in which young men were being arrested and murdered throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Bishop Belo of East Timor said: &ldquo;Everyday someone comes to my house to tell me, &lsquo;They kill my son&rdquo;&rsquo;.  The sources said systematic and careful elimination of young men had been going on for at least a month.</P>
    <P>By passing this motion tonight we at least add our voices to the voices of condemnation beginning to echo around the world.  Let the Indonesian authorities take note that their crimes are being recorded and monitored.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Norris for inviting me to second the motion. We should record our appreciation of his commitment to this issue, which he has followed through on many occasions in the last five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not often we get the chance to welcome the Tánaiste on an international issue; when he is here, which is regularly, it is usually on local business. On the two occasions I made contact with the Tánaiste and his office on East Timor, he was fantastically supportive. His views on this matter are a source of encouragement in many different places.  I have spoken to educational groups worldwide &mdash; which have discussed this issue because teachers are <Col N="659" /> under threat on the island &mdash; and they are encouraged that the Foreign Minister of an EU state has taken such a personal interest in the subject.  I look forward to his continued concern.</P>
    <P>I will not attempt to go through the issues in the same detail as Senator Norris.  He has covered East Timor, not only with his usual vitality and energy but with clear detail and he has painted a dramatic picture.  Everything I could say is a form of repetition of the issues he raised, but I will underline some points.</P>
    <P>Recently in this Chamber we discussed the meaning of neutrality and the idea of an active neutrality, contributing to world peace, enabling people to live together and forge global agreements. During that debate I asked how we would explain to our grandchildren that a generation stood by while the Holocaust happened and while Pol Pot was butchering.</P>
    <P>The same question arises about us.  If only in the self-interested sense of being able at least to say one brought the matter to someone's attention or tried to create a world awareness, this Administration and its predecessor can say it has done so by raising the issue in the constraints of the EU, although those constraints bother us to some extent.</P>
    <P>What is happening in East Timor is being parallelled in Tibet.  The positions have many similarities: large, bullying, powerful nations took over helpless, defenceless, passive peoples.  We as an independent State must bring this to the attention of the world.  This issue attracts extraordinary support when people are brought up to date on it.</P>
    <P>I put East Timor on the agenda of the World Conference of Education International, the world teachers' grouping, which is the largest professional group in the world, representing 25 million teachers.  I was to propose the motion in Helsinki two years ago but I was unable to go there.  However, it was proposed, seconded and agreed in my absence, despite the most vehement opposition of the Indonesian and Australian <Col N="660" /> teachers' unions.  The most extraordinary thing about that was that it created an awareness among teachers in every country.  People discussed the matter and had an interest in it as they had in Kosovo in former Yugoslavia.  Any problems or issues teachers have encountered in the last three or four years have been brought to my attention by the EI and also to the attention of teachers around the world.</P>
    <P>Within two months of this motion being passed at the world conference, the Indonesian teachers union sent a copy of the booklet I am holding to every teachers' union in the world.  It is a lovely glossy booklet which purports to tell us about the great improvements the Indonesian authorities have brought to the welcoming people of East Timor. I will not go into the detail of the booklet. However, East Timor in 1976 is depicted in faded black and white pictures. They show a ramshackle house, children in very poor health and farmers working in what looks like a stone age setting.  When one turns over that page one can look at pictures depicting East Timor in 1989.  They show a modern country and an emerging state thanks to Indonesia.  It would be grand if one could ignore the facts that Senator Norris has brought to our attention.  We must keep reminding ourselves that it is still happening, week by week and month by month.  My office is still receiving reports from teachers there about the difficulties they are experiencing.</P>
    <P>This is happening now.  Nobody is doing anything about it despite the fact that the United Nations in 1982, having discussed it previously in 1975, gave a clear direction that action be taken to initiate consultations with all the parties concerned with a view to exploring avenues and achieving a comprehensive settlement of the problem.  Settlement meant self-determination for the people of East Timor.  The original United Nations resolution of 1972 has been ignored.</P>
    <P>I have criticised the role of the Catholic Church at the time of the Holocaust <Col N="661" /> and how slow it was to take action. However, the Catholic Church in East Timor has behaved impeccably.  It has taken the lead on this issue.  That is true not only of the resident church authorities, mentioned by Senator Norris, but also of the papal representative, Monsignor Lopez, who was there for quite some time.  It is rare for a diplomat to speak out in the trenchant terms he used in order to bring what he called the &ldquo;atrocities of East Timor&rdquo; to the notice of the world.  Those were the words of a neutral observer.</P>
    <P>The Administration there is being propped up diplomatically by states throughout the world, militarily, financially and economically in the manner outlined by Senator Norris.  We have lists of examples of such support.  It is very worrying.  We must be proactive in this matter and encourage our European partners to support us.  I took part in the vigil outside the House during the visit of the Australian Prime Minister, Paul Keating, last year.  I did not do so without some reservations as a public representative.  I have been involved in causing problems for visiting dignitaries for many years.  I addressed a large crowd outside Buswells Hotel during the visit of the American President in the early 1980s when somebody chose to burn the American flag, an action that upset some of my American relatives watching CBS that night.</P>
    <P>However, I do not like the idea of public representatives being involved in such activities and it is not something I would do casually.  I was heartened when I arrived at the vigil to see more than half a dozen public representatives present.  I was also heartened to see the number of people there &mdash; it was a Sunday night &mdash; to show their disgust and horror at what is happening in East Timor.  That represented the views of the people, their reaction to the television programmes we all have seen, and the way in which ordinary people questioned how this could happen today.</P>
    <P>I recently asked Members of the Dáil and Seanad to put their names to a proposal <Col N="662" /> to the Tánaiste.  A majority of Members did so.  There were no refusals: those who did not sign were, perhaps, laggardly rather than refusing. We called for support for the United Nations' call for self-determination in East Timor; condemnation of the invasion of Indonesia; and pressed the Government to involve the UN in ensuring that extrajudicial execution and torture were not part of daily life. Finally, we called for the release of all political prisoners and expressed the moral revulsion of Irish people and their public representatives at the continuing reports of further atrocities in East Timor.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion to the House and I thank the Tánaiste for his personal interest in this issue.  I hope he will take it further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to have the opportunity to address this House on the motion tabled by Senator Norris, Senator O'Toole, Senator Henry and Senator Lee.  I am also grateful for the remarks made by the previous speakers.</P>
      <P>This motion reflects the text of one tabled in the Portuguese Parliament. That motion was adopted unanimously by the Assembly of the Republic of Portugal on 16 November but there was little discussion of it by the Parliament, where all the Portuguese political parties are unanimous in their views on the issue of East Timor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraphs (1) and (3) of the motion repudiate the occupation of East Timor and reaffirm the inalienable right of the people of East Timor to self-determination. Indonesia invaded East Timor in December 1975 and sought to annex it in July 1976.  The United Nations continues to view Portugal as the administering power of the territory and the UN Security Council and General Assembly have adopted resolutions condemning the Indonesian invasion and annexation.  In 1982 the UN instituted talks between the Foreign Ministers of Portugal and Indonesia <Col N="663" /> under the auspices of the UN Secretary General.</P>
    <P>The motion takes up the situation of the East Timorese people and the abuse of human rights in paragraphs (1) and (2).  Paragraph (4) particularly and firmly condemns the serious violations of human rights that have been perpetrated in East Timor.  Let me say at the outset that I agree fully with the assessment of the sufferings experienced by the people of East Timor in the last 20 years since the Indonesian invasion of their territory.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that it is estimated that some 200,000 people, out of the original East Timorese population of 650,000, have died as a result of that invasion and its aftermath.  On 12 November 1991 the Indonesian armed forces reacted to a peaceful demonstration in Dili, the capital of East Timor, by firing live ammunition into the crowd and it has been estimated that between 200 and 300 people were killed as a result. In addition, some 200 people disappeared at that time and their fate is still unknown.  In a statement issued a day after those shootings, Ireland and our EU partners expressed outrage and condemned the violent actions of the Indonesian armed forces.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (5) of the motion urges the release of all Timorese political prisoners, especially that of Mr. Xanana Gusmao.  The trial of Mr. Gusmao attracted widespread international attention and, when he was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1993, the Indonesian Government received many representations from around the world.  I wrote to the Foreign Minister, Mr. Ali Alatas, at that time.  The Indonesian Government responded to the international pressure by reducing Xanana Gusmao's sentence to 20 years but I take this opportunity to repeat that it is essential that he and other political prisoners be released.</P>
    <P>I last addressed the Seanad on the situation in East Timor on 20 April 1994, an occasion when several Senators made substantial contributions to the <Col N="664" /> debate.  I propose now to deal with important developments since that debate and in particular the recent and very critical UN report on East Timor, the latest meeting between the Portuguese and Indonesian Foreign Ministers and the meeting of the UN Commission on Human Rights &mdash; CHR &mdash; in Geneva.</P>
    <P>The Indonesian authorities agreed to invite to East Timor the CHR Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions.  The Special Rapporteur, Mr. Bacre Waly Ndiaye, visited East Timor in July 1994.  His report on his visit to Indonesia and East Timor was made public in December and was presented to the current session of the UN Commission on Human Rights.</P>
    <P>After careful consideration of the available evidence his conclusions on the Dili killings are: the killings could have been avoided by a proper crowd control operation in advance of the demonstration; the killings were done by regular members of the armed forces; the procession that took place in Dili on 12 November 1991 was a peaceful demonstration of political dissent by unarmed civilians and claims that the security forces had fired in self-defence are unsubstantiated; there are reasons to believe that the actions of the security forces were not a spontaneous reaction to a riotous mob, but a planned military operation to deal with a public expression of political discontent.  He urges the Indonesian authorities to carry out thorough, prompt and impartial investigations of all suspected cases of extra-judicial, summary or arbitrary executions and enforced or involuntary disappearances.  He calls on the Government of Indonesia to establish a civilian police force as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>He is quite disparaging about the investigation into the Dili killings carried out by the National Commission of Inquiry.  Its creation was an encouraging initiative but it was created by presidential decree, none of its members was totally independent of the Government and it was not trusted by the East <Col N="665" /> Timorese.  He concludes that a new commission of inquiry should be established, composed of individuals of recognised independence, impartiality and expertise and including, if necessary, experts internationally recognised for their objectivity and competence.</P>
    <P>The rapporteur welcomes the establishment of the National Human Rights Commission, which was created by presidential decree in June 1993 as a very positive step towards improved respect for human rights.  This commission has investigated the killing of six East Timorese on 12 January and has concluded that the Indonesian Army carried out intimidation and torture before killing six unarmed villagers. It has rejected the claim by the Indonesian Army that those killed were members and supporters of a separatist guerrilla group.  This finding has compelled the Army into conducting a further investigation.  The commission's report is grim but there is just one positive factor in it.  It means that the officially established National Human Rights Commission is now prepared to identify and publicise an army atrocity in East Timor.</P>
    <P>Mr. Ndiaye deserves our thanks for the worthwhile visit which he has carried out to East Timor.  He has produced a report which is sharply critical of the situation and was submitted to the current session of the Commission for Human Rights.  I welcome the report's emphasis that it is not too late to conduct a proper investigation into the Dili killings, to bring the perpetrators to justice, compensate those concerned and ensure that no further killings occur.</P>
    <P>The visit by the Special Rapporteur followed Indonesia's commitment, at the fourth meeting between the Portuguese and Indonesian Foreign Ministers under the auspices of the Secretary General, to invite him to East Timor. The fifth meeting between the two Foreign Ministers under the auspices of the UN Secretary General took place on 9 January 1995, in Geneva.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="666" /> The Portuguese Foreign Minister, Mr. Durao Barrosso, has reported to his ministerial colleagues in the European Union on that round of talks with the Indonesian Foreign Minister, Mr. Ali Alatas.  Discussions at that meeting focused on the initiative of the UN Secretary General to invite Timorese, both those who accept and those who reject the Indonesian presence in East Timor, to take part in a dialogue meeting in April to explore ideas of a practical nature which might have a positive impact on the situation in East Timor.</P>
    <P>Portugal considers that the fifth round of talks marks some progress.  It recognises that the dialogue with Indonesia is very slow but its aim, in the short term, is to promote advances towards local autonomy and a better internal situation in the territory though the &ldquo;all inclusive&rdquo; intra-Timorese dialogue.</P>
    <P>The sixth round of talks between the Foreign Ministers under the auspices of the Secretary General will be held on 19 May 1995, in New York.  The Ministers have agreed to consider at those talks substantive issues identified by the Secretary General regarding possible avenues towards achieving a just, comprehensive and internationally acceptable solution to the question of East Timor.</P>
    <P>It remains to be seen what substantive issues the Secretary General may be able to identify.  There is no early solution in sight but I will point to one positive development.  The rounds of talks between the two Foreign Ministers, which were launched under the auspices of the Secretary General in 1982, are now taking place with encouraging regularity.  The fact that the fourth, fifth and sixth rounds of those talks will have taken place between May 1994 and May 1995 is encouraging.</P>
    <P>This year's session of the CHR has been taking place in Geneva since the end of January and is continuing until the end of this week.  The CHR has already completed its consideration of East Timor and on 1 March the chairman of the CHR delivered a consensus <Col N="667" /> statement on the human rights situation in East Timor.</P>
    <P>As Senators will be aware, the option at each session of the CHR is that a consensus statement will be agreed by all the participants, including Indonesia, or, alternatively, that a strongly critical motion will be tabled, which Indonesia would not wish to see adopted.  Portugal conducted lengthy negotiations with Indonesia in order to secure agreement on a sufficiently strong chairman's statement. I am glad that was achieved but, if the negotiations had not proved satisfactory, Ireland would have strongly supported Portugal in seeking the tabling of a suitable draft resolution by the EU.</P>
    <P>The chairman's statement has expressed deep concern over the continuing reports of violation of human rights and specifically the recent increase in tensions and the killing of six people on 12 January.  The chairman records the Indonesian Government's undertaking to investigate those killings.</P>
    <P>The statement welcomes Mr. Ndiaye's report on his visit to East Timor, expresses concern at the contents of the report and calls on the Indonesian Government to continue its investigation concerning those who are still missing since the events of November 1991.</P>
    <P>The statement calls on the Indonesian Government to continue its policy of granting access to human rights and humanitarian organisations and international media.  It is good to see that the Indonesian Government has reiterated that commitment.  However, I have to say that the Indonesian authorities are continuing to decide on what terms they will permit access.</P>
    <P>Indonesia's unwillingness to permit free access to East Timor for journalists has, regrettably, been demonstrated again in recent months.  The distinguished Irish journalist, Mr. Hugh O'Shaughnessy, who writes for the <i>Observer</i> newspaper and contributes to <i>The Irish Times</i> and RTE travelled to Dili last year but was told there that he <Col N="668" /> would not be allowed to act as a journalist without the written permission of the Indonesian authorities and he was compelled to leave East Timor.  His case constitutes just one example of Indonesia's continuing restriction of international reporting on the situation in East Timor.</P>
    <P>The chairman's statement records Indonesia's undertaking to invite the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to visit East Timor this year and to report to the next session of the Commission on Human Rights.  Indonesia has also undertaken to invite the Special Rapporteur on the Question of Torture and the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention to visit East Timor when it is necessary for them to do so in order to fulfil their duties.  Indonesia's commitment to receive the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the relevant Special Rapporteur and working group is a positive outcome from this year's CHR.  The visit of Mr. Ndiaye last year resulted in a detailed and severe report. Its publication and examination in context of this year's session of the CHR has certainly increased the pressure on the Indonesian authorities to address the situation in East Timor.</P>
    <P>The East Timorese delegation to this year's session of the CHR has welcomed the chairman's statement and expressed the hope that the High Commissioner will visit East Timor with utmost urgency.  The East Timorese multi-party delegation has expressed deep appreciation to Ireland for its firm stand within the EU and in the UN in support of the legitimate rights of the East Timorese people.  It has also expressed gratitude to the Portuguese delegation for the manner in which it has articulated and advocated the views of the East Timorese. I am certain that the appreciation of the East Timor delegation extends not only to the Government but to all those in Ireland who seek to remedy the grave wrong inflicted on the people of East Timor.</P>
    <P>In this context, I would mention that my Minister of State, Deputy Burton, recently met with Mr. Jose Ramos <Col N="669" /> Horta, co-chairman of the National Council of the Timorese Resistance, in Geneva.  The previous Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, met with the Indonesian Foreign Minister in Karlsruhe at the EU-ASEAN ministerial meeting last September.  We can, therefore, contribute to and welcome the international pressure which has been building up on Indonesia concerning its treatment of East Timor.</P>
    <P>President Clinton availed of the APEC summit meeting, hosted by Indonesia in Djakarta in November 1994, to raise the issue with President Soeharto and to encourage him to give the people of East Timor more influence over their local affairs.</P>
    <P>It is encouraging to see that the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Gareth Evans, has taken up this theme in a speech which he delivered on 25 November 1994.  He expressed disappointment that President Soeharto has not taken up the idea of granting a special status of limited autonomy to East Timor.  Minister Evans emphasised the need for reconciliation, the reduction of Indonesian armed forces on the island and the recognition by the Indonesian authorities of the special cultural and religious situation of the East Timorese people.  He met Minister Alatas on 21 February and put to him the case for greater political autonomy for the people of East Timor as well as urging Indonesia to reduce its military presence there.  He is reported to have expressed also his concern at the deteriorating situation in the province.</P>
    <P>Senators are aware that Australia is in a particular situation as regards East Timor.  Unlike the international community as a whole, it has recognised Indonesia's annexation of that territory. That has led to international criticism of Australia's position and Ireland has taken up the issue with our Australian friends.  The recent actions by Minister Evans are very encouraging and show the readiness of Australia to use its special influence with the Indonesian Government to seek a degree of autonomy for the people of East Timor.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="670" /> Senators will be aware of the hearing before the International Court of Justice in The Hague in which Portugal is contesting the legality of the Timor Gap Treaty between Australia and Indonesia on exploitation of the oil resources under the Timor Sea.  The international community awaits with interest the findings of the court.</P>
    <P>The Portuguese Government, Parliament and people are committed to seeking a just, comprehensive and internationally acceptable solution to the East Timor problem.  I follow with close attention the efforts undertaken by the Portuguese Government and the talks between the Indonesian and Portuguese Foreign Ministers under the auspices of the UN Secretary General.  I ensure that Ireland clearly supports Portugal when it reports to and seeks the backing of our European Union partners.  At this year's session of the Commission on Human Rights, the Irish delegation has worked closely with the Portuguese to ensure that international concern about the situation in East Timor is effectively maintained and strengthened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the motion on this tragic situation.  I spoke on this issue before and I am happy to do so again by strongly supporting the motion.  It is important to put some of the facts in place and to look at a little of the background. The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs outlined the problems and covered some of the areas I intended to mention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Portugal is still the administering power, recognised by the UN.  This means for the UN and the international community as a whole that East Timor has not completed its decolonisation process in accordance with international law.  The Indonesian rule, therefore, over the territory, derived of its brutal military invasion on 7 December 1975, is illegal.  Following the revolution in Portugal on 25 April 1974, Portugal undertook to emancipate its colonial territories.  In some of these areas, such as Angola, Mozambique and Guinea Bissau, liberation movements were <Col N="671" /> already established.  In some cases, guerrilla wars were ongoing.  However, in East Timor there was no war, no liberation movement and no political parties. These came into being later; Fretilin sought independence, the Timorese Democratic Union sought to maintain links with Portugal, albeit for a short time in the transition period, while another group sought integration with Indonesia.</P>
    <P>The Portuguese Government consulted with these parties and enacted a law providing for the East Timorese to choose democratically and freely their future political status.  Civil war broke out and Fretilin had <i>de facto</i> control over most of the country.  Portugal tried many times to restore peace and reestablish the rule of law in an effort to put the decolonisation of East Timor back on the right track.  However, on 7 December 1975, Indonesia launched a military attack by ground, air and sea, leading to its occupation ever since.  It was only when the territory was invaded by the Indonesian troops that the Portuguese authorities left East Timor, since their presence was no longer possible. Portugal did not abandon the East Timorese, as is sometimes claimed.  On the day of the invasion, Portugal severed diplomatic relations with Indonesia and immediately brought the case before the UN Security Council and General Assembly.</P>
    <P>Several resolutions were adopted deploring Indonesian intervention, asking them to withdraw from East Timor and asking all countries and States to respect the territorial integrity of East Timor and to respect East Timor's right to self-determination.  These resolutions are still in force and set up the legal and political framework within which a just, comprehensive and internationally acceptable settlement to this issue will still have to be found if the UN basic principles on decolonisation and the essential rights of colonial peoples are to be respected.</P>
    <P>Portugal, bound since the adoption of its 1976 constitution to promote and <Col N="672" /> guarantee the right to self-determination of the people of East Timor, supported all the resolutions and fully accepted their provisions.  It believed a new initiative had to taken because Indonesia ignored these resolutions. Portugal also believes that the United Nations should become involved in more practical terms in the search for a peaceful and negotiated settlement to the question, which would address underlying political causes of the fighting.</P>
    <P>Portugal co-sponsored and promoted the adoption of Resolution 37/30 on 27 November 1982, whereby the Secretary General was requested to initiate consultations with all parties directly concerned with a view to exploring avenues for achieving a comprehensive settlement to the problem.  Pending the submission of his final report to the United Nations General Assembly, a practice of postponing the debate of the issue to the next regular session of the General Assembly was established.  I understand this still exists and I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to examine this point. Indonesia voted against the resolution and Djakarta was extremely reluctant to start any type of dialogue over East Timor, claiming that East Timor had been rightly incorporated into Indonesia.</P>
    <P>There is a very large imbalance of power between Portugal and Indonesia and it is only by bringing international pressure to bear that any change is ever likely to occur.  When Portugal acceded to the European Community, as it was then, it began developing unprecedented efforts at every appropriate international fora, even as far as the International Court of Justice.  It profited from every suitable occasion to raise the issue of East Timor, regarding both the need to complete the decolonisation process in accordance with international law and to put an end to the intolerable human rights situation prevailing.</P>
    <P>It was only on 12 November 1991, with the brutal killing of scores of young East Timorese in Dili &mdash; to which the <Col N="673" /> Minister referred &mdash; that there was a turning point in the world's perception of the question, drawing attention to their plight.  Shortly after this violence, in January 1992, the Portuguese Government proposed to the UN Secretary General that a renewed dialogue without preconditions should be engaged in as soon as possible, involving Indonesia and all parties directly concerned in order to achieve a just, comprehensive and internationally acceptable settlement to the question of East Timor.  It has become obvious that without addressing the underlying political causes of the situation, violence and oppression, with the inevitable ensuing systematic violation of human rights, would not be stopped.  Four meetings have been held, as the Tánaiste outlined.</P>
    <P>At present, Portugal remains firmly committed to participate constructively in these talks.  However, it is only with the international community looking continually at the problem that change is likely to come.  I commend Senator Norris for putting forward this motion and his continued interest in this matter. It is worth putting on the record that Portugal has no other interest but to complete the decolonisation process and to restore the right of self-determination to the people of East Timor.  I am shocked by Australia's attitude to East Timor.  The Tánaiste referred to the Timor Gap Treaty.  However, I am also shocked by the reluctance of a number of so-called western democracies to condemn the Australians for collaborating in this exploitation.</P>

      <P>It is about oil, power and exploitation and it is paid for with the lives of the East Timorese.  They are innocent people caught in the middle. As the Minister said, there was a fifth <Col N="674" /> round of talks in Geneva in January 1995 between the Portuguese Foreign Minister, Mr. Durao Barroso, and the Indonesian Foreign Minister, Mr. Ali Alatas.  However, these are just discussions which are moving slowly but surely and they should continue.</P>
      <P>However, we must take every opportunity in this Parliament and in other Parliaments to condemn this issue outright. We should ask the Australians what they are doing in league with these people.  Is oil so important that 200,000 lives can be lost?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion and I congratulate Senator Norris, Senator Lee and Senator O'Toole for tabling it.  This is an important motion.  It is easy for Governments to ignore human rights difficulties across the world.  Due to economic interests, it is also easy for Governments to ignore and in some cases justify actions which occur.</P>
      <P>The situation in East Timor is totally unacceptable.  While appreciating that East Timor was once a Portuguese colony and that Portugal had a vested interest in it at one stage, we must recognise that Portugal's interest still exists. While everybody seems to accept that Portugal is working in the best interests of the people of East Timor, we must remember that any country which had a former colony will always have an underlying interest in that country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ongoing level of persecution and killing in East Timor is appalling.  It appears that the Indonesian military authorities are concentrating specifically on young men, given the recent killing of six young men.  The authorities first <Col N="675" /> tried to justify this by saying that they were militants but it subsequently emerged that they were ordinary civilians. This is totally unacceptable, and this matter should be properly and fully investigated.</P>
    <P>There is also a suspicion that the authorities are orchestrating planned population control and that certain types of chemicals are being given to people to ensure that they are sterilised. This matter should be properly and fully examined by the UN and the EU also has a role to play in this regard.  Allegations have been made in relation to forced labour on two other islands. People are being forced into slave labour. Last week Senator Maloney brought a soft toy into the House which was made in Indonesia and was being sold in Dublin Airport.  I was in Dublin Airport last Friday and I thought after Senator Maloney raised the issue the toy would be removed by Aer Rianta from their duty-free shop but it was not. The Minister should raise this matter with Aer Rianta.  A minor action like that would be a statement of condemnation of what is happening East Timor.</P>
    <P>We have had unsatisfactory reports about the Dili massacre and this matter should be investigated further.  There is also a hesitancy in relation to the involvement of Australia in East Timor. I welcome the Minister's statement which gives an up to date situation on what has been happening.  He said we should welcome the change of heart by the Australians that was evident in Minister Evans' recent statement about the need for reconciliation, the reduction of Indonesian armed forces on the island and the recognition by the Indonesian authorities of the special cultural and religious situation of the East Timorese people.  It is very easy for a Minister from Australia to say that while, at the same time Australian interests are carrying out exploratory offshore work in East Timor on the lucrative resources to be found there. There is a case before the European Court of Justice at the moment in <Col N="676" /> relation to this matter.  It is fine for an Australian Minister to make a pious statement while exploratory work is being done on the natural resources of East Timor.  That has to be condemned.</P>
    <P>One cannot justify, under any circumstances, exploitation and abuse of people for economic interest.  Unfortunately that continually happens and loss of life is being ignored because a variety of states have economic interests.  This issue arises in relation to the position of fellow EU member states, such as France and England, who are exporting arms and helicopter missiles to Indonesia which are being used in East Timor. There is a responsibility on Ireland, as a member state of the EU, to raise this matter with these member states because these armaments and missiles are being used to commit atrocities against the people of East Timor.  It is a total violation of basic human rights and is something that Ireland cannot stand over.  We have a moral obligation to ensure that these matters are raised at EU level and that fellow member states, who are contributing indirectly to the situation, should be asked to cease supplying arms to these countries.</P>
    <P>Another issue which arises is the prevention of reporters and journalists from entering East Timor.  We have evidence of this because Irish journalists were refused admittance.  That is unacceptable.  There is a deliberate attempt to prevent the real story reaching the outside world; that is not good. We should ask ourselves a number of questions in relation to our position and what we can do.  We have repeatedly stated that we will assist Portugal in ensuring that everything possible will be done to ensure that something constructive emerges from the discussions and negotiations taking place.  How actively we are involving ourselves with this process? Is there a more active role for Ireland to be involved with the Portuguese and Indonesians to protect the people of East Timor?  Is the process of current bilateral negotiations between the Portuguese and Indonesians adequate?  Is there a role for Ireland to <Col N="677" /> bring about an improved situation for the East Timorese people?  These are the questions we should ask.  The question of sanctions against Indonesia should also be examined.  Has there been any consideration given to introducing sanctions against Indonesia?  Will the Department of Foreign Affairs examine this matter? Will this matter be raised at EU level or has it been considered at any level?</P>
    <P>In conclusion, we know that great demands are being made on United Nations resources and the difficulties, strains and stresses that the UN are currently experiencing, but is there a role for United Nations in East Timor?  Traditionally the United Nations did not get involved unless a war existed between two states, but recently in Somalia and Rwanda the United Nations became involved because of human rights violations.  Is there now a case for the United Nations to become involved in East Timor?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. May I say how glad I am that Mr. Tom Hyland, who has put so much work into the East Timor campaign, and a member of the Portuguese Ambassador's staff are here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The urgency of action on East Timor cannot be stressed too much.  I am a member of Amnesty International and only yesterday we received another urgent action appeal from them regarding fear of torture and arbitrary detention of up to 30 pro-independence supporters detained in Dili and Liquiza, East Timor.  Amnesty International fears for the safety of the 30 East Timorese, including several civil servants who were arrested by the Indonesian Army. They fear for their safety &ldquo;in view of recent reports of torture of detainees held in military and police custody.  The organisation is also concerned that some may be being held solely for their peaceful opposition to Indonesian rule in East Timor.&rdquo;  The fact that they are &ldquo;being held solely for their peaceful opposition to Indonesian rule in East Timor&rdquo; is very important because it <Col N="678" /> shows how inequitous the situation is there.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed with the Minister's speech.  We have had another debate on foreign affairs in which no attempt has been made to explain why we have not ratified all the international instruments for human rights.  For example, we have not yet ratified the 1977 Protocols to the Geneva Convention.  I raised this matter about two years ago on an Adjournment debate and I was told that legislation takes time.  This has taken 18 years.  I think the British are close to ratifying it. With Turkey, we will be the only country in the western world not to have ratified these conventions.  I realise that we have signed them but ratification is very important from an international point of view, especially when situations such as this arise, where a civilian population is being used as part of a war that Indonesia is waging against East Timor.  I would like an explanation why this is happening.</P>
    <P>The call from Amnesty International is to investigate what has happened to these detainees &mdash; who, far too often, do not reappear &mdash; and they have suggested that we ask for international and domestic human rights monitors.  I realise that the International Committee of the Red Cross &mdash; I am also a member of the Red Cross, I had better declare all interests &mdash; do have access to some detainees, but despite this access, there are still serious allegations of torture. The International Red Cross has to be extremely careful in its reporting. If they are alarmed about the situation it must be very serious.</P>
    <P>The fact that the detainees do not have access to their families and to lawyers of their own choice shows how serious and regrettable the situation is. As many Senators said, the fact that international and domestic journalists cannot gain access to East Timor means that we have very little knowledge of what is happening there.  We should stress the fact that foreign journalists should be given permission to travel there.  If there is no problem, why can <Col N="679" /> they not go there?  The United Nations Commission on Human Rights had stressed its concern about the lack of access for foreign journalists.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about lobbying various Governments.  I have been to Indonesia and, apart from trade connections, we do not have much to do with it so we are in a weaker position as regards lobbying there.  However, we should be able to do something in Australia because of our extremely strong connections there.  We should wait for the St. Patrick's Day Parade there and make an announcement on the subject. This might be a good idea for whichever Minister is going there;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Fat chance, unfortunately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and perhaps it could be written at the end of the Minister's speech, if this has not already been done.</P>
      <P>I am extremely glad to see from the Minister's speech that we are continuing to support the Portuguese in their efforts to find a solution to the East Timor problem.  In the past the Portuguese put forward the possibility of a referendum. Holding a referendum is only a basic right that the East Timorese people deserve.  We should support the Portuguese on this.  We should back whatever Portugal thinks is the best move because it is more familiar with the situation than we are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is sad to see that many areas in the Far East are suffering human rights problems.  I have been involved with the situation on the Thai-Burma Border.  I am sure all of us admire Amg San Su Kyee and what she has been trying to do for her people in Burma.  I admire the medical aid workers from Ireland and elsewhere who have done so much for the refugees on the Thai-Burma Border.  Thailand is now a great tourist destination for Irish people and it would do no harm if, as I have done, we were to write to the Thai authorities and tell them that we are taking a close interest <Col N="680" /> on what is happening on their border. They are the only people who will apparently give any help to the minorities, such as the Karen, Mon, Karenni, Burman and Tavoyan, who are living in settlements along that border.</P>
    <P>We have more influence than we think in some areas.  As I said, Indonesia is not one of our strongest areas of influence, apart from the trade point of view, but we do have a strong tourist influence in Thailand.  As a small independent nation, it is most important that we show our support both for the East Timorese and the Portuguese who are trying to solve the problem there.</P>
    <P>Today is International Women's Day and Amnesty International has been focusing to methods of protect women's human rights in East Timor.  To date, there has not been a great upsurge in aggression against women there, but for the men taken, detained, tortured, killed and who will never come back, there are wives, sisters, mothers, daughters and families who are denied a normal life.</P>
    <P>I commend the Department of Foreign Affairs for its interest in this area but I urge it to do more, even in the area of reproaches if necessary, to the Australian Government on this serious situation, in which Senator Norris and Senator O'Toole have taken such an interest over the last few years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House &mdash; I have not had the opportunity to welcome him before &mdash; and I wish him well in his new portfolio.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted that we have this opportunity to address the situation in East Timor.  This matter has been brought up today by Senator Norris who has worked extremely hard to see that it is kept to the forefront and I commend him for doing so.  I also commend the work of Tom Hyland from the East Timor Island Solidarity Campaign, who is in the Public Gallery.  I listened to an address from Mr. Hyland in a recent meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  I do not have to outline again the atrocities that are <Col N="681" /> being carried out against the East Timorese people.  He expanded on it extremely well, as did Senator Norris and others tonight.</P>
    <P>John Pilger's programme, which I watched on television recently, showed the abuses of human rights in East Timor.  The torture and ill treatment by the Indonesian forces involved against the people of this small country has to stand out as one of the most cowardly acts and horrible atrocities ever carried out against any people.  There is a deep feeling in this country &mdash; we have seen enough denial of human rights here over the last 70 years &mdash; that the people of East Timor have been subject to human rights abuses and injustices on a scale similar to that carried out by the Nazis in Germany during the Second World War.  We have always shown concern for abuses committed against people in other countries &mdash; Somalia, Cambodia and now East Timor &mdash; and we have to work at all times to see that this issue is kept to the forefront and that these people are not forgotten.  We saw what happened in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda.  These areas are also of major concern to us and our record is excellent as far as the help we have given to these people is concerned.</P>
    <P>In a recent statement by the multiparty East Timorese delegation to the 51st Session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, it expressed its deep appreciation to the delegation from the Republic of Ireland for its firm stand in the EU and the UN in support of the legitimate rights of the East Timorese people.  This is another indication of how the people of East Timor appreciate the efforts that have been made by a small country to support their cause.  Anyone who watched John Pilger's film would have to commend him for his courage and the work he did against the expressed wishes of the authorities in East Timor.  To do what he did and to bring that film to the world showing the atrocities that are being carried out there has to be commended.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="682" /> Indonesia invaded East Timor in December 1975.  It has been estimated that almost one third of the population of that country have died from the hostilities, starvation and disease stemming from the conflict.  The plight of the people of East Timor was shown to all the world in November 1991 when the Indonesian security forces opened fire on demonstrators in Dili and an estimated 200-300 people were killed.  Some 200 people disappeared after the massacre and they have not yet been accounted for.</P>
    <P>Even after all these abuses and the pressure that has been brought to bear on the Indonesian Government, nothing has been done to see that human rights abuses are stopped.  The killing continues. How the Indonesian Government can close its eyes to what the world is watching is unbelievable.</P>
    <P>Thankfully, we do not have any major trading ties with Indonesia.  I raised in the Seanad last week the fact that Aer Lingus is carrying on its duty free listings a small toy made in Indonesia.  I hope the Minister takes this on board and will ensure that Aer Lingus stops carrying any products made in Indonesia. It may only have been a toy, but it was made in Indonesia and showed that we were supporting its trade.  We will have to stamp that out and not give Indonesia any support whatsoever.</P>
    <P>Talks are ongoing between the Foreign Ministers of Portugal and Indonesia under the auspices of the UN Secretary General and one can only hope and be encouraged that these talks will continue.  The UN Secretary General has committed himself to monitoring the human rights situation in East Timor and the UN special representative visited Portugal and Indonesia in January of this year in preparation for the next round of talks.  These talks are to be welcomed and, hopefully, the ongoing mediation will bear fruit.</P>
    <P>We must congratulate our Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, for the excellent work he and members of the Irish Government have done since they were <Col N="683" /> appointed and the fact that every opportunity has been taken to bring the problems of East Timor on to the world stage.  This has obviously been welcomed by the East Timor delegation to the UN.</P>
    <P>As a small country, what can we do? We must question the role of the Australian Government.  It is obvious, from John Pilger's programme &ldquo;Death of a Nation&rdquo;, that the Australians have a major role to play.  The present indications would be that it is putting matters of economic concern ahead of those of human concern.</P>
    <P>Millions of dollars worth of oil is to be found in the shores off East Timor and it is obvious from speaking to any Australian politician that they are embarrassed by the situation there but are unable to do anything about it. Regardless of what party people support in Australia, they seem inept at doing something about it.  I find that very disappointing.  The programme also stated that the Australians have helped to train some of Indonesia's armed forces. If this is true, it is terrible indictment of the Australian people.  It was mentioned that some Ministers will be going to Australia for St. Patrick's Day. If this is so, they should let the Australians know that we do not agree with what they are doing in relation to East Timor.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to highlight at every opportunity the depth of feeling in this country about this issue.  We must use our position as a member of the UN to highlight and object to the atrocities being carried out there.  We must pay tribute to Senator Norris on the way he has pursued this issue.  He has raised it at every opportunity in this House.  We are all aware of his concern and interest. I welcome his input and that of the Senators who raised this motion &mdash; Senator O'Toole, Senator Henry and Senator Lee &mdash; and their concern for the people of East Timor.  We must do everything we can to ensure that the killing, the mass murder, which is being carried out in this small country by <Col N="684" /> Indonesia, with the support of other countries, stops immediately.  We must do what we can at EU and UN level to ensure this situation is ended as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I strongly support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>As a patron of the East Timor Ireland Solidarity Campaign, it gives me pleasure to speak on this motion.  It is a timely motion because we have just had, through the energies of Tom Hyland, the East Timor Ireland Solidarity Campaign and the generousity of a number of firms in the advertising industry, a successful poster campaign which raised public consciousness, particularly in the Dublin region.  The reality is that a horror is being played out in East Timor &mdash; a horror which the majority of the world which considers itself civilised is prepared to ignore.  Evidence of an atrocity on an unthinkable scale is mounting daily.</P>
      <P>Since we last discussed this issue in the Seanad, we have received the special report issued by the UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, Mr. Ndiaye, which makes frightening reading.  <i>Maubere</i> the journal of the East Timor Ireland Solidarity Campaign summarises an extract of Mr. Ndiaye's report this month.  He places the massacre in Santa Cruz in the context of the overall slaughter of the East Timorese people which has taken place for 20 years.  One-third of the population has disappeared; over 200,000 people have either died or disappeared in this small remote speck on the far side of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With each human life that is extinguished, we are all diminished.  It is time we realised that we have a responsibility to do something more than talking.  The UN &mdash; I would not be one to praise its efforts in this regard &mdash; has been involved in diplomacy but it has not become involved in effective action.  Mr. Ndiaye's report points out the determination of the Indonesian Government to quell anything which approaches opposition to its iron fist dictatorial regime.  He speaks about the conditions <Col N="685" /> which allowed the Santa Cruz killings to occur still being present and the members of the security forces who were responsible for the abuses not being held responsible.  He talks about scapegoatism in a report produced by the Indonesian authorities.</P>
    <P>We all know the infamous day when we saw on our television screens 200 East Timorese slaughtered in the graveyard when they went to commemorate Sebastiao Gomes and protest against the illegal Indonesian regime.  Mr. Ndiaye's report, however, produces a new horror which has only been hinted at up to this &mdash; the slaughter of those who were wounded that day.  They were taken on trucks to an Indonesian military hospital and were killed on the way. Some were brought to the morgue of that hospital but they had not been dispatched to meet their maker on the way so they were dispatched there.  This report must touch everybody's humanity because something equal to the Holocaust is taking place in a small remote gentle island and we are doing nothing about it.</P>
    <P>I do not share the view of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, that the Australian Foreign Minister, Mr. Gareth Evans&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;can be regarded as in any way praiseworthy.  It pains me to make these points about the Australian people and Government because I share the general sympathy of the people for Australians, but I also share something else.  My grandfather was Australian, is buried there and was involved in political movements and in the trade unions movement there.  When Mr. Keating visited the other House, it pained me to stay away as a mark of my protest against what is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cynicism of the Australian regime is absolute.  While Mr. Gareth Evans is tut-tutting at Soeharto and his dictators, the Australian Government currently provides Aus$100 million of <Col N="686" /> arms, mainly personal weapons, to the Soeharto regime which will be used to slaughter the East Timorese.</P>
    <P>I was surprised when a Senator who should know better said that there were no particular issues of women's concerns, particularly on International Women's Day.  There was mass rape of the East Timorese women whose husbands and sons had already been slaughtered.  There is evidence of an ongoing genocidal campaign of sterilisation against the East Timorese people. This is on a par with anything done in the horror camps in Nazi Germany, yet at the latter end of the 20th century going into the new millennium, we are tolerating this horror or abomination by our silence.</P>
    <P>No Minister should go to Australia to celebrate St. Patrick's Day.  We should boycott those celebrations and make it clear to the Australian Government that we do not want to participate in any celebration in that land.  The Australians are fine people with civilised standards, but in this regard every standard of civilised behaviour has been traded for a barrel of oil.  They do not give a damn about the slaughter of a small nation, a defenceless people.  The Australians could also look at Papua New Guinea where there is nothing of which they can be proud.</P>
    <P>We have a role to play and it is important that we are vigilant.  Although we may be a small and insignificant island people, we must not underplay the fact that we have a voice on the international stage and we should not be shy to make it heard.  Even as we speak, there is evidence of preparation for a new massacre in East Timor.  Journalists and foreigners are being excluded, and that has happened in the past.  We should protest if Irish journalists or those who represent an Irish newspaper are excluded.  We can protest when we go to the shop to buy Nike or Reebok shoes which are made in Indonesia. They come to our land soiled with the blood of these people.</P>
    <P>I compliment my Independent colleagues for raising this issue, which <Col N="687" /> should be kept on the Order Paper.  I will also raise another issue relating to human rights.  I congratulate the Minister for Foreign Affairs for saying that we will take a more vigilant view of human rights issues.  I have argued for that for years.  In 1978 I had the honour of being the only Irish person &mdash; I believe I still am &mdash; to win a human rights fellowship from the UN.  I had the honour to be a human rights fellow for one year and to work in that regard.  I have always believed that as a small nation we could make a massive contribution in the human rights field.  We have no colonial past to sully us; we share the colonial experience of others, and we are a people interested in the rights of all human beings, and in particular, in the rights of small nations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity East Timor has few natural resources and little strategic value.  If it had the international community would have acted long ago. Yet the UN has so far passed ten resolutions condemning the Indonesian invasion of East Timor and the regularly reported atrocities.  These resolutions have encountered only massive apathy among the international community with a few honourable exceptions, Ireland among them.</P>
      <P>The Indonesians continue their outrages against the East Timorese secure in the knowledge that they will face few sanctions.  Four days ago up to 30 East Timorese were arrested by the Indonesian Army.  No reason for their arrest has been given and their present whereabouts are unknown.  This is the latest of a series of human rights violations perpetrated by the Indonesian authorities since their occupation of East Timor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, we do not know the precise extent of the abuses taking place in East Timor as information is difficult to obtain in a closed society.  We know, however, that detention without trial, torture, disappearances and extrajudicial executions are commonplace in Indonesia.  We know, for example, that <Col N="688" /> Jose Antonio Belo was arrested following a peaceful demonstration, was beaten to the point of losing consciousness, was tied up and hung upside down like a trussed turkey.  He was then taken down and beaten again.</P>
    <P>Jose Antonio Belo and others, whose names we know, stand as a symbol for the silent suffering of the East Timorese. Most of the victims of Indonesian repression are anonymous; simple statistics in the lists maintained &mdash; with great difficulty &mdash; by organisations such as Amnesty International and the International Red Cross.</P>
    <P>Indonesia regularly attempts to justify its repression by citing &ldquo;armed resistance&rdquo; in various parts of Indonesia.  It is, therefore, ironic that Indonesia's own Commission on Human Rights has pointed out that there has been no armed resistance in Liquiza for ten years, yet arrests continue there. Indonesia will continue flouting UN resolutions until the international community decides to take a firm stand.  The time has come to substitute action for words.</P>
    <P>I urge the Government &mdash; and I know the Minister of State, Deputy Durkan will be serious about this &mdash; to continue its support of the East Timorese people and to lobby at international fora, such as the United Nations and the EU, for stiff international trade sanctions against Indonesia.  We must also make our position clear to countries, such as Australia, which, despite words of protest, continue to maintain close links with the Indonesian regime.</P>
    <P>Fifty years after the liberation of Auschwitz East Timor is yet another reminder that nations and communities continue to be subjected to persecution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the chance to speak on this matter.  It is important to register our abhorrence at what is happening in East Timor and to ensure the Government does everything possible at international level to prevent the ongoing human tragedy that is East Timor.  I commend Senator Norris on this motion and for the work he has <Col N="689" /> done on this issue.  I also commend the East Timor Solidarity Campaign which has kept the issue to the forefront of public opinion, and on a wider international level to commend the East Timor Action Network.</P>
      <P>I was fortunate enough to go to the United Nations and meet the Secretary General with an interparliamentary group from several national Parliaments. We were received graciously; we were listened to attentively; the Secretary General had a genuine desire to assist, but it is evident that neither he nor the UN had the support of the international community to act effectively. Without that support it is difficult to achieve anything.</P>
      <P>We have verified, to the extent that verification is possible or required, what the extent of the human rights abuses have been in East Timor.  I will not go back over the figures which have been discussed at length in the House with regard to one-third of the population being liquidated.  On the day we commemorated the 50th Anniversary of the Liberation of Auschwitz I said that what happened in Auschwitz must not happen again, but that it could.  The living proof that it could happen again is East Timor; it is the living proof of the road that leads to Auschwitz.</P>
      <P>People in East Timor who attend funerals are gunned down; people disappear, people are incarcerated just because they are on the &ldquo;wrong side of the street&rdquo;, so to speak.  We find it difficult in a democracy where human rights are safeguarded to understand the degree to which they are ignored by this Administration.  In that context, it is incomprehensible that civilised countries with records in terms of human rights and their defence stand by.  We may ask why they stand by and the simple answer is money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indonesia is a rapidly growing economy and the large trading nations are prepared to sacrifice hundreds of thousands of human lives in the interests of their own economic well being.  It is a purely selfish economic interest.  Arms from the EU are finding their way to <Col N="690" /> Indonesia.  Why is Australia standing idly by?  It has to do with oil.  In each case it comes down to selfish, narrow economic interests.</P>
    <P>Again we come back to making this invidious comparison with what happened in the Holocaust.  We have a capacity to be blind to what everybody knows is going on, purely because it does not serve the countries' narrow self-interests.  That is why it is so essential that Ireland and other small countries continue at every opportunity to highlight what is happening in East Timor, and to impress upon the international community the need to intervene.</P>
    <P>It is a basic human right to have the capacity for self-determination.  Any nation has that basic right but the people of East Timor are denied it. They have expressed their wishes but their wishes have been ignored.  Having met people from East Timor when I was at the UN it struck me what a wonderful people they are.  Perhaps it is their timidity which has cost them so dearly, because it is simply not in their nature to be the aggressors and they have paid the price.  To be fair, Portugal has done what it can to alleviate the situation and it is perhaps somewhat unusual in terms of a former colonial power that it has at least taken on board some of its responsibilities to its former colony, but without the support of the international community Portugal cannot achieve much.</P>
    <P>Bilateralism between Portugal and Indonesia, while it may be desirable, is not adequate.  The East Timor people have a right to be at that table in terms of their self-determination, so we have to ensure that the supply of arms dries up and that the agents of death are not allowed to flourish.  I agree with Senator Sherlock that trade sanctions should be imposed but I get dispirited when I think of the time that has elapsed since this matter first came to the attention of the international community and the lack of action in the meantime.  That is why it is important that groups such as the East Timor Solidarity Campaign <Col N="691" /> and the East Timor Action Network at international level continue to bring whatever pressures they can on Governments such as ours and that they have our support.</P>
    <P>I am sure the motion has the support of everybody in the House but I appeal through you, a Chathaoirligh, to the Minister to convey to the Government and the Minister for Foreign Affairs the need to continually have this matter at the forefront of our foreign affairs agenda; to let it be known that we condemn what has happened there, and that we are determined to do what we, as a small country of some standing on the international stage, can to ensure that the abuses that have happened there are recorded, that no further abuses take place and that the people of East Timor are accorded their basic right to self-determination.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion and congratulate Senator Norris, Senator O'Toole, Senator Henry and Senator Lee in proposing it.  We discussed this on 20 April 1994 and made our feelings known.  We had the opportunity in a debate on foreign affairs last July to do something similar and I am delighted to have this opportunity to once more support the calls for restitution of human rights in East Timor.  It is important that all Parliaments pass resolutions similar to that passed by the Portuguese Parliament and it is important that we have the opportunity to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that we discuss the level of atrocities committed in East Timor.  Until recently there was a conspiracy of silence in the western world in regard to the atrocities committed in that country.  East Timor has endured this suffering despite the brutal killing of one-third of its population.  Men, women and children have been annihilated, and the Tánaiste has referred to this.  We must condemn unreservedly the destruction of the nation and the people of East Timor.  We must condemn the open support for the Indonesian Government by prominent nations <Col N="692" /> which have continued a lucrative trade with Indonesia, including the arms sales to the military by France, as already mentioned by Senator Norris, by the United States and by the United Kingdom in particular.  These are our fellow Europeans, member states of the European Union and we must impress upon them our objection to what they are doing.</P>
    <P>On Mr. John Pilger's programme the attitude of the United States to what was happening in East Timor at the time was clearly seen.  If I remember correctly, Henry Kissinger was on the programme and what he said about this issue was unbelievable.  His statements were absolutely contrary to what was happening there.  It was obvious from the programme what was happening in Indonesia and it was unbelievable that somebody as prominent as Henry Kissinger, for whom I had a high regard, could almost deny openly what was happening in that country.  The Pilger programme was a frightening exposé of how ethnic cleansing at its worst was carried out.</P>
    <P>Although Ireland is a small nation in terms of peace-keeping, we must do everything in our power to stop the slaughter in East Timor.  I agree with Senator Roche that we can play a very strong role in this as an independent nation, as a former colony, and we should use every method at our disposal to stop the atrocities in that country.  We are a prominent member of the United Nations, and we must use our position to highlight and object to what is happening. No solution to the plight of the people of East Timor will be forthcoming until international pressure forces an end to all trading with Indonesia, until full economic sanctions and a total embargo are imposed on Indonesia similar to that imposed on Iraq and in South Africa, as highlighted by Senator Sherlock.</P>
    <P>Imposition of trade sanctions is the only way to stop this atrocity.  Only then will we see an end to the massacre of the peaceful people of East Timor.  Such a cessation of violence seems far away <Col N="693" /> at present.  Australia has provided military training for the Indonesian armed forces and Britain last year sold 40 Hawk military jets to Indonesia.  I note that the Australian Government was arraigned, as Senator Norris said, last February at the International Court of Justice in The Hague for its illegal compliance with the Indonesian Government in its policy of annihilation of the East Timorese people.</P>
    <P>Very little has changed in almost 12 months since we debated this issue last April.  Last April I quoted Amnesty International and it is worth quoting again.  Although it is 12 months out of date it still applies.  Amnesty International said:</P>
    <P>When governments pretend not to notice suffering, to whom can peoples like those in Indonesia and East Timor turn for help?  The United Nations?  Alas, the deeper you delve, the redder the faces.  The cynicism of realpolitik extends even to the UN Commission on Human Rights, of which Indonesia is a member.  When Amnesty attended the Commission... in Geneva [in 1994] to urge action on Indonesia and East Timor we met only embarrassment.  The governments to which we spoke repeated what they had been promising us for 30 years, that they will pursue a policy of quiet diplomacy.  They might as well go fishing.</P>
    <P>That is still true today, despite the statement of the Tánaiste that there is some semblance of movement.  It is not a breakthrough, it is a small semblance of movement towards an involvement of the international community in stopping the atrocities and the annihilation of the East Timorese people.  We must recognise that there is some movement but that is all it is, it is the start of a long road to stopping these atrocities.  That road must be travelled as fast as possible because daily people are suffering and dying and being denied their human rights and the international community must say stop.  Tentative steps are great but we need serious action.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="694" /> Indonesia became a member of the UN Commission on Human Rights in 1991.  As such it bears a special responsibility to implement recommendations enumerated in that body's statements and resolutions, yet with some minor exceptions it has not done so.  The minor exceptions were mentioned by the Tánaiste today.  Indeed, it has indicated that it does not feel bound to abide by the provisions of those resolutions.  If the Government of Indonesia trusts the role of the UN bodies, particularly the UN Commission on Human Rights, to discharge its mandate to promote and protect human rights, it should comply and co-operate fully, not tentatively as it is now, with the suggestions and recommendations of that body.  To do so selectively raises questions about the sincerity of the Indonesian Government and its commitment to those principles and institutions.  That Government has also failed to become a party to the most important international human rights conventions, such as the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatments and Punishments.</P>
    <P>I thank the Tánaiste for coming to the House and for his interest in the issue and I urge him and the Government to continue at every opportunity to ensure that we play our part in ending these atrocities.  I pay special tribute to Tom Hyland and the East Timor Ireland Solidarity Campaign for the excellent work they are doing and for encouraging and prompting us to do what is our duty, which is to call for the end to these atrocities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to express my appreciation to the Seanad for taking this motion so seriously and for providing such an excellent debate.  I understand that this motion will pass unanimously by agreement through this Upper House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer to some of the comments made and ask how pious we can afford to be here.  If we had an arms <Col N="695" /> trade, would we be able to justify ourselves quite as well?  Mention was made of Iraq.  I remember protesting at the sale of beef to the Iraqi tyranny and was told that what I was suggesting might be morally correct but there were economic interests involved.  I challenge the House, the Minister and our civil servants, that if we are as principled as we say and condemn people for their economic self-interest, to what extent are we prepared to prejudice our own potential economic self-interest, even with our friends like the Australians?</P>
    <P>Are we prepared to take up the proposal of Senator Roche that we should look very carefully at the invitations from the Australian Government to attend St. Patrick's Day rallies and marches in the Australian subcontinent? Could that not be used to send a very clear and determined message to the Australian Government and, through it, to the Australian people, on behalf of the people of that country who are not at all happy with the situation in East Timor?  We should not be too comfortable unless we are prepared to risk something ourselves, and I think we should.</P>
    <P>Perhaps this House should consider &mdash; I know this will be done by the East Timor Ireland Solidarity Campaign &mdash; sending the record of this evening's debate to the Australian Parliament, Government and media so that they may see precisely how the Irish people and their representatives feel about the disgraceful attitudes expressed on their behalf by their Foreign Minister, who is a man not very closely connected with veracity.  I know I could not call him a liar, if I could I would but I will phrase it in a diplomatic way.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste's speech was excellent up to the last few pages, when he became polite to the Australians and the Indonesians.  If we are, as everybody has said, dealing with a situation comparable to the Holocaust, why be polite to these people?  Is it not time for an end to politeness?  Mr. Gareth Evans dismissed the Santa Cruz massacre as an <Col N="696" /> administrative error.  This is the language of Hitler and Himmler; it is not civilised discourse.  He spoke of the readiness of Australia to use its special influence.  What special influence do the Australians have?  How did they get it? Are they entitled to it or should they not be covered in shame?  He said they are in a particular situation with regard to East Timor.  They certainly are and that situation is known as a hole.  They are in a hole, morally speaking, and it is up to us to rub their noses in that fact.</P>
    <P>May I suggest a few other concrete things which could be done?  Tributes have been paid to Mr. Tom Hyland who is the driving force behind the East Timor Ireland Solidarity Campaign.  A conference will be held in Portugal, in May to which the Portuguese Government have extended an invitation to me. I hope to travel there as part of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  Can some money be found to sponsor, even in a modest way, a visit by somebody who is our acknowledged expert and who has helped to make us all aware and ensure that the voice of the East Timor Ireland Solidarity Campaign is also heard in Lisbon this spring?  I am sure with the goodwill of the Department of Foreign Affairs this money can be found.</P>
    <P>There are areas where we can affect things.  Tourism is one.  Bali, the island of pleasure and romance, how many Irish people go there for their honeymoon, conferences, business opportunities and holidays?  A cousin of mine working in the Far East visited Bali and I was disgusted with him, but I am glad to say that his brother presented him with John Pilger's book on his return and he now very much regrets that he was insensitive enough to visit that beautiful place.</P>
    <P>I would like to underline what I said earlier about the courage of the Indonesian people because this should not be underestimated.  It is easy for me to come here for a couple of hours, get emotional, stir things up a bit, express noble sentiments and then go to the theatre to see &ldquo;Peter Pan&rdquo;, which is precisely <Col N="697" /> what I intend to do at the end of this debate, but what about the people in Indonesia who had the extraordinary moral courage from inside a dictatorship to criticise and condemn the activities of their own military authorities and expose the lies that are being told? Those are the people, as well as the East Timorese people, who really deserve the highest regard and honour and I hope that by publicising what they have done they will be protected.</P>
    <P>The Indonesian Government is an illegal regime.  It is nothing other than a noxious tyranny, which has exercised its tyranny not only against the people of Papua New Guinea and East Timor but against its own people in the most horrible ways.  We must salute the people in that tragic country who have courageously stood out against their own Government.  I would like to think that we would stand up and be counted but we have not been challenged in this country yet.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to Bishop Belo.  There was an article recently in <i>Time</i> magazine which was quite disgraceful. The Indonesian Government bought about 20 pages of advertisements. Shortly after that an article loaded in favour of the Indonesian regime in East Timor was carried and it quoted Bishop Belo.  I wrote to the magazine &mdash; I am glad to say it published the letter &mdash; and quoted what Bishop Belo said.  He said &ldquo;they [that is Western Governments] are lying about what is happening to us.  Their lies and hypocrisy are in the cause of economic interest.  We ask the people of the world to understand this and not to forget that we are here struggling for life every day&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that we have this debate in this House.  I have in my hand a document that Mr. Brendan Ryan and myself dug out of the archives; it is about 15 years old.  It was the statement of our President, then a Senator, shortly after the invasion of East Timor.  At least in this House we can say without too much pious self-congratulation that we have on an all party basis stood up for a small defenceless people whose <Col N="698" /> civil and human rights are being mercilessly trampled on.</P>

      <P>Ar an gcéad dul síos, ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire agus buíochas a ghabháil léi as ucht plé leis an díospóireacht atrátha seo í féin. Táim thar a bheith buíoch di.  Tá an t-ábhar seo idir lámha agam féin agus ag an Seanadóir Fitzgerald mar gheall ar go mbaineann sé le Daingean Uí Chúis, ár bparóiste féin.  Is iad atá i gceist againn anseo ná traidisiún na Gaeilge agus cultúr na tíre.  Dár linne, is scannalach an rud é go bhfuil sé ar intinn anois an scoil seo a dhúnadh.  Tá Coláiste Íde ar an Daingean níos faide ama ná mar atá cuimhne agamsa air.  I cannot remember how long it was there or when it was established.  Ag éirí aníos dúinne, ba chuid de shaol an Daingin agus saol an pharóiste Coláiste Íde.  Níos mó ná aon rud eile, bhí an-bhaint aige le múinteoirí na tíre seo.  Bheadh a fhios ag an Aire féin go ndeachaigh a lán de na cailíní a d'fhág Coláiste Ide isteach sa bhunmhúinteoireacht go mórmhór. Chuaigh a lán de mo chlann go dtí an coláiste seo.  In a lán slite.  ó thaobh bhunoideachas na tíre seo de.  d'fhéadfá a rá le fírinne gurb é Coláiste Íde foinse na Gaeilge dóibh siúd a chuaigh isteach sna coláistí oiliúna agus astu sin amach <Col N="699" /> go dtí na scoileanna.  Is ó na múinteoirí sin a d'fhoghlaim aos óg na tíre seo a lán dá gcuid Gaeilge.  Mar gheall air sin, is feall é anois nach bhfuil aon todhchaí ag an scoil seo.  Cuireann sé sin isteach go mór ormsa agus cuireann sé isteach go mór ar muintir na h-áite.  Is deacair do dhaoine nach ón áit iad tuiscint a bheith acu ar an suíomh aláinn atá ag an gcoláiste seo: tá sé ar imeall Chuan an Daingin.  Is scoil í a bhfuil clú agus cáil uirthi leis na cianta.  An rud a ritheann trí mo aigne &mdash; agus is cuimhin leis an Aire é &mdash; ná an deacracht a bhí agamsa le mná rialta an bhliain seo caite thall i Milltown nuair a chuadar chun scoil agus suíomh a dhíol agus fuaireadar na milliúin punt.</P>
      <P>Coláiste Íde is situated on the edge of Dingle harbour looking across to the town.  This extraordinary, beautiful location was chosen by Lord Ventry as his family home.  It is an ideal location for some sort of commercial enterprise and I am worried about that.  I suppose I can say things other people cannot.</P>
      <P>I am unhappy and disappointed that the order of nuns was not prepared to keep faith with the local people.  They had an agreement with the local people, Cáirde Coláiste Íde, who wished to take over the running of the school.  They are prepared to do for the school what another local community did for Tourmakeady College.  Incidentally the O'Toole side of my family are very much part and parcel of that project in Tourmakeady, County Mayo, and were involved in taking over the college which is now being run successfully.  We believe this can also be done in Coláiste Íde.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise this topic is coming on the Minister suddenly and neither myself nor Senator Fitzgerald expect her to have an answer to it tonight.  We ask her to take a personal interest in it, to intervene and try to make budget support available for the continuation of what is, as far as I know, the only all Irish girls boarding school in the State.  It is an important part of our tradition and we should protect it.  I know the Minister <Col N="700" /> has an interest in Gaeilge and she has always been supportive of such initiatives. It is something special and precious.</P>
    <P>In a lán slite d'fhéadfadh an scoil seo bheith ina sheoid do mhúineadh trí Ghaeilge ar an oileán ar fad.  Ba mhaith liom dá gcuirfeadh an tAire áirgead ar fáil do Cháirde Choláiste Íde.  This would enable them to take over the running of the school and continue the proud traditions that have looked after generations of primary school teachers and their children.  I know children from Dublin who went down there and loved the location and the place.  There will be many tears shed if this is not continued. I ask the Minister, on my own behalf and on behalf of the people of Dingle and Cáirde Coláiste Íde, to intervene.</P>

      <P>Ar dtús, ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Aire ós rud go bhfuil sí anseo í féin chun an rún seo a phlé.  Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an Seanadóir O'Toole as ucht cuid dá am a thabhairt dom chun mo chás a chur in iúl: chun Coláiste Íde a choimeád ar oscailt agus, b'fhéidir, airgead a fháil chun é a choimeád ar oscailt.  Ba mhaith liom a rá freisin go bhfuilim in aon ghuth leis an Seanadóir O'Toole mar gheall ar Choláiste Íde.  Gach rud atá ráite aige mar gheall ar Choláiste Íde, aontaím leis.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming here in person to hear what we have to say. I agree with Senator O'Toole's comments. I do not expect a full answer from the Minister tonight.  As we speak, a public meeting is being held in the Hillgrove Hotel in Dingle about the closure of Coláiste Íde.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In October 1993 the Superior General announced that Coláiste Íde would close in July 1996.  Last November at the annual general meeting of the parents and friends of Coláiste Íde an <i>ad hoc</i> committee of 12 people was established to try to keep the school open.  Something had to be done to maintain continuity so that those who registered in 1995 could complete their school term to 1997.  This committee was met with <Col N="701" /> open arms by the Superior General of the Mercy Convent who seemed open to its suggestions.  She encouraged the people in their work and she advised them on obtaining a manager to run the school.</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago they held another meeting after discussions with the Department of Education.  They have the full support of Roinn na Gaeltachta, Údarás na Gaeltachta, the local canon in Dingle, An tAthar Ó Fiannachta, who is a great Gaelgeoir and a former Dean of Maynooth College.  Last week they were devastated when they were told that their proposal was no good and that the school would close in 1996. Senator O'Toole, like myself, was born and reared in Dingle for many years.  He knows that this school is part of the Dingle Peninsula and of the Gaeltacht. Girls from all over Ireland got a good education there because it was an extremely good college.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to intervene and perhaps meet the <i>ad hoc</i> committee to discuss its views and proposals because it would be a shame if the college closed.  I know it is difficult for the Minister to make a decision about this matter now, but decisions must be made in the next two or three months in the interests of continuity.  No one will check into a boarding school at the end of 1995 if they will only be there for a year because they will want to finish their education.</P>
    <P>Arís gabhaim buíochas leis an Aire tar éis di teacht chun éisteacht linne anocht.  We do not expect a quick answer, but we would like a long term solution.</P>

    <P>This is an institution owned and managed by the Mercy Order of Nuns.  In 1990 the Mercy Order took the decision to withdraw at the end of 1995-96 and it cited a shortage of religious personnel as the reason for this decision.  At that <Col N="702" /> stage the Mercy nuns had hoped and had indicated to people that they expected this school to continue in operation after 1996, under a different management. However, in 1993 the Order informed the Department that, despite protracted discussions with different groups regarding a future alternative management structure, no satisfactory proposal had been received.  Accordingly, the Mercy Order announced that it had decided to close the school in 1996.</P>
    <P>In late 1993 Cáirde Choláiste Íde was formed by parents of pupils in the school with the aim of keeping the school open after 1996.  Officials of the Department met with a deputation representing the group in March 1994.  The Department's position was set out at the meeting; the Minister and the Department had to be satisfied as to the suitability of any arrangements made for the management of the school following the withdrawal of the Mercy Order from trusteeship and management.  Accordingly, it would be necessary to submit to the Department detailed proposals dealing with such matters as accommodation, management and future development.  Given the unique position of Coláiste Íde as the only all-Irish boarding school for girls remaining in the State, it was indicated to the group that any such proposals would be given detailed consideration.  However, it was also stressed to the group that, as owners of the school, the Mercy Order's agreement to any such proposals would have to be secured.  In the event that management and ownership of the school did satisfactorily transfer to a new body, it would, of course, become eligible to receive the normal grant aid available from the Department for recognised secondary schools.</P>
    <P>No detailed proposals have been submitted to the Department to date. However, I understand that Cáirde Choláiste Íde did submit proposals to the Mercy Order regarding the future running of the school.  The Order has now informed the Department that it does not consider these proposals to be <Col N="703" /> feasible and that it is proceeding with its original decision to close the school in 1996.  As Coláiste Íde is a voluntary secondary school, that decision is primarily a matter for the owners, the Mercy Order.</P>
    <P>While the proposed closure of Coláiste Íde is regrettable, I would point out that school-going children in the Dingle area would not be inconvenienced in that event.  They are catered for at <Col N="704" /> present in two all-Irish post-primary schools in Dingle, the Christian Brothers school for boys and the Presentation secondary school for girls.  These two schools are shortly to amalgamate into a co-educational secondary school once a new school building is provided, the planning of which is now under way.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 9 March 1995.</P>
