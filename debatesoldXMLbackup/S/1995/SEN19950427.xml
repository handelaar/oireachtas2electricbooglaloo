      <P>I have received notice from Senator Henry that on the Adjournment of the House today she wishes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>In view of the importance of all efforts towards peace and reconciliation on this island, the need for the Minister for Education to give financial support to the Irish School of Ecumenics which, in this its 25th anniversary year, is in serious financial difficulties.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>I had expected that the Leader of the House would have risked <Col N="102" /> being slightly out of order today by referring to last night's very exciting game and Ireland's great victory.  I was hoping to concur with the Leader's remarks in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  What are the Leader's proposals for the debate on the recently published White Paper on education?  I suggest that this debate be spread over a number of sitting days.  I do so because I understand that many schools and boards of management have still not received copies of the White Paper and have not had an opportunity to consider its contents.  It is important that our debate in this House should reflect the views of those interests. Finally, would the Leader consider making time available to discuss the purge which appears to have been initiated against members of the Fianna Fáil Party who serve on State boards?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very relevant, a Leas-Chathaoirligh.  I know for many years the two members who have most recently been asked to resign from a semi-State body and they are people of the highest integrity.  I would not like to think that in this country we have our own form of ethnic cleansing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Senator will find some more appropriate way to raise that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but perhaps the Leader might make provision to have a debate on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I concur with the two items raised by the acting leader of the Opposition, particularly regarding <Col N="103" /> the White Paper on education.  It is very difficult to have the debate at the moment when those involved in education do not have widespread access to the White Paper.  It has not yet been sent to schools.  The Leader of the House has given me a commitment that he will have a debate on this and that should be done over the next couple of weeks.  I think the Minister would welcome such a debate as well.  There are important reasons why what is good in that paper should be underlined and emphasised, particularly at a time when there are public differences among the educational partners about aspects of policy.  It is important that a consensus would develop on those issues on which we are all agreed.</P>
      <P>I want to raise another issue which I am sure will be interpreted as being in some way party political.  I ask people to give some consideration to the fact that over the last seven years in this House I have consistently opposed legislation which debarred elected public representatives from holding office or sitting on boards.  It has nothing to do with the membership of a particular party.  I appeal to my colleagues on the far side of the House on the Government benches to reject, question and challenge every proposal which seems to give public credence to the idea that public representatives&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I am putting it and I do not wish this to be seen in any way as party political.  Were it proposed in legislation by any political party I would take precisely the same line.  If these issues are not questioned, it does not help us in attempting to give public credence to the importance of participating in political life.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a need for a debate on the involvement of people in public representation at local and national level.  There is potential loss for us all if people who are successful in business or aspects of public life are debarred from participation in public boards.  I do not agree with the comments made by the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on the radio this morning that it should be in the gift of Ministers to look after their friends.  This is not my point, but I am seriously concerned about this matter.  I have repeatedly made the point about the general impression which is given of public representatives.</P>

      <P>I stated previously in the House that I do not think two from a total of 100 post primary pupils would opt for politics or public representation as an occupation in life.  I said this two years ago and it caused much annoyance to Members on both sides of the House. I do not want to subscribe to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>On a number of occasions I have endeavoured to raise the situation at Shannon Aerospace and to get some indication as to whether the Minister will make a statement in the House in that regard.  The Leas-Chathaoirleach is aware that there is much uncertainty regarding the future of Shannon Aerospace. There is still a necessity to restore <Col N="105" /> confidence in the workforce and the region regarding the future prospects of the industry.  There are still some doubts, even though the Government has agreed to make a substantial investment in the project.</P>

      <P>There are still some doubts in relation to the commitment of Lufthansa and Swissair to the establishment and maintenance of additional work there.  Could the Leader give some indication as to whether the Minister will make a statement in the House?  I also ask the Leader to obtain copies of the business plan.  This is the formula which has been supported to the tune of £12 million by the Shannon development agency.  We have not been in a position to examine the plan, which forms the basis of the new arrangement.</P>

      <P>I support the case made by Senator Mullooly regarding the removal of people from State boards.  It is most appropriate to raise this matter in the House because we must be very conscious of our electorate, to whom we have a responsibility. If our electorate is to be treated in this manner, it is our duty and responsibility&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader when the remaining Stages of the Civil Legal Aid Bill will be taken?  I was quite surprised to read in the newspapers last Tuesday <Col N="107" /> about appointments which had been made by the Minister to the board, given that the main amendments put down by Opposition parties to the Bill dealt with the composition of the board. It would have been more in order if the Minister had waited until the Bill had been passed by both Houses before making appointments.  I understand he made seven appointments last Monday, which took me by surprise.</P>

      <P>I wish to agree with my two colleagues in relation to a debate on the White Paper.  This matter is timely and it is a pity that copies are not available to all interested groups. Many interesting topics are covered by the paper, which will provoke interesting discussion.  It is an appropriate time to deal with this matter, given that it is before the end of the academic year.  This issue should be debated in the next couple of weeks.</P>
      <P>I also agree with my colleagues in relation to the removal of two fine people from semi-State bodies.  What is the criteria for appointments?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to guarantee that the promise given by the Minister during the discussion on the Arterial Drainage Bill, which was introduced by Senator Daly recently, will be met.  At that time the Minister gave two deadlines, one of which was the end of April for the publication of the Government's new Arterial Drainage Bill.  The <Col N="108" /> other was the promise that the Bill would be introduced in the Seanad before the end of May.  I wish to remind the Leader that both of those deadlines are approaching.  We wish to ensure that both will be met.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader make time available to discuss the section 19 report on the affairs of Clonmannon and associated companies?  This matter has been discussed four times in the House and Seanad Éireann is responsible for bringing this issue to the attention of the people.  I am personally disappointed by the Pontius Pilate type response from the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.  He has washed his hands of the affairs of Clonmannon by passing the buck to someone else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the interests of the Seanad, could the Leader arrange to have the report, which was produced and circulated last week by the Department, circulated to Senators?  Perhaps a debate on this issue could then be arranged.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to refer to a fine speech made in this House many years ago by the late John Kelly on the issue of appointments to the boards of State bodies.  He made the very wise point that it would be reprehensible to exclude people from State boards simply on the basis of their suspected or real political leanings.  Could a debate be arranged on the whole principle of excluding public representatives simply because they are public representatives? I wholeheartedly concur with the point made by Senator O'Toole.  It is reprehensible and wrong in every way that public representatives&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I note from the Seanad Official Report of Wednesday, 8 March, during Senator Quinn's contribution, that a commitment was given that the Bill would be published before 30 April and introduced in the Seanad before 31 May.  I ask the Leader the position in this regard.</P>
      <P>The removal of public representatives from State bodies downgrades members of local authorities.  This is, more than any other activity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I remind the Leader it was on the basis of that promise that some of us took a particular position at that time.  There is a wider principle involved for the Independents. It is precisely on the basis of such promises that we take certain approaches at the time of the introduction of legislation.  It would have very serious implications if such promises were not honoured.</P>

      <P>Senator Mullooly said that it would be appropriate that we should commend the Irish football team for their very fine display last night and I am happy to join with him, on behalf of the House, in so doing.  Those of us who had the privilege to be there had a thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable evening.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education will be in the House to debate the White Paper on Education, which will start around the second week of May.  I agree with the Senators who said that the debate should be open ended and we will arrange for this.  It will start not later than the second week in May and we will then let it take as much time as it needs because there is a huge range of issues to be discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be delighted to have a discussion on the principles and policy underlining the staffing of State boards. In fact, as Senator O'Toole mentioned on a number of occasions in the past, I did comment on this when I was in Opposition.  There is a major question to be discussed as to why Members of <Col N="111" /> the Oireachtas are barred from membership of State boards, but this side of the House has nothing to fear from a full and open discussion on the principles underlying the staffing of State boards and of the practice in which it is being carried out.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly raised the question of the business plan.  I am not sure it is appropriate to debate it, but I will make inquiries and communicate with the Senator later this morning to let him know if it can be done.  Senator Finneran, like a number of other Senators yesterday, raised the question of roads. I am in communication with the Department of the Environment to see if we could discuss that matter in the very near future.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan raised the question of the Civil Legal Aid Bill.  I understand that a number of the places on the board have still been left vacant, but there is a definite date for taking Committee Stage of that Bill &mdash; I think it is the week after next.</P>

      <P>No, it is still on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Senators Quinn, Lee and Kiely raised the question of the Arterial Drainage Bill.  I informed the House yesterday that this Bill has been completed &mdash; it is currently having its i's dotted and t's crossed.  It will go to Government at the beginning of next week and I guarantee that it will be available in and processed through this House well before the end of May, as promised.  There is a slight delay with the Bill's publication, but the Bill itself has been completed and is currently being examined by the legal section of the Department.

    <P>The Clonmannon report was raised by Senator Roche.  It has been raised by the Senator effectively in this House on <Col N="112" /> a number of occasions on the Adjournment. The matter could be adequately raised again there, but I will raise it with the Minister.</P>
    <P>I am not sure what comment I should make on the question of stress, as raised by Senator Lanigan.  I thought last evening's performance would have lifted the stress from most of us.</P>

      <P>I am indeed grateful to Senator Manning and to all the Members of this House for providing the opportunity for this timely debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the objectives of the Science, Technology and Innovation Advisory Council in completing its report was to encourage debate on the many fundamental issues contained in it.  Science and technology are issues of long term economic development.  It is not just a matter of implementing some, or all, of the many recommendations in the report; it is fundamentally about an acceptance of the role and importance of science and technology in all its facets in economic development.  That is why this report must generate a debate, a debate which must continue, a debate between all the parties involved, principally the legislators, policymakers, industry and education sectors, a debate which must lead us to a lasting appreciation and consensus on the policies needed to bring about an Irish economy founded upon scientific knowledge and the application of that knowledge, <Col N="113" /> research skills and innovative people, companies and products.</P>
    <P>Shortly after the establishment of the council, the Seanad gave the opportunity for a debate on these issues and that debate served as an input to the deliberations of the council.  I applaud the Seanad for again taking the initiative and I would suggest that Senators could, perhaps, organise an annual debate on science and technology to give the subject the level of attention it deserves.</P>
    <P>To begin with, I would like to stay on this point of the appreciation and importance of the contribution of science and technology.  The council devoted an entire chapter of its report to this issue, recognising that nothing would change unless the basic perception of science, technology and innovation is improved at all levels.  The council points out that scientists, the media, industry at large, the financial community and our primary and second level education systems need to redouble their efforts to get across the positive image and value of science and technology in our world.  However, the council also has words to say about the low level of appreciation within the Government system of the importance of science, technology and innovation. In recommending the new structures for dealing with Exchequer spending on science and technology, the council proposes that Government must display a more long term commitment to policies and funding rather than the somewhat more haphazard approach of the past.</P>
    <P>I think we can admit among ourselves that long term policy approaches, where the returns are neither immediate nor obvious and where the developmental and political cycles are out of synch, are rarely the political imperatives of the day.  This report now presents Government with the opportunity and the mechanisms to put in place structures for a more long term approach to science and technology.  Unless we get the <Col N="114" /> basic approach right, a lot of the other recommendations in the report will have a lesser impact than intended.  The structures proposed in the report are designed not only to make the best use of available funds and find the best match between resources and competing demands but also, and more crucially, to ensure that we sign up for the long term commitment that Irish industry and society requires.</P>
    <P>Against that background and focusing on the report in more detail, the council took the approach that it was important to demonstrate how investment in science, research, technology and innovation impacts on industrial and economic development.</P>
    <P>It is important to recall here the very broad terms of reference which were given to the council, essentially to determine whether the current policies are the right ones for achieving economic development through research, technology and innovation; to determine what mechanisms should be employed to achieve the desired science and technology goals and to make recommendations to improve the effectiveness of science and technology in contributing to national and economic development. As I said earlier, in the first instance the council took the view that policy makers, and indeed the public, needed to be convinced about the benefits of investment in science and technology.  In doing this it examined the international trends and statistics relating to investment in science and technology and economic development, the specific approaches in a number of other countries and the role of knowledge and its application in the competitiveness process.</P>
    <P>The council concluded that innovation based on the application of science and technology is now the mainspring of international economic competitiveness. The most innovative countries are also the world's economic <Col N="115" /> leaders, with strong export performance, based on high value added products and services.  In countries where STI policy has encouraged development through innovation, investment in R and D has been maintained at a high level.</P>
    <P>By way of example, business expenditure on R and D in Ireland is just over 1 per cent of GDP, the average in Europe is 2 per cent, it is over 2.5 per cent in the US and around 3 per cent in Japan.  If that situation were to persist over the long term, the consequences for small firms, for our traditional and natural resource based sectors, where R and D has not been a priority, and the prospects for our continued export growth would, I suggest, be discouraging.</P>
    <P>In more specific terms, the report points out that between 1970 and 1989 manufacturing employment in Japan increased by 4 per cent and in the US by 1.5 per cent, while within the EU it decreased by 20 per cent.  This clearly indicates that those who successfully apply technology keep the benefits in jobs.  Since 1970, employment in knowledge based industry increased by over 20 per cent in the OECD, contrary to the general trend in employment, indicating the job creation propensity in this sector.</P>
    <P>The basic message is clear &mdash; investment in scientific research and technological development, and its successful application into innovative high quality products and services, is vital to sustained economic growth and increased high quality employment.  Furthermore, there are no old industries &mdash; only old technologies.</P>
    <P>The council also examined the situation on the ground in a number of comparable economies around the world, such as Denmark, Korea and New Zealand. It drew a number of general policy pointers from these countries.  The essential element is to stimulate industry demand for R and D and for the higher skills to improve their innovation capability.  Secondly, the State must <Col N="116" /> ensure that there is an adequate support network to meet that demand &mdash; in terms of research programmes, centres of excellence, technical supports, access to international developments and so forth.</P>
    <P>The most difficult aspect facing any small developing economy is to ensure that there is an effective supply-demand interaction.  From the State's perspective it is critical to adopt a long term view of science and technology policy and to ensure sustained investment.  It is also important to recognise that while a country must develop its internal science and technology capabilities, no country can be self-sufficient in meeting its needs.  We must draw knowledge and technology from wherever we can source it and we must then use it.</P>
    <P>There were interesting specific aspects from each of the countries.  In the Danish case they successfully brought about R and D collaboration between numbers of small firms in particular clusters of technologies or industry sectors and with particular attention paid to the development of their natural resources.  In New Zealand a root and branch restructuring of the national S and T system meant that State expenditure was concentrated on national determined priorities.</P>
    <P>In Korea the strategic decision was taken to become a leading economic performer in world terms, through investment in science and technology. Staying with the Korean example, I quote from a recent edition of the British <i>New Scientist</i> magazine:</P>
    <P>All that most people know about Korea is that it manufactures rather inexpensive electronics and cars but, when you come to think of it, doesn't that remind you of another far off land.  The similarities between Korea and the Japan of 20 years ago don't stop there.  Korea is determined to become a wealthy world power through vigorous exploitation of technology. It intends to boost spending on S &amp; T to 5 % of GDP by the year <Col N="117" /> 2,000, double that currently allocated by Britain.</P>
    <P>On a recent visit to the UK, the Korean Minister said that Britain had great potential but had not translated that information into economic gain.  He said Korea had many small and medium sized companies that could help.  In concluding, the article said that Britain needs to swallow up the last vestiges of pride and learn quickly from Korea's success.  &ldquo;In ten years time, when Korea has become a Japan-style economy, it will be too late&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>To finish on the international perspective, I quote from the recent OECD review of industrial policies in member countries in 1994.  It states:</P>
    <P>All OECD countries have given technology policy a higher profile through promotion of R &amp; D, innovation and flexibility in industry. Greater efforts have also been made to link technological development to economic growth and employment, for example, by investments in long term strategic industry-related R &amp; D, improving the industry-university interface and overhauling innovation support to enhance its effectiveness. But there is a continuing need to improve the integration of technology policy into other areas of industrial policy, particularly policies supporting intangible investments (training and skill information, software, market development).</P>
    <P>The support for generic technologies, such as information technology, biotechnology in health-care, food supply and processing, advanced materials, environmental and energy technologies, as well as co-operative research and the technological development of small firms, is particularly marked.</P>
    <P>From its examination of the international perspective the council concluded that Ireland is not well positioned at present in respect of the new technological and market dynamics. Many countries are engaged in sustained <Col N="118" /> experimentation with policies and measures to stimulate their national innovation process.  Such experimentation implies a willingness to take risks and presupposes a long term view.  The council believes that we have little choice but to engage in the same process. In particular, according to the council, there is an undoubted need to increase Ireland's R and D investment, both public and business, if the substantial technology gap that exists in the indigenous sector is to be reduced.</P>
    <P>The report states that the challenges facing all countries, not least Ireland, from the ever increasing speed of technological development are as follows: the national capability in new technologies must be expanded; there must be transfer mechanisms to integrate new technology into less advanced sectors; enterprises must invest to prepare for these changes; and innovation must be an integral part of industrial policy.</P>
    <P>But what are the issues facing Ireland, if they are to successfully address these challenges?  The report argues that, despite the strong macro-economic performance of the economy, there are still some fundamental weaknesses and, of course, unemployment remains unacceptably high.  At the same time, societal needs and expectations for improvements in education, health-care and public services are no less than in other, more wealthy countries.  In the enterprise sector, overseas companies, which account for three quarters of manufacturing exports, are only weakly linked to the domestic economy. Indigenous industry is highly fragmented and, in general, of small scale. In a number of measurements the foreign sector is strikingly superior to its indigenous counterpart.  It is more advanced on the path to a globalised market; twice as skilled in terms of technical and administrative personnel; twice as committed to R and D; and twice as productive on average.</P>
    <P>The unrelenting globalistation of markets, through the EU Single Market. bilateral deals between the super powers and the new GATT round of trade <Col N="119" /> agreements, is an economic fact that all Irish companies, whether foreign owned or indigenous, must face up to.  The report shows that the globalisation trend is being hastened by developments in information technologies. leading to the information super-highway. Countries with the appropriate technological infrastructure to participate in such developments will be able to benefit from the globalisation of education, research, commerce, trade, banking and other services.  Ireland needs to be fully supported by the most comprehensive and advanced networking facilities available.</P>
    <P>It is against that background that we must be concerned that some 80 per cent of our companies would be regarded as having a nil or minimum technology capability; that is, perhaps, no specialist technology personnel, perceiving no need for technological capability or requiring support in sourcing technology from external sources.  This concern for the innovation capability and thus the long term survival and growth prospects of Irish firms has been reflected in every major report on industrial development since the 1960s, including the most recent Culliton report.  The matter has also been treated in specific reports on science and technology policy in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, the latter two carried out by the OECD.  Is there a connection between the reluctance to accept that science and technology are central to industrial policy, as reflected in the lack of implementation of these reports' findings, and the continuing fragile position of the bulk of our indigenous industrial base?</P>
    <P>The report says that some countries and companies have been more successful than others in adapting to and capitalising on the many changes and opportunities arising internationally.  The key to such success is the acceptance and effectiveness of the national system of innovation.  This is defined as &ldquo;the collection of all institutions and the mechanisms (public and private) that interact to stimulate and support innovations in <Col N="120" /> products and systems within the national economy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The S and T components of the Irish national system of innovation are the S and T capability within enterprises, the public sector S and T services and the S and T knowledge and skill base, principally in the third level sector.  The interaction, inter-linkages, policies and incentives which enable these elements to operate coherently are vital.  Equally important are the factors which influence the environment for innovation, that is, education and training, technical culture, public and political awareness, availability of finance and, particularly, international sources of science, research and technological innovation.</P>
    <P>The council argues that the lack of an integrated national system of innovation and the fluctuations in Government commitment to science and technology over previous decades have been at the heart of the reason that there is not a better appreciation of science, technology and innovation and of the culture of technological innovation in Ireland.  The Government must recognise and promote a long term investment strategy to build up the elements of the system of innovation.</P>
    <P>Looking more closely at the main components of the system of innovation, the council argues that within the business sector there is a need to increase industrial involvement in R and D and innovation and to move business expenditure on R and D towards European average levels.  There remains a negative attitude to entrepreneurship, risk-taking and innovation in many aspects of Irish economic life.  There is a low concentration of scientists and engineers in industry.  There is a relatively low level of new company start-ups and there is an overly strong EU influence, particularly on the funding side, on the direction of the national science and technology effort.</P>
    <P>The State's direct role is to provide a balanced programme of applied research and development, strategic R and D in the important generic technologies, such as biotechnology, and to <Col N="121" /> look to the future technology needs of the economy by providing a foresight exercise.  The range of public research institutes in Ireland has always been limited by comparison with other countries where such capability is provided by the State.  They must have a critical competence, be in areas of special national importance and give value for money.</P>
    <P>The council describes the third level sector as the vital source of people and capability in the generation and transfer of research and innovation skills into society.  Basic research provides the essential underpinning for applied research and technological development and, according to the council, we cannot achieve an innovative environment without access to the new knowledge and understanding provided by basic research.  However, we must also ensure that we make maximum use of this knowledge.  The council goes on to say that the role of such research has not been appreciated in Ireland and funding has been inadequate.</P>
    <P>The council also points out that there is a need for better interaction between industry and third level colleges to exploit research for the benefit of the country.  Industry must provide a stronger pull effect by making greater use of the expertise in the colleges.  In turn, the third level sector must provide a science push effect and achieve greater application of its knowledge to address industrial and societal needs. The Government must act as a broker in creating this greater interaction.</P>
    <P>In my speech so far I have concentrated on the problem side of the equation. I have done this deliberately because it is important that we all agree on what the problem is before we go on to recommend solutions, which the council has done in a most detailed way. I am looking forward to hearing Senators' views on issues such as international trends in the field of science and technology, how we compare with other countries at a similar stage of development, how much importance we place on science and technology in <Col N="122" /> terms of our economic development, how we harness knowledge for national benefit and about the weaknesses in the various elements of our national system.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to go into detail on the 160 recommendations in the report. Needless to say we want as many of these acted on as quickly as possible and in a pragmatic way.  To that end, the Government has decided to set up a task force along the lines of the procedure used in providing the Government's response to the Culliton report, which will examine the recommendations and report to a Cabinet subcommittee on their implementation or otherwise.  I hope that work will be completed in approximately six months. However, I do not want to give the impression that there is a quick fire solution to these problems.  Ironically, and unlike the reports on science, technology and innovation which precedes it, I hope we are still dealing with these issues for years to come and that they remain at the fore of the national consciousness.</P>
    <P>I want to say something about the new structures recommended by the council.  The council is critical of the fact that despite an investment of £650 million in S and T related areas in 1993 &ldquo;the fact that the composition of the figure only becomes known after it has been allocated, demonstrates a lack of predetermination as to how the money should be spent and limits the ability to set priorities&rdquo;.  The situation &ldquo;requires a decision to acknowledge the vital role of innovation by moving STI into a central position at Cabinet level in Government&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The council goes on to say that in Ireland there is an absence of a coherent approach to S and T across the spectrum of Government spending.  This reflects a clear lack of awareness by Government of the considerable contribution S and T can make to the national economic effort.  At the same time, the council says it is obvious that we cannot be involved in everything.  Choices have to be made.  This emphasises the need for prioritisation in State expenditure so <Col N="123" /> that the Government has a coherent and integrated strategy for committing funds to different S and T activities.</P>
    <P>In moving to better co-ordination of public spending and aiming to prioritise that spending in the areas of greatest need, the council recommends that there should be an annual national S and T plan prepared by an interdepartmental committee.  S and T activities in individual Departments should be grouped together to create critical mass and raise the S and T profile in those Departments.  The office of science and technology in my Department should be upgraded to a national office as part of this co-ordinating or prioritising process. An STI council should be established to provide independent expert advice and a Cabinet committee should approve the national plan, thus determining policies and priorities for S and T spending.  This is designed to ensure that the national elements are operating in a complementary and synergistic fashion and that the best match is made between competing demands and available resources.</P>
    <P>The reason I have singled this out is obvious.  All the areas of expenditure on S and T, ranging from the portion of a physics lecturer's salary which goes on research training, through to Teagasc experiments on crop varieties, can be individually improved, developed, squeezed or expanded according to the demands and the pressures of the day but until all these programmes, activities and expenditures are shown in an open, transparent and critical juxtaposition, in a way that every Department and agency is aware of the activities and objectives of others, then we cannot really aspire to a national system where focus is concentrated on the national priorities and gives us value for money. Until such a system is put in place, the real value of the many individual recommendations will be diminished.  It may well be that net additional resources will be required but it is also possible that we can achieve a lot by promoting S and <Col N="124" /> T up the priority ladder and reallocating funds from less critical areas.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I would ask Senators to join me in congratulating and thanking the Science, Technology and Innovation Advisory Council for the enormous effort which went into the preparation of this report.  I look forward to hearing the views of Senators and, if necessary or desirable, I will respond at the end of the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the Science, Technology and Innovation Advisory Council is important, timely and well presented.  The members of the council were asked to undertake a review of science, technology and innovation policy and to provide a report in the form of a draft White Paper for the Minister and the Government to consider. They were asked to examine and assess current policies and to bring forward recommendations in relation to changes which would improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the national science and technology system in contributing to national economic development.</P>
      <P>At the outset I will take up the Minister's invitation to compliment and commend the members of the council on the huge amount of work which obviously went into the production of this significant report.  In his introduction to the report, the chairman, Mr. Dan Tierney, makes a number of important points. This is the first time in the history of the State that we have used our own expertise to review science, technology and innovation policy.  He refers to this fact as an indication of our desire and ability to shape our own economic future.  He also makes the point that if we are to implement the right policies, our economic future can be very bright indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Tierney emphasises that the key to a prosperous economic future lies in our ability as a nation to stimulate growth through knowledge generation, innovation and the application of technology. He also emphasises that in the past we have been slow to appreciate the value of science and technology in <Col N="125" /> terms of our country's advance.  Studies which were undertaken in previous decades were not acted upon and, as a result, our indigenous industry is particularly vulnerable in the area of innovation. I would go further than Mr. Tierney and say that because we were so remiss in this regard in the past, we lost many industries which could and should have survived.  I am thinking of the leather, tanning and woollen industries, and several others based on indigenous raw materials.</P>
    <P>As far as the future is concerned, the chairman makes the point that no country, however small, can afford to rely solely on innovations elsewhere.  We need our own sources of research and development to give us instant access to knowledge and the ability to apply it. Furthermore these sources of research and development need to be comparable to or, if possible, better than those available anywhere else.</P>
    <P>Particularly relevant to Ireland is the need for innovative developments in the areas of natural resources, the environment, the food industry and tourism. These are key areas in which this country has to add value continuously if it is to maximise its considerable advantages and assets in these areas.  This, however, will not happen unless there is a much increased emphasis on science, technology and innovation.  Government commitment, support and investment will also be required on an ongoing, long term basis.</P>
    <P>Over the years the percentage of Government spending on research and development has been one of the lowest in Europe, and this situation must change in future.  The chairman says that this report must be seen as the beginning rather than the end of a process. The report makes it clear that much of the growth in output, exports and employment which we have had in recent years has taken place in the foreign owned sector of the economy.  The same dynamism has not been evident in the indigenous sector.  If this sector is to grow and become competitive in international markets a fundamental change <Col N="126" /> is required in our attitude to science, technology and innovation.</P>
    <P>The report, quite rightly, emphasises the point that innovation is not something new &mdash; a point that is worth repeating.  In fact, innovation is as old as civilisation, but innovation based on the application of science and technology is now, as the Minister said, the mainspring of international economic competitiveness.</P>
    <P>Countries which innovate are economic leaders with strong export performances based on high added value products and services.  If Ireland's indigenous industry is to achieve and maintain competitiveness in international markets, it must bring new or improved products and services to the marketplace on a continuous basis.  The report says that innovation, and the promotion of an innovative society in all areas, must become paramount objectives in Ireland's economic strategy and the key to sustained national competitiveness.</P>
    <P>Of course, innovation does not always have to be based on the application of science and technology or have a research and development input.  It may involve nothing more than new ways of organising work, design or packaging. Innovation must be ongoing because, as the report points out, the pace of change in the years ahead is far more likely to accelerate than to slow down.</P>
    <P>The opportunities and challenges which lie ahead can only be met if enterprises and industries operate in an environment which favours innovation. The report makes clear that this can only be provided by long term State commitment in the form of a coherent science, technology and innovation policy.</P>
    <P>International trends in science, technology and innovation are examined in the report.  All over the world technological innovation continues to create new enterprises as well as transforming or displacing old ones.  In countries where science, technology and innovation policy has encouraged development through innovation, public and <Col N="127" /> private sector investment in research and development is maintained at a high level or is being increased.  Innovation is recognised as being essential in such countries' strategies for survival and growth.  In these countries too, there is a strong emphasis on the transfer and diffusion of technology resulting in the speedy commercial exploitation of new ideas and technologies.</P>
    <P>Throughout Europe, according to the report, smaller companies are seen as holding the key to the future.  This must also be the case in Ireland but as has been stated on many occasions, and particularly in the Culliton report, many of our smaller indigenous companies are not sufficiently competitive internationally. This makes the need for a coherent national science, technology and innovation policy all the more urgent.  Such a policy must encourage small firms to become more pro-active and co-operative in the exchange and absorption of knowledge.</P>
    <P>The capability of third level and State science and technology institutions to provide new technology must be harnessed to the greatest extent.  The best possible mechanisms and procedures must be put in place to ensure the most efficient transfer of this technology to industry and other users.</P>
    <P>The report quite rightly emphasises that one of the main aims of Irish science, technology and innovation policy should be to encourage the application of research and development in areas such as food, marine resources and timber. It welcomes the recent increase in funding for food research and development carried out by research institutions but points out that funding for research in other areas where Ireland has natural advantages is very inadequate.  Among these advantages is the &ldquo;green&rdquo; image which the country has and the report emphasises the importance of ensuring that this status is provided through a national environmental management plan.</P>
    <P>The report makes the point that while special sectors could be given priority in <Col N="128" /> order to target limited financial resources, the general level of industrial research and development should be raised in all areas of industry through such measures as an integrated set of tax incentives, a programme to protect intellectual property rights and the fostering of stronger links between industry and the third level sector.</P>
    <P>In addition, the capacity of many enterprises to absorb the benefits of research and development could be enhanced by the placing of science and technology graduates in such enterprises.  The new Techstart programme, which has been initiated by Forbairt, is doing excellent work in this regard and its success is acknowledged in the report.</P>
    <P>In the area of industrial innovation the targets set out in the report are the doubling by 1999 of the amount of research and development carried out by business and the maintenance of the Exchequer funding share at 13 per cent, thereby giving rise to a phased increase in the Government's cash contribution to research and development in industry. Tax incentives which will stimulate business research and development are advocated and certain tax changes are suggested as a way of encouraging multinational companies to establish their regional headquarters and strategic functions in Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is suggested that new funds for food related research and development should focus on the development of new consumer products.  A further recommendation is that FÁS should ensure that at least £50 million per year is used to support training for the employed and that all FÁS programmes should contain a strong emphasis on innovation.</P>
    <P>The role which the third level sector and State research centres must play in providing a vibrant research base is dealt with in detail.  The report identifies a number of serious problems which are impairing the ability of the research system in the third level sector to maximise its contribution to economic development. These include a shortage of <Col N="129" /> research and development funding and equipment.  There is also an unclear approach to contract research for external clients.  The aim must be to strengthen the knowledge generation system in the colleges and to ensure that it reaches the areas where it will be most productive by putting in place the best possible mechanisms for its transfer to what the report describes as the &ldquo;demand side&rdquo;, which is mainly the enterprise sector.</P>
    <P>Since the majority of the smaller Irish companies have none or very few inhouse research resources they have to rely almost entirely on external resources, such as the third level sector, to provide them with technical know-how and advanced level help with innovation. In this regard the report points out that the increasing research and development activities of the regional technical colleges is important for smaller companies at local level.  Most third level colleges have focused on certain disciplines, such as biotechnology or polymer technology, and this has proved to be an approach which suits industry. I commend Athlone regional technical college for the excellent work it is doing in polymer research and its links with industry.</P>
    <P>As an important way of improving access to sources of know-how outside Ireland, the report suggests that the third level sector should actively participate in joint projects with partners in colleges and institutions abroad.  This would have the effect of strengthening the role of the third level sector in interpreting worldwide technological developments. In relation to the role of the third level sector, the report recommends that basic research funding should be substantially increased and allocated on the basis of relevance and excellence.  A five year programme should be put in place to address the research deficiencies across the public sector.  PhD scholarships should be funded to a level of not less that £3,000 each per annum and should be open to all appropriately qualified candidates.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="130" /> In the State sector, organisations such as Forbairt and Teagasc provide industry with a range of science and technology services, but the report suggests there is a need to revitalise these services. The implementation of a recruitment policy which will ensure there is a regular intake of new graduates into these services is worthwhile.  If necessary, a voluntary early retirement scheme should operate to accommodate this &ldquo;new blood&rdquo; programme.</P>
    <P>This is an excellent report.  It admits that it does not have all the answers with regard to science, technology and innovation.  However, its publication is a major step forward in developing a coherent and integrated national science, technology and innovation policy. The next step, hopefully, will be the publication of a White Paper.  The recommendations and targets set down in this report are realistic, achievable and desirable and they all deserve to be incorporated in the White Paper.  There is little reason why the implementation of many of the recommendations in the report cannot begin straight away, even in advance of the publication of the White Paper.  The report calls for extensive collaboration and linkages between foreign and indigenous firms so that there will be the maximum use of modern technology through transfer, diffusion and application.</P>
    <P>Third level colleges and academics are exhorted to take due account of national science, technology and innovation priorities and the development needs of small and medium sized enterprises in deciding on the allocation of funds and the selection of research topics.  The point was strongly made that quality and relevance should be the guiding principles governing research, teaching and training.  There is also an emphasis on the need for third level colleges and academics to join with industry in sharing the valuable and commercially exploitable results of research and development on an agreed and equitable basis.</P>
    <P>For its part, the Government is called on to give a high profile to science and <Col N="131" /> technology which will contribute to increased innovation and to put in place the structures and procedures which will ensure this will happen.  Government should not wait until after the White Paper is published to begin this process.</P>
    <P>I welcome the publication of this report and compliment all involved.  I concur with the hope expressed by the council that the White Paper will be published with a minimum of delay.  I thank the Leader of the House for providing time to discuss the contents and recommendations of the report so soon after its publication.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and compliment the Leader of the House for giving us the opportunity to discuss this report. This is the first time in the State's history we have used our own expertise to review science, technology and innovation policy.  In itself that is an indication of our desire and ability to shape our economic future.</P>
      <P>We have been slow to appreciate the value of science and technology in terms of our country's advances over the years.  Studies undertaken in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s were not acted upon as they should have been.  We must accelerate the rate of knowledge generation and absorption and its conversion into new products and processes for the expansion of companies, exports and jobs to compete in a world where the speed of change is such that there is a fusion of science and technology.  No country, however small, can afford to rely on innovation elsewhere.  We need our own source of research and development to give us instant access to knowledge and the ability to apply it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is stated in the report that Irish third level colleges and research establishments have constantly produced ground breaking work.  Many of our researchers are to the forefront of knowledge creation.  There is a rising tide of Irish entrepreneurs whose vision and determination catapulted their <Col N="132" /> companies to a position of being major international players.</P>
    <P>For many years we have had one of the lowest percentages in Europe of Government spending on R and D, reflecting our lack of conviction in this area.  No country, least of all this one, can afford such lack of response to the critical needs of knowledge.  The Minister outlined, and it is stated in the report, that 1 per cent of GDP has been spent here on R and D as against 3 per cent in Japan and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Unemployment remains extremely high, although upturns in the economic cycle are having a positive effect.  Transfers from the EU inject over £2 billion annually into the economy, but changes in the Common Agricultural Policy and possible extensions of membership to eastern European countries could significantly affect this figure in the medium term, and we are all aware that this is on the cards.</P>
    <P>The recent economic improvements will not be sustained without a fundamental change in our approach to the issues of science, technology and innovation. Such a change is essential to generate the dynamism necessary to create a highly competitive indigenous sector and to continue to attract and integrate foreign investment into the economy in order to make a significant and lasting impact on the problem of unemployment.</P>
    <P>I support the proposal that there should be a target to double the amount of R and D carried out by businesses.  In order to do so the Exchequer funding share should be maintained at around 13 per cent.  If business expenditure does not increase at that rate the Government should consider other methods, such as a repayable R and D contribution from industry.  An integrated set of tax measures is needed to stimulate business research and development, including dividend relief for owner managers, R and D tax credits, PRSI relief for R and D personnel. BES for R and D service companies and tax changes to encourage multinational companies to establish their regional <Col N="133" /> headquarters and strategy functions in Ireland.</P>
    <P>A portion of Government funds should be earmarked for new R and D performers in both multinational subsidiaries and indigenous companies. New funds for food related R and D should focus on the development of new consumer products, including marine based food.  Research is also needed to increase value added in the timber sector. There is a need for an improved venture capital environment, particularly for high tech projects, as well as initiatives to improve business perception of entrepreneurs and innovation. FÁS should ensure that at least £50 million per year is used to support training for the employed and all programmes should contain a strong emphasis on innovation.</P>
    <P>I visited Taiwan a few years ago and was taken aback by how far advanced its science and technology was.  It had science and technology business parks.  I would like to think that in the consultation which will take place in the committee the Minster has set up, we will consider going further than just upgrading the office of science and technology. We should have a national science and technology business park.  We should be prepared to show to all countries in Europe and the world that we are in earnest about upgrading our position so that we can be as good as the rest in the world.</P>
    <P>We are competing with people who are years in front of us because they realised that science and technology innovation was the way to go.  When one considers the business parks in countries such as Taiwan, the number of people working in them and the presentations made on a continuous basis to visitors from other countries, it is mind boggling to think how far behind we are.  If we are in earnest about developing this area in the way the report suggests, the only thing we can do is put our foot forward and say we will provide a science and technology business park at the earliest possible date and will compete on a one to one basis with our European <Col N="134" /> partners and other countries around the world.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that the report states that the council was critical of the fact that despite an investment of £650 million in science and technology related areas in 1993, the composition of the figure only became known after it had been allocated.  It is unbelievable to think that the amount of money allocated only became known afterwards. This demonstrates the lack of planning of where we are going and what we want to achieve in the area of science and technology.  Our third level institutions are training students to the highest possible level, perhaps higher than in many countries in the world.  This type of lack lustre approach certainly predetermines what type of real input we wanted to see by Governments over the years in this area.</P>
    <P>It is only six or seven years since we appointed the first Minster of State with responsibility for science and technology. We have come a long way in that short time.  Even though we have come a long way, we started a long way behind everybody else; and even if we implement many of the recommendations in this report, we will still be behind those who have been so far in front of us.  I expect and know that the Minister will ensure that we will move at the fastest possible pace to create advantages for the benefit of the large number of small industries which cannot afford the R and D required in their own industries and depend on the State to have people available to help industries who have to compete for business on the European and world markets.</P>
    <P>If we do nothing else today, we should compliment those involved in drawing up this report and state that we will look for funds for the provision of a science and technology business park in conjunction with the Government and that we will ensure that we will be as good as the rest.</P>
    <P>We are losing a substantial number of jobs because companies are not given the help they need at the time they need it to keep up with modern times.  I have <Col N="135" /> in mind one company in the food industry. It started as a very small company in producing prepared vegetables for supermarkets.  It started with 12 employees; today it employees about 114 people.  I know without a shadow of a doubt that if there was more up to date research and development available that number could be doubled because the company has the expertise to produce the product.  To be able to compete with similar companies in Northern Ireland it is important that we should get this type of development up and running at a faster pace than heretofore.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of talk about being in the main league with regard to monetary union and a single currency. We are so far behind in that regard that we must get up and running &mdash; and I have no doubt that the Minister will put things in place and make relevant proposals to Government &mdash; so that we can at least get into the second league and put ourselves in position by the year 2000 to be in the first league.  In view of what Korea intends to do &mdash; although we cannot compete in that league &mdash; we must be in a position to compete for the benefit of those for whom we are providing and framing policies and so that the young entrepreneurs who leave our educational institutions annually will have the best available technology in order to compete with those who are now years ahead of us.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the publication of the committee's recommendations.  Perhaps, as the Minister said, we will have the opportunity of looking at the recommendations and improving them later this year or early next year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously one warmly welcomes the report.  Its impact on our thinking should be seminal.  It is not begrudging anything in the report to concentrate on questions concerning it rather than on <Col N="136" /> continuing to welcome it in a sustained way.  Clearly we come close to the bottom of relevant international leagues, in so far as they can be relevant, in investment levels in science and technology. However, we must be careful about simple comparisons.  It is one of the most difficult of all areas to analyse in terms of relating results to investment.  I would not like to be thought that simply flinging money at science and technology in this country is a solution to current problems, and undoubtedly, there are problems.</P>
    <P>The Minister related some comparisons between Europe, Japan and America in his worthwhile speech.  There is clearly no one-to-one comparison between investment or business expenditure in R and D as a ratio of GDP and the ultimate employment figures.  The Minister said that if a 2 per cent rise in expenditure in Europe is compatible with a 20 per cent decrease in manufacturing employment in Europe, what does 2 per cent mean in that context? Later he mentioned that the report urges that our business expenditure on R and D should rise towards average European levels.  However, I am sure we do not want it to have the same consequences in terms of employment which he mentioned earlier.  The point is that there is no one-to-one correlation.</P>
    <P>It is important for us to ascertain the reasons for different rates of return on S and T investment in different economies. They vary considerably.  It is a further stage in our thought process because it is not something this report was able to do.  Perhaps nobody can do it in a definitive way.  However, we should keep the question in mind.  How do we evaluate rates of return?  Can we refine further the comparisons we have here to make them more relevant to the decisions the Department must take in terms of possible rates of return on different areas of investment?</P>
    <P>I welcome the concern in the report with constructive comparison and with learning as best we can from the experiences of other economies, particularly small economies.  However, Korea with <Col N="137" /> a population of 37 million is not small compared with Denmark, Finland or Norway.  Nevertheless, we can learn from all of them.  The jury is still out on New Zealand, by the way.  New Zealand has recently been flavour of the month in a number of ways, but I would question that &mdash; not in an adversarial manner &mdash; and would not be jumping to follow New Zealand's example until one was much clearer on its results.</P>
    <P>I welcome this approach.  We must continue to refine it.  We must not only improve our S and T capability but also our capability for thinking about S and T &mdash; we must learn how to learn.  That is a major challenge in all areas and is particularly challenging in this area because it is relatively new in this country. This is the first Irish review of the problem, as the chairman says in the report.  However, that refers mainly to the membership of the committee.  As far as I can deduce from the names, a certain amount of the consultancy backup is still imported expertise.  There is nothing wrong with that, but we need to reinforce our own expertise capacity in the evaluation area.  That is a general proposition and is not meant as a reflection on the calibre of the report.  It is simply an encouragement to continue further in that direction.</P>
    <P>On the supply side, we obviously have low levels of expenditure.  However, the gap between Ireland and the rest of the world is so wide and we are so relatively low on the league table that we can assume that some of the extra expenditure we will incur must have positive results even while we work at refining how those results can be most effective. We are probably even lower on the supply side than it appears.</P>
    <P>The figure given for higher education, low though it is, is exaggerated.  It refers to the imputed time spent on research. It is calculated in a mechanistic way. Perhaps that is the only way it can be calculated at present.  However, in so far as I am in a position to observe &mdash; and I might not be the best observer &mdash; that time is being squeezed increasingly in higher education.  As our institutions of <Col N="138" /> higher education become institutions of mass education, although I strongly approve of that from the point of view of general social policy, the implication for the research staff of those institutions &mdash; given that all staff combine teaching and research and are trapped in internal administrative requirements which become worse as the pressure on resources becomes tighter &mdash; is that the amount of good quality time that becomes low quality time as a result of the misallocation of the time of researchers within institutions because of the battle for squeezed resources is really quite frightening.</P>
    <P>If in a knowledge based economy we were to think of the quality time of researchers as a key variable, we would look with great concern at how that time has been eroded in recent years in higher education.  It is difficult to talk except in an abstract way about this, but I am convinced that it is a serious and worsening problem.  When, commendably, we are thinking about how to make higher education more accessible to sectors which have been deprived of it and when we are thinking of the social equity dimension, we should also try to keep in mind the intellectual dynamic of research.  All these must be balanced in whatever way is compatible with the national interest in so far as that can be evaluated.</P>
    <P>The report concludes that even the current figure for higher education research and development, which I believe is exaggerated, is, as a percentage of GDP, bottom of the league by far among 12 other European countries. Despite the initial scepticism I evinced about precise rankings and so forth, it appears that something must be seriously amiss.  In that respect, there are major problems to be confronted by decisions makers about how to allocate any increase in S and T resources and the balance between basic and applied research.  We can take quality and relevance into account.  Who decides what relevance is?  Who decides when relevance is?  The Minister has rightly stressed that we are in a situation which <Col N="139" /> requires long term thinking.  How far can Governments afford to think long term?  I am convinced the Minister is right for a number of reasons.  I believe in balance in these matters most of the time.  I would not like to see so-called applied research at the total expense of basic research.  At the same time one cannot simply have basic research and hope that something ultimately will emerge from it.  There must be a balance.</P>
    <P>The report distinguishes between natural resource based investment and knowledge based investment in the economy in general.  When it makes its recommendations there is a tendency, as there was in the Culliton report and despite this report's rhetoric about knowledge based investment, to go for resource based areas such as agriculture, fish and timber.  I do not oppose that.  We must extract what excellence and growth we can from those areas. However, when we must think of particular areas we are pulled in those directions rather than in the more vague and problematical but rapidly developing knowledge based areas &mdash; software, high definition television and so forth.  Knowledge based areas require some capability in basic research within the country, even when most of what ultimately will be applied is, or can be, imported.  We need a critical mass of basic research to be able to identify, domesticate and suggest ways forward.</P>
    <P>I am not criticising this report for being so natural resource based.  When one looks at Culliton, which was to be a businessman's report producing specific recommendations, which less businessmen type commissions were notably thin on, the specific recommendations for sectoral development &mdash; the famous clusters of the Michael Porter recommendations &mdash; are for agri-industry, which exactly reflect the membership of the committees, as some of the recommendations in this report naturally reflect the membership of this committee.  As far as I can remember, <Col N="140" /> the only other recommendation which they could come up with, having slagged the IDA for its failure to come up with a variety of alternatives, was aircraft maintenance.  I support that, but if we were to rely on the record of aircraft maintenance since then, we would probably be questioning that recommendation.</P>
    <P>In other words, it is very difficult to identify winning sectors.  It says in the report that the State cannot pick winners; as far as I can see, nobody can pick winners.  The market certainly cannot, except in a very rough and ready sort of way.  Therefore, if it is difficult to pick winners in that sense, who picks winners in terms of centres of excellence and identifying sectors to concentrate on or ignore?  An ignored sector may turn out seven or eight years later to have had potential growth which was unsuspected at the time.  If we have no basic scientific capability here to respond to that type of development, we will be the losers.</P>
    <P>There is a variety of very difficult balancing decisions to be taken.  I do not think that there is any right way of doing that, but the complexity of the variables must be kept in mind.  Simple decisions always have an attraction; but if they are wrong decisions, whole areas of potential development could be excluded by simply being a few years late in a particular area.</P>
    <P>If we want to keep the best research students in this country and guide high quality minds into this area, £3,000 for Ph.D. students is not an adequate incentive for that type of mind.  We will lose our best research students abroad, and there is a strong danger that many of them will remain there.  Many of the best scientists and technologists in this country &mdash; and many of the best minds in every area &mdash; have returned here from extremely successful and promising careers abroad.  They have not come back for research purposes but because they are Irish.  The best of them, who are as good as any in the world, are sacrificing glittering careers and have in many cases left outstanding positions, particularly in America, to come back. <Col N="141" /> If we are to hold them &mdash; and there have been some notable losses recently &mdash; we have to identify the highest quality people and find ways of providing incentives.  Our normal third level incentive system is very weak in many respects; it is some sort of internal ethic which drives people, given our incentive system.  We should identify the people whom this country does not want to lose in any circumstances.  In that sense one is picking winners, but on the basis of proved performance and international competitiveness in their own field.</P>
    <P>This report is saying that the demand side is disastrous and that Irish business, particularly indigenous business, is not capable of incorporating and domesticating science and technology at its most advanced levels in its activities. That is quite understandable as things stand &mdash; and Senator Quinn has spoken eloquently on this before &mdash; because not just the small size but the micro size of a great deal of Irish business makes it extremely difficult to expect business people to be able to appreciate the potential of S and T for their firms.</P>
    <P>It is one of the striking lacunae in Irish business life that our industrial organisations, which in several Continental countries play a central role in alerting their members to the moving frontier of S and T, seem, if I understand the situation properly &mdash; and I hope that I am not being unfair &mdash; to play so muted a role here.  If some of the energy which is spent on demanding changes in various policies &mdash; which may be right, for all I know &mdash; was devoted to trying to move the whole sector forward in terms of S and T rather than just simply looking for concessions, that would be a significant contribution towards raising the consciousness of our business community concerning the role of S and T.</P>
    <P>In a sense, innovation dangles a little uneasily here.  There are good paragraphs in the report and in the back up volumes on the need to integrate the totality of business thinking.  However, because innovation involves changes in management structures and internal <Col N="142" /> organisational structures as well as simply mechanical application or transfer of S and T, one of the directions in which we are going to have to develop our thinking is how one most effectively integrates in that area.</P>
    <P>I was somewhat taken aback to see no cognisance taken in the report of the report of the small business task force in February 1994, which challenged the widespread assumption that we lacked enterprise because our number of start-ups of small companies was allegedly only half the international average.  If the small business task force report is correct &mdash; and it is the only one to do that amount of digging &mdash; our number of start-ups is roughly average for the industrial world.  Perhaps they would need to be more if we were to catch up, but on the basis of that evidence, which is the only evidence adduced apart from anecdotal evidence about the lack of enterprise in this country, we are not lacking in the enterprise needed to start firms.</P>
    <P>However, where we fall down &mdash; and this may be because of inadequate thinking about S and T &mdash; is in sustaining those firms.  The failure rate is exceptionally high for the first few years, but the founder rate is not exceptionally low.  The main deficiency is not enterprise in the crude, risk taking sense, but management skill, if the report of the task force on small business is correct.  That assumption and that specific reference recur a number of times throughout these volumes.  If more homework is necessary on what the exact situation is, one needs to do it, because one's assumptions about that will underlie quite a number of policy conclusions about where the main thrust of policy ought to be oriented.</P>
    <P>In case one thinks that this is an anti-business diatribe &mdash; God forbid, in the Minister of State's presence &mdash; I have enormous sympathy for the problems of small business people trying to cope in an economy of our size with international competition.  In so far as they are highly market oriented, they have to think about exporting at a much earlier <Col N="143" /> stage, in both the growth of the firm and product cycle, than is the case with firms in bigger economies.  The objective challenge confronting them is much more serious as they have to export at a much earlier stage than is required from firms who are either in bigger economies or who have some genuinely big firms in their own economy to which they can act as sub suppliers.  What is staggering about Ireland is not our shortage of small firms but our shortage of really big firms whose influence can pervade the rest of the economic system.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State and the report are absolutely right that the linkages have to be created.  It is a little sad to have to say, after all our historic obeisance to the market, that it cannot create those linkages.  However, I am quite convinced that the report and the Minister of State are correct that the market cannot do that.  However, I would like to see &mdash; and this is an ideological statement to some extent &mdash; the profile of science, technology and innovation raised, but not by advocating the development of these areas as an alternative to or at the expense of general culture.  The Minister of State and the report used the phrase &ldquo;technical culture&rdquo;. If such culture is to be properly appreciated it ought to become an integral part of general culture, so one does not think of culture as being on the arts side while technical culture is something different.</P>
    <P>If we are to be a properly integrated people and to think consciously about the integration of all intellectual activities, we should integrate technical culture into general culture.  We can feel equally proud of it and take equal satisfaction in its achievements.  Literary culture and technical culture are not necessarily mutually anti-ethical or exclusive.  In this small country, where the general cultural ethos is crucial to national achievement, we ought to strive to integrate our thinking in those areas, as well as integration in terms of linkages and overcoming the dreadful fragmentation which affects us all.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="144" /> As the only slight concession to my local interests, I pay tribute to Dr. William Reville of UCC, who now writes a weekly column on science and technology in <i>The Irish Times.</i>  He does this well.  He attempts to place it precisely in a general cultural context, not as an extra or alien thought process which we must now painfully struggle to take on board.  His column used to be in <i>The Cork Examiner,</i> which was the pioneer enterprise leader in this area.  Despite the value of the <i>Examiner,</i> publication of the column in <i>The Irish Times</i> brings the issues to a wider public who would not necessarily have the time to peruse the <i>Examiner</i> in the necessary detail.</P>
    <P>Raising the profile of science, technology and innovation, but as far as possible in a holistic intellectual context, ought to be an integral part of the way the Minister's Department approaches this issue.  I use the word &ldquo;holistic&rdquo; although I do not like it, because there is confusion about what it means.  I wish the Minister well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Lee's contribution was thought provoking and contained many ideas which will bear fruit if they are given consideration.  I compliment him and I am sorry I am speaking straight after him.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and join with him and others in congratulating the council on this report.  I hope it will not be put on the shelf for a Government Department to examine but that it will stimulate discussion throughout society, especially in those sectors to which it is relevant.</P>
      <P>Everyone accepts the need for policy and action in this area.  The question is: what policy and what action?  How can we focus our attention on the way the intentions of the task force are carried through?  The introduction to the report stresses it is not simply for its own sake that we look to science and technology; we do so to achieve economic development. We should stress this at all times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In talking about economic development we are talking about tackling our fundamental problems of unemployment. <Col N="145" /> As the Minister said, there is no &ldquo;quick fix&rdquo; solution.  This is a long term strategy and that is why it has not always been at the centre of the political agenda.  There is no immediate political kudos in research and development. However, that is all the more reason why we as legislators should focus on it and give it the priority it deserves.</P>
    <P>The examples from other countries show there will be economic development and, in the long term, job creation, if we take this area seriously.  The task force document cites examples from the Nordic countries.  New Zealand and Korea which should be taken on board; there are more similarities between our problems and strengths and those of the Nordic countries than with the other countries.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement of a task force on this area.  He referred to the need for a national plan. A yearly one has been recommended in the document.  I presume the intention is that we do not put this aside but continue to see what progress we are making. Whenever I make a speech on these issues I mention the need to monitor on a regular basis what progress we are making.  That is essential in the research and development area.</P>
    <P>This is a fiercely competitive market, particularly as regards technology. Technological items in kitchens, hospitals, offices, canteens and factory floors constantly change.  Any company that is not able to keep up with the changes will go under.  That has unfortunately been the experience of many companies; they have been unable to keep pace with technology and keep their place in the market.  Other countries which have given more central priority to this area have been able to move forward and we should learn that lesson.</P>
    <P>It is understandable that indigenous Irish industry has not been as good as it should have been in this area.  We did not take part in the Industrial Revolution in the last century so we do not have an industrial background.  We had a colonial history and an agriculturally <Col N="146" /> based economy for a long time.  We are therefore relatively new to this area.</P>
    <P>Since the 1960s we have also been dependent on foreign companies, which we have not encouraged to focus on R and D.  We simply encouraged them to come here, create jobs and pay the wages.  We did not mind what happened after that.  That is also changing now, which is welcome.  This report suggests the IDA should encourage, if not require, foreign firms to have a research and development aspect to their activities in this country.  I would be interested in the Minister's response to that point because that has not been the case in the past.</P>
    <P>Under the Department of Enterprise and Employment there was a division of responsibilities between Forbairt and IDA.  The development of indigenous industry has been concentrated in Forbairt, which has been important to this area.  I hope that agency plays a central role in research and development.</P>
    <P>Forbairt organised an exhibition in Limerick last year.  There were stands for companies operating in the hightech area.  People in third level education or who had recently qualified were invited to barter for jobs and see what was on offer in these areas.  It is most important that there be a linkage between those in third level institutions, who provide the information, and industry. Senator Lee mentioned this in his contribution in speaking about the balance between pure and applied research.</P>
    <P>There is an onus on third level bodies to have a closer link to the market, with industry and the places their graduates will go.  The regional technical colleges, the Dublin Institute of Technology and the newer universities, University of Limerick and Dublin City University, have all developed strong links in this way.  In my area there are strong connections between the University of Limerick and many local industries.</P>
    <P>My Fine Gael colleague proposed a national technological centre; in Limerick the Plassey Technological Park fulfils that role.  It encourages the interaction <Col N="147" /> between industry and third level institutions.  I am not suggesting that is not done by the other universities, but there is more emphasis on it in the regional technical colleges and the new universities.  The links should be much closer.  This report points out there is no point in third level institutions, the Government and industry doing things separately.  There must be this kind of planned approach and this kind of link. By establishing a task force and through this document itself we are, therefore, for the first time, trying to make clear the kind of links which should be there and establish a policy.  For that reason it is essential that there is this kind of focus and that there are clear policies and links between the people that are produced in the educational system and how they react with the industries which are in place.</P>
    <P>In this context I refer to the educational section of the report, on pages 152 and 153, where suggestions are made regarding science education.  We must go back, not just to third level, but to second and primary level also, because it is essential that this starts at an early age.  There are programmes which are being developed, and the applied leaving certificate which has recently been introduced will have possibilities in this regard.  In addition, transition years are now becoming more widely available than in the past and all schools can now have a transition year if they wish to have it available to students.  This must be developed, together with the technology syllabi which have been introduced to schools. As far as I understand, the technology option in schools is still not as widely available as it should be.  I know that in one school there was a queue of students who wanted to take this subject, but it was only offered on a pilot basis so it was not available to all of the students in the school.  There was a very strong interest from the second level students in taking this option and the school had to turn away some students <Col N="148" /> because it could not accommodate all of them.</P>
    <P>There is, therefore, an interest in this area, together with an ability to think innovatively in this country, but it is not being channelled properly.  It can be observed with regard to literature, music and so on, where we have the ability to use what we have and develop it.  Again, in the University of Limerick, and formerly coming from University College Cork, we have Mícheal Ó Suilleabháin, who is adopting these techniques with regard to music.  It was interesting that Toyota Ireland recently gave him £100,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>It was £500,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to enable his department develop innovation in music.  There is no reason why this kind of thinking should not be applied and why firms like Toyota and others should not be putting money into using it in the areas in which they operate.  Hopefully, it is an indication of things to come.</P>
      <P>Regarding the famous issue of clustering, it is necessary in Ireland for firms to be brought together to operate, because we have so many small and medium sized firms, especially small firms.  It is almost impossible for them to have the finance to develop their own technologies and to develop their own networking.  This is a little bit off the subject we are considering today, but in the area of getting into the networks where people can sell their goods, of clustering together and of being able to share information &mdash; whether it be technology which is introduced from outside or the development of new technology in this country &mdash; it is essential that support of this kind be provided.  Forbairt have a role here and the former Eolas, which is now part of Forbairt, had a strong role in this area, and it is necessary to strengthen it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Community enterprise boards should also have some role, because the smaller people who set up small industries usually approach these boards first.  They should have an additional role in at least <Col N="149" /> channelling people to the available technology, information and support that is available, and, if necessary, bringing people together in clusters.  One person came to me who had approached the city enterprise board and who had a very innovative idea in the area of recycling.  However, it needed quite a bit of research and investigation to adapt the idea to Ireland and to what he wanted to do.  It took him a great deal of effort to raise the finance and to get the kind of support he needed to develop this idea, but there was potential for a sizeable number of jobs, which I hope will be realised.  There is, therefore, a need to assist people who have ideas but who do not always have the wherewithal in terms of finance or expertise to develop them.  Again, the third level institutions have a strong role here in that they should be available, through contact either with Forbairt or with the enterprise boards &mdash; or, in our case, SFADCo &mdash; so that there can be a linking and that the maximum use can be made of the expertise which we have in this country.</P>
    <P>We have a very good education system and a very intelligent population, but we need to channel it to ensure that it produces the kind of results we are seeking.  That is why it is so important for this debate to be continued and that practical steps are taken to ensure that we are not just talking but that we are achieving results.  In this context, I welcome the fact that in his speech on the Finance Bill on Tuesday last, the Minister for Finance indicated that there will be a number of measures to stimulate investment by companies in research and development.  That is the extent of my knowledge on this matter, but perhaps the Minister will enlighten me further on it.  In any event it appears to be moving in the right direction of encouraging &mdash; I am not aware if it is through tax incentives, PRSI or whatever &mdash; companies to invest in research and development.  We probably need this kind of carrot approach, together with a follow up stick approach, but if we can have measures in our tax system <Col N="150" /> which encourages companies to invest in research and development we could hope to reap rewards in that area.</P>
    <P>In the section of the report dealing with learning from other countries, on pages 38 and 39, there is a reference to Denmark and Finland, and we should learn from these countries.  Denmark has developed strong international competitiveness in areas such as agri-business, agri-industry, health care products and environmental technology.  While I take the point made by Senator Lee that we cannot always anticipate which areas we may be able to best concentrate on in terms of sectors, there is a natural tendency towards these sectors in Ireland because of our history of agricultural dependency and our green environment.  These are areas in which we could hope to develop, especially in health care, which is an area in which we have perhaps much potential.</P>
    <P>There is also a big growth in natural products and a concentration on things such as the body shop, natural cosmetics and similar naturally based products such as health foods and so on.  We should be able to link into this and develop products that would have worldwide competitiveness.  In this respect the image of Ireland would help us to sell products in this area: and in the cosmetics industry especially, there is a constant battery of advertising and of new products.  A lot of money is spent on these areas in the worldwide market and we need to consider these products to ascertain if we can link into them.</P>
    <P>The food and agri-business sector is one which has received much attention and it should continue to do so.  In my own area, the Limerick Food Centre in Raheen concentrates on developing products which have added value so that we can maximise the potential, in terms of jobs and wealth creation, of our large agricultural sector.  We must continue to develop new products in this area.  Programmes such as Techstart and Techman are doing good work, but they need to be expanded.</P>
    <P>While I again welcome the fact that we are debating this issue, it is not <Col N="151" /> enough just to debate it.  I welcome the fact that there will be a task force and I hope that there will be ongoing monitoring of progress in this area, that it will be a wide debate and that it will be responded to in the third level institutions, in the country at large and in the industrial sector.  Everybody must realise that they will have a responsibility and that, for example, the third level institutions will reward people who work in this area.  Much of the time in third level institutions, people are rewarded by promotion if they undertake some kind of obtuse research which gets into a number of journals which the public often does not read and of which industry probably takes no notice.</P>

      <P>There is also an onus on third level institutions in particular to reward by promotion people who do this kind of work.  They have an eye to the outside world and not just to the people in their own sector.  There is equally an onus on industry to put its money into long term development and there is an onus on the Government to respond with both the carrot and the stick.  It should provide incentives but also the national support and focus that is needed in this area.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the business ordered for today, the Minister will be called to conclude the debate at 12.45 p.m., which is a quarter of an hour away.  I understand there are three Senator anxious to contribute.  As there is no time limit, I ask Senators to keep this in mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>As there are at least three other speakers offering, I will confine my remarks to three to five minutes. This is not because I do not regard the matter as more important or urgent than that but because I wish to give others an opportunity to speak.  I wish the Minister of State well in his appointment. <Col N="152" /> He has the drive and initiative to tackle the work needed in this area and I hope he will be able to use that in a positive way to make some dramatic changes during his period in office.  I am glad to have the opportunity to welcome him and wish him every success in his job.</P>
      <P>I spoke on this matter last May and I will not go over those points again. However, there are some areas which are as relevant now as they were then. Again, I wish to emphasise and support the report in calling on the Government to provide the additional finances needed to fill the gaps in this area as a matter of extreme urgency.  The report highlighted that in a very stark way when it said that it was necessary for the Government to immediately allocate £25 million to face up to the present shortcomings in our programme.  These need identification and a response.  If this Minister secured that funding immediately in line with the committee's recommendation, he would have achieved a major step in the road towards meeting the shortcomings in research and development that have been obvious to many people for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was some comment about our lack of interest and awareness in or commitment to research and development and the lack of response over the years.  There have probably been more reports written about research and development than anything else.  The Telesis report in 1982 indicated clearly what needed to be done and there were many other reports.  In one of its reports, Eolas specifically demanded that investment be trebled from £50 million to £150 million in 1994.  In spite of all this, it will still be extremely difficult to reach any of the targets or achievements mentioned in this report unless the Government commits the necessary financial resources.  I said this to the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Brennan, last year when I was on the other side of the House.  If we are serious about it we have to make a financial allocation which matches our <Col N="153" /> commitment.  That is the main point I wish to make.</P>
    <P>There is certainly a need for reorganisation to ensure we get the best possible value for money.  This report identifies 41 agencies and institutions engaged in research and development activities, technological matters and innovation.  This is daft and the sooner there is some reorganisation of agencies and institutions the better.  I welcome the establishment of the Government committee the Minister announced today.  The report indicated that the Taoiseach should chair it.  I am not sure if he will, but the fact that there is now a Cabinet subcommittee dealing with the area is an advance.  I hope we will get a report from the subcommittee to indicate what it is doing.</P>
    <P>The report mentions that Ireland accounts for 0.05 per cent of European research and development.  This indicates where we stand in the research and development league; we are at the very bottom.  We need to do something urgently about it and the Minister would be well advised to seek some additional funding.  Research and development and new innovation and technology will have a profound impact on almost every area of activity.</P>
    <P>I want to highlight the present situation in Shannon.  Up to 700 jobs are threatened in a highly sophisticated industry involving aviation maintenance and reconstruction development.  There are 700 people whose jobs have been threatened for the past few months and who need a firm vote of confidence from the Government as to its support for that industry.  It is an example of what can be achieved in the research and technological area for anybody who wishes to see it at work in practice.  I am sure the Minister will have an opportunity to visit the aviation park in Shannon and see the work underway there and what can be achieved through investment in this area.</P>
    <P>I draw the Minister's attention to the situation in Shannon Aerospace and ask him, as Minister of State with responsibility for science and technology, to take <Col N="154" /> a personal interest in the business plan which has been put together to try to resolve the problems in Shannon Aerospace and secure the jobs of the 700 people there.  He will be showing them and demonstrating in a very practical way that there is a real commitment to finding ways to increase economic activity and provide more jobs and, through science, technology and innovation, create an opportunity for many more people to be employed in this country in the future.  I welcome this report and the Minister can be assured of our backing to get the necessary finances for its implementation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Daly for giving me the opportunity and time to speak on this matter.  I also warmly welcome this report, which is a necessary step along the important road the country has to travel.  I have four brief points, the first of which relates to innovation. I welcome the connection the report makes between science and technology on one hand and innovation on the other.  Innovation is the very reason why the State should strongly support science and technology in the first place. Innovation is the output and the end to which science and technology are the means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Innovation has always been around, but there seems to be something new. Until recently innovation was just an option for companies.  Some companies were able to survive and even thrive without thinking too much about innovation. There was a living for them following in the wake of what others were doing.  Most Irish companies in the past did just that and they did not themselves innovate.  They copied what somebody else was doing, usually at a leisurely pace.  What is new is that this approach does not work anymore.  We are rapidly reaching a stage where companies which do not innovate and are one step behind the leading edge, instead of keeping fully abreast of it, will not survive and have not been surviving.  They become as out of date as some of the technical industries we have seen go to the wall <Col N="155" /> in the last 25 years.  Any company that is not driven by innovation is about to become as dead as a dodo.  The future is as stark as that, and Senator Daly touched on it very clearly.</P>
    <P>My second point is to underline the link between science and technology on one hand and innovation on the other. In the world in which we move innovation actually equals technology.  One can no longer have worthwhile innovation without some technological dimension.  This applies particularly to the development of new and improved products.  Innovation in marketing is no longer enough to give one a competitive edge.  From now on the heart of innovation will be firmly based on technology.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Sullivan made the point that we are badly equipped to cope with the changes that have taken place.  We do not have a tradition of science and technology in Ireland.  I would not go so far as to say that we are technologically adverse, but it is true that our culture is mainly focused in other directions. Nowhere is this more evident than in the very corridors of power.  If Members look around the administration and the world of politics, they will see very few people with a scientific or technological background.  Overwhelmingly the qualifications are in the traditional humanities, not in subjects related to science or technology.  This was touched upon by Senator O'Sullivan when she talked about the applied leaving certificate, which is a first step in that direction. This partly explains why we neglected science and technology so woefully in the past.</P>
    <P>In the business world, the same bias is repeated.  Most people lack a technological background and this is reflected in our very companies, the businesses they trade in and the degree to which they are driven by innovation.  Far more companies, it seems to me, are driven by accountants than are run by engineers. Even when engineers set up their own companies, they are often handicapped by the fact that their training has not <Col N="156" /> given them the basic business skills necessary for success.  This is a fundamental difficulty of culture.  We have become aware that we need to develop an enterprise culture.  The Culliton report laid great emphasis on this.  We need to sharpen that now, we need to develop an innovation culture because that is the very heart of the success of enterprise.  We need to develop a technological culture because that is the way to innovation.</P>
    <P>What can we do about these needs?  I welcome the Minister's words today and the setting up of the task force.  I am not sure that I welcome Senator O'Sullivan's reference to the need to have ongoing monitoring.  I do not like task forces that monitor things.  I was delighted to hear the Minister say that he is setting a deadline of six months for the completion of the task force's report.  I then read that it was hoped that the report would be ready in six months.  I would love to see a very definite deadline of six months to come to the cabinet committee.</P>
    <P>The report today is full of good recommendations.  I do not disagree with any of them.  However, because of the costs involved, my guess is that only a small proportion of those will actually be implemented, although I know the Minister has said otherwise.  If we take that route, we will fail miserably.  I am not about to make a case for more public spending; we are in enough trouble in that area as we are.  We should stop spending money on some things in order to spend more money on supporting science and technology in order to create an innovation culture.</P>
    <P>We have too many State supports for companies.  Too many programmes are available, supporting every worthwhile aim in the book.  The result is that very often nothing gets done properly.  That is certainly the case with science and technology.  That whole area is starved of resources.  There have been increases in recent times but they have only been a drop in the bucket, so I call for a more radical focusing of State support for companies.  Let us just pick one project <Col N="157" /> and get it right.  That may shock many people, certainly many people in some of our State bodies, but it makes sense.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you very much indeed.  Let me finish with a couple of sentences.  Let us move away from the idea of the State development agency as a kind of universal nanny in the business of meeting every possible need of a developing company.  Many of the services now provided by State agencies would be supplied as commercial undertakings by the private sector if the State got out of the way.  Creating an innovation culture is something only the State is able to do.  The question is whether it will or not.  The need is there; the resources are there if we redirect what we are spending now and focus it on that one big task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Quinn for cutting his contribution short.  I welcome the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, to the House and wish him well in his new Ministry.  I will just make a few points because I know time is against us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report contains a well argued case for the importance of science and technology in a modern economy and why in general it is necessary for us, given our ambitions for national economic development, to increase the amount of funds we invest in this area. It highlights the neglect of this area up <Col N="158" /> to now and also organises a lot of useful data in this area.  It contains good recommendations for the development of our small indigenous industry.  It also makes a very valid point that science and technology must be considered in terms of our wider industrial policy and not in isolation.</P>
    <P>To look at it just from a taxpayer's point of view for a moment, a real problem with the report is the apparent approach, that of spending and continuing to spend money on the problem. There is no great justification for that.  I would like to hear an explanation of the intention to set up a large office of science and technology.  At the same time, the report says very little about how we can improve the quality of return we get from the large sums of money that are already spent on science and technology.</P>
    <P>There is an over-emphasis in the report on natural resource based industries. More jobs could be created in the natural resource based industries, but these jobs need more investment rather than more research and development. In any case, I am not so sure that there is potential for so many jobs in the natural resource based industries.  Jobs can be created in the high growth knowledge based industries.  Although they are acknowledged in this report, there is very little emphasis on these growth industries and this, in my view, is a weakness in the report.</P>
    <P>An important point made in the report is the very low level of innovation in our indigenous industries.  This is correct and a continuous effort will have to be made to address this problem. However, there is little or no account taken of the fact that more and more multinational companies are carrying out R &amp; D and product development in Ireland on a major scale.  There is a structural problem here in that Eolas, the old science and technology agency, is now part of Forbairt, the industrial development agency dealing with indigenous industry.  There is a real danger that Forbairt's emphasis will be on science and technology, which it <Col N="159" /> feels is appropriate for indigenous industry.  This would put us at a great disadvantage, I believe, and lose us opportunities in the area of helping multinationals find deeper roots here in Ireland.  There is an opening there for us and we should home in on it.</P>
    <P>Points in regard to education have been covered by a number of Senators, but I am not so sure that we should throw money into this area of education either.  Universities and centres of excellence in education are already finding support in the marketplace if they are good enough, and I am not sure that everyone in our schools is good enough to merit grant aid.  If they are good enough many of them are able to find the money themselves.  I see a structural problem in regard to food research. Should it be carried out in Teagasc as opposed to the universities?  Given the amount of money going to this area, guidance from the council is important. They are both represented on the council and it is surprising that it did not address this important issue.  It should have addressed it.</P>
    <P>I have one further point regarding pollution and the environment.  There is a glaring deficiency in the Environmental Protection Agency.  It has licensing and monitoring functions, but it cannot provide grant aid to an industry it finds offside and which could rectify the position if it were given £50,000.  I ask the Minister to consider this matter when the White Paper is being considered.</P>
    <P>I am a little disappointed that the report did not dwell on the potential of high growth, knowledge based industry. I emphasise the point that this area has high employment potential.  The report is a major contribution &mdash; perhaps the best to date &mdash; to the debate on the vital role of science and technology in Ireland.  It contains many good recommendations and presents the newly appointed task force with a serious opportunity to make further progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader of the House and all the Senators who contributed to this important debate.  Senator Finneran concluded on the point on which Senator Mullooly began, regarding the preparation of a White Paper and what should be included in it.  I have an open mind on whether a White Paper is necessary at all.</P>
      <P>This is a very comprehensive report and a task force is examining it recommendation by recommendation at assistant secretary level, in keeping with the Culliton and Moriarty format.  It is chaired by the chief executive of Forfás, Mr. Travers.  This task force reports to a Cabinet committee, which, regarding Senator Daly's question, comprises the Ministers for Finance, Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Education, the Marine and myself.  It is not chaired by the Taoiseach as the Cabinet felt it appropriate that I chair it.</P>
      <P>The committee will consider on an ongoing basis the tranches of recommendations as they are dealt with by the task force.  I have an open mind as to whether, following all of that, it will be necessary to publish a White Paper.  It may be that when the Government publishes its response, as it will have to do, it will decide that the report and the response will be sufficient to guide it in this area of policy.  A number of Senators remarked that it is unlikely the Government will be too short on policy and that other considerations will come into it.</P>
      <P>I am not ruling out the question of a White Paper.  However, I raise the question of whether it is necessary, having regard to the very specific nature of many of the recommendations and the fact that they will be subjected to scrutiny by a task force at assistant secretary level, which in turn will be examined by a Cabinet committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Farrelly made a comparison in connection with his visit to Taiwan. He urged me to consider the establishment of a national science and technology park in Ireland.  The STIAC <Col N="161" /> report did not dwell on this aspect for the specific reason that another committee, comprising academics, members of chambers of commerce and others, is examining it.  I assure Senator Farrelly that I note his points and that I am examining this matter.  I am also examining the very interesting literature on how the notion has come a cropper so many times in the past.  I am quite open to advice from anybody who can guide me on tiptoeing through the tulips in this area.</P>
    <P>Senator Lee came closest to expressing the view attributed to the institutions and people engaged in research. To some extent, Senator Finneran expressed a very contrary view when he queried whether we should be throwing money at pure research.  The answer lies somewhere in between.  Senator O'Sullivan is probably correct when she said she would encourage greater links between universities and industry in this area.  I do not think that doing this necessarily sacrifices the better elements of the traditional idea of a university and it is happening.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn is correct when he said he notices, when he looks around the corridors of power, that most people lack technological training.  This is manifestly the case, but it is most emphatically not the case with our young people.  This is the important thing I have learned in the short few months I have held this brief.  The young people in industry and those being turned out by the institutions, if they lack anything, certainly do not lack a technological training disposition.  They are not uncomfortable with it, rather they are eminently comfortable.  The deficit which existed is being corrected and to some extent it has already been corrected. These people are also benefiting from skills learned abroad, before returning to Ireland for the reasons to which Senator Lee referred.</P>
    <P>Senator Lee spotted an apparent statistical inconsistency.  It is a fair point that one can prove anything with statistics. However, I am persuaded that our <Col N="162" /> spend on research and development in this economy is less than it ought to be and considerably less than the successful economies.  Perhaps using global EU figures hides factors such as the spend levels in Greece, Portugal, Ireland or the Cohesion countries generally as compared to the levels in France or Germany, which are considered successful EU economies.  The underlying point is that the business spend is less and that too many businesses consider innovation in the same way as they consider training, as a cost rather than an investment.</P>
    <P>Senator Lee doubts that we just need to improve our capability in this area. He suggests we also need to improve our capability for thinking about science and technology.  I accept the point. Senator O'Sullivan is correct when she said there are no kudos in this element of my brief.  People's eyes glaze over when one talks about science and technology. I cannot say that they reflect on little else in large tracts of my constituency. That is not the case, but we will persevere nonetheless.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Lee returned to the eternal problem of the difficulty with picking winners.  This problem obviously exists.  Senator Finneran made an interesting point when he said that the possibilities for job creation are in the high growth, knowledge based industries and that we harp on too much about the job creation potential of natural resource based industry.  This runs against conventional wisdom, but there is probably some truth in it, especially when one considers how we have traditionally managed our natural resource based industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall Senator Quinn being the only member of a particular commission who stood out against the wisdom of An Bord Bia coming under the Department of farmers.  He may not have used that term, but I do so advisedly.  The Senator is correct.  I represent the Department <Col N="163" /> of Enterprise and Employment but I have never been able to understand why what ought to be our biggest source of jobs is not under the responsibility of the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  It is not a good idea that it ought to be producer driven and under a farming department.  This raises a whole new set of questions.</P>
    <P>I have replied to the questions that were asked about the task force and the Cabinet committee and I will now refer to the question of finance.  Many people are surprised that the total investment in science and technology related areas is in the order of £650 million. It may be as much a question of the planning and foresight that goes into it, how and where it is spent, what are the priorities and the fact that there are vigorously fought turf wars that make this area fraught will all kinds of difficulty.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn pleaded for more investment in this area, taking great care to cover himself from the public spending front.  I also acknowledge that and that there may be a good deal of merit in what he says about redirecting some of the existing resources into an area like this that will create sustainable and new jobs in the future.  However, he did not exactly tell me where we should start and that is the problem.  When one makes an investment in any given area there are howls of opposition from others.</P>
    <P>The small business area was mentioned a number of times.  We have all heard complaints about foreigners who can get as much money as they want by way of grants, etc., when they come to this country but existing small businesses cannot.  This is an extremely difficult situation.  Everything in this country seems to be tax driven; every development seems to be tax driven and the Government has done well to extend inner city renewal to Ballybunion and Westport.</P>
    <P>The answer to Senator O'Sullivan's question on the announcement by the Minister for Finance the day before yesterday <Col N="164" /> is that my Department and the Department of Finance are, and have been, in consultation for some time about taking on board the recommendations of the STIAC report in respect of the taxation area.  The Minister for Finance said he will be introducing a Committee Stage amendment that will encourage and seek to stimulate greater additional investment in research and development and some form of tax credits will be constructed to allow that to happen.  Its purpose is to encourage companies to increase their investment in research and development.</P>
    <P>I can tell Senator Daly &mdash; I thank him and Senator Finneran for their kind wishes &mdash; that I would be happy to visit Shannon.  I understand what he is saying about Shannon Aerospace.  I also understand that, after much agonising, the decision the Minister for Enterprise and Employment has made in respect of this situation is the only pragmatic solution that can be brought forward at the moment.  It is an extremely difficult question for issues that I am afraid are bigger and wider than Shannon Aerospace in terms of whether and how that decision should be made.  However, there is a young, well trained and flexible workforce working competitively at Shannon and it would have been difficult for a Government to explain any other decision than the one that was taken.  However, as Senator Lee pointed out, it does raise questions about the soothsayers in this area who point, for example, to aircraft maintenance and similar kinds of development as the industries of the future.  The disturbing fact about these prognostications is that they were made so recently.  However, I sincerely hope that the Government decision will have secured the situation at Shannon.</P>
    <P>I thank the Members for inviting me to speak.  It has been a good opportunity to ventilate what is an important report and I hope it is only the beginning of our efforts to give, as somebody requested, a higher profile to what is a very important subject.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, to the House.  I remind Senators that they may only speak once on Report Stage, except the proposer of an amendment who may reply to a discussion on it.

    <P>2.  (1) In any proceedings for an offence under the Act of 1908, the judge or the court, as the case may be, shall exclude from the court during the hearing all persons except officers of the court, persons directly concerned in the proceedings, bona fide representatives of the press and such other persons (if any) as the judge or the court, as <Col N="166" /> the case may be, may, in his, her or its discretion, permit to remain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to be back in the Seanad on Report Stage of the Criminal Law (Incest Proceedings)(No. 2) Bill, 1995.  I will discuss amendments Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 together.  Senators will recall that on Committee Stage I undertook to bring forward a package of amendments on Report Stage which would encapsulate the thinking behind the amendments tabled by Senator Mulcahy and would meet the concerns which prompted Senator Honan to table amendments for the purposes of applying certain provisions of the Rape Acts to incest offences.</P>
      <P>I explained that I had no difficulty in principle with the amendments proposed by the Senators and I indicated that I would go to the parliamentary draftsman to prepare appropriate amendments for Report Stage which would try to encompass the requirements put forward on Committee Stage. I am glad to report that that process has been completed and I am able to fulfil the commitments I gave on Committee Stage to introduce additional amendments.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of these amendments is to replace sections 2 and 3 of the original Bill as published with more extensive provisions with the overall result that the type of arrangements which currently apply for the reporting of rape trials would, in effect, also operate in criminal incest proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 1 inserts a new section 2 into the Bill which provides that where a person is being tried under the Punishment of Incest Act, 1908, the persons who can be in court will be court officers, persons directly concerned in the proceedings, bona fide representatives of the press and such <Col N="167" /> other persons as the court shall permit. One of the effects of this proposed section, which is modelled on section 6 of the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981, as amended by the Criminal Law (Rape)(Amendment) Act, 1990, is that the press will be able to attend and report on incest trials subject to certain restrictions provided for in amendment No. 3, which I will discuss shortly.</P>
    <P>In addition, the section I propose to include in the Bill allows the court to permit a relative or friend to accompany an incest victim to court.  We are all aware of the difficult situation victims face in court and I have no doubt there is a need to ensure that a person who has been a victim of incest, in particular a child, is entitled to the support of a person they can trust when they are required to give evidence in court.  A number of Senators spoke about this provision on Second and Committee Stages.  I stress that the type of arrangements I propose in that regard for incest cases has operated successfully under the Rape Acts.  Essentially, I am mirroring that proposal which will allow designated people, with the court's permission, to accompany a person giving evidence in an incest case.</P>
    <P>The amendment also reproduces the requirement in the current section 2 of the Bill that any verdict, decision or sentence in a case arising under the 1908 Act must be announced in public.  Not only will bona fide members of the press be allowed to be in court to report but, as I pointed out to Senator Mulcahy on Committee Stage, I have ensured that the verdict and sentence, if any, will be announced in public.</P>
    <P>Such a provision will guarantee that a person or a body with a specific interest in the welfare of an incest victim &mdash; for example &mdash; a health board &mdash; can ascertain the outcome of an incest prosecution. It is important that the elements relating to the bona fide press and a public announcement are included in the Bill.  Senator Mulcahy did not include that in his amendment. I am anxious that section 2 of the original <Col N="168" /> Bill is left in the Bill.  It will ensure that if a health board or caring agency does not have the time to be in court for the entire case, they could arrange for someone to be present for the public announcement of the verdict and sentence.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 2 is a technical one &mdash; it simply repeals the existing section 2, which will be replaced by the new section proposed in amendment No. 1.  I have modified the original section 2 of the Bill so it is no longer necessary to leave it in the Bill.  Once amendment No. 1 is agreed to by the Seanad, the provisions of section 2 will be encompassed in the new section.</P>
    <P>The purpose of amendment No. 3 is to strengthen the Bill by replacing the direction procedure provided for in the existing section 2 (2) with a more comprehensive method of ensuring that the names and other details of incest victims are not made public.  The amendment achieves that purpose by providing for a new section 3 which contains a prohibition under which once a person is charged with an incest offence, no matter likely to lead the public to identify that person or the victim shall be published in a written publication available to the public or be broadcast.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that a similar amendment was proposed by Senator Mulcahy which mirrored the provision in the Rape Acts.  I said I had a problem with his amendment because of the word &ldquo;complainant&rdquo; which would not be appropriate in an incest case.  That problem has been overcome with the assistance of the parliamentary draftsman who has come up with a wording which refers to an incest victim as &ldquo;the person in relation to whom the offence is alleged to have been committed&rdquo;.  In addition, the opportunity has been taken to define the terms &ldquo;broadcast&rdquo; and &ldquo;written publication&rdquo; in the same way as they have been defined in the Rape Acts.  This amendment makes it an offence for anyone to make public the identity of the person charged with incest and the name of the victim.  I was not happy that the section in the Bill <Col N="169" /> was as watertight as I wanted it to be in relation to the identification of the victim and the accused person.</P>
    <P>The additional section proposed in the amendment makes it an offence to disclose information which could identify a person as the perpetrator of an incest offence or the victim of such an offence.  In view of the close family relationship which will exist between the parties in incest cases, the anonymity of the accused will not be lifted at any stage.  Senators must understand that by making known the name of the member of the family, the victim is automatically identified because incest involves a member of a family.  To that extent this represents a departure from the provisions of the Rape Acts which permit the name of a convicted rapist to be published after a conviction has been obtained.  Senators will appreciate that there are compelling reasons for adopting a different approach in relation to proceedings taken under the Punishment of Incest Act, 1908, and that every effort must be made to protect the identity of the victim and the family involved.  In this section I am departing from the conditions in the Rape Acts for good and safe reasons in order to protect the identity of the victim and the family involved.</P>
    <P>The prohibition on the publication of broadcasting material caught by the proposed new section 3 extends not only to a journalist but also to a proprietor and editor of a newspaper.  This is also the arrangement which operates under the equivalent provisions in the Rape Acts.  Some people might argue that it would be sufficient for the person who discloses the relevant information to be charged with an offence.  However, it has become the practice that in the case of such offences proprietors and editors should be held responsible for the actions of others who operate under their authority.  Otherwise, a person who had adopted a policy that sensationalist matters should be published might escape liability by claiming they had not published the material which could lead to the identification of a rape <Col N="170" /> or incest victim.  This is necessary in practice to ensure that an editor or publisher of a newspaper or publication, who could claim their journalists have freedom and they cannot stop them, is also held responsible.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 4 makes provisions for the penalties which will apply in respect of an offence under the proposed new section 3.  The penalties provided for are in line with similar provisions in the Rape Acts, except in the case of fines where account has been taken of the changes in the value of money.</P>
    <P>A further section, section 4, would be included in the Bill.  That section is in standard form, but it also provides for a defence by a person charged under it that he or she was not aware, did not suspect, or had no reason to suspect that the matter published or broadcast could not be disclosed.  Such a defence is also permitted under the Rape Acts.  The reason for its inclusion is to prevent injustice &mdash; for example, where disclosure is made inadvertently.  It does not, however, offer an easy means of escape from liability for a person who is prosecuted for a disclosure because, in order to come within the scope of that defence, the person must prove in court that under the particular circumstances he or she is entitled to be relieved of criminal responsibility.  It will not be sufficient to say that he or she did not know they were not entitled to disclose the material in question.  The court must be satisfied on the basis of proper evidence provided by the accused that that was the case.</P>
    <P>I tried to think of an example where someone might be able to use this in their defence by saying that they could not have been aware of making something public which could help to identify a person.  It is difficult to find examples because the section in the Rape Acts has not been used by anyone prosecuted for identifying someone in court whom they are not supposed to identify.  The best example I could get was a case where a judge or someone might say it was appalling that a particular crime <Col N="171" /> was committed in a small town in the west when a carnival or festival was taking place.  It might not be clear to an editor or journalist that by saying this took place during a carnival in the west they may be identifying a person because there may have been only one festival or carnival taking place at that time. Someone may be able to draw a conclusion that it happened in a particular town or location.  One could argue there was no way they could have known that would help to identify a victim.</P>
    <P>I trawled my mind to find an occasion where someone could validly say that information was given without the slightest idea that it would cause a victim's identity to become known.  To the best of my knowledge, no examples have been quoted in court.  This provision is included to protect the victim and someone who, unwittingly, might be prosecuted for identifying a victim.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 5 repeals section 3 of the Bill which is concerned with the situation where a person is charged in the same proceedings with incest and rape offences.  The effect of the section is that the arrangements which apply in respect of the reporting of rape trials would also apply in joint incest and rape cases, even where the rape charge might not be proceeded with.  As I have indicated, the amendments I am proposing will achieve the result that the relevant procedures laid down by the Rape Acts will also apply in relation to incest prosecutions. In the circumstances, there will be no role for section 3 if those amendments are adopted.  Accordingly, I am proposing its deletion.</P>
    <P>I want Senators to be clear about what I am doing.  In the original Bill I indicated that sections of the Rape Acts would come into play where, as in the case referred to by Mr. Justice Carney, there were two original charges of incest and rape.  The rape charge was subsequently dropped and the trial was then conducted under the 1908 Act, as opposed to the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981, and the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990.  That meant all <Col N="172" /> the conditions applying to a trial of an incest case under the 1908 Act were being used.</P>
    <P>I am now proposing to amend the Act to take on board a number of the existing conditions in the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990.  There is no need for that section now because, even if a charge of rape and incest is brought, the rape charge is dropped and the case reverts back to the 1908 Act. That Act will now be strengthened if the Senators adopt these amendments to mirror the Rape Acts.  It is superfluous to the purpose of the original Bill.  I hope Senators agree to adopt these amendments.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 7 proposes to repeal section 5 of the Punishment of Incest Act, 1908.  This section states in the original 1908 Act that all proceedings under the Act shall be held <i>in camera.</i> Senators will appreciate that in order to give effect to the amendments I am proposing, it will be necessary to repeal section 5 of the 1908 Act.  That is provided for in amendment No. 7, which is a technical amendment.  Once Senators agree to adopt the other amendments, one could not leave section 5 of the 1908 Act as it stands.  Mr. Justice Carney concentrated on that section in his judgments because he was defining what the term <i>in camera</i> meant.  In amending the Act, I hope Senators will accept that is no longer relevant.</P>
    <P>The amendments I have put forward for consideration by this House involve substantial changes to the Bill.  We should strive to achieve the best provisions in this Bill.  For that reason I am happy to have the time to review the discussions we had on Second and Committee Stages and to be able to come back with an improved Bill and one which I hope will meet with the approval of the House.  I have taken on board the views that have been expressed during the debates on all sides, both by Senators who tabled amendments and those who did not.  I believe that the amendments I am moving reflect and meet all the relevant concerns <Col N="173" /> insofar as it is possible to do so in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I hope that Senators, in adopting my amendments, will see that their work and my own, as well as that of the parliamentary draftsman and my departmental staff, has greatly strengthened this Bill.  It is a good piece of legislation which will now be brought before the Dáil and in turn will be signed into law.</P>

      <P>I would like to remind Members that a Senator may speak only once on Report Stage, with the exception of the proposer of an amendment who may reply to discussion on the amendment.  I make that point for your own benefit so that you will know the guidelines and the rules.</P>

      <P>I am obliged for your guidance, Sir.  This is a case where maximum flexibility should be allowed, especially considering the manner in which we proceeded on Committee Stage when the Minister graciously accepted certain of our amendments both in spirit and in principle.  However, the Minister said that she would like to come back to us with her own particular wording covering those amendments.  It was all very amicable and agreed, but we now find on Report Stage that we have a wording before us that we did not have great notice of, except in the amendments which we were given some days ago.  However, I am happy to admit that the Minister's wording is one with which the Fianna Fáil Party can largely agree.</P>
      <P>I will not repeat any of the arguments that were advanced on Committee Stage, they are well known.  This Bill arises out of the decision of Mr. Justice Carney and another decision which gave rise to concern that the caring agencies would not be able to report incest cases nor alert the authorities to the possibility that people might reoffend.  The Minister quickly and commendably came to this House with a Bill which we have altered, and there has been almost total bipartisan agreement for all the changes that have been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="174" /> I wish to make some specific points on the Minister's amendments.  I notice that in relation to amendment No. 1 she has not taken up my suggestion that we would include the charges.  Amendment No. 1, subsection (2) states that &ldquo;the verdict or decision and the sentence (if any) shall be announced in public.&rdquo;  But there is a case to be made for including the charges, because obviously one cannot put the verdict and sentence properly in context if one is not fully apprised of the charges.  One can, of course, publish the charges without indicating the identity of the person concerned. One can say that Mr. A.B. is charged with, etc., or that Ms A.C. is charged with, etc.  Unless there is a technical or legal problem with including the word &ldquo;charges&rdquo;, I do not see why it should be excluded.  Perhaps the Minister could consider that, if she has an opportunity to speak to her draftspeople.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 2 follows from what was agreed on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In relation to amendment No. 3, I want to thank the parliamentary drafts-people &mdash; if that is the correct phrase these days &mdash; for the wording &ldquo;a person in relation to whom the offence is alleged to have been committed...&rdquo;. That is a formula used in other pieces of legislation and therefore it makes sense. Another suggestion would have been &ldquo;the alleged victim&rdquo; because a victim is not a complainant and is gender neutral. However, if for some technical reason the drafting experts feel that their wording is better, then, although I might have the capacity to argue with them, I do not feel that it would serve any purpose to do so.</P>
    <P>Also, in relation to amendment No. 3, a point arises that I may have missed on Committee Stage.  Subsection (2) contains the wording taken from the Rape Act.  On Committee Stage, the Fianna Fáil Party made the point that the wording from the Rape Act in relation to this should be transposed into the Incest Act.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to give some last minute reflection to the fact that we <Col N="175" /> do not include the writer of the article. Subsection (2) (a) states</P>
    <P>If any matter is published or broadcast in contravention of subsection (1) of this section, the following persons shall be guilty of an offence namely:</P>
    <P>(a) in the case of matter published in a newspaper or periodical publication, the proprietor, the editor and the publisher thereof,</P>
    <P>Nobody is as aware of the danger of identifying the person about whom they have written as the writer of the piece. The Minister will also be aware that in defamation proceedings one can sue the writer, editor, publisher, printer, distributor and, in theory, the boy or girl who is disseminating the newspaper on a street corner.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, everybody who touches on a defamation can be responsible for that defamation.  I am not saying that it is an oversight on the Minister's part &mdash; perhaps it is my own oversight &mdash; but it seems odd that the actual writer of the material is not included, though there may be a good reason for this.  However, I would advance a general proposition in two stages.  First, that the writer of an article covering an incest case is in the best position to know if that material is going to lead members of the public to identify the victim.  Second, if the writer knowingly breaches the need for confidentiality then nobody should be as punished as the writer.  I do not think that anybody would disagree with that.</P>
    <P>As we know, the vast majority of journalists are extremely responsible, but we also have to guard against a tiny minority of people who might not be so responsible.  I do not want to repeat my earlier comments about the need for guidelines to be drawn up on responsible reporting of incest and other sexual offences cases.  However, there is a very fine line between accurate reporting of such cases and the prurient reporting of them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="176" /> We are not dealing with censorship here, but the Minister said on Committee Stage that she would consider guidelines. Studies are being undertaken into this and it will be some time before progress can be made.  But if anybody oversteps the mark in identifying a victim and if a writer knowingly breaches confidentiality, there is a case to be made for including the writer or, if it is a television programme, the presenter or whoever is at the coal face making the report.</P>
    <P>Staying with amendment No. 3, subsection (4) deals with the definitions of &ldquo;broadcast&rdquo; and &ldquo;written publication&rdquo;. These definitions may be taken from similar Acts of the Oireachtas where broadcasting is involved.  With the advance of technology there are ways of communicating information other than by writing and broadcasting.  For example, E-mail would be one such case.  Is the Minister happy that the transmission by electronic or satellite means is covered by the wording of this Bill?</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) (c) of amendment No. 3 refers to &ldquo;... in the case of matter broadcast, any person who transmits or provides the programme in which the broadcast is made and any person who performs functions in relation to the programme ...&rdquo;.  As I understand it, broadcasting is normally by means of wireless telegraphy.  Will the Minister reassure the House that she is happy this will cover all possible forms of modern communications which are now commonly in use?  Indeed, I will be giving the Minister my E-mail number shortly and we can communicate by that means.</P>

      <P>In subsection (3) of amendment No. 4, is the Minister satisfied that the issue of the onus of proof <Col N="177" /> lies on the person seeking to use the ignorance clause as a defence?  I understand this is a standard legal phraseology. In other Acts it can be stated in a more trenchant way.</P>
      <P>A further question of reasonableness arises, and the Minister touched on this. Is recklessness covered by this?  Does this cover the case where an editor or proprietor of a newspaper or a radio or television station is uncaring and reckless as to the contents of any report in this regard?  A reckless person is not aware and neither suspects nor has reason to suspect.  If somebody is reckless as to whether the provisions of this Bill were going to be breached there should be a sanction.  By &ldquo;reckless&rdquo; I mean gross negligence or &ldquo;uncaringness&rdquo;, but in legal parlance it is a total lack of care in relation to what transpires.</P>
      <P>With regard to amendment No. 5, the Minister is correct that this is no longer necessary and the reasons were explained.  It is obvious that if there is a joint prosecution under the Rape Acts and the incest legislation, no matter which prosecution is dropped the remaining one will be covered by the confidentiality and anonymity provisions.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 6 was a matter of total agreement.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleagues and I in Fianna Fáil gave much thought to the issue of weighing up the pros and cons of reporting such cases.  On Committee Stage I mentioned a speech made by the Director of Public Prosecutions on this matter.  The correct approach is that it is important for the caring agencies and for society that such cases are reported. It is also essential they are reported in a responsible mature manner.  If we find <Col N="178" /> there is a prurient concentration on the detail of these cases, such that the public is disquieted or disgusted, and if there is irresponsible reporting of these cases by dwelling on these aspects, there will be a need for guidelines for the reporting of these cases.</P>
    <P>Many mistakes were made in the past. The DPP has said there is a possibility of these crimes being committed by people who are imitating the details of other crimes.  He has a long experience of these cases.  In so far as we are trying to remedy wrong we are doing good work, and I hope that those whom we are allowing access to these cases for the good of society and victims will also act in a mature responsible way.  If they do not, it will be incumbent on the Minister to act quickly so that there will not be a lopsided concentration on some of the more disgusting aspects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's amendments as they have greatly improved the Bill.  A great deal of time and thought has gone into them, and a great deal of generosity in accepting the amendments put forward on Committee Stage.  I hope it will encourage the Minister to introduce other Bills here.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 1 is particularly important in allowing the judge to permit someone to stay in court, as was described in the debates on the rape legislation, as a friend of the person against whom the offence is alleged to have been committed.  This is even more important in incest cases than in rape cases.  In rape cases there are often a lot of other people from the alleged victim's family to support them.  However, in an incest case one can see how easily the child can become isolated within the family because their reporting what has happened to them may be bringing down the structure of the family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This provision comes at a good time with the recent introduction by the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, of initiatives between members of the health boards and the Garda.  There will be a need to consider those applications when one looks at section 1 in particular. <Col N="179" /> A second social worker may be needed as the friend of the child in court.  The first social worker may be considered to be too concerned with the persons connected with the proceedings as they would have to be involved in the investigation of the case.  I am sure the health boards will make available some other suitable person as a friend of the child in these cases.</P>
    <P>The guidelines I mentioned were brought in partly by the Minister's Department and I welcome them.  It does not go as far as mandatory reporting but it goes a long way towards it.  I am sure this Minister, and the other Ministers involved, will bear in mind the urgings of groups of social workers that more staff will be needed.  I am sure she has noticed an editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i> which pointed out how very difficult these cases are for social workers. There is a certain amount of burn-out among this staff and senior social staff must be put in place.  I am sure the Bill will be very important in providing for a humane approach towards these cases rather than, as might have happened initially, leaving children in very isolated situations.</P>
    <P>The <i>in camera</i> part of the 1908 legislation does not need to apply.  I would be grateful if the Minister would look at what we mean by <i>&ldquo;in camera&rdquo;;</i> maybe she is doing this at the moment.  It would be extraordinarily important if this sort of legislation applied to family law cases.  These are cases where the same amount of anonymity is required but the Minister has dealt with this in the amendment very satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>In cases such as incest and family law cases there is little opportunity for members of the public to know about what they can complain, which is another point we must consider. Nobody want prurient details in the papers but it is important that people know that if crimes have been committed against them in the family, this can be complained about and that there is justice.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="180" /> Perhaps the courts could allow in young impecunious reporters to write law reports showing delay in dealing with family law cases &mdash; which I am sure the Minister regrets as much as anybody else &mdash; from one to four years.  It is children who are at the centre of all these cases.  I urge the Minister to bring forward similar legislation, or even guidelines, for judges on the <i>in camera</i> reporting of law cases.  A friend for the family, or the divided family in these cases, could be very important.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 5 proposes the deletion of lines 23 to 33.  I thought there could be some confusion and that there could be two trials, one for incest and one for rape.  I am very glad this has been clarified.  I warmly welcome the amendments introduced by the Minister and urge her to apply this philosophy to the legislation on family law which I hope she will introduce.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister and am pleased to see her in this House with such a range of amendments which take account of the concerns of this side of the House.  I pay tribute to the generosity of the Minister in acknowledging our concerns.</P>
      <P>It is almost five weeks since the Second Stage of the Bill was taken.  At that time I said that a more comprehensive Bill could be brought in if a little more time was given.  All the consideration the Minister has given to the issues we raised, and which she herself accepted were of great concern, has enabled a much better Bill to be brought before the House today, which will be debated by the other House and, we hope, passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 effectively delete the original section 2 and substitute a new section.  They provide for the exclusion of the public from a hearing, with the exception of bona fide representatives of the press and, as the Minister and other Senators have mentioned, a friend who will support the child involved in the case.  This is very welcome.  The amendments also provide for the giving of the verdict in public. <Col N="181" /> The principle of both these changes is what I sought in my Bill.  Although the Minister is bringing forward these changes in a different way, she is achieving the results I wanted.  I am delighted she is doing this and I thank her.</P>
    <P>It is accepted by all that allowing bona fide representatives of the press to attend incest cases, as is the case in rape trials, was an acceptance of the concern of Members of the Oireachtas that the public should be made aware, through sensitive and restrained reporting, of various crimes and offences which are perpetrated against women and children. We should create a climate of public awareness which is supportive of women and children who are victims in these cases and which would act as an encouragement for other women and children to come forward.  The fact that victims of these crimes would not feel that they were alone and would know there are other people against whom these crimes have been committed, would encourage them to come forward, as we all want.  Amendment No. 1 provides for this.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 provides for the anonymity of persons charged and the persons against whom the offences were committed.  All of us wanted details of the cases to be known so that public opinion would be supportive of the victim. This was sacrosanct to our concerns and I very much welcome amendment No. 3.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 4 provides for penalties on people who do not safeguard anonymity, which is most important. The Minister is also proposing to repeal section 5 of the 1908 Act, which was one of the provisions I sought.</P>
    <P>We were all of one mind on what we wanted to achieve but the difficulty was the speed with which this could be achieved and the effectiveness of what we were doing.  We were willing to acknowledge that the Minister accepted the principles of what we wanted and in bringing forward these amendments, she has done exactly what we wished. She has shown courage in doing that. This has been a very good day for <Col N="182" /> democracy.  By introducing legislation in either House, listening to what all the Members of that House have to say and using our combined wisdom and efforts, we can ensure that better legislation is enacted.</P>
    <P>However, I have one concern.  The Minister said that one of the provisions in my Bill was outside the scope of this Bill.  This related to sections 1 and 2 of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1935, which deal with defilement of girls under 15 years of age.  We are not dealing with this here but I am a concerned that anonymity is not guaranteed in these cases.  Many child abuse prosecutions are brought under these sections.  This is the offence with which the man in the X case was charged.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave a commitment that she would review this and bring forward legislation when it was concluded.  Yesterday we had a press release detailing all the legislation that has been promised and the Leader gave details of the legislation which will be introduced this session.  This is a very important issue about which I know the Minister is concerned. The Minister of State, Deputy Currie, also spoke about this on Second Stage.  I am very concerned that this issue may be lost when the Bill is passed.  I would like the Minister to give some indication when she proposes to deal with the loophole relating to sections 1 and 2 of the 1935 Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on her open approach to the Committee Stage of the Bill and her response on Report Stage.  It is important that we, as Members of the Oireachtas, have a real role to play when legislation is going through the House.  Too often, even though we make good points, some Ministers feel it is a comment on them if this or the other House has a direct input and suggests that Ministers did not get it right at the start.  That would be totally negative and for that reason we congratulate the Minister on her attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now have a much improved Bill. All sides took part in a detailed Committee <Col N="183" /> Stage debate.  We agreed in principle with a great deal of what was said on the other side, even though we had not put down the amendments and the Minister has taken this on board.  If that approach were to be adopted by Governments there would be a much better attitude and we, as Senators, would play a stronger role as legislators. The same would apply to the other House.  That is what we are supposed to do: to bring our sometimes inexpert commonsense to bear on the complex area of drafting legislation.  I commend the Minister for her approach.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 1 improves the Bill dramatically.  It allows incest victims to have a support person with them in court.  This is an important provision.  It is important that an incest victim &mdash; I accept Senator Henry's point that perhaps &ldquo;victim&rdquo; is the wrong word but for the purposes of this discussion I will continue to use it &mdash; should have in court the support of somebody who is close to them, who understands them, who will listen to them and who has empathy with them.  It must be an isolated and lonely experience to have to go to court for what must be the biggest crisis any family could confront, an incest prosecution in court.  The victim is in a vulnerable position and needs every support possible.  This amendment caters for that situation.</P>
    <P>It further allows the caring professions, such as health board personnel and others who are assisting or advising the incest victim, to be present during the proceedings.  It gives wide discretion to the court to have such people present throughout the full hearing and not just for the delivery of the verdict.  Often incest victims have built up a relationship with the caring personnel from health boards and so forth and they lean on them for support.  During the interim a personal relationship develops on the part of the victim as a result of their vulnerability, while on the health board side a professional relationship develops in the course of advising the victim.  In many cases the health board person is <Col N="184" /> of key importance.  Every case is unique, but it is important that those giving the professional support the victim received from the time of reporting the case can be present in court and that the courts have discretion to allow that person or persons to be in court when the case is heard and to allow them to support the victim.</P>
    <P>It is also important that the verdict or decision is announced in public.  Publicising court cases in either the local or national press is the subject of frequent debate.  It is important that our courts are open and transparent and that the public is admitted.  That lends the court system a credibility it would not have if courts only met in private.</P>
    <P>It is equally important, as amendment No. 3 provides, that the identity of the victim is not known and that there is no danger of it being made known. However, on Second Stage we recognised the fact that absolute anonymity is impossible because a certain number of people will know, depending on the family circumstances and the extended family's knowledge of the case.  Nevertheless, the identity of the person charged with the offence and of the victim must be concealed as far as possible. Within that boundary the maximum amount of information should be made available to the public to ensure that there is transparency in the decision of the courts and about the level of such criminal acts.</P>
    <P>We are aware that the more open a discussion is about such problems in society the more likely it is that people will come forward and reveal terrible situations which previously they would have kept to themselves and for which they would have continued to suffer for several more years.  As a result of this openness people are coming forward ten, 15 and 20 years after enduring substantial difficulties and suffering as a result of the treatment they received from their families or from people outside their families.</P>
    <P>I again congratulate the Minister for proposing these amendments.  Members from both sides of the House who spent <Col N="185" /> over four hours offering our views to the Minister on Committee Stage feel the effort was worthwhile.  There is a great sense of satisfaction and achievement in finding that our views have been accepted on Report Stage as was promised.  Too often in the past we have done the same only to receive no response or consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a number of queries for the Minister.  However, my principal reason for contributing to the debate is to compliment the Minister on how she has responded to the debates on Second and Committee Stages.</P>
      <P>Like Senator Neville, I believe this House has the character and the capacity to look objectively at legislation. It has the capacity to improve legislation, provided there is a response and recognition from the Minister who is conducting the legislation through the Oireachtas.  Far too often in the past a willingness to respond to the capacity of this House in that regard was not forthcoming. As it is forthcoming so willingly on this occasion from the present Minister, I must join in complimenting her. She has recognised the value of this Chamber in proposing beneficial changes to legislation on its passage through this House.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 1 deals with the manner in which the verdict and sentence can be announced and reported in public.  The point I wish to make is linked to a certain degree with the point made by Senator Mulcahy.  The charges cannot be announced in public or reported in the media.  In practical terms what form of words will the judge use to communicate his decision to the public? The Minister may well say that it is a matter for the judge.  It may also be that the same response could apply to the reporting of this in the press and media.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the fault is mine, but I wonder how the judge can say that person A is guilty and the sentence is such and such without indicating what the verdict and sentence are related to.  How does a report of this appear in the media? Does it state that person X has been <Col N="186" /> found guilty and sentenced?  There cannot be any reference to the charges.  As there cannot be any reference to the charges I doubt that there will be a tendency to publish at all.  As a result we will return to the problem that gave rise to the decision of Judge Carney.  A rape charge was dropped and an incest charge proceeded with and, under the 1908 Act there could be no reporting of the matter.  If a reporter is restricted to simply reporting that X has been found guilty, without saying of what, and sentenced accordingly, this may be considered not worth reporting.  It may be a failure on my part to understand what is involved here.  I have no problem with that outcome but I am simply looking for an explanation from the Minister.  I understand very clearly the example she quoted of the need to restrict publication, especially in relation to small communities.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 refers, as has been already mentioned, to the print and broadcast methods of communicating information. There are, as has been said, other methods.  I am sure the Minister recognises that and that, if necessary, she will consider means of including those other methods.</P>
    <P>I welcome the penalties in amendment No. 4, which I believe are set at the right level.  However, I have a problem with section 4 (3) which states:</P>
    <P>It shall be a defence for a person who is charged with an offence under section 3 of this Act to prove that at the time of the alleged offence the person was not aware, and neither suspected nor had reason to suspect, that the matter alleged to have been published or broadcast was matter specified in the said section 3.</P>
    <P>I do not know how a person could validly expect to advance such a defence with regard to an incest case.  The subsection could only have very limited application and I agree with that. However, it baffles my imagination as to how somebody could say, in dealing with what is clearly an incest case, that <Col N="187" /> they neither suspected nor had reason to suspect that that was the case. However, I am sure that there are reasons for including it.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on recognising the capacity of this House to improve legislation in an objective way. I hope that other Ministers in the future will be as responsive and positive in their dealings with this Chamber.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Senators for their constructive input into this debate and for their words of compliment and commendation on the manner in which I have handled this legislation. I agree with the comments which have been made that it is essential for the combined wisdom of all Members of both Houses to come into play in legislation. It has, perhaps, been a fault of successive Ministers of various parties that they have, as Senator Neville said, regarded accepting amendments as some sort of criticism of their role.</P>
      <P>It is particularly important now, with the increasing involvement of Members in committees, for a much higher percentage of legislation and work to be made available for both Houses of the Oireachtas to deal with.  Legislation will have to be prepared as quickly as possible and brought to the House.  Sometimes there may not have been time to fully consider elements of new legislation and the combined experience and wisdom of Members in their own walks of life &mdash; both before and during their time in this House &mdash; can be brought to bear in amending and improving legislation. I hope that I will be in a position as Minister for Justice to continue to leave myself open to listening to and taking on board valid recommendations made by Members, with the express purpose of improving legislation.  The legislation which we are enacting in 1995 may be discussed in 2055 when we are all dead and buried and gone to our just rewards, even Senator Mulcahy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>We are now discussing a piece of legislation which was enacted in 1908, when nobody in this House was born, so it is important that we scrutinise legislation.</P>
      <P>As I said on Second and Committee Stages, Members of the Opposition publish Bills from time to time which they exhort Ministers to accept lock, stock and barrel.  It is my duty and responsibility as a Minister to ensure that any legislation to which I put my name, and which becomes an Act of this State, stands the test of time.  I will be open in accepting amendments and looking at legislation brought forward by the Opposition.  However, sometimes the Opposition has the luxury of putting forward a Bill very quickly without the restrictions of examining how it interfaces with many other pieces of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my job and responsibility, and that of my Department, to examine each line, word, comma and apostrophe in proposed legislation to ensure that it does not cause damage to existing legislation. That may be tedious and result in a certain amount of criticism of me or other Ministers.  However, that is how I will continue to operate to ensure that legislation will stand the test of time and that when our grandchildren are in these Houses they will not say that if Nora Owen had taken more care with legislation when she was the Minister, some of the subsequent difficulties could have been avoided.  We are bringing in this legislation because when the Act was enacted in 1908 people could not have anticipated how it might have been interpreted many years later.  Mr. <Col N="189" /> Justice Carney, in his wisdom, interpreted the <i>in camera</i> section.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that it appears that all my amendments will be accepted without a vote.  Senator Mulcahy raised the issue of the word &ldquo;charges&rdquo;.  It was very important for me to have in this Bill the provision that the sentence and the verdict would he announced publicly. That was an element which Mr. Justice Carney made great import of in his judgment, where he said that not only could bona fide journalists not be in the court, but he could not even announce the verdict and sentence, if any, in public.  Senator Howard also referred to this.  It is conceivable that even with the amendment allowing bona fide journalists to be present in court, they may decide that the case is not worth reporting.</P>
    <P>It must be provided that the verdict and sentence are made public because a caring agency may know a case about which it was concerned was being heard, although no names were used.  If the agency wanted to find out what was happening, even if the case was not reported in the newspapers, it has the right to find out the verdict and sentence from an official of the court because it has been announced publicly. Even without the safeguard of it appearing in the newspaper, that must be available.</P>
    <P>I will examine the position in relation to charges.  I agree with Senator Howard; I do not believe it will be possible for a judge to announce the verdict or sentence, if any, without saying what the charge is, that the accused is guilty of the charge and what sentence he is imposing.  I think it would be superfluous to include the word &ldquo;charges&rdquo; but I will look at this again when I bring the Bill to the Dáil.  I do not think it is necessary.</P>
    <P>Also, the type of case will undoubtedly be mentioned in the reporting by bona fide journalists.  If it is an incest case, that is the what the charge will be; if the person is charged with both rape and incest that can be made clear.  In my view the public announcement of the <Col N="190" /> verdict and sentence is what is crucial so that any member of an agency can find out what it is.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy spoke about the new section 3(2) and asked why the writer or journalist was not included.  I stress the offence is one of publishing and making public the article, not of writing it.  If someone was being charged with the offence of publishing information leading to the anonymity of the victim being breached, the writer of the story would also be involved in the charge.</P>
    <P>The reason the writer is not mentioned in the section is that the offence is not writing but publishing.  The journalists can write as much as they want in the backrooms of newspaper offices but the offence is for the publisher or editor allowing that to appear in the newspaper.  It puts a great onus of responsibility on sub-editors and those who allow the article to be published because a junior journalist could be covering a case and writing the story. There is the safeguard that it is up to the publisher or editor to ensure that is not done.  That is why the offence is for publishing and not writing the article. Who knows how many articles are written but never get into the newspapers?</P>
    <P>The Senator also mentioned the definition of &ldquo;broadcast&rdquo;.  This is taken directly from the definition used in the Acts on rape.  It may well be that technology has changed since 1990 when the last Act was introduced.  I am not sure if E-mail was as readily available at that time; I bow to the Senator's superior knowledge as he is a good deal younger than I and probably much more expert in these areas.  Those of us over a certain age are struggling to get to grips with modern technology and I have not mastered E-mail yet.  The wording in the Act of 1990 may need to be amended. The main concern of the amendment is to prevent the disclosure of the identity of victims to the general public and this has undoubtedly been achieved.</P>
    <P>If there is now an extended concept of the word &ldquo;broadcast&rdquo; to include E-mail or use of computer or telephone <Col N="191" /> technology to transfer information, that would affect all Acts using the word and the position would have to be tackled broadly in a Bill to modernise the use of the word.  The point is well made and I will pass it on to my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins, because I imagine it would be under his auspices that a Bill would be drafted to redefine &ldquo;broadcast&rdquo; and reinterpret it for all other legislation using that terminology.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy asked if recklessness would be included under section 4; I believe it would be.  The only defence someone can raise not to be convicted of an offence of making another person's name known is a defence under the new section 4 (3), as mentioned by Senator Howard, which states:</P>
    <P>It shall be a defence for a person who is charged with an offence under section 3 of this Act to prove that at the time of the alleged offence the person was not aware, and neither suspected nor had reason to suspect, that the matter alleged to have been published or broadcast was matter specified in the said section 3.</P>
    <P>I am not sure I understand Senator Mulcahy's point about recklessness.  This amendment provides that one shall not be reckless in reporting and publishing a case.  If the publisher of an article is proven to be reckless, the only defence he or she might have is of not knowing he or she was being reckless but if recklessness is proven I think the Bill covers it.  I do not think anyone can claim he or she was only reckless; if the person has published something which allows the victim's identity to become known he or she will be found guilty of an offence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister have that looked at also?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I will but I do not fully understand the Senator's point so perhaps he could speak to me later.  I am of the opinion that the Bill is carefully <Col N="192" /> worded in such a way that the only defence is based where one is not aware or suspected or had reason to suspect the matter alleged to have been published or broadcast was a matter specified in section 3.  I will return to this when replying to Senator Howard.</P>
      <P>Senator Mulcahy asked if we would consider publishing guidelines of how cases should be reported but I envisage it would be extremely difficult to devise them.  The cases may be quite different. As Senator Henry said, it is important that in the reporting of cases there would be no undue prurience and sensationalism.</P>
      <P>It is also important for people suffering in silence and anonymity in their homes who know something their father, brother or grandfather is doing to them is wrong but are not aware it is an offence.  The publication of what may be distressing details of what someone else has suffered may allow a person to identify that what is happening to her is not right and she should not have to suffer it.</P>
      <P>By drawing up guidelines one may prevent the publication of information which in turn would protect someone else and give him or her the courage to speak to someone, to say what is happening to her and that she always thought she had to put up with it, that it was perfectly normal for a member of her family to do that to her.  Those people should not have to endure that.</P>
      <P>By and large, our newspapers and broadcasters are conscious they must not create circumstances where copycat cases may happen.  I also respect what the DPP said in the Burren Law School so I will keep a watching brief over this area.  I recently met representatives from the National Newspapers of Ireland; that organisation expressed its concern that anything their newspapers would report would not be seen as being reported only for reasons of sensationalism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sadly, these awful things do happen. It shakes the complacency of people who believe such things do not happen in Ireland.  Unfortunately they happen <Col N="193" /> all the time and it is important that we, as legislators, do not do anything which puts anyone at risk of not coming forward and making known what is happening to him or her.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry welcomed the new guidelines published to encourage close co-operation between health board workers and the Garda.  I appreciate her support.  This new set of guidelines will hopefully ensure that the kind of cases that have come to light only in recent years &mdash; and I am speaking of people who suffered for many years, some of them from a very young age into adulthood &mdash; will not be highlighted 20 years down the road, and responsibility for lack of action being laid at our door. The kind of facilities I will be putting in place for training and to have people with the necessary expertise made available to the care workers and specially designated gardaí who will be operating these guidelines will be provided on a regional basis.  The Minister of State, Deputy Currie, has already made an announcement on this matter.  In addition, we are working on mechanisms to ensure that ongoing training and available information are made available to these people.  These guidelines will constitute a very important element, with legislation like this, in ensuring that people do not continue to commit these crimes and, more importantly, that these crimes will not go unnoticed and unreported while these women and young people suffer.</P>
    <P>I also welcome Senator Henry's comments and reminder that this is a very traumatic area of health care.  It must be realised that the gardaí will be made privy to the most intimate of details of people's lives and will have to make judgments where there is a suspicion that somebody is causing this pain and horror.  Training and information will be made available.  We will monitor how these guidelines are working, together with the need for staff and a good back up service.  We cannot expect one person in a health board area to be the only person available.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="194" /> Senator Henry also referred to the <i>in camera</i> provision.  We are introducing this legislation because of Mr. Justice Carney's interpretation of &ldquo;<i>in camera</i>&rdquo;. We have tackled this in the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990, and the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981, and in the discussion document I will introduce, the whole issue of <i>in camera</i> will be re-examined so that we do not leave ourselves open to a further interpretation which, in turn, will overturn the work we are doing here today, that there will be a clear understanding of what <i>in camera</i> means and that there will be no obfuscation around the edges of what it means in any future cases.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan welcomed the fact that these amendments have taken on board what she was trying to do in her Bill and in the amendments she put down on Committee Stage.  I was not able to take them all on board because they were too composite and included sections that would not work.  As regards sections 1 and 2 of the 1935 Act, the defilement of girls under 15 years of age and the fact that there is no anonymity provision, will be part of the discussion document.  It will not get lost, but until I have completed this legislation, it would be inappropriate to get this discussion paper out in the open because I do not know what other amendments may be introduced in the Dáil and there may well be changes which will effect the document. However, I assure the Senator that it is an area of the law which I am examining again and will take on board any suggestions I can from people working in this area.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Neville for his kind comments about bringing in a much improved Bill.  Amendment No. 1, which is a mirror of the relevant amendment in the Criminal Law (Rape)(Amendment) Act, 1990, is carefully worded to ensure that the word &ldquo;victim&rdquo; does not appear, because one cannot say that there is a victim until somebody has been proven guilty of creating a victim.  That is why the wording is constructed in a negative way &mdash;<Col N="195" /> it &ldquo;... shall exclude...&rdquo; the following people; if it was worded in a different way we would have to find some way of defining the person who might be the victim at the end of the case.  It is constructed this way to ensure that the judge can decide.  The wording reads: &ldquo;... such other persons (if any) as the judge or the court, as the case may be, may, in his, her or its discretion, permit to remain.&rdquo;.  The same wording is in the Rape Acts which I understand is working very well.  People know that under that legislation persons &mdash; for instance someone from the Rape Crisis Centre &mdash; other than immediate families or people immediately involved, are allowed to sit with alleged victims in the court while the case is being heard.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard raised the issue of charges and said that the charge could not be made known.  That is not so because once there are journalists in court they may report the charges.  The Bill does not in any way exclude the announcement of charges but, in a positive way, says that the verdict and sentence must be announced.  To ensure that there is no misunderstanding, the charges can be made known in any reporting of the case.  No matter how many journalists may be present in a court, they may decide, for their own reasons, of space or otherwise, not to report the case.  Given the size of our newspapers, there are many cases &mdash; all kinds of cases, not just incest cases although, by and large, incest cases will probably be reported &mdash; which are never reported and never see the light of day.  It is important, therefore, that the verdict and sentence be made public.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard correctly points out that section 4(3) may be used as a defence and there will be a very limited application of it, but it is conceivable that something could be published that would identify a victim and that somebody could claim they would have had no understanding that an innocent piece of information might, in a small area, identify the victim.  There has to be this <Col N="196" /> small safeguard but it will not be used very often.  The Senator is right and wise to have noticed it.</P>

      <P>This is a straightforward amendment which proposes that the maximum sentence that can be imposed by a court for the offence of incest by a male will be imprisonment for life. Senators will recall that there was an <Col N="199" /> amendment put down in the names of Senator O'Toole, Senator Henry and Senator Lee on Committee Stage requesting this.  The amendment will allow that a life sentence for a person convicted under section 1 of the 1908 Act can be passed.  As explained, I was prepared to accept this in principle at the time.  One of the difficulties which arose was that the Senators had not, perhaps, taken into account the fact that the maximum penalty for an incest offence had been increased to 20 years under the Criminal Justice Act, 1993. However, for the sake of consistency and the importance of giving the right signals, I am now altering that maximum of 20 years imprisonment for incest offences to a maximum penalty that can be imposed of life imprisonment. Hopefully the House will accept this straightforward amendment.</P>

      <P>This amendment is supported by the Fianna Fáil Party.  It is the same sanction as is provided under the 1935 Act for defilement.  The good aspect of this provision is that it allows for a penalty from a suspended sentence through to a full term of life imprisonment. It is retaining full judicial discretion in the extent of the sentence.  It is not Fianna Fáil policy to support, at least for these types of cases, any policies on minimum sentences.  Minimum sentence requirements for second or third offences have been introduced in some foreign jurisdictions leading to the ridiculous situation of people getting 20 years for stealing a hamburger.  The amendment is to be supported because, at the top end, it gives a judge the power to impose the maximum sentence possible and yet allows total discretion down to the imposition of a suspended sentence where circumstances deem it appropriate.</P>

      <P>I welcome the inclusion of this amendment.  Senator O'Toole, Senator Lee and I put forward our own amendment on this point.  I am always being given medical advice and opinions <Col N="200" /> by lawyers so I am careful about giving legal ones myself.</P>
      <P>The fact that this is a felony may make it easier to bring the mandatory reporting of such cases a bit closer, because the crime of felony can also be alleged where there is aiding and abetting. This could have been very important in the case which was recently before the courts where a father tried to incite his son to have sexual intercourse with one of his sisters.  Where that sort of case occurs, a person who is not actually the perpetrator of the act may look more seriously at the situation.  I very much welcome the Minister's clarification of the situation regarding the sentences. I keep talking about mandatory reporting and the Kilkenny incest investigation. I urge the Minister to look carefully at that with her discussion group, as I am sure she will.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">

      <P>The Minister responded to the concerns expressed, particularly from the Independent benches, that the term &ldquo;not exceeding 20 years&rdquo; should be deleted and the term &ldquo;life&rdquo; substituted. I may be the odd person out in all of this but I am not satisfied, if the intention was to ensure the application of a more severe sentence, that this amendment achieves that.  Life is a sentence which in practically all cases is imposed for murder.  It has a measurable term, which is less than ten years in many cases and considerably less than the 20 years originally provided for in the legislation.  If we are focusing on psychological effect, life does work; but in practical terms it has often emerged to be a very short sentence.</P>
      <P>Senator Mulcahy made a point about minimum sentences which would not have effect under the original term used or under the new term.  There was no question of the original term, &ldquo;not exceeding 20 years&rdquo;, having any implication that a minimum sentence would be required.  I am happier that the original term would in practical terms work out to be a far more severe penalty than what is now proposed.</P>

      <P>Senator Henry mentioned mandatory reporting, which is an issue on which I hope those involved in the caring agencies and the legal and medical practices will make submissions to me in the context of the discussion paper.  The new guidelines are very clear where a health board or the Garda are involved in the reporting of any case.  It is as close as one can get to mandatory reporting, because they will have to make a judgment.  In practice if a case is brought to the attention of a health board and/or the Garda, the exchange of information has to take place immediately.  Effectively, there is a mandatory system of reporting between the Garda and the health boards in the sense that if somebody reports a case to the Garda, they must report the suspicion to the health board and <i>vice versa.</i></P>
      <P>Senator Howard talked about the change from 20 years to life.  The case was strongly made on an earlier Stage that a number of other sexual offences have life as their maximum sentence.  In 1993 the maximum sentence for incest was changed to 20 years because the 1908 Act provided that incest was a misdemeanour with a maximum sentence of two years.  During Senator O'Toole's submission on Committee Stage, I got the feeling that he thought the sentence might still be two years and that was why he proposed the amendment. Thankfully, in 1993 it had been changed to 20 years.</P>
      <P>There is one advantage to a life sentence. If someone gets a 20 years sentence, that is essentially most of their life.  However, if somebody gets a life sentence and a Minister grants them early release after ten to 15 years, because it was a life sentence conditions can be imposed and that person can be under a life sentence of examination and checking to ensure they are not found guilty of committing a similar offence.  The essential reason for changing it is to introduce some consistency into the maximum penalties for all crimes of this sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assure the Senator that it does not <Col N="202" /> provide for a lighter sentence than the wording &ldquo;not exceeding 20 years&rdquo;.  It is important that anything we do in legislation does not somehow give a signal that one crime of this nature is a lesser offence.  If life is the maximum sentence for a range of sexual crimes but 20 years is the maximum for incest, it looks as if we are treating it less seriously than other serious sexual offences.  That is the reason for the amendment.</P>
    <P>I neglected to answer a point earlier. Senator Henry mentioned <i>in camera</i> rules in family law cases.  I can assure the Senator that the area is being examined by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform.  He is preparing legislation on domestic violence and other family law areas and the <i>in camera</i> rule will be examined in that context.</P>

      <P>The debate on this Bill was a textbook example of how legislation should be handled in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  A Bill came into the House on which there were strong views and considerable disagreement. However, the manner in which the Bill was handled by Members of the Opposition and those on my own side, who put forward their views constructively and reasonably, and by the Minister, who accepted those views, meant that <Col N="203" /> instead of confrontation we have a Bill which has been arrived at through consensus. That greatly strengthens the Bill and its impact, because there has been a pooling of the resources of the wisdom of the Minister, her Department and of Members of all sides of this House.</P>
      <P>The Minister showed an openness, a willingness to listen and to accept that her Bill might not have been the final word on the subject and in so doing she has displayed the essential quality of a confident Minister, a Minister who is prepared to listen and admit that he or she was wrong or not completely right, who is prepared to take on board the views of the House.  The end result is a Bill which is infinitely better, more acceptable and stronger than what was originally proposed, and for that I commend all concerned.  I should really make a video of the Minister's performance here and send it to other Ministers so that they will see how legislation should be handled in the House.</P>

      <P>I join in the congratulations to the Minister.  This is very important legislation.  When the Minister introduced the Bill she stated that it was to deal with a specific problem. She did not suggest that this Bill would embrace all the other areas of legislation which she was concerned about and which she will publish in her discussion document.  Everybody in this House agrees that nobody could have assumed in 1908 that the <i>in camera</i> ruling could have resulted in the care agencies being excluded from vital pieces of information which they needed to protect victims of incest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join with Senator Mulcahy on this side of the House and all the Members of the Seanad in congratulating the Minister on the way in which she has dealt with this legislation.  When I spoke on Second Stage I said that I knew the Minister from another chamber.  I have served with her in Dublin County Council and Fingal County Council before she was rightly elevated to the position of Minister in the new Government.  I <Col N="204" /> knew her in that chamber to be a very capable, confident and formidable politician, but I have to add today that she is a very caring Minister.  She cared enough about the success of this legislation to take on board suggestions and amendments from all sides of the House.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I accept that, who were members of the previous Government, have come into this House to introduce their Bills and have said that they were open to suggestions from all sides of the House; but in all cases that has not happened.  We have had cases where there has been almost all party agreement in this House that a Bill could or should be altered so as to improve it and the Minister has steadfastly refused to accept those suggestions. The Minister, Deputy Owen, if she continues the way she has begun with this legislation will certainly have more than earned her stripes, she will have done a lot for democracy and for the Seanad.  I commend her for introducing this legislation.</P>

      <P>I have made my views known.  I welcome the passage of this Bill through the House.  On Second Stage it was stated that incest is a fact of life and that it must be eliminated.  It cannot be fully eliminated, but we owe a duty of care to our children to do everything we can to eliminate it.  We identified that ongoing contact with the professionals is inadequate at present. There is no proper code of approach by professionals, parents or relatives on how to tackle this very sad problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I again compliment the Minister.  I will not go into detail because I have already done so.  The Bill was a quick reaction to a situation that developed within the courts.  Similar developments have not prompted such a quick and necessary reaction in the past.  I also <Col N="205" /> compliment Senator Honan for her attention to this area in conjunction with the Minister and in introducing a Private Member's Bill to the House which is now reflected in the Minister's Bill.</P>

I hope that the Minister will tell the other members of Government that we are charming people and that she would like to introduce a lot of her legislation in this House in the future.</P>

      <P>I thank the Members for their warm and complimentary comments.  I never had the privilege of being a Senator, so this for me was a very good exercise in seeing how the Seanad should work and also in being able to contribute to the work that Senators do here and to enjoy the benefit of the expertise available in this House.  It probably is an easier House to do that in, so I am glad this Bill was initiated here.  I do not believe that we would have had as constructive a debate in the other House.  The whole set up here leads to the kind of democracy in legislation that we should have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In answer to Senators' remarks about colleague Ministers, I hope that colleague Deputies in the other House <Col N="206" /> might also learn that it is not a sign of weakness, tardiness or lethargy when a Minister takes the opportunity to listen carefully to what Senators say and to take on board the wisdom and the experience that is obvious in the comments Members here make.  A number of issues were raised during the debate which have been very useful.  Although they were not specifically relevant to this Bill, they will be very useful to me and to my Department in preparing and finalising the discussion paper.  I may come back to Senators who have raised particular points to get further information from them.  I will of course circulate that discussion paper to Members of this House when it is available so they can study it carefully and put their views to me.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to publish that discussion paper as early as possible after the enactment of the Bill and I look forward to receiving the views of interested parties.  There is a great deal of knowledge out there.  Many people have been working quietly in the background with victims of sexual abuse and sexual crimes.  I need to hear what they have to say.  It would be easy for me as a Minister to gain many kudos by rushing in with legislation in this very difficult area, but I would be wrong to do that without taking on board the experiences and the advice that is there to be offered to me.  I hope to be able to do that and to come back into this House with further legislation to tackle some of the other issues that have been raised.  I thank Senators for their co-operation and their compliments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for Justice for taking this matter on the Adjournment.  Pope John XXIII was one of the most remarkable figures of this century.  The Second Vatican Council <Col N="207" /> was one of the most important events.  The Irish School of Ecumenics was founded in 1970 as an Irish attempt to mark and to respond to the historically significant changes brought about by the Second Vatican Council.  The ecumenical movement of modern days sprang from a series of conferences involving the Missionary Movement of the Protestant Churches.  The new attitudes and policy marked by Vatican II signalled a change of remarkable and world wide significance.  The founding and the ecumenical basis of the Irish School of Ecumenics deliberately reflected that change at a very early stage.  Throughout its 25 year history, the Irish School of Ecumenics basis, organisation, staffing, curriculum and student body has been fully representative of the different Churches on this island.</P>
      <P>The school is constituted legally as a trust, separately for Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  The policy and general direction of the school is governed by the academic council, a body of some 50 members drawn from the Churches and public service, from industry, from academic institutions and from the wider community.  The council appoints an executive board to which the director is responsible for the running of the school and its financial management.</P>
      <P>The areas of study in the school include unity and diversity in the Church; the Eucharist and intercommunion; mission, evangelism and dialogue; Christianity and major world religions; conflict, resolution and nonviolence; international politics; the politics of development and conflict and change in contemporary Europe.  I am sure the Minister will agree that these topics are of great relevance nationally and internationally at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this critical time, when we are all attempting to forward peace and reconciliation on this island, the school may have to close due to lack of funds. Students, who come on an international basis, cannot be enrolled now if the <Col N="208" /> school will not be open in September.  It would be a disaster if, ironically, as we are making such progress towards peace, our only institute of peace studies was to close down.</P>
    <P>The school has had a long struggle to remain financially viable.  Its student fees contribute to less than 25 per cent of its income, while donations, gifts, collections and grants make up about 30 per cent.  In recent years, with increased appreciation by the Churches of the work of the Irish School of Ecumenics, direct grants from Church bodies have amounted to about 12 per cent of its income.  Small contributions have also been received from some Government sources in Dublin and Belfast, many countries abroad, the World Council of Churches and the International Fund for Ireland.  However, the school still awaits a realistic grant-in-aid subvention from the Irish Government &mdash; a subvention extended to most educational establishments in the country &mdash; without which its work is not only hampered and restricted, but its very existence is put in doubt.</P>
    <P>We realise the importance of the Irish School of Ecumenics following the representations made by some of its members to the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.  Given a more realistic funding base, it could make a much more significant and revolutionary contribution to Irish life, secular and religious, community and Church. These are all extremely important at this time.  The school has experience, skill, academic standing and reputation, practical and applied techniques and local and national knowledge and contacts.</P>
    <P>With the creation of a non violent situation, resulting from the paramilitaries cease fires, and the movement towards an environment of open politics, free from the fear of death and injury, the challenge of sectarian bitterness, intercommunity fear and religious bigotry remains to be met, answered and transformed by a new valuing of diversity. Such has been the dedicated aim of the Irish School of Ecumenics through the <Col N="209" /> long years of the troubles.  This contribution, through an era of conflict and alienation, has helped sustain the integrity of community life and leadership and foster a climate where the seeds of peace can take root.</P>
    <P>The current director of the school, Sr. Geraldine Smyth, has worked in Northern Ireland and the school has expanded its staff there also, since it feels that an energetic response to the peace process is needed.  It has undertaken a major research project there called &ldquo;Moving Beyond Sectarianism&rdquo;, the purpose of which is to explore the theological, ethical and structural factors which affect interchurch and cross cultural relationships in Northern Ireland.  Psychological, religious and community dimensions will be examined, using an interdisciplinary and ecumenical approach.</P>
    <P>The project will include the formation of cross-community groups of people who can reflect on their experience of sectarianism and develop processes of healing and open exchange.  This will enable a deeper understanding of the dynamics of sectarianism and develop procedures which encourage respect for diversity and cross community development, thus leading to the transformation of sectarianism.</P>
    <P>The project is supported by the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust, the Coventry Cathedral Development Trust, the Christendom Trust and the Central Community Relations Unit of the Northern Ireland Office.  Where is our contribution?  The Constitution rightly does not allow for the support of denominational theology, but surely this is the antithesis of that.  To quote the late John Whyte: &ldquo;The Christian Churches are so important in Northern Ireland society that, paradoxically, there is little literature directly on them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It has been said that the very complexity of the troubles in Northern Ireland has allowed academics and Church people to neglect the obvious significance of sectarianism.  The less obvious significance of sectarianism in this State should also be examined. <Col N="210" /> When religious minorities are very small, cherishing their beliefs is as important as when they are large and in a position to make their voices heard.</P>
    <P>When Fr. Michael Hurley established the school, he chose the motto: &ldquo;May it flourish in order to perish.&rdquo;  Those are very important words, particularly at this time in our history.  Much has been achieved in the last 25 years in terms of closer relationships among the Churches, both leadership and laity. However, the school must flourish for a much longer period before we can say we are in a position to allow it to perish.</P>
    <P>We should be mindful at this time of Pope John XXIII's commitment to tolerance and reconciliation between the Christian denominations and all religions.  The will to continue the work is there.  Surely the Irish Government will not allow it to finish prematurely for lack of funds of approximately £150,000 per annum?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy on behalf of the Minister for Education to express her appreciation of the valuable work undertaken by the Irish School of Ecumenics since its establishment in 1970.  The role and objectives of the school are set out in its mission statement, which states:</P>
      <P>The Irish School of Ecumenics is an international academic institute, Christian in its inspiration and ethos, interdenominational in structure and personnel.  It exists to promote through research, teaching and extramural activities the unity of Christians, dialogue between religions and work for peace and justice in Ireland and abroad.  Its resources are available to churches and other appropriate bodies committed to unity, dialogue and peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that at no time in the history of this State could there be a greater appreciation of the aspirations expressed in this mission statement.  It would, however, be unfair and misleading to imply that there has been no recognition of the role and contribution <Col N="211" /> of the school in the peace and reconciliation process on our island.  The school has been in receipt of Exchequer funding from the Department of Foreign Affairs since 1984 in recognition of its cross-Border activities in the sphere of peace and reconciliation.  I note there is a provisional budget in 1995 of £30,000 from the Department of Foreign Affairs.  In 1993, a special once off grant of £15,000 from the Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust Fund was also made to the school.</P>
    <P>However, the school offers an educational course in ecumenics and peace studies in association with Trinity College and the University of Ulster.  It is in respect of these educational activities that the school seeks funding from the Minister for Education over and above that being provided by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  There seems little need to emphasise the heavy cost that the provision of educational services places on the Exchequer.  However, one indication is that Exchequer expenditure on third level education rose from £186 million in 1985 to an estimated <Col N="212" /> £433 million for the current year.  It is probably true to say that at no time in the history of this State has there been a greater demand for and a greater emphasis on the provision of educational services.</P>
    <P>How the resources available to the Minister should be spread across the different sectors in education has also been the subject of great debate in recent years.  I am glad to tell the Senator that the school's application for funding is under active consideration in the Department of Education at present and the Minister will give her response to it in the near future.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for her reply on behalf of the Minister for Education.  I ask the Minister to express our concern to members of the Government. It would be extremely unfortunate if a school of peace studies failed at this time.  This is one of my main reasons for taking up this issue on behalf of the school.</P>
