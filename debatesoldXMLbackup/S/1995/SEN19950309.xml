      <P>I have received notice from Senator Roche that, on the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to make every effort to have a report by his Department's designated official into the affairs of the companies associated with the retirement village brought to a conclusion at the earliest possible date, and if he will make a full statement on the matter.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to grant funding immediately to Limerick County Council to alleviate the disastrous situation of the regional and county roads.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Wall of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to outline the funding, framework of operations and rules concerning the home-help scheme as operated by the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="706" /> I have also received notice from Senator Kelly of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to give consideration to the proposal to establish a senior training centre for travellers in Rathkeale, County Limerick.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Sherlock of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health to establish a purpose-built centre to serve Cork city and county and to make the appropriate arrangements in this regard.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Henry of the following matter:</P>
    <P>In view of the results of a recent survey by ASH which showed that 90 per cent of attempted purchases of cigarettes by children under 16 were successful, the need for the Minister for Health to review the 1990 regulations governing same.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Neville's and Senator Roche's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business today is Item 1, to conclude not later than 1 p.m.  It is suggested speakers be confined to 20 minutes.  There will be a sos and Item 2 will be taken from 2 p.m. to its conclusion.</P>
      <P>With regard to next week's business, I had a preliminary informal discussion with the Leaders of the other groups. We want to allow sufficient time next week so the Bill can be fully discussed &mdash; there will be no suggestion of it being rushed through the House.  The Whips and Leaders will meet this morning to arrange the times, conscious that St. Patrick's Day also falls next week.</P>

      <P>I thank the Leader of the House for outlining his plans.  We will agree to starting our business as early as possible next week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It is wise to begin that debate as early as possible next week. We could conclude our business before the weekend by starting on Monday morning.</P>
      <P>The news this morning of an increase in interest rates brings into focus again the necessity for the European Union to have a clear policy on a single currency. I ask the Leader of the House to consider having a full debate on this issue.  I am concerned that the date is constantly moving &mdash; from 1997 to 1999.  All the discussion at present is in relation to 1999 whereas the original date was 1997. If the date for a single currency must be 1999 fair enough, but people should realise that playing around with money rates and between currencies, with banks making hundreds of millions of pounds profits, would not be possible if there was a single European currency. That would be the practical way to cut out those problems.  We should move towards a single currency as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>With regard to the interest rate increase raised by Senator O'Toole, I suggest that it goes beyond the issue of the European Union, although that is obviously part of it. However, it demonstrates the folly of budgeting for a deficit.  The Minister was warned before Christmas about the consequences of an increase in interest rates.  We must have a debate on the economy.  The Finance Bill will be <Col N="708" /> before us soon but will it be soon enough for us to discuss these matters in detail?  This issue was raised yesterday by Senator Quinn.  It is a serious issue in terms of the welfare of the economy. A 1 per cent increase in interest rates on a £27 billion deficit has a serious effect on every Irish taxpayer. We must examine that dimension of the issue as well as the European dimension.</P>

      <P>The House might not be aware that there are serious problems regarding medical cover in the women's prison at present.  Two women doctors who have been giving sterling service there are no longer giving weekend cover in protest at the lack of progress in getting medical contracts for prison doctors.  While alternative arrangements have been made, I consider them less than satisfactory in view of the fact that most women prisoners are admitted at weekends.  The issue of medical contracts for doctors in the prisons has been going on for three years.  Could the Leader of the House instill a sense of urgency into the Department of Justice regarding this matter?  I realise there have been problems from the point of view of the doctors but this is totally unsatisfactory.  We are obliged to give proper medical care to prisoners.  I cannot see how what is happening at present in the women's prison could be considered in any way satisfactory.</P>

      <P>Senator Dardis and Senator O'Toole made points about the economy and Europe.  Items 8 and 9 on the Order Paper are relevant to those issues and perhaps they could be discussed under Item 9, the Appropriation Bill which still must be debated.  I will try to arrange a full debate on that for the week after next.</P>
      <P>I will arrange a meeting for Senator Henry today with the Minister or her programme manager so that the Senator can convey the urgency of the issue she has mentioned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Carey) Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Carey)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Carey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Cathaoirleach and Senators for the good wishes they expressed on my appointment.  I noticed during that debate that many Members had a particular interest in the west.  I hope to make a contribution to the improvement of living standards of people in the west during my short 120 or so weeks as Minister of State.</P>
      <P>Rural Ireland faces serious economic and social problems.  These are all too evident to anybody travelling outside urban centres, especially in remote areas.  These difficulties are a daily fact of life for people who live in rural areas. They are aware of being caught in a vicious cycle.  As population has declined, services have been reduced, and, in turn, economic activity has decreased and so communities have less hope of holding on to their own young people.  As young Europeans they will naturally seek improved standards of living.  They have every right to expect this.</P>
      <P>These young people will be attracted to the better employment opportunities and life styles of the big city.  They may wish to taste the different experiences of living in a foreign country.  They may also want to broaden their education or gain valuable work experience.  At the same time they fully appreciate the quality of the environment and special family ties they have left behind.  In many rural areas they do not have an option of staying in their local area. Many of those who have left find it too difficult to return and settle back once they have become used to easy accessibility of facilities and services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not a unique problem to Ireland; it is an international one.  Our European colleagues are also facing the problem of rural depopulation, the cycle of rural economic decline and decreasing services.  Approaches to the question have been varied, reflecting the different <Col N="710" /> nature and culture of communities in Europe.  However, a common element in all these models is a bottom-up approach coupled with a top-down commitment: local communities involved in partnership with their local authorities supported by central government.</P>
    <P>The decline in rural areas due to population loss leads to the withdrawal or curtailment of necessary services such as post offices, ESB offices, bank branches, health clinics and county council offices which in turn accelerates the process of population decline.  This is a very depressing feature.  We can all appreciate the need for public services to be provided efficiently and on economic criteria.  However, that is little comfort to the small and remote communities whose standard of living is under threat.</P>
    <P>The effects are not just economic.  I am acutely aware of the impact that loss of population, especially the emigration of young people, can have on the morale of small communities.  It is important that such communities regain and develop their self-confidence so that they will be in a position to join in the rural renewal process.</P>
    <P>In the recently published report entitled <i>New Approaches to Rural Development</i> the National Economic and Social Council highlights the seriousness of the economic and social difficulties facing Irish rural areas.  The publication recommends that these difficulties are important enough to warrant detailed and sustained attention by policy makers.  As an example of how complex the whole issue of rural development is, the report states that the future of rural Ireland will not be determined alone by restructuring the agricultural and non-agricultural sectors of the economy.  It will also be determined by the operation of policies at national and European levels.  The council raises issues regarding the interdependence between urban and rural areas.  Above all it points out that rural development policy goals can only be met in the context of balanced regional <Col N="711" /> development and national settlement patterns.</P>
    <P>The NESC report considers the origin and nature of the problem.  It examines the issues involved in policy terms from a national and rural perspective.  It discusses the context within which rural development policy must be formulated and it looks at all the elements involved in this process, the value of area based partnerships, the delivery of public services and many other issues.</P>
    <P>The current and future policy responses and the institutional and organisational issues which now arise are examined.  A number of core principles are identified as a guide to the development of structures and institutions for rural development.  Some of these principles are already in practice through existing groups such as the county enterprise boards, Leader and area development management partnerships and through the efforts of Government. I compliment the members of the council who examined all these existing groups.  There is a valuable critique of the long term and short term attitudes people should have to these companies in the report.</P>
    <P>The Government has accepted NESC's recommendation that a pilot scheme be initiated to develop service centres in rural areas.  I have been given the job of overseeing the implementation of this pilot scheme as part of my responsibilities.  The idea is a simple one: to house a number of essential public services under one roof so that remote rural communities will still have a range of services available to them in an economic and effective way.  The pilot scheme is to test out how best this might be achieved.</P>
    <P>My appointment as Minister of State with responsibility for western development and rural renewal is an indication of how serious the Government is in tackling the many areas of rural policy. My job should also be considered in the context of the roles allotted to my colleagues the Minister of State with responsibility for rural development, <Col N="712" /> Deputy Deenihan, and the Minister of State with responsibility for local development, Deputy Gay Mitchell; our briefs are complementary.  Each of our areas of responsibility reflects the complexity of the issue of rural development as the NESC's report clearly shows.  It is also an indication of the Government's commitment to tackling this policy issue in a co-ordinated way and a response to the heartfelt desire of the people who live in rural Ireland to stem the decline in their populations, to become vibrant, self-sustaining communities with a long term future.</P>
    <P>My own area of responsibility seems very broad at first, but in many ways it is straightforward: it is to find practical ways of helping communities in rural Ireland break out of the vicious cycle of population decline, reduced economic activity and the consequent erosion of services.  There is already a variety of interesting work going on in this area. A notable example is the work of Jim Connolly and his colleagues in Rural Resettlement in Ireland.  They are developing new partnerships between the public and private sectors and the Irish overseas.</P>
    <P>The Western Development Partnership Board was established to promote the economic development of the western region with the objective of achieving population stability by the end of the decade at 1991 census levels on a county by county basis.  The board will prepare an action plan for the region. Its work will also take account of the need to strike a balance between the development of urban areas as centres of growth and the maintenance of rural communities.</P>
    <P>The Forum group in Connemara is responding to the needs of the elderly in the area along with improvements in remedial education, in public transport together with new initiatives in shell fish farming and local tourism.  It is an excellent model of how practical achievements can be made.</P>
    <P>There is a section of the rural Irish population I wish to specifically mention in the debate on rural development <Col N="713" /> that is, the people living on our offshore islands.  Whatever difficulties rural communities on the mainland have, islanders have the additional problem of isolation. As Chairman of the Interdepartmental Co-ordination Committee on Island Development I hope to further the development and improvement of living conditions of our offshore islands.</P>
    <P>The NESC report identifies the serious nature of the economic and social problems in rural Ireland but it also emphasises the many positive initiatives which are already impacting on life in rural communities.  The report calls for further research on Ireland's settlement problems in order to explore the interdependence between urban and rural areas.  I would hope this interesting research will be carried out soon so that a further piece of the jigsaw will be in place.</P>
    <P>I wish to praise the authors of this report.  I commend them for the extensiveness of their research and the comprehensive nature of the consultative process they pursued.  I wish also to acknowledge the co-operation and assistance they received from many individuals and organisations in bringing this research work through the many stages and, finally, to its publication.</P>
    <P>Rural development is a complex matter. The NESC report has, however, increased our understanding of the nature and depth of that complexity.  At the same time it clearly marks the difficult road ahead for policy makers in approaching rural development in innovative ways.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire go dtí an Teach seo. I sincerely welcome the Minister because he is a man from the west who has worked and lived there and is well acquainted with its problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also welcome this NESC report.  It certainly is a good report and has highlighted many of our problems.  It is really a history &mdash; a book that should be retained &mdash; but, while it identifies the <Col N="714" /> problems, it does not seem to have come up with any answers.</P>
    <P>As someone who has been involved in the depopulation and decline of the west since the fifties and who was a member of a Fr. McDyer campaign to save the west, I claim to have long experience and, as someone who has continually worked in the west, particularly in Roscommon, Mayo, parts of Galway, Sligo and Leitrim for over 20 years dealing with the farming community, I know the west well.</P>
    <P>One of the real problems in the west is how do we keep people in the area. How do we provide them with a living? Deputy Blaney, when he was Minister for Local Government, did one positive thing by organising the regional group water schemes.  But for his foresight &mdash; and he was criticised a lot at the time &mdash; the west would be a poor place indeed. These schemes, in turn, supplied water for many of our group water schemes. Earlier electricity was provided, and people in those remote areas were given the same living comforts; they had water, light and all the facilities of a town or city.  Unfortunately, we did not capitalise sufficiently on that.  We did capitalise on it as far as our hotels and guesthouses are concerned; we would not have the volume of tourists in the west today were it not for the fact that we had electricity and running water.</P>
    <P>When we joined the EEC we all looked on it as the saviour of west.  It certainly was great for a number of years; when I worked with the farming community in the sixties and seventies, agriculture was booming in the west. The small farmer with ten cows was a viable unit.  In my own area of north Sligo we had three creameries.</P>
    <P>Rural Ireland was damned by amalgamation &mdash; that word should be removed from the Irish vocabulary. We amalgamated small schools, Garda barracks and small creameries because, economically, it appeared right to do so and we based our decisions on how we could save money.  However, did we save money at the expense of human flesh <Col N="715" /> and blood?  This has gone on for years, Thomas Davis wrote in &ldquo;The Silence of Unlaboured Fields&rdquo; that:</P>
    <P>A human voice is never heard,</P>
    <P>The sighing grass is everywhere.</P>
    <P>Grassland and lowing herds are good,</P>
    <P>But better human flesh and blood.</P>
    <P>There must have been depopulation of rural areas in his time too for him to write in such striking terms.</P>
    <P>I welcome this NESC report and I am very pleased about some aspects of it. Grants and loans were mentioned.  For many years, I have said that grants are not the answer and we squandered all the money we got from Europe.  That money should have been used for low cost loans at 1 or 2 per cent for people to start industries.  There would have been bad debts of course, but 80 or 90 per cent of that money would have recirculated to help others.  That money was given out in grants and helped one initiative but that was the end of it. There was nothing for the next person. I welcome the suggestion in this report that low price loans might be the answer.  I say that rather than &ldquo;might be&rdquo;, it is the answer.</P>
    <P>I started in business 35 years ago through necessity; I had no choice.  It was easy to start in business then.  In the 1970s I could not get an advanced factory for my village so I built a shed.  In those days, one only had to go the county council's planning office to discuss plans and if they could not see a problem they would give the go ahead. A factory could be ready to begin production as soon as the planning permission was granted.  That is how I was able to build six small factories in my town creating up to 200 jobs.</P>
    <P>I worked out today the cost of adding another three small factories; it would be in the region of £6,000 to £10,000 because of the cost of planning permission &mdash; there were no planning charges in those days &mdash; and an environmental impact study which would cost £4,000 or £5,000.  Then there would <Col N="716" /> probably be objections after that.  We have to marry the concerns of environmentalists and industrialists so that they can work in harmony because, at present, they seem to be completely opposed to one another.  Nobody seems to be working on that front.  We have to make it easier for people to get into business and set up industries.</P>
    <P>We are getting some great results now.  When Pádraig Flynn was in the Department he started to build good roads to the west.  Many criticised him for that and said the county roads needed priority.  We cannot exist without county roads but we need good roads to get our produce to Dublin, Belfast and the other big cities.  That is happening now.</P>
    <P>However, something is still missing which is barely mentioned in the report. There are more students of marketing now than ever before but we have no salespeople.  The art of salesmanship &mdash; or, to be more politically correct, salespersonship &mdash; seems to be a thing of the past.  People walk in and out of shops and nobody cares if they buy; if one looks around a car showroom one is rarely approached by a salesman.  We all remember a time when salesmen came to our doors.  We have lost the art of salemanship.  There is no marketing, research or sales assistance for small businesses.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to create jobs but, as Senator Quinn said here one day, if there is a market for a commodity and the commodity sells, then jobs are created.  One cannot make something and then stockpile it.  We need to do a great deal of work developing a good marketing system for our produce. There is no reason for any unemployment in this country or depopulation of the west.  There are good airports in Knock, Sligo, Galway and Shannon and we have good ports.  We should be able to transport our products.  There is a huge potential market in the EU of which we will get a very small part.  We must put some marketing mechanism in place and encourage people to go into business.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="717" /> Our taxation system is discouraging.  I spoke recently to a contemporary who started in business at the same time as I did and who said I was lucky to be out of business.  He said that when we went into business if he saw somebody with a briefcase or a folder getting out of a car he knew it was a commercial traveller; today it is an inspector.  Inspectors have been our greatest growth industry.  We have harassed entrepreneurs.  Any small business today has visits from safety inspectors, fire chief inspectors, tax inspectors, health and safety inspectors and environmental health inspectors.  I could go on and on&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.  The Senator's 20 minutes would be used up before he finished the list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Each inspector prevents a man from working.</P>
      <P>In every town and village there were many small contractors employing three or four people reconditioning houses, building walls, decorating and so on.  We brought in a taxation system where all those people had to be registered contractors and they packed up and are on the dole today.  We started a black economy and created a Frankenstein because we did not realise what we were doing.  I have always maintained that no tax should be imposed on small industries with a turnover below a certain level.  They should pay VAT to wholesalers, which they will not get back, but nothing else.  The bookkeeping should be cut out.  It is impossible for small businesses to carry bookkeepers and accountants and often they are put out of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past 20 years in my village 16 shops have closed down.  This is happening in every small village.  These shops employed one, two or three people and some had vehicles on the road.  For many years I drove a van for one of these shops, collecting eggs and delivering groceries.  However, these type of operations are a thing of the past.  The lights went out and with them the jobs.  Something should be done to <Col N="718" /> make it easier for people to run a business.</P>
    <P>County Leitrim is a very neglected area and it has lost more of its population than any other county.  If a scheme was introduced there, where people who set up businesses did not have to pay tax for ten years, the number of new industries would be unbelievable. Such a scheme should be established.</P>
    <P>My county prepared a special submission for support funds.  It is a small report but it is very good because it puts a price on everything that could be done.  It is a local action plan, and every county should have its own plan. National and regional reports are riddled with jargon and we must get back to basics in local areas.</P>
    <P>Our action plan covers small villages; £10 million would have created a great deal of work in County Sligo through, for example, streetscaping and pavement programmes and the restoration and refurbishment of Sligo Model School, a fine old building, a new arts centre in Sligo &mdash; £2 million would be enough and the possible redevelopment of the old butter market as a craft workshop, environmental enhancement of Sligo Abbey and the presentation of the jail complex, etc.</P>
    <P>Targeted areas include Aclare, Ballymote, Ballintogher, Ballisodare, Ballinafad, Buninadden, Carney, Cliffony, Coolooney, Coolaney, Dromorewest, Easkey, Inishcrone, Grange, Gorteen, Mullaghamore, Riverstown, Rosses Point, Strand Hill and Tubbercurry. Every village is covered in the plan and what happened in my village, Grange and in the small village of Aclare, indicates the effectiveness of even modest intervention.</P>
    <P>Aclare is on the border of County Mayo.  It was a very neglected area but it was improved over a number of years through a proper and well prepared village plan and a significant contribution from local sources.  As I have said a number of times, there are many local people who would be willing to invest in <Col N="719" /> their area, if grants and other benefits were available.</P>
    <P>There was nothing in Aclare and a great air of depression existed.  Funds were leveraged from a range of sources which first provided a serviced industrial site.  A small field was bought in that remote village and a small advance factory was built.  People said it was a white elephant.  However, it led to the return to his native village, where no industrial employment existed in 1984, of a young skilled toolmaker from the United States.  Less than ten years later, this small industry employs 17 people and the business is being expanded to take on another ten or 12 employees. This year he won the prestigious national small industry of the year award.</P>
    <P>This is positive action and can be mirrored in every small town and village across the country.  In the village of Aclare, major elements of the plan have been achieved over the years, with the building of an excellent community centre by local unemployed youths on a training scheme.  This now houses medical clinics, health care facilities and a branch library.  An imaginative modern scheme of townhouses and old people's dwellings in a courtyard setting has replaced a former eyesore of ruined derelict buildings.  Aid from the new fund to continue the work of maintaining this village plan would be a tremendous boost to this remote area.</P>
    <P>All this work has been carried out in the small village of Aclare by the county council and the local community with very little resources.  We must try to promote this type of effort because this is how jobs will be created.  The example of Aclare proves this point and I have no doubt that the work done there can be emulated in every village in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>North Sligo is an area of exceptional natural beauty with a remarkable variety of landscape and seascape, mountains, woodlands, boglands and rivers and similar areas exist all over the west. It was calculated in the action plan that <Col N="720" /> £7.5 million would boost this part of the county, which features Lissadel House and estate, the former home of the Gore-Booth family and the remarkable Countess Markievicz.  She was the rebel countess who was sentenced to death for her part in the Easter Rising, the first woman elected to the Westminster Parliament and conferred with the freedom of the Borough of Sligo after her release from Aylesbury jail in 1917. Almost next door is Drumcliff graveyard, the burial place of William Butler Yeats and his brother Jack.  There is a whole range of tourist attractions in this part of the country.  However, nothing is fully developed but the action plan has put a price on the cost of developing these places.  This is the type of action that should be pursued.</P>
    <P>The action plan is an example of what has been done and more areas should get involved and produce similar reports.  It gets to the nitty gritty and points out the costs involved and the jobs which could be created.  The experiments in Grange and Aclare prove that this is possible and feasible. Rural Ireland does not have to be a desolate place.  More money is required to maintain roads and the infrastructure but employment can be created.</P>
    <P>I do not see the black part of the picture. I did not believe in leaving the country when it was popular to go in the 1950s.  I decided to stay.  I never left the country except on holidays and I have no regrets.  I was very successful.  I believe we can revive rural communities and make them successful.  The phrase &ldquo;bottom up approach&rdquo; is much misused. Stay at the bottom because we must start with the foundation.  The foundations are in rural Ireland, in towns and villages; let us get back to basics. County councils should become more involved and we should encourage them to produce such reports as the Sligo action plan, help them financially and get rid of grants and provide low interest loans.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I am certain he will have an interesting period in office dealing with western development and rural renewal.  I wish him well.  His brief presents many challenges but I am certain he has the expertise, competence and energy to make the most of it.</P>
      <P>I hope he will seek to extend his brief to include the Offaly side of the Shannon because there are areas in my constituency &mdash; Shannon Harbour, Banagher, Lusmagh, Shannonbridge, Doon, Clorhane, Ferbane and Birr &mdash; which should be considered for development; they too have been seriously affected by the recent flooding.  There was a lot of publicity about the plight of the people living west of the Shannon, and rightly so.  However, people in my area have been suffering similar problems on an ongoing basis.  This report deals with rural Ireland.  Some of the operations of SFADCo, which is within the Minister's remit, are located in Offaly.  I hope the Minister will seek to extend his brief to these areas.</P>
      <P>There are many important points in this important report.  In page (xiv), under the heading <i>Public Services in Rural Areas</i>, it states that &ldquo;Pressures of public finance and changing patterns of service provisions have given rise to reorganisation and withdrawal of public service provision in rural areas.&rdquo;.  Over the years, national policy at Government and semi-State level has slowly but surely played a major part in the process. Governments and semi-State bodies are to blame for much of what has happened in my constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some people might think that this was yesterday's war.  It is not yesterday's war; the problem is still there today and it needs to be confronted.  I am speaking of the closure of our one and two teacher national schools; many three teacher national schools have been under threat.  A report was presented to the Department of Education a few years ago calling for the closing of all one, two and three teacher national schools.  I come from a rural area.  I know that once a school is closed in a <Col N="722" /> village or a small community, people will start to leave the area.</P>
    <P>The provision of rural post offices is an important service.  If they did not exist, people would have to travel to larger towns to get a stamp or to collect their post.  The closure of rural post offices is a serious matter and affects the fabric of society in the area.  There are at least 100 applications currently before the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications from An Post calling for the closing of rural post offices &mdash; I am not sure of the exact figure, but it is probably higher than that. If these post offices close, 100 villages across the country will be affected.  The Government must have the courage of its own convictions and tell An Post that it cannot allow this to happen.</P>
    <P>The late John Healy, a very famous political correspondent, wrote about Charlestown, County Mayo &mdash;&ldquo;No one Shouted Stop; The Death of an Irish Village&rdquo;.  It is a beautiful book, well worth reading and is as relevant today as it was in the 1950s.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that at the time somebody had the courage to shout stop and it helped to revitalise the community.  I was in that town during the Seanad election; I did all right there too.</P>
      <P>The third point I want to raise relates to Garda stations and what is called community policing.  In fact, it is the opposite; it is closing communities.  If a community loses its national school, post office and Garda station, what is left?  It is wrong to close Garda stations and close they will unless the Government makes a definite policy decision to keep them open.</P>
      <P>I read an article in <i>The Sunday Times</i> about people leaving villages in France, Spain and Italy in their thousands, and now they are like ghost towns.  We have to make sure this does not happen here. The Government needs to adopt a positive policy to support these services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="723" /> I also appeal to those who live in those small areas.  We can blame the Government for everything but the general public must adopt a responsible attitude.  As a person living in a rural area, I have a duty to support my local shop &mdash; whether it is the butcher, the grocer, the hardware shop, the drapery store or the local licensed premises &mdash; rather than go to a big supermarket, I do not want to fall out with Senator Quinn about this.  Services provided by a local bank or a cafe can only keep going, and the community can only survive, if there is interplay between the local communities, the semi-State bodies and the Government.  Banks are currently centralising their powers and giving less authority to their local managers.  That is a mistake and I ask the banks to review this policy.</P>
    <P>Local authority planning is playing an effective part in closing down rural Ireland.  I do not want to fall out with any county manager &mdash; we have to keep on their right side &mdash; but local authorities are actively pursuing a policy to encourage people to move into towns.  It is impossible to get planning permission in rural Ireland.  If people build houses in rural areas, local authorities will have to provide services for them.  That is part and parcel of the duty of Government and local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Local authorities say they will have to provide roads, lights, water and sewerage schemes.  The people living in vibrant rural communities are being encouraged to live in towns.  I say that with great regret but it is a fact.  It is time the Government directed county councils and An Bord Pleanála to encourage rather than discourage people to build homes in rural areas.  When a farmer transfers sites to his son only one house may be built and he cannot give the remaining sites to anybody.  If the other members of the family want to live near their home, <Col N="724" /> they must move into towns.  That is a mistake and I hope the Government and local authorities will reverse this trend.</P>
      <P>The reports states that an &ldquo;increased role for local authorities in rural and local development should only occur within the context of (a) proven performance of the county enterprise boards in the formulation and execution of strategic enterprise development plans&rdquo;.  I agree with the report in that any plans produced by Leader, the country enterprise partnership boards, etc., should be well researched and formulated. If plans are presented as envisaged by this report they will be of benefit to rural communities.</P>
      <P>The scheme Leader I was a success in County Offaly.  Attractive buildings and new businesses are now located in areas which were run down and derelict.  A considerable amount of employment has been created and it continues to increase.  A further application for assistance under Leader II has been made by the Laois County Enterprise Partnership Board, which is before the Minister.  I hope the success we have achieved will continue under Leader II. The Minister of State, Deputy Gay Mitchell, is responsible for the partnership areas.  I am delighted that much of north Offaly has been included in the partnership schemes and that grants will be available under them for small businesses. I am pleased that it has been approved and I hope its launch, which was to take place tonight, will happen in the not too distant future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read the excellent application from County Laois for assistance under the Leader programme.  It outlines positive points about County Laois, including the many attractions, infrastructure and the availability of skills and expertise. However, over recent years national funding for County Laois has fallen.  I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, will approve the application by the Laois County Enterprise Partnership Board for funding under Leader II because it is important that it be provided. <Col N="725" /> It is a positive application and was well researched.</P>
    <P>This important report needs Government support and the co-operation of semi-State bodies and agencies.  It also needs the support of the people.  We can have many excellent plans, but unless they have the support and goodwill of the people, they will not succeed.  This new approach to rural development should be approved by the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and wish him well in his new post.  Lest there be any misunderstanding, I would like to say that although I, with my colleagues, voted against the appointment of two new Ministers of State, that did not in any way reflect on the competence and ability of the individuals appointed to those positions both of whom are excellent public representatives.</P>
      <P>This is a comprehensive, interesting and well researched report.  One might ask, why is a Dubliner speaking about rural development?  We all have an interest in the future of this country.  A rural sector is important to the country. We began on the land; thousands of years ago we moved from the forests and sheltered areas to land which we cultivated.  However, I do not intend to go into the history of agriculture here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problems identified in the report, and by other speakers, highlight the threat posed to rural areas.  The Minister in his speech mentioned the off shore islands.  When I was younger I visited the Aran Islands six or seven times to attend an Irish speaking school and I subsequently returned to holiday there. What is happening on the Aran Islands is an interesting lesson for other rural areas.  The people there have struggled to develop their economy, but also to protect their environment.  It is all very well to say one wants prosperity, but not at any price.  Some islanders, particularly those on Inishmore, are upset by large numbers of tourists on their island in the summer &mdash; they get a break in the winter because not too many people are <Col N="726" /> keen to cross Galway Bay, or an sunda salach, in the winter months.</P>
    <P>A problem, not just for the Aran Islands, is how to balance development with protecting the environment, not in a green sense but in terms of peace of mind or the integrity of one's community. How can the integrity of rural areas be maintained if they are to prosper?</P>
    <P>We have an advantage over many countries in that we do not have a large heavy industrial base.  We do not provide most of our employment in large scale engineering, motor manufacturing or chemical production, although there are such facilities dotted around the country, for example in Cork.  One can travel through large parts of rural Ireland where it is hard to find a factory. That is not the case in many other countries in Europe such as Germany or Austria or, indeed, England where the entire countryside is constantly attacked by an ever increasing spread of roadways and factories.  It is hard to find large amounts of unspoiled land in southern England.  In protecting, as opposed to developing, rural Ireland we must look at the question of roads.  If we have roadways all over the countryside it will disturb the environment and will not create a place where people want to live.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the excellent idea of service centres.  In my constituency in Dublin there are five building societies right beside each other.  It is a total waste when only one office is required to get a mortgage.  I support the provision of services in rural Ireland but we must ask if there is an over duplication of offices.  It is coming to a stage where every town will demand a post office, a Garda station, VHI shop and insurance offices, a few building societies, video outlets and a social welfare office.  Can we streamline this activity to remove waste?  We are talking about the distribution of scare resources, as the Minister knows.  People do not want to pay more taxes for more services; they want to pay less tax and have more services. In effect, we have to provide a <Col N="727" /> system of supporting rural Ireland whereby better services are provided at a more efficient cost.</P>
    <P>Although the Minister did not refer to it in his speech I am sure he will consider in his deliberations the issue of the information superhighway and the internet.  I do not claim to fully understand it but I hope to learn about it.  The Speaker of the American House of Representatives, the now famous Newt Gingrich, said a few weeks ago that the government should give everybody a computer to access information.  One no longer calls to an office to get information: if I have a query about social welfare for a constituent I do not call to an office, I ring the Department of Social Welfare in Sligo, Mayo or Athlone.  We are going beyond a point where people feel that they have to access matters in a personal physical sense.  The language and idea of calling &ldquo;into the shop to get something&rdquo; will become a thing of the past.</P>
    <P>If someone in a rural area has a query on their pension or their tax it might be easier and more profitable for them to access the information by computer.  We are not far from the day when one will not even have to key in to a computer; one will speak to the computer.  The technology exists already whereby one can speak to a computer and tell it to type up what one is saying.</P>
    <P>People sometimes wrongly give the impression that rural Ireland is the backward part of the country.  It is not although it may be the under-resourced part where people have not had the same opportunities and exposure to education as those in cities.  If the Minister is doing a pilot scheme on service centres he might also include one on computerisation.  He might consider giving some families attached to the service centre a free computer and have carried out a cost audit on whether money is saved by giving the computers to people to access information and services.</P>
    <P>We all want Ireland to be an inclusive place.  The Minister knows about the rural resettlement programme.  Hundreds <Col N="728" /> of families want to leave the city and live in the country.  There are organisations dealing with the programme and the State should be assisting them because Dublin has the highest rate in the country of unemployment per thousand. If people feel they will have a better life and better employment prospects in the country it might make sense to give them financial help to relocate.</P>
    <P>This report is so good that I ask the Minister to talk to his colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Gay Mitchell, who is from my constituency because we need such a report for the more deprived parts of the cities.  There are parts of Dublin, Limerick, Cork and other towns where there is real poverty. I do not want to spoil the debate by trying to compare poverty &mdash; although all poverty is relative.  There is a French organisation called <i>Le Quatre Monde</i> which means the fourth world.  Some people living in deprived city areas have absolutely nothing; they do not even own a field.  A field is not enough to feed oneself but at least if one owns a few acres one feels rooted to something. There are people who are totally alienated in our cities and towns.  A report such as this needs to made to address their problems.</P>
    <P>I welcome this report and this debate. I support many of the report's conclusions and many of the steps the Minister is taking proudly, as a city Member of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimTownsend" hpid="Mr. Townsend Mr. Townsend">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Townsend</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I do not know him personally but from what I am told I believe he has his feet firmly on the ground.  The subtitle to the report is <i>New Approaches to Rural Development</i> which is appropriate as it is exactly what we want.  If we are to take into account what has happened in the past 25 years new approaches are needed, based on the real world.  We cannot turn back the clock: we have to go forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the report I picked out some figures which support my case.  The numbers engaged in agriculture fell from 330,000 in 1986 to 155.000 in 1992, a <Col N="729" /> staggering decline of 7.000 per year. While I have been in the Seanad, public representatives have wrestled with their consciences over many things, the closure of Digital in Galway, that transatlantic flights would in future overfly Shannon and problems in Aer Lingus yet there is hardly a whisper about the 7,000 farmers and farmworkers who have to leave rural Ireland every year. The reason is they are scattered throughout every parish and cannot be photographed in large numbers coming out of a factory.  The media cannot find them easily to interview them and neither can politicians find them easily.</P>
    <P>On reading the report it appears the outlook is very bad and a new approach to rural development is needed.  Of the remaining 155,000 farmers, only 31 per cent earn an economically viable income from their farms.  A further 17 per cent are surviving on viable jobs outside the farm and a further 30 per cent are surviving with the help of social welfare, CAP transfers and so on.  Some 20 per cent of farms are not viable at all, but if we are honest with ourselves we will acknowledge that it cannot be otherwise.</P>
    <P>We received an enormous amount of money from CAP resources over the last 25 years but 80 per cent of that went to 20 per cent of the larger farmers simply because the system is based on the amount of land, crops or animals a farmer has.  When the CAP was reorganised it made the situation worse.  The Government brought in an early retirement scheme.  If a small farmer wants to hand over his holding to a very big farmer, he can do so if he is the right age.  If, however, he wants to hand over to his son but is not able to enlarge his holding &mdash; they call it extensification &mdash; he cannot do so.  I know several small farmers whose sons are working on the farm.  They are anxious to hand over to their sons and they simply cannot do it because of the rules.  That is not good enough.</P>
    <P>A scheme brought in as one of the accompanying measures when the CAP was reformed and not referred to in this <Col N="730" /> report is the Rural Environment Protection Scheme.  A large amount of money will be available over the next five or six years under that scheme which is the most likely to have a major impact on smallholders and help them stay on their land, but because the scheme is mainly directed towards the farmer with less than 100 acres, the will is not there to implement it properly.  There is much negative publicity about that scheme.  A sum of £10 million was made available last year and only £1.4 million was taken up.  It was financed 75 per cent by the European Union and 25 per cent by the national Government.  It is to our eternal shame that we have not taken up that £10 million and have not put a proper scheme in place.</P>
    <P>While people with very large incomes employing perhaps up to ten people can do what is required under this scheme and can draw £50 per acre up to a maximum of 100 acres, smallholders on social welfare or taking part in a community employment schemes are afraid that if they take part in it and get £2,000 from REPS, their social welfare payments will be reduced.</P>
    <P>The community employment schemes have a role to play provided they are properly organised.  The county enterprise boards should be given a fair chance as they are working reasonably well.  The REPS, the community employment schemes and the Leader schemes combined could contribute, each in its own way.  The county enterprise board in Carlow, for instance, has given grant aid to a person for snail production.  Since this enterprise was set up it has created approximately 50 jobs and that is the right way to go about things.  Alternative enterprises should be taken seriously but should be well planned.  I outlined here last week a bio-fuel project developed and researched in Carlow, France, Germany, Italy and now England are taking this type of development quite seriously.  We will be left behind if we do not develop alternative enterprises.  The county boards, the REPS, the community employment <Col N="731" /> schemes and Leader schemes if they are properly organised can play their part.</P>
    <P>We cannot turn the clock back.  I was interested to hear what Senator Mulcahy had to say and I agree with much of it.  We talk about small schools, post offices and telephone boxes.  In primary schools in some large towns classrooms are vacant simply because there is not enough pupils to fill them.  When post offices in rural areas are being closed &mdash; it is the same with telephone boxes &mdash; the local people want to keep them although they do not support them. They use the post offices in the bigger towns to get their pensions and that sort of thing.  A new approach to rural development is needed.  If we continue talking, as we have over the past 25 years, about small schools, post offices, and telephone boxes, we will not make progress.  I agree with much of what Senator Mulcahy said.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Carey, on his appointment and welcome him to the House.  I had the opportunity, as I am sure the Minister is already aware, on the occasion on which we discussed the appointments, to put on record my good wishes to Deputy Carey on his appointment to the office and to assure him of my support and to some extent my sympathy in the work which he has to undertake.  Already he has demonstrated a willingness to meet various organisations and associations and has taken some initiatives in endeavouring to come to grips with the problems in rural areas.  As he said in his speech, it is not just a local Irish problem.  We hear a great deal about Irish solutions to Irish problems but this is a European problem and one that has certainly created problems even for the strong German economy.  I visited an area in the northern part of Germany where, like the west of Ireland, there was a serious population decline, Initiatives were taken to deal with this decline because part of it was due to the decline of traditional industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="732" /> I welcome this detailed report, which I have not had the opportunity to study in depth.  When it was published earlier in the year I looked through it in an overall manner.  In the report we have the expertise of people who have been to the forefront of economic and social development in Ireland for many years. As Members will be aware, industry, agriculture, co-operatives, farming bodies, Government Departments and others were involved in its preparation. Trade unions and people like Mr. Peter Cassells who were involved would have a deep understanding of the problems of communities.  There is no doubt that western communities have been hit hardest in the decline of rural areas.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's appointment and wish him well.  However, I feel there is an element of fragmentation in the Government's approach to this issue. There is overlapping and duplication of effort, which we can see in the allocation of ministerial responsibilities.  If the Minister is to be successful, as I hope he will be &mdash; and he can be assured of our support &mdash; he will have to pull together the various strands of responsibility for different areas of action and find somebody who will put in place an overall policy initiative, not a piecemeal one, dealing with the establishment of pilot projects to deal with specific areas.</P>
    <P>We need an enlightened policy in relation to how these problems can be minimised.  I do not say &ldquo;resolved&rdquo; because I do not think it will be easy to resolve them.  No matter what initiatives Governments take, some people will decide to leave rural areas in search of opportunities, entertainment and other things elsewhere.  If the best services in the world were in some of these areas, some people would still leave.  I know this from personal experience.  Some members of my family do not wish to live in the social scene in west Clare and have already left to live elsewhere.  I have lived in west Clare and have found it a disadvantage to be about 200 miles from Dublin.  I have kept my permanent residence in the west, even when under <Col N="733" /> extreme pressure in my ministerial post. The strain and pressure this puts on individuals is almost unbearable.  I am sure the Minister knows this already from the short time he has been in office.</P>
    <P>There is a common perception which must be rejected in a debate like this. This is the fatalistic attitude that rural areas are lost and gone and beyond rehabilitation.  This is a fallacy and it is a disservice to people living in rural areas to put that perception abroad.  It is said that the effort to resolve these problems must come from the people in these areas themselves.  This is not realistic.  They cannot resolve these problems themselves.  They need Government support and initiatives to enable them to work towards finding solutions.</P>
    <P>An area where Government and EU initiatives, with local community involvement, can be successful in meeting and facing up to these problems can be seen in the Leader programme.  I welcome the second Leader initiative which is about to be launched.  It is to be expanded nation wide, which is welcome, but it would be more welcome if resources were provided for it.  We have seen the success of the Leader programme in Clare under Fr. Harry Bohan.  Initiatives have been taken and projects organised and put in place which have resulted in jobs being created.</P>
    <P>The Leader programme has come to a standstill because of the lack of the necessary finances to complete it. People have been waiting almost six months for Leader II to get underway. Does this demonstrate a commitment on the part of the EU or the Government? I am not blaming this Government but am saying that the Leader programme has been at a standstill for six months.  The Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, launched a welcome initiative last weekend in Ballybunion.  Could we see the Leader programme accelerated and additional finances provided for it?  On the basis of the extension of the programme to the whole country, <Col N="734" /> the finances provided for it will be totally inadequate.</P>
    <P>Some of the areas which benefited from Leader I will be at a disadvantage because of the expansion under the new programme and because the amount of money provided will be totally inadequate to meet demands.  This would be a major shame.  It would be in the interests of everybody if the Minister took an initiative in that regard.</P>
    <P>His colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, deals with the Leader programme. This is the basis of my criticism of the fragmentation of ministerial responsibility, which looses momentum and does not result in an overall concentrated approach.  The concept of a Minister of State with responsibility for western development is good and, as I have said several times, I wish Deputy Carey success.</P>
    <P>There is another perception abroad that there is no solution to the problems in rural areas, particularly in the west. I do not agree with that.  Many of the problems can be resolved with small initiatives.  I support the view, expressed in the report, that it is necessary to do some further research.  Quite an amount of research has already been done.</P>
    <P>We are overburdened with organisations. We debated the fragmentation of the IDA and the division of the responsibilities of agencies.  We have agencies all over the place.  When we debated the IDA I spoke strongly to Deputy Quinn, now Minister for Finance, and said that the breaking up of overall responsibility in the industrial area was fragmenting effort and leaving people unsure, if they wanted assistance, about whom they should go to, whether it is the IDA, Forbairt, county development teams, the Leader programme or county enterprise boards. There was total confusion and that still reigns.  If the Minister can bring some semblance of sanity to those arrangements, he will be very successful.  I wish him luck.</P>

      <P>It gave me an opportunity to refocus.  I support the view expressed in the report about the necessity to undertake further research, especially into a balanced regional development policy.  It is a reasonable comment but I am at a loss to ascertain the nature of our present regional policy.  We do not have a regional policy of any significance and it is certainly not balanced.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to argue at European Union level about dealing with regional imbalances when we cannot deal with regional imbalances in our own jurisdiction. We should, once and for all, set down clearly defined regions.  The western partnership board has been established but it is necessary to put some type of regional development authority on a firm statutory footing and that has not been done.  Instead, there has been a very haphazard approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We discussed a report here in the House a couple of years ago.  Everyone <Col N="736" /> concluded that it was a great initiative and that we should follow it up by establishing a statutory authority to give effect to some of its recommendations. There was a strong representation that there should be a Minister with that responsibility and the Government responded by appointing Deputy Carey who would do a service to our regional development policy if he were to introduce statutory responsibility for regional affairs.</P>
    <P>There are elected regional bodies but they do not have the statutory responsibility necessary to undertake the work. They should be involved and the development organisations in each region should be answerable to those regional authorities as a basis for making an effective effort and establishing meaningful regional development policy. We should define the regions with reference to the existing elected regional personnel which require some statutory responsibilities.</P>
    <P>These organisations need to be able to consult the various organisations involved in the region whether it be Telecom Éireann, An Post, Coillte or the Electricity Supply Board.  Soon after I was elected some 21 years ago, a pilot study was carried out by Ray MacSharry on the co-ordination of State agencies and Government Departments which clearly indicated the overlap.  This point was raised by Senator Byrne last night when he said one agency was not aware of what the other was doing.</P>
    <P>The ESB dig up a main road to lay cables and the post office dig it up the following week to put down telephone wires.  The week after that the county council could lay a sewerage scheme and then dig it up again to put down a water pipe.  This daft situation has existed for a long time in this country. The local regional authorities which have been put in place should be given the function of co-ordinating the efforts of State agencies and Government Departments in an area to avoid the duplication which is costing millions of pounds.  That funding could be put to <Col N="737" /> better use providing the initiatives mentioned in this document.</P>
    <P>Can anyone in their sober senses convince me that it is possible to stop the population decline in rural areas when one considers the chronic state of county roads?  I attended a meeting in Carran on Monday night which was held in the dressing rooms at Carran GAA field.  When we drove into the meeting the hall was surrounded by tractors because the people could not travel the roads in their cars.  There was no possibility of walking.  We had to make three detours between Ennistymon and Carran &mdash; a distance of a few miles &mdash; because of floods.  There is no prospect of a resolution of this problem in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>Members of local authorities are dissatisfied with the roads allocation they got from the Department of the Environment recently.  We raised this with the last Government.  I raised it with the previous Fianna Fáil Government and I raised it when I was in Government.  We still cannot get a firm commitment from the &ldquo;Dublin Government&rdquo; to do something soon about the state of our county roads.  The situation in relation to the county roads is a national disaster and should be declared as such.</P>

      <P>It is a scandal.  People cannot go to church on Sundays and their children cannot get to their school buses. There are people in Carran who have been living in bed and breakfast accommodation since Christmas because they cannot get into their own homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The NESC report says we must have initiatives to enable some balanced regional development and that we must endeavour to find solutions to western problems.  Surely to God the best initiative would be if this Government had the courage to say, once and for all, that it will set up some system or mechanism, whether in co-operation with local communities or in other ways, to tackle the scandalous state of our county roads <Col N="738" /> and repair them so that people will at least be able to get in and out of their own homes.  This is the first action we must take and we must do so soon.  The time for talking about these things is well past.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy spoke about the necessity for modernisation.  There is quite an amount of modernisation in western areas.  For the first time in generations we are abreast of developments in matters such as satellite communications. We have the benefit of Horizon television in the most remote areas of my constituency.  The Loop Head peninsula, which is the last stop before Boston, Massachusetts, has satellite communication and people are picking up CNN, Sky, Super Channel and a variety of other channels.  The facility exists to modernise things so it is not all doom and gloom in the west.</P>
    <P>The western rural region includes the most attractive areas in the European Communities.  We have the most important national amenities including national parks in the Burren and Killarney. The west has the most scenic and attractive places people could visit in the European Community but we need assistance to develop them and bigger projects which will help the tourism industry.  While the Leader programme, the western development initiatives and the small agri-tourism projects all help in their own way to provide employment opportunities, we need major projects which will attract big numbers and uplift all businesses.</P>
    <P>I fully support the development of parks such as the national park in the Burren and I know the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, also supports it.  I hope he will expedite the completion of the centre in Mullaghmore which will not damage the environment.  I was appalled that the decision to go ahead with the project in Lugalla was rejected because some people in the locality wanted to protect the mountain from any intrusion or development.  The mountain in Lugalla was planted 50 years ago, not by native Irish timber but by imported Norway spruce, sitka <Col N="739" /> spruce and Norway pine.  It is farcical for professionals to suggest that the mountain in Lugalla was never interfered with by man.</P>
    <P>If we agreed to the decision about Luggala, which An Bord Pleanála and others want us to, then we would need to dismantle some of the mansions in the Wicklow area which are owned by people who are the principal objectors to this development.  They want to preserve the mountain for themselves and they do not want a new centre to be built at Luggala because visitors might enjoy the scenery and that would spoil their enjoyment.  They do not suggest dismantling their own properties which are not in keeping with the wilderness of Luggala mountain.  I have heard enough nonsense about this matter.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the Mullaghmore area is a wilderness.  People lived in this area for thousands of years. The population is far less than it was 100 years ago.  These issues must be tackled if we want to solve the problems mentioned in the NESC report.  Will we invest in good projects where enterprise will be rewarded and where sustainable employment opportunities will be created?</P>
    <P>I draw the Minister's attention to the provision of employment opportunities in small towns and villages, particularly in Kilrush where an industry which gave employment to 30 or 40 people was threatened with closure in the past few weeks and frantic efforts were made to rescue it.  Jobs must be created in towns in rural areas, like Kilrush in west Clare which is losing jobs.  Government assistance is needed to protect those jobs.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the co-operatives which are investing millions of pounds in Mexico and in other countries thousands of miles from here to do something about this.  It is questionable what benefit these investments will be for this economy in the long term.  One co-operative, in particular, which I will not name but which the Minister knows, spent millions of pounds on a project in Mexico, but it would not put £100.000 into projects <Col N="740" /> in Kilrush, where it gets some of its raw materials, including milk, to save 30 jobs there.  It is time some of the bosses in our co-operatives asked themselves about their responsibilities to this economy. They lecture us on a daily basis about how we should manage this country's finances and tell the Minister how he should run his Department. However, they are short on commitment when it comes to supporting small industry in their regions.</P>
    <P>I am sure they will not read the Official Report of this House, but they have a responsibility to the people in small industries who are crying out for investment in their businesses.  These co-operatives should invest in towns such as Kilrush, Tralee and Listowel before they look to Mexico.  We may need to get our priorities right, but some people in business also need to look at their priorities and make an effort to help to resolve these problems.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Carey, is the ideal person for this position and I wish him well in the onerous task of trying to make the west a better place in which to live.</P>
      <P>I welcome this detailed report which states in a number of places that better use should be made of local authorities. Members of local authorities will appreciate this.  However, those outside the local authority scene do not seem to know what that means.  Funds are not available for projects in counties Mayo, Galway, Leitrim, Sligo or Roscommon and the catalyst for those projects is the local authority.  Local authority members are the only people who are accountable to the electorate.  However, we are being stripped of our responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of agencies represent County Mayo, including Údarás na <Col N="741" /> Gaeltachta, area partnership boards, county enterprise partnership boards and local authorities and it also benefits under the Leader and IRD programmes. The Minister of State, Deputy Carey, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Gay Mitchell, the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Deenihan, and the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, have responsibilities in this area.  Several Senators mentioned that our limited resources are used for administration by these agencies at different levels.  I ask the Minister to co-ordinate their activities.</P>
    <P>The report states that:</P>
    <P>There are doubts about whether the County Enterprise Boards (CEBs) have the structure, resources and capability to formulate and execute enterprise development strategies for local prosperity.  It will be important to observe the extent to which CEBs devote attention to key strategic activities in the coming years.</P>
    <P>The County Mayo Development Team, one of the best teams in the country, has been replaced by the County Mayo Enterprise Partnership Board.  Hundreds of jobs were created by the County Mayo Development Team under Mr. Sean Smith who was renowned for his development skills in the west.  I have no doubt that the County Mayo Enterprise Partnership Board will play an important role in the development of the county.</P>
    <P>The report also states:</P>
    <P>2.9 The Council is concerned about the heavy reliance on grants in the various rural development schemes. For commercial projects there should be greater use of loans or other forms of repayable finance.</P>
    <P>2.10 Property and the use of property are key factors in almost all kinds of development.  This implies that Local Authorities have the ability to <Col N="742" /> assist or frustrate rural and local development.</P>
    <P>That further copperfastens what I said about the need to make greater use of the local authorities in each county.  The catalyst for western counties should be the local authorities because they can obtain and attract funding, although they should be given greater powers to co-ordinate this with local communities.</P>
    <P>The report is excellent and goes into great detail.  A paper was launched recently by a Dr. Colm McCarthy and I notice that one of those who drafted the report is also a Dr. Colm McCarthy &mdash; whether it is the same man I do not know.</P>

      <P>He was taken to task by Dr. Séamus Caulfield.  For the last three years the western bishops have been highlighting the particular problems of declining rural populations in their dioceses and the need for urgent action to arrest that decline.  Last year the publication of <i>A Crusade for Survival</i> and the setting up of a Government task force to consider the document led to a series of recommendations for action.  Subsequently the Government set up a western development partnership board and the bishops set up a complementary council for the west to harness the input from the voluntary sector in development initiatives.  More recently the new Government has appointed Deputy Carey as Minister of State for western development and rural renewal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A leading Dublin economist has questioned the validity of the case that the rural west has extreme problems.  In both a <i>Sunday Independent</i> review of <i>A Crusade for Survival</i> and a lecture delivered to the Merriman Summer School, Dr. McCarthy dismissed the western case by providing population and employment statistics, which he claims show the west performing as well as or better than the national average between 1971 and 1991.  While many have rejected Dr. McCarthy's view, <Col N="743" /> solely from their knowledge of what is happening, nonetheless his conclusions have attracted widespread media coverage. In recent months both Mr. John Waters and Ms Nuala O Faoláin have devoted columns to the McCarthy debate.  While his conclusions have been challenged it has been assumed the statistics he published are authentic.  A check on the source of the statistics on which he based his case shows they are not just biased and selective, as Mr. Waters said, but that the key statistics have been transposed in error, so that he has drawn conclusions diametrically opposed to what the real statistics indicate. When correctly assigned, the population statistics he uses demonstrate beyond a shadow of doubt that the problems of the rural west are more urgent than in the State generally.  No one from the west has to be told its population and its services are declining and I take issue with Dr. McCarthy on this matter.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Minister addressed this in his contribution when he said:</P>
    <P>The decline in rural areas due to population loss leads to the withdrawal or curtailment of necessary services such as post offices, ESB offices, bank branches, health clinics and county council offices...</P>
    <P>The Minister sees the necessity in the most remote parts of the country to locate those services in &ldquo;one stop shops&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I come from a county which could be a great tourism area but is one of the most underdeveloped counties in that regard.  The current Minister for Tourism and Trade is from our county.  He told us that on recent trips to trade shows in America, Germany and other countries, there were very few, if any, stands from the west.  No one is selling tourism facilities north of Shannon in America or Europe.  The Minister with us today should co-ordinate those agencies, or put in place a scheme so small hotels, guesthouses and even small companies can have a stand at those trade <Col N="744" /> shows.  County Mayo has nine blue flag beaches and the finest fishing lakes in the world.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment to this portfolio and I am happy to see him in the House. It was a rather symbolic appointment because it results from the Government's commitment to the west and rural areas in general.  I look forward to the evolution of the various programmes to see what can be done by the Government.  It is good to know there is at least a commitment and it is up to all of us to move it along.</P>
      <P>Rural development is a recent phenomenon in so far as attention has only been drawn to it of late.  It was always happening, sometimes in a negative and sometimes in a positive way.  It was governed almost entirely by fluctuations in the Common Agricultural Policy. In the last few years we have seen a redesigned CAP and its impact is more questionable.</P>
      <P>Rural economies feel more fragile than they used to and there is much more uncertainty.  People are beginning to respond and some diversification is happening.  Landowners are doing their best to change from traditional products, which are subject to quotas, to new products which are better placed in the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Retention of population in rural areas will be more difficult and will always <Col N="745" /> pose problems.  The east coast has a burgeoning population while other provinces and regions are losing population, as can be seen by anyone who checks the statistics.  In Cavan and Monaghan the population has decreased over the last ten years and we must halt that.</P>
    <P>The Minister Deputy Carey pointed out that when population decreases services are less available and in many cases disappear.  That is a vicious circle because once services disappear people follow them.  They leave for the centre where services are available.  I welcome the &ldquo;one stop shop&rdquo; initiative the Minister announced, where services can be combined in a single building with less overheads, making it possible for the services to survive.</P>
    <P>Development of the rural economy in Cavan and Monaghan could and should be used as a model for the rest of Ireland.  The goods produced by landowners and the farming community are processed locally; the mushroom factory is a great example of this development. Mushrooms are grown in a &ldquo;satellite growing&rdquo; method in many places, taken to a central place for processing and brought to the market place.  There is a huge turnover and many jobs have been created.  That is a model that can be used by communities everywhere.  Poultry is the same type of industry in which there is satellite growing and central processing.  Now we are progressing to further processing and added value, thereby trying to create more jobs.</P>
    <P>We have an incredible community in Cavan/Monaghan.  It was probably necessity that drove us to such achievements in the poultry and mushroom industries.  I am confident, to some degree, about the future there. However, there is much to be done and we need a great deal of support.  In the past we have not received much support. Much of our industry is native and not grant aided.  It is a credit to us that we have managed to achieve so much but we need support.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to community development, particularly in Border counties. Those counties benefited from the IFI <Col N="746" /> which had a programme of giving priming grants to community groups and offering such groups assistance to carry out whatever work they believed was valuable and necessary in their areas. The IFI and Leader programmes have achieved a fantastic sea change in the attitudes of people throughout Ireland, particularly in Border counties where community groups have blossomed. Those groups are now getting tremendous confidence.  The community gets together and elects a committee which decides, in a somewhat faltering manner, to carry out a little development. Thinking matures and they get used to the idea that they can do things for themselves.  I know of communities that are preparing to make significant investments. The community development associations are replacing the old rural co-operative movement in job creation. Rural co-operatives did a massive job in the development of rural Ireland for 100 years.  That role has been diluted because rural co-operatives are retrenching, reorganising and centralising. They are moving away from the rural areas they developed.  That is a painful process.</P>
    <P>However, the local development associations have the potential to become the new co-operative movement. I know through my involvement with these groups that they have the potential to make huge investments. Indeed, a number of groups I am working with are preparing to make investments costing millions of pounds.  That development is growing out of necessity. We are losing population and there are no jobs in local areas.  The people are standing up for their rights and emancipation is taking place all over the country.  People are realising that they have power and they are prepared to use it.</P>
    <P>I wish to outline to the Minister the problems that exist.  A community decides, for example, to make a substantial investment.  It might have to borrow £0.5 million to do so.  However, the grant aid agencies are quite slow in making payments.  If a contractor is <Col N="747" /> involved, he or she must be paid at various times throughout the development of a project.  If that person is not paid the project comes to a halt.  That causes huge problems for community groups who are short of resources.  The cost of carrying borrowings throughout the development of a project is huge.  I want the Minister to address this problem.</P>
    <P>Can we get a more efficient response from the grant aid bodies?  Instead of writing the cheque six months later can we be given the cheque soon after verification that the work is done has arrived in the office?  Can there be a quick response to prevent a drain of local funding into financial institutions? That is the big problem.  I know communities that are willing to borrow £0.5 million or £0.75 million for viable projects before this year is out.  What is happening is incredibly exciting.  If the first efforts are successful they will be examples for other community groups to do likewise.  We must support them and ensure that the initial efforts are successful.  There are many people with skills and good ideas but they cannot get into business.  The local development association can put them into business. I envisage a fantastic future for rural, town and village communities as a result of this process.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister good luck in his job.  He has a major task on hand.  He must co-ordinate a plethora of grant aiding bodies and programmes &mdash; it is frightening to look at the list.  However, that is essential to the development of Ireland in a way that has never happened before.  I look forward to continuing to be part of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Minister well in the task of western development and rural renewal.  It is a task of immense magnitude.  My only regret is that the Government did not create the Minister's portfolio when it was allocating the ministries rather than introducing it as an addition, so to speak.  That is no reflection on Deputy Carey's ability.  It is an immense task and will require not <Col N="748" /> just the Minister's energy but the energy of the whole Government.</P>
      <P>This report should be mandatory reading.  Everybody in the Departments of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Finance, the Environment and possibly the Department of the Marine &mdash; Departments that have anything to do with rural development and rural life &mdash; should be required to read this report. County managers should be required to read it as should politicians.  In fact, the only people who probably are not required to read it are those who are involved in community work in local areas and rural development because they could have written it.</P>
      <P>The report is a damning indictment of the lack of policy on the part of successive Governments in this area.  The Minister said it emphasises the many positive initiatives which are already impacting on life in rural communities.  There are positive initiatives although it must be said that most of them originated in Europe.  However, chapter 7, which deals with past policies and policy perspectives on rural development, concludes:</P>
      <P>Overall, this review of policy orientations and perspectives suggests that, while the various components of a comprehensive rural development policy have been identified at one time or another over the past 30 years, a clear and consistent approach within a well-articulated policy framework has not emerged.</P>
      <P>Another chapter, which deals with diversification of the farm business, offers the same type of analysis and conclusions:</P>
      <P>Strategies that can help stimulate entrepreneurship and generate opportunities for new work and income creation across a diversified set of sectors are needed if the continuity of many local communities is to be secured.</P>
      <P>The chapter on services and infrastructures concludes:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="749" /> Locational and reorganisation decisions, especially within the public sector, need to take greater cognisance of the interrelationships between the provision of public services &mdash; and of the implications of decisions to change them &mdash; for the State's policies to maintain rural population levels.</P>
    <P>The following chapters make similar conclusions.  The report is an indictment of the lack of policy and coherence in this area.  Unless we come to terms with that and unless we overcome the interagency rivalries that have bedevilled rural life we will make no progress whatsoever.</P>
    <P>The report is a catalogue of rural decline.  Figures in the report state that in 1991 over 107,000 of the 160,000 farms in the country were not viable.  Of the 107,000 there were only 27,000 farms on which spouses had an extra source of income to help maintain them. More tellingly, 30,000 have dropped out of the statistics.  They have disappeared, not because they have gone out of business but because their level of economic activity was not sufficient to warrant their inclusion.</P>
    <P>What sort of picture does that portray of rural poverty and rural decline?  I suppose, it makes one mindful of Goldsmith's poem where he talked about &ldquo;Ill fares the land, to hast'ning ills a prey, Where wealth accumulates, and men decay&rdquo;.  That was written a couple of centuries ago and seems to be as true now, or maybe more true, of the society we are living in and trying to develop.</P>
    <P>The question then arises is rural depopulation an inevitability?  Must it continue until the super highways we have built to the west bring the people out of the country and allow the tourists to look at the few curiosities that are left?  Is that the scenario?  I suggest it is not necessarily the scenario provided the intervention takes place because the report tells of a population turnaround in the 1970s where the pattern of decline was arrested.  Why was that the case?  The reason was we joined the <Col N="750" /> Common Market and there was a rapid increase in incomes and people had some reasonable level of prosperity. That is what it is all about.  It is creating the conditions in which people can live, work and create wealth in the rural areas because, unless we do that, whatever other measures we introduce are only stopgaps.  When they have given the five or ten year breathing space we go back to the original problem, the people leave and then we wonder if the investment was worthwhile in the first place.  I would say it is worthwhile because the underlying problem, and it is referred to in the report, is unemployment in society as a whole.  What happens these people who are forced to leave rural communities and the land and where can they find alternative employment?  That is the conundrum that faces the Government and the European Union.  It is probably better, even from a purely cynical economic point of view, to spend the money keeping the people in rural areas rather than putting them on an over-supplied labour market and having them live in urban ghettos.  The point I want to make is that the decline need not necessarily be irreversible, and if there is profit and economic activity, it is possible to turn it around.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a presumption that this rural malaise is confined to the west.  That is not the case.  It is a much wider decline and again that is underlined in the report when it talks about what happened in the midlands in the 1980s when it became another problem area.</P>
    <P>I had not intended to talked about the co-ops but the issue was raised and I need to respond.  Senator Daly, in particular, seemed to believe that co-ops have some responsibility to return to the practice of taking in milk at the crossroads in cans and that they should take on their social responsibilities.  The most effective way the co-ops can ensure they fulfil their social responsibilities, of which they are aware, is to create the international businesses that can live in a highly competitive environment.  I <Col N="751" /> have no criticisms of Kerry Group plc or anybody buying businesses in the United States, Australia or Britain which will give them the economic mass that will allow them to repatriate money earned abroad.  In this country, we always talk about the effect of bringing international business and manufacturing companies which repatriate their wealth.  Let us have a few companies abroad repatriating the wealth they create there so that we can look after rural society in the way it should be and give a return to the farmers who produce goods for those co-ops.  I see that as the way forward and it was articulated to us by the co-operative movement at the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation last week.  Let us be clear about what it is we require of our co-ops.</P>
    <P>Senator Cotter referred to the traditional function of the co-op in terms of its local social responsibility, that is, through community effort and activity linked to the co-ops.  There is plenty of evidence of that in the Leader groups. Many of the more successful Leader groups have the co-ops as a driving force, particularly in the west, the one in Mayo and Sligo, where NCF are involved; there is the one in the area of the Barrow, Nore and Suir where Avonmore plc are centrally involved; there is another in west Cork where the cattle breeding society are involved.  It can be done but let us not stifle the co-ops in their economic activity.  It must be 25 years ago when the late Brian Daly, the manager of Lough Egish Co-op, remarked that co-ops have two functions: one is social and the other is to make a profit, but if they do not make a profit they cannot fulfil the first function, and that is as true today as it was when he said it.  I was led into that alley because of Senator Daly's intervention.</P>
    <P>The report points to serious deficiencies in training and in statistical backup in terms of defining and knowing the problem.  They are within the Government's ambit to sort out and address. The Minister made the point that the <Col N="752" /> report calls for further research, and that is true.  It is evident that there is no national policy in respect of rural development.  What has emerged is a policy which originated from the European Union as a result of CAP reform. The drive behind the rural development policy, such as it is, is from the European Union, the farm organisations and the people on the ground but not from the Departments of State and not from the Government, and maybe not even from the Opposition parties.  My view is that rural policy must embrace more than farming.  It is frequently confused with farming &mdash; obviously farming is central to the rural problem &mdash; but it has to be taken in a broader context.  We have to look at rural society as an entity in terms of the local village, the local shops and the local services and the farming community.  Until we look at rural policy in that light we are only tinkering at the edges.</P>
    <P>Rural development has become almost a conference circuit.  Members of local authorities know that any month there will be a conference somewhere on rural development and rural employment. I wonder how much money has been devoted to the conference circuit. The people who go on the conference circuit drive nice motor cars, live in nice houses, probably mortgaged, but they are comfortable.  It is nice for them to talk about the problem but it does not achieve anything.  Let us keep the focus where it belongs &mdash; on the people on the ground.</P>
    <P>There is huge energy and enthusiasm, there are ideas bubbling up all over the place.  The Leader programme has shown the capacity of rural communities to help themselves.  It is only a case of giving them the power.  I see little evidence that the political establishment at county council level, or at any other level, is prepared to give that empowerment to local communities to help themselves.  It has to be a partnership. The county council or the other levels cannot be excluded but I frequently see where that partnership is not working because somebody somewhere <Col N="753" /> has to hold the reins and they will not give the people who know what is happening on the ground the power to go ahead and do the job.</P>
    <P>One of the benefits of Leader is that the applications were made locally and the local board made the decision as to how the money would be spent.  Now under the county enterprise partnership boards, there is a similar set-up in terms of allocation of funds.  What happens? Decisions are made in the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  That does not make sense.  Senator Daly is right when he says we have a multiplicity of agencies competing with one another.  People are confused.  They do not know where to go.  One positive aspect is the services centres.  They would steer people in the right direction. It is something I commend and I hope it will happen quickly.</P>

      <P>This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the Dáil.  In accordance with Standing Order 82, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage.  On the question &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, the Minister may explain the purposes of the amendments made by the Dáil and this is looked upon as the report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad.  The only matter, therefore, that may be discussed is the amendments made by the Dáil.</P>
      <P>For the convenience of Senators I have arranged for the printing and circulation of those amendments.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>There were 13 Government amendments to the Adoptive <Col N="754" /> Leave Bill in the Dáil; the amendments are listed Nos. 1 to 13 on the amendment sheet.  All the amendments, with the exception of amendment No. 6, are purely technical.  Amendment No. 6 is a substantive amendment.  Amendments Nos. 1 to 5 are related technical amendments.  I will outline first the purpose of the substantive amendment &mdash; amendment No. 6 &mdash; and then describe briefly the related technical amendments.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 6 replaces subsection (3) of section 4 of the Bill with two new subsections.  The new subsection (3) is similar to, but broader in scope than, the subsection which it replaces and is a fairly common provision in labour legislation.  It makes clear that a contract of employment or a collective agreement may provide arrangements which are more beneficial to an employee than the minimum provisions in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Examples of the more beneficial arrangements permitted by the provision would include 11 or more weeks adoptive leave instead of the ten weeks statutory minimum or payment during the period of leave.  The new subsection (4) of section 4 ensures that an employer who gives more beneficial arrangements to an adopting parent will not be obliged to make similar provision for employees who are not adopting parents.  The purpose of the related technical amendments Nos. 1 to 5 is as follows.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 1 extracts the definitional element in the existing subsection (1) of section 4 and makes a new subsection (1) which deals only with the definition of &ldquo;agreement&rdquo;.  There is no change to the definition of agreement.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 are technical amendments to the existing subsection (1) of section 4 consequential on amendment No. 1.  Amendment No. 3 deletes the definitional element in the existing subsection (1) which is now contained in the new subsection (1).</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 similarly amend the existing section 4 (2). Amendments Nos. 7, 8 and 11 are identical technical amendments. The amendments replace three references to the Maternity Protection of Employees Act, 1981, with references to the Maternity Protection Act, 1994. The Maternity Protection Act, 1994, has been enacted since the Adoptive Leave Bill was passed by the Seanad.</P>
      <P>The amendments are not strictly necessary because section 2 (5) of the Bill provides that a reference to any enactment includes a reference to any enactment as amended.  However, the amendments are made for the sake of ease of reference for future users of the legislation.</P>
      <P>The deletion of section 23 and amendments Nos. 9 and 10 form a single composite proposition.  The new provisions contained in amendments Nos. 9 and 10 are modelled on similar provisions in the Maternity Protection Act, 1994.  They leave redundant the contents of section 23 of the Bill, which was consequently proposed for deletion. The amendments are of a purely technical nature and have no practical implications for the scope of the Bill.  They achieve the same purpose as the text being replaced but in a neater form.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 12 inserts a comma to section 33(1) of the Bill as passed by the Seanad.  The insertion will facilitate a correct interpretation of the subsection. Amendment No. 13 is a textual amendment to ensure consistency between this provision and other provisions in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation has had a difficult passage through both Houses since the Minister initiated it in the Seanad in November 1993.  It was a further 12 months before Committee Stage was taken and at that point it had been subject to quite a number of changes.  Many of these improved the basic concept of the Bill, which was to give effect to adoptive leave for couples <Col N="757" /> adopting a child.  At the time, all sides of the House welcomed the Bill.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage, the Bill underwent quite a number of changes as a result of changes in other legislation. Despite attempts to amend the Bill by what is now the Government side of the House, the amendments were not considered necessary and the Bill proceeded to the other House, where it was amended.  The Minister described these amendments as technical, to take account of certain changes in law since the Bill was initiated.  However, I am not sure that those amendments were not known when Committee Stage was taken in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>I am open to correction but I understood that when the Bill came before the House the Minister was attempting to grant adoptive leave to either spouse. I am not fully aware whether that was the point at which the legislation stood but speakers on both sides said that would be a most welcome innovation and that there was an absolute need for this type of legislation otherwise people adopting children would not have the same rights and entitlements as those who gave birth naturally.  More importantly, all sides recognised that there was a particular need for adoptive parents to bond with the child.  I note that the amendments proposed by my colleague, Deputy Woods, in the other House tried to achieve the objective of allowing adoptive leave to either spouse.  The Minister did not accept those amendments and this does not reflect the tone of the debate in this House when the Bill was initiated in 1993.</P>
      <P>I had hoped the Minister would have explained the technical reasons for the amendments rather than simply stating, for example, that a section was technically amended with reference to the Maternity Protection Act, 1994.  I had hoped he would tell the House what changes had taken place since the Bill was initiated and passed by the Seanad to warrant these amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section which allows for an additional week of leave is welcome.  I <Col N="758" /> ask the Minister to tell me if he is happy with the fact that I, as an adopting parent, given an additional week of leave by&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no additional week.  The Senator misunderstood me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe I did.  I thought the Minister said that the new subsection in section 4 ensures that an employer who gives more beneficial arrangements to an adopting parent will not be obliged to make similar provision for employees who are not adopting parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  The Bill says that some employers might wish to go beyond the statutory minimum provided, which is ten weeks.  They may do that without there being consequences to follow that would bring inequality positions into play which might perhaps enable somebody else to make a claim for the more generous provision being made by that employer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I was incorrect in specifying one week.  In giving the more beneficial arrangements, whatever period they may last, I ask the Minister if he is confident that this section of the Bill reflects equality of treatment in the law.  While I would argue that is the case for granting this kind of leave, I would similarly argue that a mother who has gone through childbirth should be entitled to the same kind of provisions in law as somebody who is adopting. This provision states that it is at the employer's discretion to give this leave to an adopting parent.  There is no obligation to give it to someone who is not adopting.  I ask the Minister if that is in keeping with equality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister said, a lot of these amendments are technical in nature.  I am still unclear as to whether the Minister intended in the initial legislation that adoptive leave could be extended to either spouse.  This legislation certainly prohibits the granting of adoptive leave to the father.  I may be confused, <Col N="759" /> but I initially thought the Minister intended that it might be extended to either spouse.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in welcoming this Bill, as I did on the first day the Minister brought it in.  I know things can change and occurrences in the passage of time can necessitate the change of legislation, but the Minister's Department seems to be suffering particularly badly as a consequence of this.  Bills that have been initiated have been changed substantially before they have been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Is there a need to make haste slowly in a lot of occasions on some of this equality legislation? Other important Bills which I know the Minister holds dear, such as the Matrimonial Home Bill, have been struck down.  Maybe there is a case for ensuring that what is enacted can be passed and can stand the test of time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome these amendments to the Bill.  Amendment No. 6 &mdash; the other amendments are technical &mdash; facilitates employers to give leave in excess of that stated in the Bill.  The principle that any employer can give any level of benefits to their employees is accepted in the areas of labour law and industrial relations; they have the freedom and right to do so.  This amendment facilitates custom and practice throughout industry and commerce.  Of course, the Bill does not prevent adoptive leave for fathers.  That is at the discretion of the employer.  It is not a legal right.</P>
      <P>There have been extensive changes to this Bill since it was introduced in November 1993.  It is a credit to the Dáil and the Seanad &mdash; most of these amendments came from this House &mdash; that we honed and improved the legislation and that is our duty.  One would hope that the Minister, as he did on many occasions, and other Ministers accept improvements and introduce their own improvements to a Bill following Second Stage debate.  That is the purpose of the Oireachtas.  It certainly worked with this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear, from what the Minister has said, that many of these amendments are technical and thought worthwhile to give proper effect to the legislation.  I welcome the additional section which allows for an employer to give additional rights to his employee. As has been said by Senator Neville, this is accepted in employment law and we should not criticise it.  Such leeway is a sensible provision.</P>
      <P>Section 11 of the Social Welfare Bill, 1995, also allows for the introduction of the adoptive benefit scheme.  What has been put into effect in this law in allowing adoptive leave has also been put into practical effect through the Social Welfare Bill by allowing social welfare payment in that area.  I am pleased to see the Departments working hand in hand.</P>
      <P>Senator McGennis said that the Bill was substantially changed.  We ought to welcome this.  Indeed, that is our role as legislators.  If the Bill as first initiated were to be accepted, we would be made redundant and that would not be good either for us or for democracy in general. The Minister is to be complimented on the fact that he is open to amendments and always has been, unlike previous Ministers who have come before this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment treats an adopting mother in exactly the same way as a natural mother is treated under the maternity protection legislation &mdash; the wording of the section is nearly identical.  There is full equality of treatment.  The Bill never sought to extend paternity leave to men generally. I have already indicated that I would <Col N="761" /> hope to address such a development in the context of parental leave and that matter is being considered at the moment in the European context.</P>
      <P>So far as extensive changes to this or other Bills are concerned, the reason our legislative system provides for five stages of a Bill in the Dáil and the Seanad is to enable mature consideration as to the structure of Bills, amendments that may be required, to take note of comments that may be made by Members on all sides of the Dáil and Seanad and new situations that may arise in the course of Bills going through.  It is right and proper that the best possible legislation should be produced at the end of the day.  It is my intention, no matter how long it may take, to get the best possible legislation. Once it goes on the Statute Book, it is not easily buried or amended.  It is important to get it right.  I believe in using the procedures of both Houses to achieve that end and I am always interested to hear comments from Members on improving Bills, not just opposition for opposition's sake, but constructive amendments and comments on legislation as it proceeds.</P>
      <P>The legislation will make adoptive leave available on a statutory basis &mdash; we have never had that before.  I hope to be in a position to make a commencement order which will bring the Act in its entirely into operation very shortly after its enactment.  All going well I hope statutory adoptive leave will be available within a fortnight or so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation will benefit employees, primarily adopting mothers, by providing for a minimum of ten weeks adoptive leave from work beginning on the day the child is placed for adoption.  Adoptive leave will attract the social welfare allowance which is pitched at the same level as maternity benefit.  As Senator Gallagher said, section 11 of the Social Welfare Bill, 1995, published last week, provides for the introduction of the adoptive benefit by way of regulation.  The Bill also provides for up to four weeks additional adoptive leave immediately following <Col N="762" /> the period of adoptive leave.  In the case of a foreign adoption some or all the additional adoptive leave may be taken immediately before the day of placement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on bringing the Bill through both Houses.  I am pleased that adoptive leave will be available on a statutory basis within two weeks.  The Commission on the Status of Women recommended the introduction of adoptive leave.  As a member of the commission, I welcome the recognition of the needs of adopting parents and their children. The commission made other recommendations on paternity leave and leave for family responsibilities.  Perhaps now that the Minister has dealt with adoptive leave, he could turn his attention to these matters.  It is important that paternity leave is introduced and that family leave is available to both parents because family responsibilities should not only be the responsibility of the women.  We must ensure that child care, home and work duties are shared.  We must do what we can through legislation to encourage this.  I encourage the Minister to consider this as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for introducing this legislation. This is not simply a statutory instrument to allow an adopting parent take leave and to ensure they do not lose out financially as a result, it is a broader statement, which I welcome.  The Minister should not interpret criticism as personal. I have never opposed anything for the sake of opposition.  Senator Neville made comments and suggested amendments to improve legislation when he was on the Opposition benches. All Governments should open up a little more to Opposition amendments. We could be back on the <Col N="763" /> Government benches next month.  It is good that there are many stages to approve and amend legislation and this is the proper way to deal with legislation. I would ask the Minister with whom we were in Government and may be again, and my party to lighten up a little.  There is nothing wrong with accepting Opposition amendments in the Dáil or the Seanad.  When we reach that stage, we might have true democracy with legislation which is sound and will stand the test of time.</P>

The Minister said my amendments were outside the scope of the Bill although I was trying to improve the situation in regard to adoption in general. The Minister made a commitment to look at the amendments which I proposed to include in the Bill and I will hold him to that commitment.  I am sure Senator McGennis will assist me, although she was silent when I put these cases some of months ago.</P>

I am delighted the Adoptive Leave Bill, 1994, will become law a few weeks after its enactment.  It will be of benefit to people, who through no fault of their own, have been unable to have children and are anxious to follow adoption procedures.  It is apt that this legislation should come into force, particularly when there is so much controversy about abortion legislation, because it upholds the right to life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to draw the attention of the House to the <Col N="764" /> transitional arrangements provided for in the Bill.  These arrangements will be of particular interest to employed adopting mothers who have had a child placed with them since the middle of February.  These employees will have missed out by weeks, the opportunity to benefit in full from the leave provisions of the Bill.  However, Senators will recall that as a result of amendments to the Bill made in this House, most of these employees will be entitled to a portion of the minimum period of ten weeks adoptive leave and to the four weeks additional adoptive leave.  These transitional entitlements must be taken up by eligible employees immediately following the coming into operation of the legislation.  The arrangements would apply similarly in the case of a sole male adopter.</P>
      <P>I thank Senators for the way the received this Bill.  The Seanad has dealt carefully with the various proposals.  I am particularly conscious in the case of this Bill of the painstaking work undertaken in this House last autumn when approximately 100 Government amendments were taken on Committee Stage. We ensured that the proposal which now passes into law is an effective and useful addition to the corpus of employment protection legislation.  I would like to express my thanks and appreciation to the officials in my Department who worked hard to bring us to this point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, to the House and thank her for taking this Adjournment Matter.  The Coalition Government has paid special attention <Col N="765" /> to problems in rural Ireland and to rural renewal.  The Minister of State, Deputy Carey, initiated pilot studies in co-operation with services in rural areas as a prerequisite to halting the departure of services.  The Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, is also doing excellent work in the Leader II programme.</P>
      <P>In County Limerick this work is being overshadowed by an issue of immediate importance &mdash; the critical state of county roads.  In some places county roads have disappeared and areas of the county are almost inaccessible.  We can have all the programmes and initiatives to improve rural Ireland but if people do not have access to their houses, they are not interested regardless of how welcome and beneficial they may be. People want to be able to get to their homes, travel to their place of work and to their local village.  I ask the Minister to treat this as a matter of urgency and increase the grant for county roads by a substantial amount in the current year. The increase should be in the region of £1 million which is equal to the amount provided by Limerick County Council for 1995 in excess of the 1994 figures.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to express how bad the situation is in County Limerick.  Road conditions are the worst in living memory. Many roads are completely impassable and dangerous and this has resulted in accidents.  Damage to vehicles is a regular occurrence.  If this were costed the figure would run into several hundreds of thousands of pounds.  There are many rural areas where it is dangerous to walk on the roads; cycling is impossible; elderly people are isolated in their homes and children take their lives in their hands travelling to school and to school bus pick-up points.  One must express concern about accessibility for the emergency services in certain areas and delays that may be caused to ambulances, the fire brigade or other services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The winter of 1994-95 has been one of the wettest in decades in our area. The rain has washed away the surface and in many areas removed even the foundations of the roads.  On 7 and 8 December last 25.5 millimetres of rainfall was recorded at the Shannon Airport <Col N="766" /> weather station.  Extraordinary rainfall was experienced on 26 January 1995 when 24.6 millimetres was recorded and on 27 January 1995 when the figure was 32.8 millimetres.  Monthly recorded rainfall at Shannon Airport for December 1994 was 181.1 millimetres compared with the normal figure of 106 millimetres, an increase of 70.8 per cent.</P>
    <P>The recorded figure for January 1995 was 190.2 millimetres against the normal rainfall for the month of 93 millimetres, an increase of 205 per cent, more than double the average rainfall.  The figure for February 1995 at Shannon Airport was 156.8 millimetres; the normal level of rainfall is 63 millimetres.  The increase for February 1995 is 249 per cent, almost two and a half times the average.</P>
    <P>It has been an incredible winter and has had an enormous effect on the roads.  High rainfall was also experienced last winter: December 1993 saw 217.6 millimetres, January 1994 saw 164.8 millimetres and February 1994 saw 111.6 millimetres.  We have had an accumulation of damage from weather over two winters.  The unprecedented level of rainfall has destroyed the condition of the roads and we have an emergency as a result.  The Government must acknowledge the crisis and assist the council in providing special funding in 1995 to make roads passable to many areas of our county.</P>
    <P>County Limerick has the highest intensity of milk production in the country resulting in the highest volume of the type of traffic which causes most damage.  Dairying is the life blood of the economic activity of our county; the county depends on the production of milk for the livelihood of many of its people, those on and off the farm.  Milk must be collected and transported to the co-operatives; County Limerick supplies 10 per cent or 110 million gallons of the 1,100 million gallons of the national milk quota &mdash; the highest intensity of any county.  It is heavy vehicles such as bulk tankers, lorries, tractors and silage machinery, and not cars which affect the condition of our roads.  The impact on a road of a ten tonne lorry is equal to that of 10,000 cars.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="767" /> In essence, the level of service to agricultural activity is the measure of service which the roads are expected to provide.  A significant case can be made to the Government for funding for county roads.  The co-operative creameries pay a substantial amount in road tax for commercial vehicles around the country.  The largest percentage of this is paid outside County Limerick because most of our co-operatives are outside the county.  County Limerick collected in excess of £8 million in car tax in 1994.  In a crisis the Department of the Environment must recognise the special circumstances prevailing in County Limerick and increase substantially the allocation to our regional roads over and above its allocation.</P>
    <P>One may ask what the county council is doing.  Limerick County Council is increasing its own contribution by more than £1 million.  All members of the council from all parties agreed to take the hard decisions at estimates time.  It is an indication of the level of deterioration of the roads that prior to the floods of this winter and the consequent damage, the members of Limerick County Council decided to substantially increase the charges and rates to deal with the problem.  I request the Minister to substantially increase the Government's contribution from Central Funds.</P>
    <P>The county manager has estimated that to bring the roads to an acceptable level &mdash; the level they were at in the 1970s &mdash; would cost about £23 million. We are not asking for that; we want it over a period of years.  If rates had not been removed the council's income for 1994 would have been in the region of £7.4 million.  The deterioration in county roads has been happening since the discretion was taken away from councils to collect money.  All Governments since 1977 have a responsibility in this matter.</P>
    <P>I entreat the Minister of State to communicate to the Minister for the Environment, and the Government, the message that we in County Limerick need urgent action.  We want our unique situation to be recognised.  All the political <Col N="768" /> parties in the county are united in one voice.  We asked the last Government and we were disappointed; we are asking this Government and we do not want to be disappointed again.  We ask the Minister of State to convey to the Minister, Deputy Howlin, our absolute frustration.  I will be going to a meeting about roads tonight and I expect it will be attended by hundreds.  That is an indication of people's concern.</P>

      <P>I join Senator Neville in requesting additional funding for our county roads.  The problem of our county roads has been with us for many years and has arisen as a result of the removal of domestic rates on houses in 1977.  Up to that time local authorities had the capacity to raise the funding they needed to provide a level of service which they required within their county. We had the power, if we needed additional funding, to increase the rates. Since the removal of domestic rates in 1977 our rates support grant has fallen annually and has not met the level we need for the services.</P>
      <P>Many of the county roads in rural Ireland are the life blood of the community; whether for the milk supplier, the machinery contractor or those who have to earn a living in milk or beef production, they must have a road to earn their income.  It is vital for them to have a road to transport their product, be it milk or beef, to the market and to get in feed or silage machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The vast majority of our county roads have not changed since they were built 100 or 150 years ago.  Until the 1950s the means of transport was horses and carts. Unfortunately, or fortunately as the case may be, we have had a complete change in the style of farming over the past 40 years.  We now have heavy machinery involved, such as slurry tanks, silage machinery or milk lorries, and the roads are not able to carry the weight.  As a result, the roads are breaking down; the surface has gone and we <Col N="769" /> cannot get sufficient funding from central Government to resurface them.</P>
    <P>This is not just a problem in my county of Roscommon, but in the west as a whole.  A substantially increased level of funding will have to be provided to maintain a reasonable road standard, and a reasonable standard of life for those using the roads.  Senator Neville clearly pointed out that whether it is the children going to school or people going to mass or going about their daily work, they are not able to travel on some of the roads.  The flooding has caused problems this year and has put a high cost on local authorities in trying to alleviate it and improve services but the problem has been there for the past few years and unless we get substantial additional funding for the county roads it will not be tackled.</P>
    <P>Our local authority has increased the amount of money we raise.  We have increased our water charges substantially this year and they are now running in excess of what water is costing in order to meet the shortfall on the county roads funding.  We have introduced this year for the first time a sewerage charge and privatised refuse collection, and that has saved us money. Nevertheless, we are only scratching the surface of the problem.  We need additional funding.  If that funding has to come by way of additional taxation, so be it.  The road structure will have to be repaired and built up.  If not the people will not be able to live in rural Ireland.  The dwindling population of the west will decline further if we are not able to maintain a proper road structure there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senators know, I was very pleased to be able to negotiate a substantial amount of funding for county roads as part of the Structural Funds.  State funding for non-national roads is now provided generally by way of annual discretionary grants to local authorities and grants under this European Union co-finance scheme for specific road improvement projects which <Col N="770" /> promote employment and economic activity.  In order to qualify for grants for county roads under the latter scheme, projects must have a significant and quantifiable economic impact, particularly as regards employment and on industrial, tourism, fisheries, forestry, agricultural and rural development. As I have said before in this House, that scheme is not designed to fill our favourite pothole; it is about roads that lead to jobs.  Senator Neville has made the point that many of the roads in County Limerick have jobs at the end of them in terms of agriculture, the food industry and so on.</P>
      <P>Proposals received from Limerick County Council and local authorities generally for funding in 1995 were assessed having regard to their individual merits and for compliance with the European Commission approved criteria applying to the grant scheme.  The non-national road grant allocations notified earlier this week by the Minister to Limerick County Council include grants totalling £1,169,000 for eight specific improvement projects which will contribute to economic development in the area, particularly in the industrial, tourism and forestry sectors.</P>
      <P>In addition, discretionary grants totalling £2,054,000 have been allocated to Limerick County Council this year. Included is a supplementary improvement grant of £250,000 in recognition of the poor state of roads in the county. This allocation is over and above the normal discretionary grants and is confined to a number of county councils experiencing difficulty in maintaining regional and local roads up to an acceptable standard.  That is concrete recognition by the Department of the specific problems of County Limerick to which Senator Neville adverted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is now a matter for Limerick County Council to determine how best to use these grants and its own resources provision, including the programme of works to be undertaken to repair roads damaged by the recent storms and flooding.  I am glad to see that Limerick County Council are putting £1 million extra of their own money into this project because the Government <Col N="771" /> funding for county roads is meant to supplement money spent at local level.  I know the Minister for the Environment is concerned to give money to those local authorities that are prepared to put their own money where their mouth is as well, and I am glad to hear that from Limerick County Council.</P>
    <P>Special grants are not provided for repairs arising from poor weather.  In line with established practice, local authorities are advised to reserve as a contingency fund a proportion of their discretionary grants for this purpose. The Minister has secured additional funding for non-national roads in the budget including £4 million as an immediate response to the poor condition of these roads which have been aggravated by the recent weather.  We all recognise that this past winter has been particularly appalling and that the bad weather and flooding have damaged the road system.  The discretionary grant allocations notified to Limerick County Council earlier this week incorporate the council's share of this specific budget provision.</P>
    <P>The overall 1995 provision for non-national roads is £103 million.  This may on the face of it appear to compare unfavourably with expenditure in this area last year which totalled £107 million but last year's money included an exceptional £15 million out of the amnesty for the maintenance of non-national roads by county councils and a supplementary block grant of £5 million provided in May 1994 for maintenance of county roads.  In the case of the £15 million the source of funding, the tax amnesty, was accepted to be a once off benefit to the Exchequer.  When this exceptional provision is excluded, the 1995 provision for county roads is 12 per cent higher than the underlying 1994 figure and considerably higher still than the funding provided for these roads in any previous year.  I believe a very serious effort is being made by the Government to address the problem of the county roads.</P>
    <P>The statutory responsibility for the maintenance and improvement of non-national roads lies with local authorities, <Col N="772" /> as is the primary obligation in relation to providing sufficient resources for roadworks.  Government action alone cannot resolve the problem of unsatisfactory road conditions.  There is a need for local authorities generally to face up to their statutory responsibilities for these roads and to make realistic provision from their own resources for maintenance and improvement works.  I am encouraged by the practical steps taken in this regard by Limerick County Council which has spent more than £2 million from its own resources on these roads this year, an increase of almost £770,000 on the council's expenditure in 1994.</P>
    <P>In spite of increasing State support over the years, the Minister for the Environment is fully aware that many roads are in an unsatisfactory state and have further deteriorated as a result of the severe weather in recent times.  For this reason the Department of the Environment is undertaking a comprehensive review of the non-national roads.  This review will address funding issues in detail and its findings will form the basis of future action by the Government in devising and implementing the best strategy which, in co-operation with the local authorities, will bring the non-national roads network up to a standard that people deserve.</P>
    <P>As has been emphasised by the previous Minister, Deputy Smith, on many occasions, it is important when spending money on county roads that we do not simply engage in surface dressing but that the job is done properly and will last.  It is not about filling pot holes; it is about improvements to the road network, using this very substantial amount of public money, and ensuring that they stand the test of time.  That is important.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the last 16 months a bewildering amount has been written and spoken about Clonmannon Retirement Village.  In fact, the plight of the villagers was highlighted on four separate occasions in this House and it is because of the action of Members on all sides of the House that finally there is some light at the end of the tunnel, but not enough.</P>
      <P>During the last 16 months the question has been approached from a variety of potential ways of resolving it.  There was an attempt, for example, in November and December last year by the Eastern Health Board to intervene by putting a management team into the nursing home at Clonmannon. However, that attempt only ended in the nursing home being closed.  Clonmannon was the subject of a number of court hearings during the last 16 months.  Many of these battles were between the then owner, Mr. George Robinson and the Corneill family, the minority shareholders.  That matter was resolved in the courts by a private agreement and payment in July of 1994. There was a separate and very valiant court action by Mr. Lance Hall, one of the residents of Clonmannon.</P>
      <P>In addition to the court hearings Clonmannon featured in hearings before the Employment Appeals Tribunal where seven of the nursing staff brought separate actions challenging the relevant companies for redundancy claims; all seven won.  There was an additional hearing before a rights commissioner in which an award for compensation for unfair dismissal was made to a former worker who, incidentally, at one stage was illegally imprisoned by the management of Clonmannon.  For the record, I wish to put a number of other items in this saga before the House, before calling on the Minister to take a specific action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clonmannon has been mentioned on a number of occasions in Seanad Éireann.  There was, for example, in December 1993 an Adjournment debate in the House.  Early in 1994, following the closing of the nursing home and various outrageous actions including, for example, the cutting off of water and <Col N="774" /> electricity to the elderly residents by the so-called care company, the matter was again raised on two separate occasions in this House.  On the second of these occasions, an Adjournment debate, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Rourke, indicated in very strong terms her personal views, and indeed her personal revulsion, regarding the activities of the company and specifically the named individuals who were charged with the management of the village.</P>
    <P>In March 1994 a deputation was received by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Rourke, and senior officials. I attended that delegation and I came away hoping that the Department of Enterprise and Employment would take some action.  Those hopes, however, were crushed because at the end of March 1994 the file on Clonmannon Retirement Village was returned to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn.  Over the next month there was an extraordinary blizzard of correspondence between myself and the Minister.  By letter of 23 March the Minister was encouraged by me and by others to appoint either a designated official or an examiner under company law to investigate the very serious and well documented allegations, including allegations of operating with fraudulent intent by Hilltop Catering, its associated companies and its management.</P>
    <P>That letter was acknowledged by the Minister in April.  Unfortunately however, the Minister and his Department took the extraordinary view that it was not their responsibility to take action on these issues and they suggested that the elderly people resident in Clonmannon should try and proceed the matter through the courts.  While the correspondence was winging its way between the Seanad and the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Clonmannon itself was back in the courts.  The Minister, Deputy Quinn, was again contacted and was sent a further submission, clearly showing that his Department had responsibilities under company law to act in relation to the company.  The Minister unfortunately decided not to act.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="775" /> On 27 July 1994 there was a substantial feature in <i>The Sunday Times</i> on Clonmannon.  This is one of several features that appeared in a number of journals at the time but was the first one to appear in a British paper.  The Minister was again exhorted to take action. Again he suggested that his Department could not do so.  I personally asked the Minister and his officials to contact the British authorities because it had come to my attention that an undischarged bankrupt issue was involved here and that there was certainly an interest in the British courts in the affairs of people involved with Clonmannon.</P>
    <P>Throughout the summer of last year the issue heated up.  On 29 June the Corneill family and George Robinson reached a settlement in which £125,000 was passed over and Mr. Robinson withdrew from the issue.  On the same day, according to a press report, Allied Irish Banks registered a charge on Clonmannon village with Rayhill Property Company Limited.  This was the first of a number of such charges registered throughout the balance of last year.</P>
    <P>Early in August the village was back in the news.  The solicitors for the Corneill family served a formal notice of forfeiture of lease on all the residents of Clonmannon.  This was the second time they attempted eviction procedures against people who had paid, in some cases, £50,000 and more for short term leaseholds.  There was a series of further press reports and a special programme on RTE.</P>
    <P>The Minister was again approached and indicated that there was not a reasonable basis for intervention under the company law code.  This prompted some further heated exchanges between myself and the Minister.  It is an open secret that our relationship deteriorated very dramatically at this time.  It was my belief that serious fraud was taking place and that there was a serious dereliction of duty on behalf of the Department of Enterprise and Employment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="776" /> In the days which followed there was considerable revulsion at the inactivity of the Department.  The local priest, Fr. Arthur O'Neill from Rathnew, who himself had been the subject of much criticism and outrageous smears by the company, had a petition signed at churches on 27 and 28 August.  There was a very substantial rally outside Clonmannon on 3 September and, at last, the Department of Enterprise and Employment woke up to the fact that there just might be something wrong in Clonmannon.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated in a press statement issued that week that he would now give serious attention to the issue and that there could be good news concerning the village.  This prompted a suggestion by the Minister and his Department that mediation should take place.  The Minister's flirtation with mediation lasted a number of weeks and, thankfully, at the end of this period the Minister came, in my view, to his senses and indicated in early October that, from the information supplied to him, he was appointing a designated official under section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990, to examine the affairs of the companies involved in Clonmannon.</P>
    <P>The designated official commenced his investigations very quickly and he seems to have been doing a very thorough job.  I have made very substantial personal submissions.  I have submitted documentation, including, for example, a cancelled cheque which never went through the accounts of the bank of the companies involved but ended up, nonetheless, in Allied Irish Banks in Manchester.  That cheque was made out for over £17,000 and never seemed to appear in the accounts of the company. I also produced other evidence.</P>
    <P>However, in the period that the investigator has been doing his very thorough job, the strain and stress on the elderly residents has taken its toll.  Husbands and wives who retired to Clonmannon for the final years of their lives have been forcibly separated; one spouse has had to go to a nursing home and move out of the village.  Some have faced <Col N="777" /> more permanent separation.  The death toll at Clonmannon has been mounting alarmingly throughout this affair. Because of the advanced ages of the residents, it would be wrong to suggest that all the deaths could be attributed to stress, but certainly ten people have passed away since this dispute commenced and there is no doubt in my mind, without in any way wishing to sensationalise the matter, that this stress has had a part to play.</P>
    <P>I believe that the evidence of fraud in Clonmannon is so self-evident that no further delay is necessary.  I have submitted to the Minister and to the official involved clear evidence that company law is being consistently and flagrantly abused as a shield behind which activities which are clearly fraudulent in intent are taking place.  I have produced proof of funds being siphoned out of the company and out of the country.  I have produced clear evidence to the Revenue Commissioners and they accept there is a need for thorough investigation by them.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the management of this company is not willing to operate within code of civilised behaviour.  It is equally clear that the greed of the family involved in running the company will not be satisfied until all the residents at Clonmannon are driven out of their homes and their property expropriated. We cannot and should not tolerate this. I would ask the Minister if the investigation could be brought to a speedy conclusion and if the matter of litigation could be put in hand without any further delay.</P>
    <P>May I share my time with Senator Ross?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Sir.  I thank Senator Roche for sharing his time.  I pay tribute to him for leading this battle on the issue of Clonmannon and its residents. I am not familiar with the details of the allegations in the statements he <Col N="778" /> made but I know that the underlying issue &mdash; that old people are vulnerable in a nursing home and are being exploited &mdash; is beyond dispute.  I know from representations made to me and to others that there are separated families here and old people who are vulnerable and they have had their water and ESB supplies cut off.  This is totally unacceptable in Irish society as we know it.</P>
      <P>There are complications but the problem is that the details of the rights and wrong do not matter that much.  What matters is that old people are in trouble and need speedy action to remedy their very acute physical problems.  That speedy action has not been forthcoming.</P>
      <P>As Senator Roche so rightly said, this problem has been going on since 1993. What we need from the Minister is not for him to send in an official, for whom we will have to wait to report, but a reply, a timetable and action as soon as possible.  There are old people looking to the Minister and the Government for action to give them comfort.  It is no good falling behind bureaucracy and red tape and saying we are sending in an official who will carry out an examination. We want the Minister to give them the reassurance that they can live the rest of their days in comfort with electricity, water and all the things people regard as human rights.  I ask the Minister to come to Clonmannon, talk to some of the residents and see for herself how bad the situation is.</P>

      <P>On a very personal level I sympathise with the appalling situation in which the residents of Clonmannon have found themselves.  As Senators know, I used to work with the housing advice organisation, Threshhold, which dealt with people being evicted and experiencing housing difficulties of various kinds.  What is happening in Clonmannon matches some of the worst cases with which I have ever had to deal in my time with Threshhold.  As a fellow <Col N="779" /> human being, I sympathise with these people.</P>
      <P>This has been very sensitive and complex from a legal point of view because of the various cases involved.  The background to these cases has been raised on a number of occasions in the Seanad, particularly by Senator Roche and I will not go into all the details now.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, appointed an authorised officer, Mr. Martin Cosgrove, under section 19 of the Companies Act on 7 October 1994 &mdash; this section requires books or documents relating to specified companies to be produced to the authorised officer in relation to matters under the Act &mdash; to inquire into Rayhill Property Company Limited.  Home Affairs Limited.  Hilltop Catering Limited, and Retirement International Ireland Limited.  It is important to note that such investigations primarily involve only those issues which relate to the Companies Act.  That is Mr. Cosgrove's legal brief.</P>
      <P>Other issues have been alleged but they are not within the ministerial competence of Deputy Rabbitte.  He is the appropriate Minister and in his absence abroad on official business I have been asked to take this Adjournment debate. The function of the authorised officer is to carry out the task assigned to him and to report to the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment with responsibility for Commerce, Science and Technology as soon as possible. That report has not yet been received but I understand completion and submission are imminent.  As soon as it is received I am sure that the Minister will act on it as speedily as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all share the concern expressed about what is happening at Clonmannon. Because of the sensitive legal issues involved and the kind of allegations made, it is important for me not to comment further.  The official inquiry <Col N="780" /> will proceed in an objective and effective manner and there may be further litigation down the road.  I am confident that my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, will act very speedily when the report is received; I gather it is imminent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">

We have to give these people some hope.  A number of them have just arrived in the House; unfortunately they are too late for the debate.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to use her good offices to arrange for Senator Ross and me to meet the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, as soon as that report comes to hand.  He knows, and the Minister knows, that we would not seek to release any information.  That is important.  The Revenue Commissioners are about to commence another investigation there; that is well known.  I am not revealing any secrets but they have to wait until the other report is completed.  I hope we can have a meeting with the Minister of State to expedite matters.</P>
