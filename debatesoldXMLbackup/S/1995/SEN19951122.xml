      <P>I have notice from Senator Mooney that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to indicate whether the Irish Government was consulted by the European Commission on the establishment of the Eurathlon Programme and if she agrees that the requirements of at least three member states participating should be reduced to two in order to permit the development of Irish sport, especially our national games.</P>
      <P>I have received notice from Senator Cassidy on the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Defence to maintain Columb Barracks, Mullingar, County Westmeath, at its present staffing level and if he will give an assurance to the people of the midlands that this level will be maintained.</P>
      <P>I have received notice from Senator Kelleher on the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health to provide adequate resources <Col N="558" /> for the Southern Health Board to ensure proper security at psychiatric hospitals.</P>
    <P>I have received notice from Senator Burke on the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to provide funding for a new sewerage scheme for Belcarra, County Mayo.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senators Mooney's and Cassidy's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take items 1, 13 and motion 25 today.  We will deal with item 1 until 6 p.m.  The first speaker from each group will have not more than 45 minutes and each subsequent speaker will have not more than 30 minutes.  Item 25 will be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader for agreeing to permit contributions of 45 and 30 minutes in relation to item 1.  It is not often such time limits are requested but, as the Leader is aware, there is immense interest in the Harbours Bill, 1995.  The Leader will have received deputations and requests for meetings from people concerned about the Bill and many of my colleagues are anxious to express their concerns and table amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today our thoughts are with the families of the fishermen missing off the coast of County Donegal.  Our sympathy also goes to the family of the man tragically killed off Howth Head last week. Perhaps the Minister for the Marine might comment when dealing with the Harbours Bill.  I welcome the fact that he has called for a review of the rescue service operating on the east coast. When that review has taken place, I hope the Leader will request the Minister <Col N="559" /> to return to the House to enable Members to comment.  Many Members, on both sides of the House, are associated with the fishing industry.  Our thoughts are with all concerned.  I hope the Minister can ensure, by way of the review, that improved rescue services can be put in place to avoid a recurrence of the tragedy at Howth.</P>

      <P>Last week I raised the question of the intervention of Mother Teresa of Calcutta in the debate on divorce. I wish to raise a related point today and ask the Leader a clear and specific question.  Reports have been received from Reuters that the Pope has intervened in the divorce ballot in Ireland, has appealed to voters to reflect on the indissoluble nature of the bond of marriage and urges everyone to reflect on the importance of the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to suggest the House debate divorce to bring some balance into some of the statements which we have heard during the past few days but in light of what Senator Norris has just said, I will withdraw that proposal.</P>
      <P>The Cathaoirleach will be aware that the Leader gave a commitment that item 13, motion 22, in Senator Honan's and my names about Trinity College would be taken before the end of this week.  I know there is a general desire on the part of Members that we would not sit tomorrow so I am prepared to have it deferred until next week but I seek the Leader's assurance that it can be taken next week.</P>
      <P>I agree with the remarks made by Senator Wright in particular about the tragedies which took place off the coasts of Donegal and Howth.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to see the Leader has given enough time to debate the Harbours Bill in detail because there are Members who wish to make substantial contributions to it.  I think I am correct in saying, and the Leader will correct me if I am wrong, that this debate is not to conclude at 6 o'clock; it will be resumed at a later date if there are still speakers offering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="561" /> We must welcome the historic peace agreement which was signed yesterday in the United States and hope Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia will at last have peace.</P>
    <P>The final matter I wish to raise was mentioned by Senator Kiely over several weeks and that is a debate on agriculture. Today the Minister is making important announcements about the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme and we should discuss it.  There is also a dispute in the local departmental offices which have reverted to opening only in the morning.  That leaves the Minister's farmers charter in tatters.  There is also the closure of Teagasc's analytical services. For all of those reasons I recommend&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader to convey to the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht the concern which has been expressed about the disposal of the photo library and cuttings of <i>The Irish Press</i>.  I understand from media reports of the last few days that this particular aspect of the break-up of <i>The Irish Press</i> is to be sold to private tender and <i>The Sunday Times,</i> as a UK publication, has indicated an interest in acquiring this important collection.  I believe this should be retained within the State because of the historical nature of <i>The Irish Press,</i> the manner in which it was formed in the early thirties and its central role in Irish life.  I ask the Leader to ask the Minister to make a statement on the matter and to put forward the proposal that, in the event of the collection leaving the country, the State should acquire it through the National Library.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  In view of the promises made earlier in the year by various Ministers about allocations of money for flood relief throughout the country, will the Leader ask the Minister for Finance when this money will be dispersed?  The money has been promised all over the country but, not one penny has been spent yet and we are coming into the flooding season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I again ask that a message of protest be sent to the French Government in response to yesterday's nuclear explosion on Mururoa Atoll.  Can we also condemn the British Government's intervention?  It was reported this morning <Col N="563" /> that the French Ambassador to New Zealand said France is no longer isolated since Mr. John Major has supported their continuing the tests.  It is outrageous that another test has taken place and that the British are involved.</P>
    <P>In view of the recent horrific incidents in Nigeria and the full page advertisements placed by Shell in all national and international newspapers, may we have a debate on the intervention of multinational companies, such as Shell, in the internal politics of other countries purely for gain?  In doing so they have caused ecological damage to Nigeria from which it will never recover and created a situation in southern Nigeria where we have murder by Government almost daily.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator Lanigan in his condemnation of the resumption of nuclear testing by the French. Will the Leader ask the Minister for Health to bring forward proposals, as a matter of urgency, to resolve the nurses' dispute in Portlaoise, Tullamore and Mullingar hospitals?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the leader of my group in expressing concern at the serious problem of the missing fishing boat in Donegal.  While it is too late in the day to save the fishing boat presumed lost off the Donegal coast, I ask the Minister to implement the existing regulations.  On paper there are fairly strict regulations relating to the control and licensing of fishing boats and small and pleasure craft but they have not been implemented because of a lack of will in the Department of the Marine. My county has paid too high a price for the lack of control of small fishing boats. The Leader will agree that this matter must be taken seriously if further lives are not to be lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask that we take item 10 today.  In County Donegal a £2 million improvement project to build additional accommodation at a military barracks in Lifford is in progress.  The contractor is completing the work although it has <Col N="564" /> been recommended that the Lifford military barracks be closed.  Surely this is the greatest folly anyone could witness. I propose that we discuss item 10 because we want to know where we stand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Senator moving an amendment to the Order of Business?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>That item 10 be inserted after item 1.</P>
      <P>PDFORRA are in Donegal today looking at the possibility of closing the barracks. The work is not yet complete and this House should have an opportunity to express its dissatisfaction at the waste of public money to build a new military barracks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Senator Wright in expressing sympathy to the family of the man who lost his life off Howth and the families of the fishermen who lost their lives off the Donegal coast.  My own family suffered when I lost a brother at sea.  It is inconceivable that in 1995 we can lose someone in sight of land and <Col N="565" /> that a city the size of Dublin does not have a helicopter on standby.  Such a service is not needed just for marine rescues; it could be needed if there was a fire in a high rise building in Ballymun. While I welcome the review which the Minister has stated he is going to initiate, it is inconceivable that, in this day and age, we cannot station a crew overnight at Baldonnel with a helicopter fully equipped to undertake any kind of rescue that is needed at sea or on land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week Members touched on the murder of Ken SaroWiwa. We have also had discussions on East Timor and on ethnic cleansing.  If one looks at parliamentary agendas around Europe, it is interesting to note that the same issues come up time and again.  Perhaps the Leader will consider the possibility of an initiative by the House whereby both Houses of the Oireachtas suggest at European level that there should be a parliamentary human rights watch dog established to oversee abuses of human rights, not just outside Europe, but any that occur in Europe.  Such a body would help to inform public debate and decisions regarding aid and, above all, to inform and to police the decisions that multinationals make.  There are informal human rights watches that operate in Europe, but parliamentary assemblies throughout Europe, including the European Parliament, should, at this stage, consider establishing such a body.  Will the Leader consider a debate of this proposal?</P>
      <P>The recent McKenna decision in the Supreme Court will have profound effects not just for what will happen on Friday but, more importantly, for the long term.  It raises the issue of the appropriateness of Government intervention on the information side of any referendum.  I have argued for some years that Governments are tainted with politics and cannot be value free in the provision of information.  We need a constitutional commission to handle the administration of referenda after the political decision has been made.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be possible for the Leader to arrange for the McKenna decision, and the decisions which now need to follow from it, to be discussed in the House?</P>
      <P>I apologise for raising this issue for the seventh or eighth time, but during the week the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs made an interesting speech on the Western European Union and the change to the Western European Union Charter, suggesting that it may make this bizarre institution more palatable to Irish tastes.  This would not be the case but it appears that with 1996 and certain post-Maastricht decisions approaching, we need a debate on this issue.</P>

      <P>I join with Members in sending sympathy to the relatives of the fishermen lost off the coast of County Donegal.  It was a great tragedy.  Arising from a report which I saw in a newspaper recently, and having made some inquiries, I am concerned about a possible take-over of Greencore plc, the company established as a result of the privatisation of the sugar industry by a decision of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  At the time of the establishment of the company, the then Minister for Agriculture and Food inserted a section in the relevant Act which gave the right to a golden share that would protect the sugar industry in the event of any take-over.</P>

      <P>Senator Mooney raised an interesting question about the dispersal <Col N="569" /> of the assets of the <i>Irish Press</i> group. It was sad yesterday to see how the assets of a once great institution were dispersed in almost an inhuman way.  I do not know if the National Library would be the proper repository for press cuttings.  I suspect that it already has most of that material.  However, such cuttings may form a useful archive for a university or other centre of learning.  I will convey the concerns of the Senator to the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.</P>
      <P>Senator Doyle raised the question of written questions.  Ministers are not directly responsible to this House as they are to the Dáil.

      <P>I agree with Senator Lanigan and others that the behaviour of the French Government is outrageous and it is important that the views of Members of all parties and of none are expressed once again to the French Ambassador. However, protests made not just here but throughout the world have made little difference.</P>
      <P>A question about Nigeria was raised. I do not know enough about this issue at this stage.  Two points of view are being put across.

      <P>The Bill, which comprises 105 sections and six Schedules, is the first major revision of commercial harbours legislation since 1946.  The purpose of the legislation is to restructure the management framework of port authorities by establishing State commercial companies to manage the 12 bigger ports. Before outlining in detail the main provisions of the new legislation, I wish to mention the existing legislation, the Harbours Act, 1946.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="571" /> The 1946 Act had its genesis in 1926 when, by a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas, the Ports and Harbours Tribunal was established to inquire into the position of the several ports and harbours in the State.  The tribunal reported in 1930.  Its two main recommendations were, first, that the provisions of the various general Acts relating to harbours should be replaced by a general consolidating Act and second, that the Department of Industry and Commerce be given the general oversight of harbour administration and be placed as regards harbours in much the same position as the Department of Local Government and Public Health occupied in relation to local authorities. The Bill to implement the tribunal's recommendations was ready for introduction in 1940.</P>
    <P>However, owing to the abnormal circumstances affecting the ports and harbours of the country which then existed, its introduction was postponed.  The Second Stage of the Harbours Bill, 1945, was taken in Dáil Éireann on Wednesday, 28 November 1945.  The Bill was introduced by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr. Seán Lemass, and contributors to the debate included such well known figures as General Mulcahy, Mr. John A. Costello and Mr. Maurice Dockrell.  The Committee Stage of the Bill was taken in the Seanad in March 1946 and contributors to the debate included Professor Joseph Johnston, T.C. Kingsmill Moore and Gerard Sweetman.  The legislation came into effect in 1946 and still remains the main body of legislation governing commercial seaports.</P>
    <P>In the interim years, techniques in shipping and cargo handling have changed dramatically.  On the one hand there has been the growth of large bulk shipments while, on the other, the almost universal use of unitised systems &mdash; either lift on-lift off or roll-on roll-off.</P>
    <P>These changes have provided ports across the world with new challenges. The international response has tended <Col N="572" /> towards the greater commercialisation of ports.  Ireland's ports have been severely constrained in their ability to respond commercially because of the restricted legislation under which they operate.</P>
    <P>It was for this reason the then Minister for the Marine, John Wilson, established the commercial harbours review group in October 1990.  The task of the review group was to identify those aspects of existing legislation which constrained a modern port; the structure of harbour boards needed to be examined as did the extent of ministerial and departmental control on the day-to-day activities of ports.  The review group included a broad representation of interests associated with ports &mdash; the Irish Port Authorities Association, IBEC, a transport economist, a port user, a local authorities representative, a SIPTU representative and a representative from the Department of the Marine.</P>
    <P>The group presented its report and recommendations in July 1992.  I would summarise the major findings of the review group as follows.  Ireland of all countries in the EU was probably the most heavily dependent on external trade for its future prosperity.  The crucial importance of seaports to the economy was highlighted by the fact that in 1990 80 per cent by volume and almost 55 per cent by value of the total external trade of the State passed through seaports. Having regard to Ireland's remoteness from the main European and world markets, there was an urgent need to bring the overall performance of Irish seaports up to a level at least on a par with the best international standards. Cargo handling and shipping techniques had changed dramatically in recent years with the advent of unified and large bulk shipments.  The pace of change had outstripped the ability of seaports in Ireland and elsewhere to cope effectively with the challenges arising from it.  Current legislation &mdash; the Harbours Act, 1946 &mdash; was outdated to present day requirements being unduly restrictive with ministerial controls <Col N="573" /> more in keeping with procedures in local authorities.  A survey of international trends indicated that seaports were being restructured and commercialised in many countries.  Cargo handling activity was identified as a serious disability in many ports.</P>
    <P>The key recommendation of the review group was that in order to facilitate commercialisation, commercial State companies should be set up to manage certain ports.  The group also recommended that the commercial mandate under which the new port companies would operate should give them flexibility to operate as truly commercial enterprises.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before the House is based on the main recommendations of the review group.  The Bill provides for the setting up or commercial State companies to manage and operate the ports of Arklow, Cork, Drogheda, Dublin, Dundalk, Foynes, Galway, New Ross, Shannon, Waterford and Wicklow &mdash; these ports are at present managed by harbour authorities in accordance with the Harbours Act, 1946; the setting up of a State commercial company to manage and operate Dún Laoghaire Harbour which is at present managed and operated by the Department of the Marine; the function of the companies so established; and a revision of the law relating to pilotage.</P>
    <P>I will not deal at length with the details of the provisions of the Bill but I will briefly describe its main provisions. The new companies will be formed and registered under the Companies Acts. The State will be the sole shareholder in each company.  Thorough preparations will need to be undertaken before the companies are actually established. Such preparations include the installation of modern accounting systems; the preparation of commercial accounts, including up to date balance sheets; an assessment of pension assets and liabilities; a review of each harbour's trading performance and medium projections of same; a forecast of capital expenditure needs and of how these would be <Col N="574" /> financed and an examination of staffing levels.</P>
    <P>Existing harbour authority boards range in number from nine members to 29 and comprise representatives of local authorities, chambers of commerce, trade union interests, IBEC, the livestock trade, shipping and ministerial nominees.  The view taken by the review group was that structures of this nature, that is, large representative authorities comprising up to 29 members, were no longer attuned to the competitive requirements of a modern port and were not the most efficient way of managing ports.  The group recommended that the board of directors of the new companies should have seven members, including employee representation, the chairman and the chief executive.  They further recommended that the non-executive directors should be appointed by the Minister with a five year term of office and should be drawn from the commercial sector of the economy and that persons with a vested business interest in the affairs of a port should not be given board representation.</P>
    <P>However, following publication of the review group's report, there were numerous requests for a continuation of the existing representation.  Having considered the matter the Government decided that the number of directors of each company should not be more than 12 and that three local authority directors should be appointed to each port company.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as now presented, provides that the number of directors of each company will not be more than 12.  The directors, with the exception of the chief executive, the worker and local authority directors, will be appointed and may be removed from office by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  Each director, except the chief executive, will be appointed for five years and will be eligible for reappointment.</P>
    <P>As regards worker directors, I should point out that the norm in the public sector, such as Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta, An Post, etc., is that worker directors <Col N="575" /> make up one third of the board's full membership.  However, the numbers employed by harbour authorities and to be employed by the new port companies are small compared to other semi-State bodies such as An Post, and one third worker representation on the new port boards could be viewed as over-representation.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the strategy that has been developed is that the staff of companies, whose employees exceed 50 in number, will elect two worker directors; the staff of companies, whose employees are more than 30 but not more than 50 in number, will elect one worker director.  Where the staff of the company is less than 30 in number the Minister will, following consultation with recognised trade unions, appoint a person as the representative of the interests of the employees of that company.</P>
    <P>There was a strong demand for continued representation of local authorities on the new port companies as such representation would maintain the close relationship between city, town and port.  It was argued that local ports play a key role in the economic life of the town or city associated with the port and that there must be close day to day interaction between the port and the local authority.  Local authority representation, it was suggested, on the port authority provided a long established and effective means of ensuring full co-operation between both bodies. The Government agreed that such close co-operation was essential and considered that the inclusion of representation was merited on those grounds.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the Minister for the Marine will appoint three persons, nominated in the prescribed manner by a prescribed local authority, to be each a director of a company.  Regulations prescribing the manner in which such persons are to be nominated will be made by the Minister for the Marine. The chief executive of each port company shall, by reason of his office, be a director of the company.  The remaining <Col N="576" /> directors will be appointed by the Minister for the Marine with the consent of the Minister for Finance and will be drawn from the professional and business community.  Deputies, Senators and MEPs will be disqualified from becoming directors of port companies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I will now outline the powers and duties of the new port companies. The principal objects of each company will be, first, to take all proper measures for the management, control, operation and development of its harbour and the approach channels thereto and provide reasonable facilities, services and accommodation in the harbour for vessels, goods and passengers, second, to promote investment in its harbour and third, to utilise and manage the resources available to it in a manner consistent with the foregoing objects.</P>
      <P>In addition, each company will be empowered, first, to engage in any business activity, either alone or in conjunction with other persons, that it considers to be advantageous to the development of its harbour; second, to take such steps either alone or in conjunction with other persons as are necessary for the efficient operation and management of its harbour; third, to promote leisure activities that may be carried on in its harbour or which relate to the marine generally; fourth, to appropriate any part of its harbour to the exclusive use of any person; fifth, to engage in activities outside the State related to functions in respect of its harbour which will promote the interests of trade and tourism in the State; sixth, to charge rates in respect of vessels using the harbour, goods shipped, transhipped, unshipped or stored within the harbour and any service provided by the company; seventh, to lease, acquire and dispose of property and eighth, to make by-laws for the use of the harbour, safety of navigation within the harbour and generally for the regulation of the harbour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, the Bill provides that it shall be the general duty of each company <Col N="577" /> to have due regard to the consequences of its activities on the environment, the heritage, whether natural or man-made, relating to its harbour and the amenities generally in the vicinity of its harbour.</P>
    <P>Each company will be required to submit annually to the Minister a copy of its annual accounts and the auditor's report on the accounts.  The accounts will be audited by commercial auditors. Each port company will be empowered to borrow with ministerial consent up to a limit of 50 per cent of the company's fixed assets.  The Minister for Finance may, in certain circumstances, guarantee borrowings by port companies.</P>
    <P>Persons who immediately before vesting day were employees of a harbour authority or, in the case of Dún Laoghaire Harbour, of the Department of the Marine, will not, while in the service of the port company, be brought to less beneficial conditions of service or of remuneration to which they were subject immediately before vesting day. Each port company will be required to establish and maintain a superannuation fund.</P>
    <P>I will touch briefly on the pension liabilities of harbour authorities and also deal with an important amendment in this regard which was introduced with Government approval on Report Stage in Dáil Éireann.  The amendment in question was accepted by the Dáil and provided for the insertion of a new subsection (9) in section 41 of the Bill.  The new subsection (9) provides that the Minister for the Marine may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, pay to the trustees of certain pension schemes moneys in respect of certain liabilities that have arisen prior to the relevant vesting day.  This provision applies only to port companies to be established under the Harbours Bill.</P>
    <P>Historically, harbour authorities operated a &ldquo;pay as you go&rdquo; system for pensions rather than having a specific pensions fund.  This system is no longer in accord with acceptable standards. Under the Pensions Act, 1990, and the <Col N="578" /> provision of this Bill, harbours must build up pension funds.  This is a costly operation and while some harbour authorities are in the process of building up a fund others are only beginning to do so now and it will take some time for them to put fully endowed funds in place.  In particular, Dublin Port and Waterford Harbour have serious shortfalls in their pensions funds.</P>
    <P>The Government is taking action to secure pensions and ensure harbour authorities build up the necessary funds. Consultants have been employed to do a comprehensive study of the financial status of harbour authorities, including the long-term funding requirements of ports and how these are to be achieved, taking due account of measures to meet the appropriate funding standards for pensions schemes under the Pensions Act.  I expect this study will be available shortly.</P>
    <P>If it is found that some harbour authorities cannot build up the required funds within the timescale set out in the Pensions Act, it will be necessary to remove from the scope of Part IV of that Act those pension schemes or parts thereof which do not meet the required funding standard.  The purpose of the new section 41 (9) is to allow for this. The effect of removing pension schemes from the scope of the Pensions Act is that such schemes will avail of Exchequer cover; in the unlikely event that port companies cannot meet their pension obligations the State will undertake to do so.</P>
    <P>This provision will also allow for the payment of moneys by the Exchequer into a pension fund to build up that fund.  The provision is enabling only and will only be invoked in the direst of circumstances where the Minister for the Marine and the Minister for Finance are satisfied that an Exchequer contribution towards a pension fund at a port company is absolutely necessary.  Any such contribution will only be made on foot of a plan agreed by the Minister for the Marine and the Minister for Finance with the company and the trustees of the pension scheme which provides for <Col N="579" /> building up the pension fund over a specified period.  Policy will be to minimise the Exchequer exposure in this regard through ensuring that every effort is made by the harbour authorities and port companies to provide for the funding of pre-vesting day pension liabilities themselves.</P>
    <P>I want to state clearly and strongly here today that, first, the purpose of the new subsection is only to provide a backstop guarantee against the eventuality that certain harbours may be unable, through trading performance or closure, to meet pensions liabilities.  I also want to make it clear that Exchequer intervention will only occur in the direst of circumstances.  Second, harbours will be expected to make every effort to fund all pensions liabilities through improved trading, asset sales, etc.  The strategic plans of the boards will be required to provide for a mechanism by which funds are brought up to the funding standard requirements of the Pensions Act; the Exchequer's backstop guarantee will only operate until such time as the boards can reasonably attain that status.  Third, there will be a stringent case by case approach; for example, notwithstanding the text of the amendment there will be no question that certain categories of liabilities, such as pre-vesting day, will be automatically Exchequer funded for all bodies.</P>
    <P>Fourth, the intention is that when the study which has been commissioned into the current and prospective viability of the harbour authorities is completed, I will consider further, in conjunction with the Minister of Finance and the harbour authorities, how best to put the necessary measures in place to enable the pension schemes to meet the funding standards of the Pensions Act.  The DKM study is now almost completed and the consultant's report and recommendations should be available within the next two weeks or so.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a provision whereby port companies may apply to the Minister for amalgamation and the Minister, <Col N="580" /> if of the opinion that for sound business reasons the ports concerned should be amalgamated, may, by order, provide for such amalgamation if the companies concerned are agreeable.  An amalgamation order will have to be confirmed by a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>In respect of each port company the Minister will be empowered to issue directions to the company relating to safety, the levels of harbour charges, the acquisition and disposal of lands, the development of harbours and any other matters.  He will also be empowered to stipulate, in consultation with the company, financial or other targets, including the payment of dividends in respect of shares in the company, to be achieved by the company.</P>
    <P>Each port company will be required to organise pilotage in either of two ways &mdash; by employing pilots directly or by licensing self-employed pilots to undertake pilotage operations.  Each port company will be empowered to make by-laws for the operation and organisation of pilotage services, qualifications for pilots, the grant of pilotage exemption certificates and for other matters related to pilotage.</P>
    <P>I now wish to refer to the limits of jurisdiction of Foynes Harbour.  Following publication of the Harbours Bill, 1995, I appointed Mr. Patrick J. Murphy to act as an independent mediator between Limerick Harbour Commissioners and Foynes Harbour Trustees in the matter of an application from Foynes for an extension of its area of jurisdiction.  At present Foynes only exercises control over a small area of water in the immediate vicinity of the harbour.  An extension of the limits of Foynes Harbour would involve an encroachment on the area over which Limerick Harbour Commissioners have traditionally exercised jurisdiction.  The limits of Limerick Harbour have never been defined in any statute that can be traced.  However, traditionally, Limerick Harbour Commissioners have exercised jurisdiction over the entire Shannon Estuary with the exception of the harbours <Col N="581" /> of Foynes, Cappa Pier at Kilrush, Glin, Tarbert and Kildysart.</P>
    <P>The mediation process commenced in October and the mediator's report and recommendation was received on 16 November 1995.  The mediator has recommended that the western limit of Foynes Harbour be extended and that the extension should comprise the entire area below high water mark lying between an imaginary line drawn from Battery Point on Foynes Island and a point in the estuary north of the White River at Loghill.  I am pleased to advise the House that I have accepted the mediator's recommendation and that I propose to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage to redefine the limits of Foynes Harbour.</P>
    <P>The Shannon Estuary is a wonderful natural resource which Ireland must exploit to its fullest potential in a farseeing way.  The extension of the limits of Foynes Harbour together with the enshrinement in legislation, for the first time ever, of the limits of Limerick Harbour should make for a very vibrant and competitive import/export environment in the Shannon Estuary in the future as larger vessels become the norm.</P>
    <P>In relation to pilotage in Waterford Estuary, ships travelling to New Ross Harbour must pass through the Waterford pilotage district.  Pilotage is compulsory in both the Waterford and New Ross pilotage districts and this means that pilotage dues are payable to both pilotage authorities by ships bound for New Ross.  During the course of the passage of the Bill through Dáil Éireann, efforts were made to abolish compulsory pilotage in Waterford Harbour for ships bound for New Ross.</P>
    <P>On average a total of 1,100 ship movements are piloted to and from New Ross Harbour each year and consequently pass through the Waterford pilotage district.  This is in addition to approximately 1,600 movements per annum to and from Waterford Harbour. I am of the view, because of this fact, that, in the interests of safety, compulsory pilotage is necessary for all ships from Dunmore East to Cheekpoint, <Col N="582" /> where the New Ross pilots take over. Having said that, however, it is likely that pilotage exemption certificates will become more freely available once the new harbours legislation is in place.  The persons in charge of ships travelling to New Ross Harbour on a regular basis will be able to apply for such certificates in respect of the Waterford pilotage district if they so desire and if they satisfy the conditions laid down in section 72 of the Bill, thus cutting overall shipping costs.</P>
    <P>Both Waterford and New Ross Harbour Commissioners were invited to round table talks in my Department on Monday, 6 November 1995, to discuss the Waterford Estuary pilotage question. At the meeting it was agreed that a review of the entire pilotage operation in the estuary would be undertaken.  It was further agreed that a review group would be set up by the Department of the Marine to examine the pilotage in detail.  The group will comprise one nominee from Waterford Harbour Commissioners, one nominee from New Ross Harbour Commissioners, one official of the Department of the Marine and one independent member &mdash; with the necessary technical expertise &mdash; to be nominated by the Department of the Marine and agreed by both parties.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of the group will be drawn up by the Department and it was agreed that the group will be requested to concentrate on cost effectiveness of existing pilotage and any new operations proposed, safety, management, logistics, jurisdiction, pilotage exemption certificates and their effects under the new legislation and comparison with relevant situations elsewhere in the EU.  It was agreed that the Department would convene the group as soon as possible with a view to receiving the group's recommendations within three months.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as drafted, will, I believe, enable any of the review group's recommendations to be carried out.  Section 79, for example, provides for the redefining of pilotage limits and section 43 allows for the amalgamation of interests <Col N="583" /> provided the companies concerned are in agreement.</P>
    <P>I want to outline the objectives of the Harbours Bill.  The new legislation is designed to ensure that the ports will be able to operate as truly commercial and self-sufficient enterprises free from undue control by the State.  The reorganisation of the commercial seaports together with a continuation of EU aid for port development will give the ports the flexibility they need to operate as truly commercial enterprises and will greatly improve their efficiency and effectiveness to the benefit of exporters, the agricultural and industrial sectors of the economy and our tourist trade.  The main thrust of the new legislation will be to relax ministerial control while increasing accountability for operational and financial performance.</P>
    <P>In tandem with the new legislation, a port development policy is also in place and significant investment in portal development will take place between now and 1999.  The objectives of this investment are first, to facilitate the expansion of industry and agriculture, second, to facilitate the expansion of tourism and third, to facilitate regional development.</P>
    <P>In line with these objectives the following features of Irish ports are being addressed &mdash; the need for more intensive competition; the inadequate frequency of services; the poor quality/outdated infrastructure leading to inefficiencies; some selective capacity deficiencies; the inadequate port handling equipment; capital dredging and the repair of structural faults.</P>
    <P>The investment programme of £135 million is designed to achieve the elimination of bottlenecks, an expansion of port throughput by end 2000 of 46 per cent in the case of unitised freight -ro/ro and lo/lo &mdash; and 40 per cent for bulk freight, a 15 per cent real reduction in combined port and shipping costs, and the stimulation of a reduction in shipping charges which will have a significant impact on the productive sectors of the economy.  The port development <Col N="584" /> programme together with the reorganisation of the commercial seaports will gear the ports to meet the challenges of the 21st century.</P>
    <P>I would like now to turn to other provisions of the Bill.  On the future administration of the small non-commercial ports, the review group recommended that responsibility for harbours of lesser commercial significance, 13 in all, be transferred to local authorities.  The harbours involved are &mdash; Annagassan, Bantry Bay, Ballyshannon, Baltimore and Skibbereen, Buncrana, Cappa Pier (Kilrush), Kinsale, River Moy (Ballina), Sligo, Tralee and Fenit, Westport, Wexford and Youghal.  This proposal was discussed in detail with the majority of the harbour authorities concerned and the City and County Managers Association and it did not attract general support. The Government, having considered the matter, agreed to the proposal that, rather than providing for automatic transfer, the Bill should contain a framework which would allow these small harbours to, first, continue to operate under the Harbours Act, 1964; second, to be set up as commercial State companies or, third, to be transferred to local authorities.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as now drafted, contains these empowering provisions.  The position to be adopted in this regard will be considered on its merits on a port by port basis once the new legislation is in place.  Decisions will be taken based on the present and anticipated level of commercial traffic at the ports concerned and the present and anticipated financial position of the ports concerned. Any proposals to transfer responsibility for any of the smaller harbours to the relevant local authority will be subject to the consent of the Minister for the Environment.  Likewise, any proposal to establish a State commercial company in respect of any of the harbours concerned will have to be confirmed by the resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>As Senator Fitzgerald is in the Chamber, I want to refer to Dingle Harbour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill contains an enabling provision which empowers the Minister to designate Dingle Harbour as a fishery harbour centre once the new legislation is in place.  This means that responsibility for the harbour would be transferred to the Department of the Marine which already manages and operates five fishery harbour centres. However, the general question of the management of fishery harbours falls for review in the context of a major review, announced by the Minister on 1 March 1995, of the organisation and management structures of the fishery services including the fishery harbour centres.  I will be assessing the future management plans for Dingle Harbour and other major fishery harbours in the light of the outcome of the review which it is intended to have completed later this year.</P>
      <P>In the course of preparation of the legislation a comprehensive consultation process on the purpose and context of the Bill has taken place with interested parties &mdash; mainly the harbour authorities concerned and the social partners &mdash; and, in so far as was possible, their views have been taken on board.  I am confident that the principles of the Bill will be generally acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, throughput at the commercial ports in 1980 amounted to 19.4 million tonnes; the corresponding figure for 1994 was 30.9 million tonnes &mdash; an increase of 59 per cent.  The importance of our ports to the Irish economy cannot by over-emphasised.  The measures outlined here today &mdash; (a) restructuring of the management framework of port authorities through the early introduction of commercial semi-State enterprises; (b) an emphasis in investment on strategic corridors so as to increase frequency of service and benefit of economies of scale; (c) the taking of appropriate steps to ensure adequate competition within and between ports and in shipping services and (d) a major programme of investment, supported by <Col N="586" /> Community funds, in port infrastructure and facilities &mdash; are designated to ensure adequate and internationally competitive capacity.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister and this legislation.  As a person involved in the sea, I want to be associated with the remarks made in the Chamber this morning with regard to the people who lost their lives and are still missing in Donegal.  I sincerely thank the rescue services around our coasts and, in particular, those involved in these rescues.  I sincerely thank the people of Great Britain and Wales, in particular the RAF and those who came so quickly to our assistance.  It would be wrong for some people to criticise the manner in which they did so.</P>
      <P>I also thank the Minister for acting so quickly and I congratulate him.  From media reports, it appears he is putting a night-flying helicopter in place fairly quickly in the Dublin area or on the east coast.</P>
      <P>Turning to the Bill, and this is where I will give the Minister a real welcome, I want to thank the people who have been involved in the preparatory work. It did not just appear here today.  I thank the review group and, believe it or not, the five Ministers to date who have handled this Bill.  In particular, we should remember the late Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan who was really handling this Bill.</P>
      <P>I have been asking for this Bill for nearly as long as I have been here &mdash; for at least four years.  I want to be critical, not of the Minister personally or anyone in particular in his Department but of the time which it has taken to introduce it.  It has taken far too long.  The review group said this matter should be acted upon with urgency, yet it has taken almost five and a half years and five Ministers to bring it to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I attended the launch of the report in Dublin Castle and was under the impression that the Harbours Bill would be published two or three months later. How can this country progress if it takes <Col N="587" /> this length of time to bring legislation before the House?  There are many review groups but one would almost need a review group to ascertain why this process took so long.</P>
    <P>This Bill is, and was, urgently needed to facilitate the aims of the report which are to develop fully the potential of the 12 harbours mentioned in the Bill and to make certain other amendments with regard to other ports, including my own town of Dingle.  When I discuss section 86 I will explain why I am annoyed about the delay.  It is not the Minister's doing but it has taken far too long to get things going and, in the meantime, we are losing money.</P>
    <P>If I have responsibility for an area I make the decisions.  However, nowadays every Department has review groups. They spend a year or more reviewing a matter on which the people in the Department should make decisions. Those people are there to run a Department, not a review group.  I have to be critical of the Minister's Department in which there are at least three reports being compiled at present.  There was one relating to BIM and another on the fishery harbour centres.  Why can the people in the Department with all the knowledge not make the decisions and draft legislation?  I will return to this point in the context of section 86 because Dingle is very important.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to be mischievous because I want to be constructive about the Bill but I will indicate where amendments are necessary to give the Minister an opportunity to introduce them himself. Many sections are weak but they may sound different when clarified.  The objects of the company, as outlined in the Bill, should be statutory duties rather than aspirations.  They are not hard and fast and the company has no statutory duties as it stands.  It is similar to a development plan for a county which one tries to follow as best one can but there is no obligation to carry out the duties.</P>
    <P>The 1946 Act was a strong Act and, rather than introducing a new Bill, we <Col N="588" /> should have amended it.  The definition of &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; in that Act refers to the Minister for Industry and Commerce while this Bill refers to the Minister for the Marine.  Times change and not every administration has a Minister for the Marine or a Minister for Fisheries.  The relevant individual is often a Minister of State.  That could be covered by providing that &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; means the Minister in charge of marine affairs; it could be the Minister for Agriculture or the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The provisions relating to the master of a ship present a small problem.  Is an individual still the master of a ship if he is under arrest or if the ship is being towed into port?  For example, a ship was arrested off the coast of Kerry for gun running activities and was ordered to go to Cork.  On the way, a propeller fell off and she could not proceed and had to be towed.  That is an interesting case which could lead to compensation. Who was in charge of that ship which was being towed and where crew were under arrest?  There may be provisions in other Bills which relate to the arrest of a boat.</P>
    <P>I have a big gripe about the port penalties in section 6.  A person can be found guilty of an offence under 15 sections of the Bill.  If a boat goes into Dunmore East and commits an offence, such as disobeying the harbour master, it carries a penalty of £10.  However, under this Bill if one disobeys the harbour master in New Ross, the penalty is a fine of £1,500, six months in jail or a fine of £100,000 on indictment.  I want the Minister to repeal the 1946 Act and bring it into line with the penalties in this Bill or amend the penalties in the 1946 Act.  A harbour master in Dunmore East has the same qualifications as a harbour master in New Ross or any other port but if one disobeys a harbour master in any port other than the 12 ports mentioned, the penalty is between £5 and £10.  The penalty should be £1,500 for all these offences.  If the Minister cannot amend the 1946 Act I will introduce a small Bill to amend it and bring it into line with this legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="589" /> Section 9 of the Bill relates to the limits of a company's harbour.  I am glad the Minister stated that the Bill, as it relates to Foynes, will be amended. There is a hard working group of people at Foynes.  They have drawn up development plans for the harbour and are proceeding with them.  Without the extra limits the harbour is now getting, all their efforts would have been in vain. The findings and recommendations of the mediator must be included in the Bill, otherwise I will be compelled to put down an amendment to this effect.</P>
    <P>While the companies' limits and the problems at New Ross and Waterford have been discussed elsewhere, and while I agree with the arguments that have been made, I do not agree with the Minister's remarks today that there is a need for compulsory pilotage from The Hook up to Chief Point because there is no compulsory pilotage on the way out. If there is compulsory pilotage on the way in, why is this not the case on the way out?  In bad weather, the pilots cannot board and the ships proceed upstream accordingly.</P>
    <P>I understand these matters are before the review group and they will be considered again on Committee Stage, but I agree with the suggestion that, in the interests of safety, the boats proceeding to New Ross should take on their pilots in Passage West and then proceed. When a pilot boards a boat at Chief Point, he must go through the Barrow Bridge within two minutes, which is 80 foot wide.  To put this into context, how would the Minister like to drive my car out the gates of the House?  He would have two minutes to do this, and with my old banger, he would probably crash into the gates.  In the same way, the pilot must get the feel of the ship.  If he boarded at Passage West, he would have approximately 15 minutes to carry out this manoeuvre and would then be in a position to proceed through the Barrow Bridge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I strongly recommend that the pilotage be rearranged. The Minister is aware of the problems.</P>
      <P>The objectives of the companies, as addressed in section 11, are only aspirational but I believe there should be a statutory duty and obligation to undertake them.  Despite this, there are no words on fishing, here or in the rest of the Bill, despite references to matters such as fisheries harbours and accepted vessels, which are fishing vessels.  There is nothing in the Bill to tell companies at Galway, Waterford, Cork, etc., that there is also an onus on them.  For example, is there an onus on them to look after fishing?  If so, they must do so.</P>
      <P>I am very unhappy that there are many aspects left out of the Bill which should be included.  The 1946 Act was very strong.  While time has caught up with it and parts of it should be strengthened, it deals more specifically than the Bill with the duties of a harbour authority.  Surely it is in the interests of the companies to promote fishing if fishing boats are using their harbours.  Are they simply going to turn their backs on the fishing industry? Their task is to develop all aspects of their harbours.</P>
      <P>The fishermen have been sold down the swanee over the past 20 years.  Since 1972 we have sold their seas and have given them to Europe and have only developed five fishery harbour centres, which has been at the rate of approximately one every five years.  What is happening to the fishing industry is ridiculous and I will return to this when I address the situation in Dingle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 13 requires an agent for a shipping company to take out a bond in the event of the non-payment of rates. This should be deleted.  It places an added expense on a shipping agent to take out a bond.  The Bill does not specify the size of the bond, the amount of <Col N="591" /> money involved and so on.  The bond must be taken out so that the harbour company can recoup it in the event of any charges outstanding on a ship that has absconded.  However, section 14 addresses this issue adequately.  Its provisions are so strict that a ship which has been detained could not leave the harbour. These include procedures for detaining the ship, its goods, the sale of its goods, etc.</P>
    <P>I now want to discuss unfair competition. A company running a harbour could become a shipping agent.  Is such a company required to take out a bond to protect itself from arrears, or of moneys owed to it?  This would not make sense.  The Minister is creating unfair competition between the shipping agents and the company.  On Committee Stage I will be seeking its deletion from section 13.</P>
    <P>Section 13 (8) refers to charges by other ports.  Doubtless, the Minister is aware of the problem at New Ross on the issue of charges.  A ship coming into Waterford pays the same charge as a ship coming from The Hook as far as Cheap Point.  This means there is an excess charge on ships coming into New Ross, and this is creating unfair competition. Whatever it costs to run that section of the estuary for the year should be divided between Waterford and New Ross rather than Waterford imposing an excessive charge on the New Ross company.  I will move an amendment to delete this section and insert a new one which will provide for the charges to be laid out in a different way.  What is the reason for the present situation?  Is it because there is more water off Waterford or because the Barrow has more water than the Suir?  The charges imposed on New Ross by Waterford are excessive.  A review group has been set up and we will see what it will say on the matter.</P>
    <P>Section 15 deals with the buying, selling and leasing of land.  We have heard enough about the selling of land over the last few weeks and months and <Col N="592" /> there should be a tightening of the procedures relating to such selling.  I thought Kerry County Council was behind the times, but for years it has operated a system with regard to buying, selling and leasing whereby three valuers are selected from all the valuers in the county to value land.  This section should be amended to provide for the valuation of land by three independent valuers.  One such valuer can be influenced in some shape or form, but a person would want to great detective to influence three valuers in the fixing of a price.</P>
    <P>Section 17 (3) deals with the directors of harbour companies.  I will have a great deal to say about directors on Committee Stage.  I want to make sure that members of chambers of commerce will be appointed as directors and I will move an amendment to that effect.</P>
    <P>Section 9.5 of the report of the Review Group on Commercial Harbours and Pilotage Policy and Legislation points out that Limerick harbour adjoins three counties &mdash; Clare, Kerry and Limerick &mdash; and Limerick city.  The report states that:</P>
    <P>The future restructuring of ports should take into account the territorial boundaries of harbour areas... It is important, therefore, that proposals for a new port company reflect this geographic spread in the membership of its Board...</P>
    <P>I would like to see the Bill entitle people from the three counties adjoining the Shannon Estuary to become members of the board.  People from these counties should have a proper say in the running of the estuary.  The Harbours Act, 1946, provided for the appointment of members of chambers of commerce as directors and this has done no harm to harbours.</P>
    <P>Section 28 deals with the annual report.  Companies are to be given six months after the end of each accounting year to make a report to the Minister. It is laughable that the Minister, other members and I receive reports on our desks for 1993 and 1994.  Today we have <Col N="593" /> computers and other technology.  I present annual reports at annual general meetings of Dingle Harbour Board. Within a few weeks these reports are given to the Minister.  Matters affecting a harbour company could go totally wrong and it could be sold down the swanee during the six months the Minister is waiting for its report.  This period should be reduced to about a month. Any company worth its salt always has its affairs up to date.  Large shops can press computer buttons to find out exactly what is happening.  We should be able to do the same in this day and age.</P>
    <P>Section 29 deals with performance audits.  It refers to the appointment of</P>
    <P>...a person to carry out an examination as to the efficiency and cost effectiveness of the performance by a company...</P>
    <P>Is making ends meet our only worry?  I will propose an amendment to this section which will provide for the appointment of a person to carry out an examination as to the efficiency and cost effectiveness of the performance by the company of all the objects laid out in section 11.  I would not select only certain items for such an examination but would make sure that performance audits relate to the objects and aims of companies which are clearly stated in section 11.</P>
    <P>I do not see any references in the Bill to the qualifications of harbour masters even though it sets out what the qualifications of pilots should be.  This Bill, as is the case with the 1946 Act, should set out what the qualifications of harbour masters should be or should state whether the Minister is given the power to decide them.  The Bill gives a harbour master the power to authorise a company to do anything he or she wants it to do.  In effect, a harbour master could ask his wife or anybody in the company to look after the harbour while he is away for a few days.  We must introduce regulations on the qualifications a deputy harbour master must have. There is no doubt that a harbour master <Col N="594" /> must have certain qualification.  It is crazy if the Bill allows harbour masters to authorise any persons in their companies to run harbours in their absence. What happens if something goes wrong?</P>
    <P>I will propose an amendment to enable harbour masters attend meetings. It will receive much support in the House and the Minister should take note.  There are several reasons why harbour masters should be included.  I have knowledge in this regard from meetings of the harbour board of which I am a member.  I must ask the harbour master about the obligations placed on the board regarding every item which arises.</P>
    <P>For example, a company meeting is held this evening but the harbour master cannot attend.  The meeting goes on for three or four hours during which matters are discussed and decisions made.  The instructions are passed on to the harbour master so he can carry them out the following morning.  However, he takes one look at them and says they are impossible and he cannot enforce them. The result is that another meeting must be held.</P>
    <P>It would be much easier to give the harbour master the rights he deserves. The harbour master is the boss and he can overrule any person in the port, including the managing director of the company.  If the managing director does something wrong, the harbour master can say the matter comes within his remit.  I intend to put down an amendment to ensure the harbour master may attend meetings, albeit without a vote. This will ensure he can contribute to meetings.  If the case arises at times that matters need to be discussed in the absence of the harbour master, it is easy to ask him to leave so that certain items may be addressed.</P>
    <P>I intend to seek the support of the House to amend section 52.  This House, the Lower House, the Minister, the Government and his party have protested about the explosion of nuclear bombs in the south Pacific.  We have also been doing our best to ensure the closure of Sellafield.  The Bill provides <Col N="595" /> an opportunity &mdash; I want two new sections &mdash; to totally ban the entry of any ship, vehicle or conveyance to our harbours which is either powered by nuclear energy or carrying nuclear material or anything which will case harm or damage to people and property.</P>
    <P>I will have the full support of the House and the public for this amendment. After it has been considered, I intend to go further and call for a nuclear free zone around our coast. Until we make a move ourselves, our voices will not be heard in other places. The purpose of the amendment will be to ensure a total ban on the entry of any ship, vehicle or conveyance powered by or carrying any type of nuclear substance. The Minister should take serious heed because I spoke to the Independent Members of the House about this matter and they said they will support it.  The Bill provides the Minister with a golden opportunity to strike a blow in our campaign to get rid of Sellafield and the other protests.  I am warning the Minister that my party has considered this matter and I have received clearance to move an amendment to ban nuclear ships from our coast.</P>
    <P>Such ships are entering our harbours. For example, there was a large protest in Cork about a submarine.  We do not want any more ships of this type in our harbours, but an exception could be made if there is a need to bring in a minute amount of radioactive material for use in industry.  For example, some years ago I moved a motion in the House to ban strychnine.  A Minister of State in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry pleaded with me not to move it, but I had more support than the Department realised and strychnine was banned.</P>
    <P>However, small amounts of strychnine for medical purposes were exempted and are still entering the country.  This substance is contained in medication, such as Waffron tablets, which I take.  If small amounts of nuclear material are necessary, they <Col N="596" /> may be exempted, but I intend to push this matter to the limit to secure a total ban on the entry of any ship which is powered by or carrying nuclear material.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why so much power is given to the harbour police.  A good police force already exists but under the Bill the harbour police can arrest a person for committing offences mentioned in the legislation.  For example, a director or managing director will commit an offence if they release confidential information.  The Bill will give power to the harbour police to arrest the managing director of the company.  This is unacceptable and nobody could agree with giving such powers to what is effectively a private police force.</P>
    <P>It was never intended that the harbour police would be involved in such activities.  Their role involves security and the provision will create a situation where the force will run the harbour. The Garda Síochána should be in charge at all times.  What type of training will the harbour police receive? According to the Bill, it will be the appropriate training considered necessary by the company, but how does the company know how to train a policeman? This aspect makes one's mind boggle.  The Bill hands this matter over to the company.  It will employ harbour police and must come up with its own way of training them.  It is a dangerous job and these people should be properly trained by the Garda Síochána.  I ask the Minister to seriously examine this provision. Such extensive powers should not be given to the harbour police.</P>
    <P>Regarding section 77 and pilotage, does the master of a ship have the right to refuse to allow a pilot to take charge of a ship if in his opinion the pilot is under the influence of drink or drugs? On the other hand, can the master of a ship be charged on the basis of evidence from a pilot that he was drunk while in charge of a ship?  No section covers this aspect.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the Bill under which a director may be disqualified for <Col N="597" /> non attendance.  At times, their attendance is bad.  The Bill should contain a provision to cover this area.  People may be disqualified for other reasons but not non attendance.  I am trying to cover as many matters as possible as my time is running out.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the Bill regarding the granting of licences by companies for small boats to ferry passengers.  The company in Dingle issues such licences in the interest of safety and all companies should do likewise.  Section 53 of the 1946 Act, which clearly sets out situations where a harbour authority may grant licences, should be included in the Bill.  There is no provision in the Bill for a helicopter pad or facilities for rescue services and such provisions should be included to improve the Bill.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with Dingle.  I have waited four years to have Dingle designated as a fishery harbour centre.  We are waiting for a review of the matter from the Department.  We try to do our best in Dingle.  I have given 21 years' voluntary service on the harbour board and I want better treatment from the Department.</P>
    <P>I had an Údarás na Gaeltachta engineer draw up a plan to regulate the development of Dingle Harbour and I sent it to the Secretary of the Department of the Marine on 21 April.  I received a reply a week ago apologising for the delay in replying.  The cheek of it; it has me fuming.  We spent many hours meeting and discussing and, despite three other letters, the Secretary took over seven months to reply to our correspondence.  We are trying to develop Dingle and help the Department of the Marine.  If we are to be treated thus I will put in the boot; I am sick and tired of the way we are being treated.  The letter tells us that we did not cost the plan.  No costing is necessary; it is only an attempt to regulate the development of the harbour.</P>
    <P>We will have more hard words to say but they are not directed personally at the Minister of State or his staff. However, we will have a long session on Committee Stage.  I have not touched on <Col N="598" /> a number of matters due to time constraints; I should have asked for another half an hour to deal with other matters and representations I have received.  I will get my colleagues to deal with those matters.</P>
    <P>I had to publicly express my anger of the Department's treatment of Dingle.  I will not take it lying down.  Four years ago the then Minister for the Marine, Deputy Woods, nominated a person in his Department to liaise with us to ensure a smooth take-over of Dingle Harbour.  Nothing has happened since. Dingle has the fourth highest level of landings in Ireland.  There will be many amendments to the Bill put forward on Committee Stage, some of which I hope will be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the improvements and efficiencies which the Bill will provide for harbours.  The main provision which sets out the establishment of 12 commercial companies is a positive approach.  It is important that ports and harbours are exposed to the same economic activity as industry and commerce. Such exposure will ensure harbours will be operated as effectively and efficiently as possible.  They will be required to do so just to survive.</P>
      <P>In recent years harbours have been neglected in favour of airports and national primary routes, and there has been less emphasis on the development of harbours.  More goods are exported by sea than by air or road.  A new Harbours Bill is long overdue.  It is 50 years since the last legislation was enacted. More money needs to be directed to harbours and to the shipping industry in general.  There should be greater State aid and encouragement for individuals and companies involved in the shipping industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no agency from which a person can get State aid to put a ship on the seas and thereby create employment.  In the case of other industries there are various agencies from which assistance may be sought.  There is a belief that those who fund shipping are extremely wealthy, have no difficulty providing the <Col N="599" /> necessary finances and do not need State aid.  Every industry needs State aid at present.</P>
    <P>We are the last island nation in Europe since the advent of the Channel Tunnel.  We must ensure there is increasing investment in the shipping industry and in modernising harbours. Ports have operated under the Harbours Act, 1946, with some minor amendments &mdash; a worthwhile Act which stood the test of time.  It was introduced immediately after the Second World War when sailing ships were the norm in many ports.  Many of its provisions deal with sailing ships which then had precedence over mechanically powered ships between harbours.  Parts II, IV and V of the new Bill are welcome and take account of changes which have occurred in the type of vessel used in ports and the modern communications systems in use.  Such changes were not anticipated by the legislation enacted 50 years ago.</P>
    <P>Attempts made in the past to modernise the Harbours Act were unsuccessful. This Bill arises from the recommendations of the harbours review group set up in October 1990 whose task was to identify those aspects of existing legislation which constrained the modern port.  The structure of harbour boards was examined as was the extent of ministerial and departmental control of the activities of ports.</P>
    <P>The group's main findings were that Ireland of all countries in the EU was probably the most heavily dependent on external trade for its future prosperity; the crucial importance of seaports to the economy was highlighted by the fact that in 1990 80 per cent by volume and almost 55 per cent by value of the total external trade of the State passed through seaports; having regard to Ireland's remoteness from the main European and world markets, there was an urgent need to bring the overall performance of Irish ports up to the best international standards.  The key recommendation of the review group was to facilitate commercialisation and that commercial State companies should be <Col N="600" /> set up to manage certain ports.  The group also recommended that the commercial mandate under which the new port companies would operate should give them flexibility to operate as a truly commercial enterprise.  The Bill is based on the main recommendations of the review group.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Fitzgerald's comments on the position of harbour masters and I urge the Minister to look closely at discussions on this matter. Reference is made to the two positions which must be filled in each port company, the chief executive and the harbour master.  The chief executive's role is defined and regulated, but the harbour master's role is unique in the new port companies and is not correctly legislated for.</P>
    <P>A large section of the Bill is devoted to pilotage and the same emphasis should be placed on harbour masters. Confidence in the new management techniques should mean more flexibility in controlling pilotage and less control from central authorities.  If harbours share pilotage, it should be done by agreement and understanding and commonsense should prevail.</P>
    <P>Harbour masters were recently named in safety and environmental legislation as the competent local authority responsible for the administration of such legislation.  The responsibility of this mix of statutory and commercial obligation is not reflected in the harbour master's representation at board level under the proposed legislation.  Under the pilotage section of the Bill the harbour masters are expected to regulate and control pilots, but they do not have representation on a board of inquiry under section 73.  The right of the harbour masters to attend board meetings and to enter into discussions should be enshrined in the legislation to ensure that board policy will not be in conflict with the statutory obligations of port companies.  Harbour masters should not be on the board because they would compromise their situation, especially their statutory role.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="601" /> It is vital that the harbour master is privy to the board's discussions and is available to the board for consultation during discussions at harbour meetings. The harbour master has a right to attend board meetings and to take part in the discussions.  The core business of a port is the safe arrival, stay and dispatch of vessels to and from the waters of every port and the safe handling, storage and dispatch of goods to and from ports.  The commercial and technical qualifications and experience of the harbour master is vital to the safe running of the ports.  The training, expertise and technical knowledge of the harbour master should be identified and enshrined in legislation to ensure that harbour masters have a basic standard of qualification.  They should attend board meetings because the role of the harbour master is widening, particularly where staff numbers are falling, and every decision made at board level will eventually impinge on some important aspect of the harbour master's role in the port.</P>
    <P>As a member of Foynes Harbour Trustees for ten years I welcome the decision announced by the Minister for the Marine to extend the jurisdiction of the limits of Foynes Harbour.  I commend Mr. Patrick J. Murphy for the work he has done in this regard.  It is important to put on the record the main recommendations which the Minister has taken on board.  Mr. Murphy recommended that increased jurisdiction be granted to Foynes Harbour Trustees as follows:</P>
    <P>The limit to the east, consisting of the entire area below high water mark lying between an imaginary line drawn from Dernish Point to Gammarel Point, should remain unchanged.</P>
    <P>The limit to the west, consisting of the entire area below high water mark lying between an imaginary line drawn from Battery Point on Foynes Island and a point in the Estuary North of the White River at Loghill, being 7.4 cables South of the County <Col N="602" /> Clare Coast, ... should be granted to Foynes Harbour Trustees by way of increased jurisdiction, to enable them to expand logically and to cater efficiently for expected future imports and exports.</P>
    <P>This proposal extends the present western limit of Foynes Harbour which is bounded by an imaginary straight line drawn from a point 168 metres west-north-west of Foynes Rock to a point due north thereof in the townland of Foynes Island.</P>
    <P>The proposed new area of jurisdiction is bounded by a line 4.0 cables west of Battery Point to a point in the Estuary from which a line is drawn south-west to a point 2.8 cables north of the Limerick coast between Poultallin Point and Mount Trenchard Point, from which point the line proceeds south-west to a point 2.8 cables north of Mount Trenchard Point, from which it continues south-west to the point north of Loghill, which is 7.4 cables south of the County Clare Coast, and meridian 9 degrees 12 minutes west of Greenwich, where it is bounded to the south-west by a line passing south through the mouth of the White River at Loghill.</P>
    <P>Limerick Harbour Commissioners would continue to have Estuarial responsibility for safety, lighting and other services and I am satisfied that my proposal would not pose any safety risks for incoming and outgoing ships navigating the Estuarial Channel for destinations other than Foynes Harbour.</P>
    <P>Foynes Harbour is one of the great success stories in Limerick.  The Foynes Harbour Trustees were established in 1890 under the Foynes Harbour Order, 1890.  It laid down the existing jurisdiction of Foynes, which consists of one mile of water on the southern bank of the Shannon Estuary.  This area of jurisdiction was confirmed in the Foynes Harbour Order, 1932, and has remained unchanged for over 100 years.  It should be understood that in 1890, when the jurisdiction of the harbour was set out, <Col N="603" /> the average size of a vessel was 250 cwt. The amount of water in 1890 was adequate for the size of vessel to be safely anchored in the area.</P>
    <P>The port of Foynes has been developed extensively over the past 30 years.  Foynes port is on a par with Dublin and Cork in relation to the size of vessel which can be accommodated, approximately 36,000 cwt.  No other port in the State can facilitate this size of vessel. Foynes Harbour Trustees have increased trade through the port from 41,000 tonnes in 1963 to 1,414,000 for the year ended 31 March 1995.  The number of trading vessels for the same period has increased from 32 to 300 and the net register tonnage of vessels has increased from 20,000 tonnes to 850,000 tonnes.  Over the past 25 years Foynes Harbour Trustees have spent £12.5 million on improving marine and onshore facilities and have received £1.3 million from State and EU grants, which represents 10.4 per cent of the total capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>I will now outline on what the money was spent.  A deep water jetty was built in 1968 at a cost of £0.5 million and another was built in 1985 at a cost of £3.3 million.  Mooring dolphin cranes were built in 1990 at a cost of £1.2 million. Capital dredging in 1981 and 1990 cost £2 million.  Acquisition of port handling equipment cost £1.3 million and acquisition and development of 150 acres of land from 1987 to 1991 cost £1.6 million.  I was involved in the heart-searching about purchasing the land at that time, which is now a hive of activity that has created employment in the area.  The erection of warehouses and weighbridges and the acquisition of office accommodation cost £1.2 million. Installation of essential services, such as roadways, fresh and fire water, main sewer, Telecom, ESB, etc., came to almost £1 million.</P>
    <P>Foynes Harbour is still one of the most competitive ports from an economic and industrial relations viewpoint. It has lost only seven working days due to industrial action in the past 50 years. <Col N="604" /> It is the sole port on the west coast with a direct rail link to the national rail system and it is directly adjacent to the N69 national route.  Employment in the port has increased from 60 persons in 1963 to 400 at present.  The development of Foynes over the past 30 years has been phenomenal and the trustees have achieved this level of trade and development mostly from revenues generated from the port itself.</P>
    <P>The port has now reached its maximum potential within the existing limits.  Further expansion and development after the present development plan, which is updating the present facilities, has been completed can only be achieved by utilising the adjacent deep water.  I am glad the Minister is convinced of this case.  It should also be noted that no other authority has any plans for the utilisation of waters included in the proposed expansion of the jurisdiction of Foynes.  It is fair to say the development of the deep water immediately adjacent to Foynes, including the potential berths at Foynes Island, Mount Trenchard and Coalhill Point, can only take place by using existing Foynes Harbour facilities.  When making the application for the extension of jurisdiction over the adjacent waters, the Foynes Harbour Trustees were careful to select limits which were the minimum necessary with the use of the immediately adjacent deep water and would cause the least interference with the existing use or potential development of any other area by any other enterprise or harbour authority on the Shannon.</P>
    <P>The occupancy in utilisation of berths in Foynes is high.  The trustees have completed plans to extend the west jetty up to a length of 300 metres next year to enable this berth to accommodate two large vessels simultaneously.  This facility will lead to a reduction in traffic congestion in the immediate future, but it is confidently predicted that the extra facility will be utilised to its maximum within a short period, thereby increasing the overall traffic and throughput by approximately 50 per cent.  This <Col N="605" /> additional facility will only alleviate existing shipping congestion and will not cater for future trade.</P>
    <P>It is important that Foynes Harbour Trustees have the facility to extend areas where there are deep water sites which are located at Mount Trenchard. Foynes would be capable of handling super-Panamax type vessels in the Mount Tranchard area, so this is an obvious step.  The development of proper jetty facilities in this location would substantially reduce the cost to Irish importers and exporters and the savings of freight cost for port users who use the Panamax size vessel could be as high as £3 per tonne.  The construction of a deep water jetty in the area of the proposed extension to the jurisdiction was identified by An Foras Forbatha in 1983 as one of the most suitable sites on the Shannon Estuary for development, which would also eliminate the existing restrictions on vessels in excess of 20,000 DWT berthing or un-berthing during the dark time period, which can apply at various intervals from 1 November each year to the following 15 February.  The provision of a berth at this location would also release the berthage in the inner harbour of Foynes and substantially reduce the risk of congestion and eliminate demurrage cost to the Irish importers and exporters.</P>
    <P>I thank the Government for its positive response to the Foynes Harbour development plan, which costs £10 million and will substantially improve the present facilities.  I especially commend the present Minister for the Marine, Deputy Barrett, the Minister of State, Deputy Gilmore, and the previous Minister, Deputy Coveney, for their response to Foynes when the application was initially placed before them.</P>
    <P>The State grant of £5 million is the biggest received in the 100 year life of the harbour.  This development will be completed in a short time; it is due to commence early next year, possibly April or May, and finish as quickly as possible.  In conjunction with this it is vital that we draw up plans for the development of the deep port.  At the <Col N="606" /> same time the Department and the EU should look at the funding implications, the cost/benefit factor and the opportunity for Ireland of having such a port on the west coast.  We would not wish to wait until the development on hand was completed.  We must immediately make plans and look forward to the response from the Department and the relevant EU authorities about this exciting development.</P>
    <P>There are two difficulties which may slow or delay the development of the level of commercial business at Foynes. These two issues must be tackled in conjunction with future developments. Undoubtedly Foynes has a bright future and will contribute in an exciting and progressive way to the economy and the State.  The two inhibitors to the expansion are the condition of the N69 road serving the port of Foynes and the work practices on the docks.</P>
    <P>I request the Minister to immediately discuss the improvement of the N69 with his colleague, the Minister for the Environment.  This road serves Foynes Harbour from Limerick city and the national primary network.  It is in extremely bad condition and has been commented on by many potential businesses who examined Foynes and Askeaton for industrial development purposes. I raised this issue in the House on numerous occasions and again call on the Government to develop immediately a programme for this road to complement and enable the development of Foynes and areas between Limerick and Tarbert.  There is also great potential for tourism development on this excellent scenic route and the economic return from both the commercial and tourist aspects of the road would be enormous. Over the past ten years Limerick County Council has fully backed these proposals and made unanimous recommendations to Governments in office over that period concerning the opportunity for development of port industries along the southern side of the Shannon Estuary if the road is improved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="607" /> The second area of concern is the work practices.  A review and re-organisation of labour management on the docks should be introduced.  No one acknowledges that he or his company is employing the dockers and I am concerned that the employee's rights and the transparency of employment should be clarified in the port.  The stevedores have no role in the selection of dockers. The selection is completed by the SIPTU committee of 12 people and the stevedores go to the union, which provides a gang to work on certain boats. When work is available it should be and should be seen to be allocated on an equitable basis.</P>
    <P>In a confidential report to the Minister for the Marine on the harbour authorities throughout the country, completed by the Labour Relations Commission, reference to Foynes was made:</P>
    <P>All dock labour on Foynes port is casual.  There is a hard core &mdash; i.e., first call &mdash; of 33 who work an average of 90 per cent of the working week.  In addition 60 to 70 work 75 per cent of the time.  The hiring of dockers on behalf of the stevedores is done by the local SIPTU part time official, who selects and books out gangs.</P>
    <P>On 24 August I wrote to the president of SIPTU, Mr. Ed Browne, regarding the concerns of many people about this problem.  A reply was received on 11 October; it was totally inadequate and only conceded on one issue, that non-regular dockers would be allowed on the selection committee.  There must be transparent, open and fair procedures in the selection and allocation of work in Foynes.  I am also concerned at reports that the practice known as &ldquo;ghosting&rdquo;, which allows a small group of SIPTU members to be paid for several shifts at one time.</P>
    <P>There must be proper pension arrangements and retirement policies in the docks.  It is not right in 1995 that people work well into their seventies <Col N="608" /> while others wait for the occasional mail boat.  The problem of work practices and management of labour on the docks must be examined to ensure Foynes fully benefits from the future the arbitrator's report recommended.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal now with New Ross harbour.  I was visited by a delegation from New Ross who outlined to me the issues mentioned by Senator Fitzgerald. I am aware from the Minister's speech that on 6 November 1995 it was agreed at a meeting that a review of the entire pilotage operation on that estuary should be undertaken.  It was further agreed that a review group would be set up by the Department of the Marine to examine the pilotage issue in detail, which I welcome.</P>
    <P>The New Ross Harbour Board is concerned about the light dues, as dealt with under section 13.  Ships bound for the port of New Ross must pass through the port of Waterford Harbour.  At present, these ships are charged light dues at the same rate as vessels which are proceeding to Waterford, in spite of the fact that the New Ross ships use less than half the lights of the estuary. Waterford Harbour Commissioners collect £45,000 per annum in light dues from New Ross ships.  The charge is not related to the cost of providing the lights and is, in the view of the harbour board, making New Ross uncompetitive. I understand that an amendment on Report Stage allows for the continuation of this inequitable situation &mdash; some thinking was done on this on Committee Stage but it was reversed on Report Stage.  Will the Minister outline his thinking on why a decision to accept this was reversed at a later stage?</P>
    <P>The harbour board accepts that if Waterford port provides facilities or services which are of benefit to ships going to New Ross it should be able to recover a fair proportion of the capital and operational costs of providing those facilities or services.  However, those costs should be recovered from the other port company rather than a levy on each ship. This would result in an equitable and transparent situation between the two <Col N="609" /> ports.  If the present proposals continue, the principal competitor of New Ross Harbour will be in a position to levy charges on it.  The cost of recovery should be on a transparent basis and a realistic assessment of the cost of the services given by Waterford Harbour Board.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's statement on pension schemes.  There is concern in many ports in regard to this; the Minister mentioned Dublin Port where there is great concern because of the situation they are experiencing.  Various unfunded superannuation schemes were established over the years which were subject to sanction and approval by the responsible Minister.  The latest of these, in the case of Dublin Port, was sanctioned in 1990.  These schemes permitted contributions to be deducted from staff without the necessity of forming a pension fund.  These moneys were invested in the expansion and development of the port in the absence of any State or other funding.</P>
    <P>The Pensions Act, 1990, and the Harbours Bill, 1995, require the board to establish a fund to cater for all pensions liabilities, past and present.  The requirement to retrospectively provide a fund, which in the case of Dublin will be £60 million, is not equitable or justifiable in view of the fact that the board fully complies with all obligations set out in the Harbours Act, 1946, nor is it possible to so do.  At present, the turnover of Dublin Port is in the region of £23 million, £3.5 million of which goes towards pension funding.  Difficulties will arise if £60 million extra is required. I appreciate that the Minister said he has set up a mechanism to overcome this and to allow for some derogation. Perhaps he would look at a derogation in this instance of between 25 and 30 years to allow Dublin Port to build up the necessary funding to accommodate its pension situation.  I know there is a provision that some funding would be provided by the Government.  Will the Minister explain in full his proposals for State funding of harbours which have a <Col N="610" /> turnover of £23 million and are now required to produce £60 million to fund a pension scheme?</P>
    <P>The whole area of pilotage was discussed and forms a very large part of the Bill.  There is a dramatic change in the present pilotage laws.  The making of harbour by-laws under section 42 is straightforward but is in contrast with the requirements of section 71 in relation to the making of pilotage by-laws. The Bill should be amended to include in section 22 the making of by-laws with regard to pilotage.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald referred to harbour police.  I agree with him that if such a police force is needed, I do not see why it cannot be the Garda.  I am also concerned about their training.  The requirement that a board must have a harbour police force surely puts it in an uncompetitive position in regard to trading relations.  A board would be disadvantaged by having to maintain a police force and should have the discretion to decide whether to have such a police force.  Provision should be made to enable routine security duties, such as gate security, to be carried out by people other than policemen &mdash; for example, a security firm.</P>
    <P>We have all been contacted by the Irish Shipping Agents Association.  A bond is now required to be lodged with the harbour company to cover payment of harbour charges.  The Irish Shipping Agents Association has asked whether the procedure of compelling the agent to pay his principal liability by direct cash or an extraction from his bond contravenes the law of agency, to which Senator Fitzgerald referred.  Will the Minister comment on the bonds issue?  I am sure this will be discussed throughout the debate because our attention has been drawn to it.</P>
    <P>As the review group stated, Ireland is the most heavily dependent of any EU country on external trade for its future economic development.  Eighty per cent, in terms of volume, and over 50 per cent, in terms of value, of the total external trade of this State passes through Irish seaports.  Ireland is the last <Col N="611" /> remaining island country in the EU.  It is of vital importance that the overall performance of Irish seaports should be on a par with the best international standards.  The handling efficiencies and techniques of 1995 have no relationship to those of 1946 when the Harbours Act was introduced; new legislation is necessary to deal with modern cargo handling. The restructuring of seaports and the updating of legislation is taking place in many countries and it is important that Ireland is not left behind. The new legislation is designed to ensure that ports will be enabled to operate as truly commercial and self-sufficient enterprises, free from undue control.  As the Minister said, the reorganisation of the commercial seaports, together with a continuation of EU aid for port development, will give the ports the flexibility they need to operate as truly commercial enterprises and will greatly improve their efficiency and effectiveness to the benefit of exporters, the agricultural and industrial sectors and our tourism trade.</P>
    <P>The main thrust of the new legislation will be to relax ministerial control while increasing accountability for operational and financial performance.  I welcome the significant investment in portal development which will take place between now and 1999.  It is important that investment be made to facilitate the expansion of industry, agriculture, tourism and regional development.  The importance of our ports to the Irish economy cannot be over-emphasised.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State for his presence in the House and his response to the Foynes Harbour issue.  I have been a member of the board of Foynes Harbour for ten years.  I also thank the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Barrett, for his response in this regard.  I particularly thank the review group and those who are most often forgotten, the civil servants.  These people contact harbour boards daily and are annoyed and hassled for the privilege.  On occasion, the chief executives of harbour boards <Col N="612" /> are instructed to lay it on the line to civil servants.  I thank Noreen O'Mahony and her staff for their excellent work throughout the years.  With the advent of this Bill, these people are moving into a new and exciting area.  The harbour boards look forward to close co-operation with them.</P>
    <P>I will not be a member of the new board for Foynes Harbour because I am a serving Member of this House.  I do not have any hang-ups in that regard.  I do not know if Members of the Oireachtas should serve on the boards of semi-State bodies.  However, many colleagues are of the opinion that we should.  I hope to be in a position to contribute to the port in my area.  I look forward to friendly, co-operative, developmental and complementary relations with our partners and neighbouring ports in County Limerick.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I concur with Senator Neville in congratulating the Minister for engaging in the arduous task of producing this Bill.  This Bill is a long overdue effort to introduce modern commercial reality to our ports.</P>
      <P>The failure to modernise our ports has been an amazing oversight, given the dependence of our economy on the export trade.  Senator Neville quoted figures which remind us how important that trade is to the country.  Great effort and investment have been made over many years to develop that trade but some Irish ports have proved to be a bottleneck in the export process.  They have tended to hinder rather than help Ireland's export development.  The situation is summed up by the extent to which the port of Larne in County Antrim has developed as an outlet for the export of goods from the Twenty-six Counties at the expense of other ports which are much nearer to the eventual destination of such goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I attended the opening of the H.J. Heinz Company factory in Dundalk two years ago at which Dr. Tony O'Reilly spoke.  He explained that one of the reasons Dundalk had been selected for <Col N="613" /> the establishment of that factory, which provides great employment opportunities in the area, was the availability of ports and he specifically mentioned Larne in that regard.  If one looks at a map of Ireland one sees how far Larne is from Dundalk; this reflects on our ability to run our ports.</P>
    <P>I passed through Belfast yesterday and drove, via the M1 and M2, on to the Larne road.  I realised the difficulties faced by anyone attempting to export from Dundalk via Larne.  They must travel further and they experience many extra problems.  However, that was the specific reason the H.J. Heinz Company built their factory in Dundalk.  It seems to be a startling reflection on our ability to ensure that our ports are capable of handling such business.</P>
    <P>The main problem in the past was that our ports were slow to come to terms with the realities and needs of today's business world.  As a result our ports have been bedevilled by restrictive practices, excessive charges to customers and times of opening which suited the people working the ports rather than those using them.  Hopefully all this will soon be a thing of the past. This enabling legislation will help us to bring the ports in our distribution chain into line with the rest of what is done in relation to foreign trade.</P>
    <P>Last month I received a visit from a group of North Americans planning to open a factory in Ireland.  I put them in touch with the IDA, with which they were very impressed, and brought them to the House where they met the Minister for Enterprise and Employment. During our discussions I inquired about their main concern to establish a plant in Ireland &mdash; their business involves grocery, not food, products which are not short-life products.  The chief executive stated that their main concern is that Ireland is on the periphery of Europe.  The group had contacted one of their largest customers, based in Milan, and asked what they required from a supplier of grocery products.  The customer in Milan, who runs a chain of supermarkets, stated that their business <Col N="614" /> operates on a &ldquo;just in time&rdquo; delivery system and that they do not want to store goods any longer than necessary. When they order goods, they require delivery within four days.</P>
    <P>It is clear from this that the American company is already at a disadvantage.  If they base their operation on the periphery of the periphery &mdash; the west of Ireland &mdash; a number of extra hours will be added to the difficulty of delivering their products to that wholesale distribution centre in Milan.  When this is taken into account, we realise how important are our ports and the work carried out there and that it is imperative we have efficient ports.  We must be able to provide efficient service to customers establishing factories in Ireland which will provide jobs and develop industry.</P>
    <P>I must confess, however, to having a major reservation about the provisions in this Bill in so far as they determine the composition of the new harbour boards.  I hope the Minister will give a commitment to address my reservation. I hope he will do so by way of a Government amendment on Committee Stage. The Bill provides that the Minister appoint the members of the new boards and that some board seats be reserved for worker directors, which is in line with current practice.  In addition, it provides for representation by members of the local authority.  I have no problem with any of these provisions.  My problem is that these provisions represent the beginning and end of what the Bill states regarding the composition of the new boards.  Workers and local authorities are to have entrenched representation, but no mention is made of representation for other interested parties.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains no requirement to appoint representatives of local business interests.  This is an amazing oversight given that the underlying purpose of the legislation is to bring the ports into the commercial world.  I recently spoke to someone who has decided to use the port of Warrenpoint, County Down. The reason for doing so is that the port authorities there are commercially <Col N="615" /> minded and customer oriented.  If a ship arrives a number of hours late, the people who work at the port will come in at 3 a.m. to load or unload that ship. That is very different to what used to take place in our ports.  The challenge with which the Minister is faced is how to put our ports into a position to challenge traditional ways of doing things so that we might compete.  If we are to compete we must be driven by the customer's needs, in this case the person importing or exporting goods.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister for the Marine who has taken over from the Minister of State.  I am sure he will appoint representatives of local business interests to the harbours boards.  This legislation will be on the Statute Book for a long time and I believe that, if workers and local authorities are represented, customers &mdash; in this case local business interests &mdash; should be represented. If we are to specify that workers and local authorities must be represented, then surely we should also specify that business interests are also represented.  To omit this requirement is to send a bad signal about the overall intention of the Bill.  It calls into question the depth of commitment to create a commercial regime for our ports and I find it hard to accept.</P>
    <P>No doubt it will be said no Minister in his right mind would ever appoint a harbour board without including business people on it.  I am sure this is so, but it is not the point.  The point is that this legislation should signal clearly what it is trying to do.  It is not giving the right signal by entrenching the representation of workers and local authorities while refusing to do the same for the customers, that is, the business interests.  On the contrary, it is giving entirely the wrong signal.</P>
    <P>Let us remember what we are trying to do here.  We are trying to drag our ports into the modern commercial world so they become a springboard for export growth rather than an inhibitor of it. Who in his right mind could argue that with such an objective, we should fail to <Col N="616" /> specify in the legislation that business interests are represented fully?  That is what the Minister is striving to achieve &mdash; healthy, viable ports which will be responsive to the customers who import and export.  I am very concerned about this.  I believe the Minister has not given sufficient attention to this and to the case made in the other House.  This is the opportunity to do something about it.</P>
    <P>I wish to touch on some other issues. I congratulate the Minister on the steps he has taken with regard to Foynes.  He was not in the House a few minutes ago when Senator Neville congratulated him on these measures.  It seems this development is exactly the sort of step which is creating competitiveness in the ports area.  This is the right way to go and the Minister is to be congratulated for it.  I know he is taking this step in the knowledge that it will be to the benefit of the economy as a whole as well as to the port of Foynes.</P>
    <P>I am not quite sure I understand the steps which are being taken in regard to New Ross, but I know that will be debated on Committee Stage.  I can only add that in regard to both Foynes and New Ross and the question of representation on the board, we aim to ensure there is fairness and competitiveness.  I believe the Minister is behind that, I know his heart is in it and that when he hears the case being made here with regard to the various arguments which are to be advanced on Committee Stage, I am sure he will come to this House with an open mind to ensure our ports will be the healthy viable ports for which we all strive.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the Bill and wish him well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCalnan" hpid="Mr. Calnan Mr. Calnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy Gilmore, who was here earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Harbours Bill, 1995. When we recall it has been 50 years since we had major legislation in this country to deal with our harbours, we should be ashamed of ourselves as an <Col N="617" /> island country.  We are acting more like Switzerland or Austria than an island in the Atlantic off the European Continent.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Marine plays a big role in the development of our coast.  It is a relatively new Department. The fact that there was no Department of Fisheries until the 70's and that it then formed part of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries shows how neglectful we were of the sea and the land bordering the sea.  Later, there was a Department of Fisheries and Forestry and, finally, the Department of the Marine.</P>
    <P>Our approach to the sea, harbours and islands over the years has left a lot to be desired.  This new Department needs a lot of finance and I hope the Minister will be able to get it because there is huge potential for development along our coasts.  There is mariculture, aquaculture, tourism, sailing, yachting, angling, the commercial aspect, landing facilities and, most importantly, the servicing of our islands.</P>
    <P>I served as a member of the Baltimore and Skibbereen Harbour Board from 1974 to 1979.  When I first went to a board meeting I was completely disillusioned with what I found.  There were a number of people working with great dedication on a voluntary basis to try to keep the harbour board going and that is the way it has been since.  There was really no money, and a board cannot function without money.</P>
    <P>The Baltimore and Skibbereen Harbour Board is constrained in its work. There were local authority members on the board &mdash; I was one of them; there were ministerial appointments; there was a union, commercial interests and others.  But the board lacked the finance for the proper management, control, operation and development of the harbour and its approaches.  Whatever is to happen with boards in future, they must have finance or ways to raise finance in order to function properly.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have dealt with the broader national issue of harbours, but I want to confine myself to the smaller <Col N="618" /> ones.  People have spoken about Foynes, New Ross, Dublin, Cork and so on, but I want to talk about the coast in my constituency, which stretches from Kinsale to the Dursey Sound.  It is a very long stretch of coastline.  First, I will address the Kinsale Harbour Board.  It has the same functions as the other boards and is constrained by its financial situation in the same way.  Kinsale has great commercial prospects for landing goods, it is developing fishing and it has a leisure centre already.  With a properly financed board, I can see great developments there.</P>
    <P>I mentioned already that I have been a member of the Baltimore and Skibbereen Harbour Board and I attended one of their recent meetings.  In a letter from the Baltimore and Skibbereen Harbour Board dated 18 November, the board's secretary states that the harbour commissioners are totally against the abolition of certain harbour boards and the transfer of their responsibilities to anybody else.  He added that they wished to express &ldquo;in the strongest possible terms&rdquo; their opposition to any suggestion of that happening to the Baltimore and Skibbereen Harbour Board. The board feels this would be a retrograde step and would take the running of the harbour out of the hands of those people who have a detailed knowledge and expertise of the area, which could cause problems in the future.</P>
    <P>Over the years Baltimore has developed well as a leisure centre, fishing and commercial port and it plays an important part in the servicing of Sherkin Island and Oileáin Cléire, which is a Gaeltacht island.  The board needs the support of the Government and the local people.  Under the present circumstances they are doing a very good job on a tight budget.</P>
    <P>The Bantry Harbour Board further west is a newer board.  It was set up only quite recently.  Bantry has a fine harbour; it is one of the finest, if not the finest, in western Europe.  However, again, financial constraints have led to poor development of the bay.  There are huge commercial and fishing interests in <Col N="619" /> Bantry.  One thing about all of the ports, and of Bantry in particular, is the amount of aquaculture and mariculture which is being undertaken.  This is often unplanned.  I feel the board's role in the control of aquaculture and its proper development for the people who are doing a fine job and giving great employment there should be comprehensive.</P>
    <P>The INPC Whiddy terminal is also in Bantry, from which boats will go out to the developing project.  We hope that oil will flow and that we will have good employment like that which existed in the past.  Only a proper harbour board with proper finance can fulfil that role.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Bill includes the powers, functions and operational areas, which are extremely important.  Section 91 deals with the local authority area.  A board in a village or town which is not given the scope to develop into its harbour and sea area is no good.  Aquaculture and mariculture, if developed properly, can provide great employment in a constituency like my own where there is little other employment at present.</P>
    <P>Harbour boards can cause terrific development in tourism.  Places such as Baltimore, Kinsale and Bantry have sailing clubs and diving clubs and are developing marinas.  Such facilities are important to attract foreign tourists. Dredging costs hundreds of thousands of pounds and is completely beyond the resources of local harbour boards, which cannot even consider it. Approaches to harbours must be marked and this also costs money. Safety at sea is paramount.  Any loss of life is tragic.  We must always watch for loss of life at sea resulting from a lack of proper facilities.  Harbour boards must also be vigilant in the area of drug trafficking, which is the scourge of our country.</P>
    <P>The greater part of the bill deals with the 12 major commercial harbours, but I want to talk about the other 13, including the three in west Cork which I mentioned. They are covered by sections 87 and 88.  The Minister mentioned that <Col N="620" /> they have an option to continue to operate under the Harbours Act, 1946, but they will still need finance.  An alternative is to set up a commercial State company to manage the small port and that must be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Another option is to transfer the power of a board to a local authority with the approval of the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister say that this will be done on a port by port basis with consultation.  Those words are of extreme importance because one is on to a loser if one tries to foist an authority on an area.  The local fishermen, commercial marine interest, those involved in aquaculture or mariculture, local authority members, local shopkeepers and others working along the coast know what is wanted.  At times there will be an element of individual greed; but if all the points are taken and worked out properly, the right solution can be found for the smaller ports. Some of them would function better under a local authority while others would be better as they are but with proper financing.  Others may be better operating as registered companies.  Consultation and assessment on a port by port basis is important and I am glad to see it included in the Minister's speech.</P>
    <P>Frequently, we see projects fail because they fall between two Departments &mdash; the Department of the Environment on one side and the Department of the Marine on the other.  The high water mark is the border line and while the local authority may be inclined to say a problem is within the remit of the Department of the Marine, the Department of the Marine will say it comes within the functions of the local authority.  There are two such examples in west Cork.</P>
    <P>The first is the proposed building of a barrage on Clonakilty Bay to protect the housing in the Faxbridge and lower Clonakilty areas from flooding.  There is hassle between the Department of the Marine and the Department of the Environment as to what will happen to this project.  The other concerns a stone <Col N="621" /> shelter in Roaring Water Bay, where moneys were granted in the past and difficulties have arisen between the county council and the Department of the Marine about safety and insurance. Fishermen are dragging products up slippery stones to try to sell them abroad.  This results in danger to life and limb.  Provision of funds would eliminate the extreme hardship being encountered by the fishermen.</P>
    <P>Castetownbere is not mentioned in the Bill because it is a fishery port and is in a separate category.  There are great developments in Union Hall.  Is there any possibility that another board might be established to deal with that development which includes a fine new pier?  I must praise the initiatives of the local people including the fishermen's organisations, for the work they have done and the manner in which they have promoted and fought for it.</P>
    <P>We cannot overlook the tremendous tourist facilities in Courtmacsherry and Schull which do not have harbour boards.  Local participation is an important part of the future development of smaller ports.  While dealing with the 12 larger harbours and 13 smaller ones, we cannot forget the hundreds of small piers and slipways around our coast which are the responsibility of local authorities who have no money to maintain them.  We must examine them in the context of the future development of the fishing industry.  A small boat can come into its local pier, land its catch, make money for people in the locality, keep them employed and give them some dignity.  These small piers are a lifeline for work and need our support and that of the Department of the Marine.</P>
    <P>There are seven inhabited islands and many uninhabited islands off the south west coast of County Cork.  Two of the larger ones, Bere Island and Whiddy Island, are in Bantry Bay, while the Baltimore-Skibbereen Harbour Board area includes Cape Clear, Sherkin Island, Long Island and Hare Island.  The harbour boards could play big part in the lives of people on these islands.  The <Col N="622" /> ferry to Cape Clear and Sherkin Island leaves from Baltimore.  Proper management and development on the shore side will effect development on the islands.  One of these islands is a Gaeltacht area to which hundreds of students go during the summer.  Properly regulated tourism can be developed on those islands which need it badly.  There is a large future role to be played by the Department of the Marine in coastal protection and coastal development. Much work is needed to combat the power of the Atlantic.  I welcome the Bill.  I would welcome more Bills from the Department of the Marine which would address the development of coastal areas, whether it be coastal protection, coastal management or otherwise. Cork County Council established a coastal management committee some years ago.  Its function is to ascertain what can be done along the coast, but financial constraints are a big factor in its operation.  When the high water mark is reached the committee no longer has any function.</P>
    <P>In the past couple of years we established an islands committee; members from the islands meet with members from the local authority and exchange views.  This committee deals mainly with west Cork because the inhabited islands are off the west Cork coast.  The west Cork members of the county council are also the members of the island committee.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Minister's intentions are the best but with the introduction of more Bills from the Department of the Marine we could have a very good coastline with the development of fishing, mariculture and agriculture, which will provide employment for our young people.  This is vitally important in places such as west Cork where other sources of employment are not great.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill has been threatened for the House for some time and has been the cause of at least three. general elections.  I hope it will not cause another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="623" /> There are parts of the Bill which I welcome and which are long overdue because the powers of port users and port authorities are antiquated.  We have not been able to move forward to the best of our ability.  The Bill will enable ports to borrow more money and use their expertise in the commercial world for promotion and development.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn made some interesting points on the development of ports in the North over the past years, especially the ports of Larne and Warrenpoint, where the opportunity was seized to adopt, 24 hour roll-on roll-off operations. Many companies in the South use and have used the facilities of these ports, especially when VAT at the point of entry and various other measures hindered the kind of development that was required in this country.</P>
    <P>Part of the legislation seeks to reconstruct the management framework of port authorities by establishing State commercial companies to manage the 12 bigger ports, in addition to the other 13 ports that have been mentioned.  It is approximately 50 years since the Second Stage of a Harbour Bill was introduced to the House by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr. Lemass. Many famous names contributed to the debate, including General Mulcahy, John A. Costelloe and Maurice Dockrell. I wonder what will be said about this debate 50 years from now.  Will speakers concede that the right decisions were made, that we were advanced or restricted in our views?</P>
    <P>Some of the recommendations of the 1992 report of the Commercial Harbour Review Group are antiquated and we must move forward from them. However, the Bill does not go far enough, especially in dealing with Ireland's remoteness from the main part of Europe.  We are an island and depend totally on our exports by sea.  We are the only part of the EU severed from the mainland, which provides the basis of a case for proper and adequate funding for the development of our ports. An enormous effort will have to be <Col N="624" /> made to secure such funding.  We have fallen behind over the past number of years because of the lack of funding and proper legislation which would give the ports powers to develop.</P>
    <P>What does the Minister intend by the establishment of a State commercial company to manage and operate Dún Laoghaire Harbour, which is currently managed and operated by the Department of the Marine?  Does he intend that privatisation will take place or is this the foot in the door towards the privatisation of all the ports around the country?  I recently visited some ports in Scotland that are under State control and some that have been privatised. With regard to those that have been privatised, the numbers employed have been reduced, in some instances from approximately 300 to 400 people to approximately 25 or 30, with one person in the control room operating from a computer type system.  Will the Minister indicate if he intends this is to be the way forward for our ports?</P>
    <P>The Minister advises that the State will be the sole shareholder of each company.  Will he clarify this point?  He also advised that it is essential that thorough preparation is undertaken before the companies are established.  Is it his intention, once the Bill is enacted, to proceed with this on a piecemeal basis, for example, by dealing with the easiest port first and seeing how it works out, or does he intend to deal with all the ports together?</P>
    <P>With regard to the formation of the companies that the Minister intends to establish, I am disappointed that he will exclude Deputies, Senators and MEPs from the boards.  While MEPs and Deputies may be too busy, I fail to see the logic in prohibiting Senators.  I am a member of one such a board for the last 16 years, and am one of the most qualified members of the board as I am the only person living on the Shannon Estuary, which is included in the remit of the board.  I know as much if not more about the estuary than most people.  I know how it ticks and how, with the new powers to be given to the port authorities, <Col N="625" /> it could be developed and expanded.  By constrast, new appointees may have no interest in the boards they join having been appointed, for example, because of their expertise in company affairs and so on.  People with local knowledge should be involved in the running of boards.  Everybody knows what a port can mean to the livelihood of a town or village and this has been proven over the years.  There are successful ports throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The powers and duties of the new port companies will include promoting investment in harbours, utilising and managing the resources available to them and promoting leisure facilities.  In the operation of ports I cannot see how leisure and port facilities can work hand in glove, particularly in the case of large ports in and out of which large ships travel. Sailing clubs may interfere with pilotage of large ships in estuaries.  As far as the Shannon Estuary is concerned, designated areas for pleasure and recreation should be defined in advance and should not interfere with the shipping of goods in and out of the harbour.</P>
    <P>With regard to the audited accounts, the Minister said that each port company will be empowered, with ministerial consent, to borrow up to 50 per cent of its fixed assets.  Will this be with the consent of the Minister for the Marine or with the combined consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance? The Minister for the Marine might decide one thing but the Minister for Finance may say that money cannot be provided for this, even though the port authority may have put forward a viable economic plan.  This is a weakness of the Bill and I would like some clarification on it.  If the Minister for the Marine is responsible for the operation of ports. he should be empowered to give or withhold consent for borrowings by port authorities.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill the Minister will be empowered to issue directions to companies relating to safety and harbour charges.  We are setting up new authorities while at the same time the Minister <Col N="626" /> will retain control of these matters. People who have been operating ports for a number of years know more than anybody else about the safety of rivers and ports in their areas.  If the Minister is empowered to levy harbour charges, this will inhibit ports from attracting industry and development to their regions.  This part of the Bill should be amended.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that each port company will be required to organise pilotage by employing pilots directly or by licensing self-employed pilots to undertake pilotage operations.  Each port company will be empowered to make by-laws for the operation and organisation of pilotage services, qualifications for pilots, the grant of pilotage exemption certificates and other matters related to pilotage.  I would like the Minister to clarify this.</P>
    <P>During my years as a commissioner I have seen people being prohibited from operating on the Shannon Estuary, even though they had properly qualified people to operate on the river and all the necessary certificates.  They were prohibited because they were interfering with a cosy arrangement which was operating in the estuary.  Every obstacle one could think of was put in the way of the first registered operator. This man introduced a cheaper type of pilot boat system on the river which has been of benefit to this day.  Harbours and the people who use pilots in the estuary have benefited greatly from this person's operations.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the limits of the jurisdiction of Foynes Harbour.  The Minister appointed Mr. Patrick Murphy to act as an independent mediator between Limerick Harbour Commissioners and Foynes Harbour Trustes. I attended a number of these meetings during one of which Mr. Murphy met a delegation from Limerick Harbour Commissioners.  The Minister stated that he has accepted Mr. Murphy's recommendations and that he will introduce an amendment on Committee Stage to put them into effect.  Was Mr. Murphy acting as a mediator or an arbitrator? <Col N="627" /> Will the limits of the harbour's jurisdiction be defined before the debate on the Bill is concluded?</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the Shannon Estuary is a wonderful natural resource. There is no question about this but it is being held back and has been interfered with.  It has not been included among the four ports which may qualify for Cohesion funding, even though the tonnage passing through the Shannon Estuary, that is through both Limerick and Foynes harbours, is far greater than the tonnage which enters Dublin port.</P>
    <P>I live in Tarbert, which is at the mouth of the Shannon Estuary and where there is and oil refinery.  I should like to promote the establishment of a port in Tarbert.  As a member of Kerry County Council I proposed this, but I do not know why the council did not apply for a licence for jurisdiction.  We used to have a port in Tarbert but this was allowed to be replaced by Limerick Harbour Commissioners.  Since 1968 or 1969 every penny has been taken from this region to operate a harbour 35 or 40 miles downriver.  No development has taken place in my area while at the same time Arran Energy purchased 150 acres of land for a proposed oil refinery and the IDA purchased about 600 acres of land adjacent to this for the development of a smelter.  Toyota also bought 100 acres for the importation and assembly of cars, but this work was subsequently lost to Wales.</P>
    <P>This part of the estuary has the deepest port facilities and can turn around the biggest ships in the world, but it did not qualify for a single penny from the Cohesion Funds.  There is a coal powered power station across the estuary in Moneypoint.  This matter has been mentioned on numerous occasions and there have been umpteen meetings, but the development of the transhipment of commodities other than coal in that port has been prohibited.  If proper funding was put in place and people were given a free hand, it is possible that another port in the region could be developed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="628" /> The Minister should reconsider the Shannon Estuary in its entirety.</P>
    <P>The jurisdiction of the Foynes authority should be identified in the Bill. Foynes is a success story, involving a small number of people running a small port in a small town.  It originally employed up to 20 people but as many 400 have been employed on a week on/week off or day on/day off basis.  This created an unbelievable buzz around the town and credit is due to the operators for their achievements.  The same could be done in other ports if a free hand was given.  The Bill does not go far enough.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville mentioned the N69, but this should involve the road all the way to Tralee and from there to Tarbert, Foynes and back to Limerick and the development of the entire estuary area.  For years I have promoted the development of the north Kerry area in terms of transhipment, oil refinery and smelting, but the government has not given a commitment to install water facilities which are needed.  Approximately £22 million was required to dam the Smeala River and we were told Cohesion Funds would be made available to install a proper water supply and link the facilities to the estuary. However, it was a chicken and egg situation: which came first?</P>
    <P>Years ago, if and industry intended to set up an operation along the river, it was told the facilities would be made available.  However, in the market today the services must already be in place. Places with successful roll-on roll-off facilities prove this point.  Although it would be expensive, there is a need to run a natural gas line along the estuary. This would attract industry.  The Smeala River also needs to be dammed and the infrastructure in the area needs to be updated.  The N69 should be upgraded. If this is not done we may as well forget about the entire Shannon region.  If the proper funding is not available, proper development will not occur.</P>
    <P>The review group mentioned the names of the new ports, including the Shannon port.  However, Limerick <Col N="629" /> people are anxious that it is called the Shannon Estuary Authority.  The report states that the arrangements suggested would not affect the autonomous stature of the Foynes and Kilrush authorities. While I agree with that point, I also agree that the establishment of a north Kerry or Kerry estuary authority should be considered.  I will deal with the problems of the Waterford estuary, particularly regarding the New Ross Harbour, on Committee Stage.  The Bill is totally unfair in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated the main thrust of the Bill is to relax ministerial control while increasing accountability for operational and financial performance. While it is important an eye is kept on the ball regarding operational and financial performances, the Minister will be restricted in terms of examining borrowing requirements if this opening exists.  A Fine Gael Party or Labour Party Minister will not always be in office and Ministers may differ.  The Minister for the Marine should be responsible for decisions on applications from ports for developments, although I understand the Minister for the Marine may need to refer to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the ports development policies and the establishment of four ports.  He stated significant investment must be made in these ports by 1999.  Apart from the four large ports, where will areas such as the Shannon Estuary come in?  The removal of the béal bar has been discussed for many years.  This would be hugely expensive but would allow the entry of the largest ships in the world.  It also poses a difficulty in Money point, although the problem there has just about been surmounted.  Will moneys be made available for the removal of the béal bar from the £135 million mentioned by the Minister?  The Minister specifically mentioned the elimination of bottlenecks and this is definitely a bottleneck on the Shannon Estuary.</P>
    <P>Senator Calnan mentioned the other provisions in the Bill, including the measure to put Tralee and Fenit under <Col N="630" /> the control of Kerry County Council. Who will pay for this move?  Will the local authority pay for the running of the authority?  Will it be the port authority in Tralee?  If the Minister is putting Kerry County Council in charge in Tralee, why not also in Dingle, Tarbert or Kilrush?  Senator Calnan also mentioned the small ports along the Shannon Estuary.  Who will be responsible for maintaining the small ports within the jurisdiction of the new company the Minister intends to establish?</P>
    <P>A small pier was falling down in Tarbert for the last 30 years.  It was in a dangerous condition.  I made representations to the Department of the Marine, Kerry County Council, the Department of the Environment and others for funding to repair the pier, but everybody washed their hands of it.  Eventually, the local people got together and raised approximately £45,000 to restore the old pier.  It is located at the entrance to Kerry for the ferry and has enhanced and improved the entire area.  However, this work would not have been done but for the local people.  Who will be responsible for maintenance if another pier on the Shannon Estuary starts to fall apart?  Who will finance the upkeep of these items, such as in Fenit?  If Kerry County Council is to be given control, where will it get the money to do it?</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned designating Dingle harbour as a fishery harbour centre once the new legislation is in place.  Could that be put in place in one form or another while the legislation is going through?  The people of Dingle have sought this type of facility for many years.</P>
    <P>I support change and the introduction of a new Bill.  However, it is not strong enough and it contains inadequacies.  More could have been given and there is a conflict of interest between the Minister and the Minister for Finance. Enough power has not been given to the new bodies.  For example, the Minister intends to change the structure of the boards and increase the membership from eight to 12.  Three members of <Col N="631" /> local authorities will be allowed to sit on the boards and this is welcome. However, apart from the chief executive officer, from where will the other directors come since eight people may be appointed?  Will the Minister appoint people from the chambers of commerce or business interests?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann condemns the Government for its failure to introduce any adequate tactical or legislative measure to combat the twin scourges of drug trafficking and drug abuse in the country; and calls upon the Government to:</P>
      <P>(i) immediately bring forward legislation to implement measures announced by the Minister for Justice in the summer of 1995 to tackle drug trafficking;</P>
      <P>(ii) immediately bring forward proposals to tackle the drug problem in our prisons;</P>
      <P>(iii) immediately bring forward legislation to eliminate the consumption of drugs at clubs, pubs, discos and other premises;</P>
      <P>(iv) immediately discuss with the teaching unions the necessity for a drug awareness education programme in primary and second level schools; and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(v) adapt an intertwining approach to address the aforementioned <Col N="632" /> problems by establishing a National Drugs Forum to include all interested parties where positive proposals can be passed and subsequently introduced.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House to respond to this motion on the drugs crisis.  I ask the Minister to declare a national drugs emergency.  An emergency situation exists in relation to the trafficking, supply and abuse of drugs. This emergency is comparable, if not more serious, pervasive and threatening to the fabric of society to other emergencies the State has seen in the past.</P>
    <P>To emphasise the seriousness of the problem I wish to refer to statistics on the value of drug seizures by the Customs Service.  In 1992 the value was £11 million approximately, in 1993 £16.5 million and in 1994 the figure had fallen to £5.4 million.  However, for 1995 the figure is already £32 million and that amount will probably rise by the end of the year.  There has been a 600 per cent increase in the value of drug seizures over last year.</P>
    <P>I am told the value of drug seizures by the Garda Síochána drugs unit this year will be in excess of £170 million.  A large proportion of that figure is due to the large seizure at Urlingford, for which I compliment the Government and the Garda.  In 1994 the Garda drugs squad seizures were of the order of 5,379; the figure for this year will be approximately 6,600 &mdash; an increase of 24 per cent.  The positive aspect of the increases is that the Garda and Customs Service are to be praised and congratulated for the efficiency and thoroughness of their efforts on our behalf.</P>
    <P>The Minister should declare a national drugs emergency.  Having declared the emergency she should make all the resources of the State available to fight this scourge.  It is not just an Irish problem; it is international. If the Minister fails, refuses or neglects to declare a national drugs emergency I will have to ask why.  The Government's record this year on the drugs issue is problematic.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="633" /> It is amazing that under the Offences Against the State Act a person can be detained for 48 hours but under other laws the maximum period of detention is 20 hours &mdash; two six hour periods with an eight hour rest period.  Why is it that an alleged terrorist can be detained two and a half times longer than an ordinary criminal?  It is not good enough.</P>
    <P>Supplies of Ecstasy and cannabis are available throughout the country.  If the Minister will not declare a national drugs emergency I want to know why. There will have to be a sea change in attitudes and action in the face of this problem.  We need special powers of arrest and detention for the Garda.  We need more resources for the Garda, a change in the bail law and more prison spaces.  We need a comprehensive nationwide education and drug awareness programme in primary and secondary schools and at community level.  We need a national drugs forum as advocated by the leader of Fianna Fáil, Deputy Bertie Ahern, at the recent Árd Fheis.  We need a European coast guard service.  As a relatively small country we find it hard to finance the coast guard operation needed for our large coastline. What has the Minister done to promote a European coast guard service?</P>
    <P>The Minister will agree that the Government's response in terms of legislation has been inadequate.  When she announced in July of this year that she was to bring forward a criminal justice drug trafficking Bill she had the support of Fianna Fáil but it seems that her colleagues in the Labour Party and in Democratic Left were dragging their heels on this issue.  If the Minister is having problems with her partners in Government as regards bringing forward tough anti-drug trafficking measures, then she should listen to Deputy O'Donoghue and realise that she has the support of the Fianna Fáil Party.  It is not good enough that the Government's hands are tied by people who are not as dedicated to the fight against crime and drugs as they should be.</P>
    <P>The low point of this Government's fight against crime was the decision on <Col N="634" /> Castlereagh.  The Minister said the proposal was not cancelled but postponed. For how long has it been postponed? The Minister may be at odds with the Garda Commissioner.  The crime rate will soar because of a shortage of prison accommodation, the State's top law officer warned yesterday.  The grim prediction was made by Garda Commissioner Patrick Culligan who said millions of pounds must be channelled into the fight against crime if it is to be successful.</P>

      <P>It is taken from the <i>Irish Independent.</i> The Garda Commissioner gave an interview to its security editor, Mr. Tom Brady.</P>
      <P>The Minister said she is in favour of this prison and that it is needed.  Is provision made for this prison in next year's Estimate for the Department of Justice? Will it receive an allocation in the 1996 budget?  If not, will the Minister agree that her hands are tied to such an extent that her position as Minister for Justice is no longer tenable in those circumstances?</P>

      <P>Given that the Garda Commissioner has said that extra prison spaces are needed, what will be her response if no budgetary allocation is made for the prison in next year's budget?  The Government's position on this issue will be suspect if those extra prison places are not made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the past year Fianna Fáil has been constructive in the area of law and order.  The Minister was prepared to accept my amendments on the Criminal <Col N="635" /> Law (Incest Proceedings) (No.2) Bill, 1995; last week she was prepared to accept the Bill introduced by Deputy Eoin Ryan and Deputy O'Donoghue on sex tourism.  She said publicly that she was in favour of amending the law on bail.  If that is true, why did she not accept Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill to change the bail laws by way of amendment to the Constitution?</P>
    <P>The main issues at present are drug trafficking, prison places, bail and extra resources for the Garda Síochána. There may be marginally fewer members of the Garda Síochána today than there were on 1 January 1995.  The Minister has failed to secure the extra resources required to fight the crime wave and the increasing drugs problem. Parents are afraid that Ecstasy tablets are freely available at the night clubs their sons or daughters frequent.  A young girl died recently in Terenure; we will see more such incidents unless the Minister takes firm action.  The Government has failed so far.  We now need urgent action before the country is overrun by drugs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. New legislation has not been introduced in this area, yet crime is escalating.  It is now estimated that there are 300 crimes per day.  Nothing is being done about the drug barons.  They can be detained for two periods of six hours and an arrest period of eight hours.  We can only get information from Interpol after that length of time and then the prisoners may be released.</P>
      <P>Everyone knows Mountjoy Prison is overcrowded.  People who did not have drug problems when they were first imprisoned are now caught up in the drugs scene.  We do not have proper prison accommodation and a decision on Castlereagh has been postponed.  Crime is escalating, yet we have not tackled this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prevention should include education programmes in our schools.  I am a teacher and every week a drugs problem arises which requires the help of parents, <Col N="636" /> the junior liaison officer, the home school link and the social worker.  Yet there are no preventative measures in place.  I ask the Minister to adopt an integrated approach between the Department of Education, the Department of Justice, the Department of Health, the Department of Social Welfare and the various agencies.  There is no shortcut to resolving this problem. An integrated approach may help to stem the escalating drugs problem which is rampant in Dublin city and county and in rural areas.</P>
    <P>The north Dublin area is a model which should be used for every part of the country.  However, it is not functioning well at present because of a lack of resources.  Surely the resources which were needed to keep gardaí on duty along the Border could be used in this area now that the violence has stopped in the North?  Where is that money being spent?  I do not care where the money comes from, but it must be found to help in the fight against drugs.  The Department of Education, the Department of Health and the Department of Justice have a role to play.  Money must be pumped into this area.  Parents and teachers must be vigilant if we are to stop what is happening around our schools.</P>
    <P>Drugs are freely sold in nightclubs. Are club owners warned about this by the Garda?  Is there legislation to deal with this because club owners have a huge responsibility in this regard?  There is not enough pressure being applied in this area.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we should consider a European coast guard because we have such an open coastline.  I compliment the gardaí, the Naval Service and the Customs and Excise officials for their work in preventing the importation of drugs. However, we need more surveillance because of the nature of our country.  I ask the Minister to look at this area also. If we are short of gardaí, I see no reason why the Army cannot be used, because this is an emergency.</P>
    <P>In every residential area the parents are crying out for help, as the Minister <Col N="637" /> knows.  At every residents association meeting the first item on the agenda is the breakdown of law and order and the drug problem.  Are measures being introduced to combat the problem?  Can we introduce courses in the schools? Parents are calling on us to act but we seem unable to do anything.  The gardaí do not know what to do and there are not enough of them.  We need more vigilance and more gardaí on the beat.  It is becoming so serious that we must think about how we will solve it.</P>
    <P>Legislation is necessary and must be introduced now &mdash; we cannot wait any longer.  I ask the Minister to renew the prisons policy because Mountjoy is overcrowded.  People from all age groups are allowed out on bail and continue their old habits &mdash; keeping those people inside is the only measure which would stem the tide.  I compliment the Minister on the appointment of new judges but we need prevention and we must start now.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Seanad Éireann endorses the Government action on drug trafficking and drug abuse and, in particular:</P>
      <P>(i)  welcomes the Government's intention to introduce in this session a Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill which will allow for increased detention powers in drug trafficking cases and the issue of search warrants by members of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of superintendent in such cases;</P>
      <P>(ii)  welcomes the proposed assignment of powers of search, seizure and arrest to naval officers;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(iii)  welcomes the setting up of the National Drugs Unit under the operational control of a <Col N="638" /> Deputy Commissioner with overall responsibility for drugs law enforcement by the Garda Síochána;</P>
    <P>(iv)  commends the Garda Síochána, the Customs and the Naval Service on the huge seizure of drugs in Urlingford and other recent successes reflecting the improved co-operation between the law enforcement agencies;</P>
    <P>(v)  notes that a review is being carried out by the Minister for Justice of the law in relation to renewal of licences of premises where the sale and/or misuse of drugs is suspected including an examination of systems of control for unlicensed premises where drug sale and/or abuse is suspected;</P>
    <P>(vi)  recognises that the Minister for Justice has taken a series of concrete measures to tackle the drug problem in prisons, focusing in particular on (a) control and prevention measures, (b) treatment of addiction problems among inmates, and (c) a comprehensive prisoner education programme which highlights in particular, the risk of contracting communicable diseases, including HIV and hepatitis C, from drug abuse;</P>
    <P>(vii)  notes that the Minister for Health will be bringing forward proposals before the end of the year in relation to the care and treatment of drug abusers and demand reduction measures;</P>
    <P>(viii)  welcomes the proposed Government awareness and information campaign on drugs; and</P>
    <P>(ix)  notes the fact that a substance abuse awareness programme is at present being implemented in second level schools and that plans are in train <Col N="639" /> to introduce a like programme on substance abuse awareness in primary schools at the beginning of the 1996-97 school year.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister for Justice and congratulate her because this is the second time in the lifetime of the Government that she has come here to discuss this issue.  The Minister for Health has also been here and it is important that we take every opportunity to discuss the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that the nature and extent of the drug problem in Ireland is worse than it has ever been. Not only is drug abuse a serious problem in urban areas, some drugs are freely available throughout rural Ireland.  This did not begin today or yesterday, it has been developing over a number of years. I remind the Senators opposite that the Minister inherited a deteriorating drug situation and has endeavoured to tackle it.  I congratulate her on trying to come to grips with the most serious problem facing Irish society.  If it is not controlled it will threaten the existence of society as we know it.  I welcome the measures to combat drug abuse as announced by the Minister and commend her series of legislative, financial, operational and organisational measures designed to combat drug trafficking with a multifaceted approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These major initiatives &mdash; tough measures, but ones which are balanced and justified &mdash; will enable the Government to wage an all out war against the drug scourge, when allied to the measures being prepared to the Department of Health and the Department of Education, both of which have a big role to play.  At the Fine Gael conference on drugs on 21 October, Fr. Seán Cassin, who deals with drug addicts daily, outlined the other side of the problem &mdash; the need to deal not alone with the supply but the demand side, those who take <Col N="640" /> drugs.  This area must be examined much more deeply and I am pleased the Department of Education and the Department of Health are taking these steps.</P>
    <P>One of the key measures introduced by this Minister was the establishment of a new Garda drugs unit under the overall responsibility of a Deputy Commissioner. In September the Government decided this unit would be further augmented by an officer at chief superintendent level.  To underline the importance the Government attaches to the drug problem the Minister has agreed with the Garda Commissioner that the Deputy Commissioner, Mr. Patrick Byrne, is to be given direct responsibility for all Garda drug measures throughout the country.  I am glad the Deputy Commissioner will be given overall responsibility for implementation of the wide-ranging Garda measures approved by the Government in July.  The Government has also decided that systematic reports of the work of the new structures and of implementation of the new measures will be made directly to the Minister for Justice.  These Government decisions will strengthen the Garda's hand against drugs and will facilitate implementation of the wide-ranging package introduced by the Government.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the Minister's intention to introduce new powers enabling gardaí to shut down raves and discos where Ecstasy is being sold.  She will repeal the law preventing undercover gardaí mounting surveillance operations in clubs and dancehalls.  This is part of the campaign to clamp down on the growing acceptability of Ecstasy among young people.  The recent deaths in clubs following the taking of Ecstasy highlights the absolute necessity of reform in this area.</P>
    <P>The new legislation will make it far easier for senior officers to object to licences of clubs where Ecstasy and heroin are being peddled.  It is unacceptable that at present the force can only object to dancehall licences once a year, in September.  The Minster proposes that <Col N="641" /> they could object at any time when they suspect drugs are being sold.  The Public Dance Halls Act, 1935, is inadequate, totally outdated and prevents Garda chiefs placing young undercover detectives in dancehalls where they suspect drugs are being sold &mdash; they are only allowed place uniformed officers in public dancehalls under the Act.  After the change in the law, drug squad detectives will have the authority to enter and search licensed venues, whereas currently they have few powers.</P>
    <P>Drug abuse has scorched its way to the top of the political and community agenda, with the avalanche of Ecstasy tablets into every nook and cranny of the country.  Such is the level of use of this drug, it has assumed a grotesque normality in the teenage disco scene.  It is a difficult drug to police in that it is easily concealed and there are no telling signs such as syringes or smoke scents. Nevertheless, it is a killer.  Death from Ecstasy is an awful end.  In certain quantities the drug can rupture organs, causing massive internal bleeding.  While the number of deaths has not been huge &mdash; not that even one death is acceptable &mdash; the long term effects are unknown.  Will many of today's Ecstasy users be afflicted with chronic medical conditions in their mid-twenties as a result of their present habits?</P>
    <P>The drug culture threatens to undermine Irish and western society.  More than 80 per cent of crime in the Dublin area can be linked directly to drugs and 80 per cent of prisoners are in jail for drug related offences.  It is unacceptable that a young addict who still has the will and determination to reclaim health and peace has to wait for up to eight weeks to get on a detoxification programme in Dublin &mdash; Fr. Cassin made this point forcefully at our conference.  These facilities should be available to encourage and assist everybody who wants to cure our drug dependency problem and to allow people to return to being productive members of society.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to an Adjournment matter which I raised in this House on <Col N="642" /> 28 March 1990, when I asked the then Minister for Justice to ensure that all the necessary preparations were put in order to prepare for the policing implications of open borders post 1992.  I stated that:</P>
    <P>Less thought or action is being devoted to the possibilities open for international crime, especially in the area of drug trafficking.  In the light of the massive increase in international criminal activity, drug trafficking, terrorist activities and so on, it is important that the police forces of Europe integrate into a cohesive unit which will have adequate resources to carry out detailed research into the problem and formulate laws and strategies to combat it.</P>
    <P>I said that to the Minister on 28 March 1990, and nobody, including the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, listened.  This Minister is listening now, and I congratulate her.</P>

      <P>The Minister will see from the wording of the motion, as well as the Senators' contributions, that this matter is taken very seriously by the House, as it is by the Minister and everybody in the country.  My remarks will focus on one drug in particular, which has been mentioned by all previous speakers, which is the drug Ecstasy.  Some seriously erroneous statements have been made by student bodies regarding the safety measures which can be taken in regard to the use of the drug.  There is no safe dose of Ecstasy.  The increased consumption of the drug in this country is most unwelcome and, while a whole culture is involved, I would like to deal with the drug itself first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Members may have seen Professor Des Corrigan of the school of pharmacology in Trinity College, Dublin, on &ldquo;Crimeline&rdquo; a few weeks ago. They will realise, having listened to him, how essential it is that more information is disseminated regarding the danger of <Col N="643" /> this drug.  Deaths have taken place all over the country, but still student bodies are advising those who may try it to take half a tablet first.  This is the greatest nonsense.  There is absolutely no pharmacological basis for saying if one takes half a tablet that double the dose will only have twice the effect &mdash; it could have ten times the effect.  We have no idea what the half tablet may do in the first place.</P>
    <P>For a start, these people who are giving such advice have no knowledge of what amount of MDMA &mdash; that is, methylene-dioxane-metho-ampheta-mine &mdash; is in each tablet.  Is it 75, 100 or 200 milligrammes?  Is there a source of production of which they know?  What contaminants are in the drugs?  We know that there was heroin and cocaine in Ecstasy tablets from which one young woman died recently.  They say that MDEA &mdash; that is, methylene-dioxaneethyl-amphetamine &mdash; may be of less consequence if it is taken.  How do they know that?  What toxicity tests are they quoting?  One form is as dangerous as another.  Anyone who says that the pure compound on its own is less dangerous is wrong.</P>
    <P>We know something about the short term effects of these drugs.  We know that people develop hyperpyrexia &mdash; very high temperatures &mdash; which is increased by the temperature within the rave venue itself, which is often an enclosed area, and also by the rise in body temperature from constant dancing, and that people die of heat stroke. We have had numerous cases of this happening in this country already. However, to suggest that heat stroke can be prevented by those taking the drug drinking enough water and avoiding alcohol is wrong.  Death has also been caused by heart and asthmatic attacks.  I am talking about cases which have occurred in this country.  For example, I read today the report of a young man who died in Cork from multiple organ failure.  There is no such thing as the safe use of Ecstasy because we have no idea of the long-term effects <Col N="644" /> since the drug has never been used medically.  There are no toxicological studies of the effects of the drug on humans.  We know from animal experiments that it is a neurotoxic drug which affects the brain.  However, the young people taking these drugs are human guinea pigs.</P>
    <P>Serotonin and dopamine are released from the brain shortly after Ecstasy is taken.  These are the enzymes which give a feeling of elation within the body. However, very shortly after that, when the serotonin and dopamine are used up in the brain, there is a terrible feeling of depression.  How important a factor has this feeling of depression been in the increase of suicide among young men, in particular?  How important is it in the increase of psychiatric disease among our young people?  Are studies being done to see how much drugs have been involved in the increase of suicide and psychiatric disease among the young?  There is a huge mobilisation of energy when people take Ecstasy but very shortly afterwards there is a terrible depletion of energy. The two parts of the person's life &mdash; when they are on and off Ecstasy &mdash; becomes totally dissociated and they are like two different people.</P>
    <P>I wish I could agree with Senators that this problem can be solved by putting a criminal justice law into effect, but it cannot.  Sadly, there is a whole culture involved.  While the Garda can do something about the area of drug trafficking and so forth, we have to look at the culture involved in the use of this drug.  In the past we studied the association of social deprivation with heroin use, but we have to look at the use of Ecstasy in a different way.  There is a culture of acceleration in the world at the moment.  If there is an acceleration in the field of work, why should the young not feel that there should be an acceleration in the field of play as well? Why should it not be faster and more intense?</P>
    <P>Young people involved with this drug talk about a virtual reality.  They become involved with techno music where fast rhythms and beats are much <Col N="645" /> more important than harmonies or melodies. The whole idea is to create a new rhythm to one's life.  They talk about cyberspace, a fifth dimension in which one can do anything and where reality is replaced by fantasy.  We have to remember the flower power culture which was associated with cannabis in the 1960s and realise that we now have to cope with a whole culture associated with Ecstasy in the 1990s.  It has a style, clothing, music and advertising slogans of its own.  All the raves give a great sense of belonging and bonding which is incredibly important to those involved. While the dancers may be separate while they are dancing, there is an incredible fellow feeling that they are there in the same spirit.  It reminds me very much of the flower power culture of the 1960s.</P>
    <P>The UN has proposed a major global conference &mdash; because this is a global problem &mdash; on the problem of drugs in 1998.  While it may seem very hard to believe that it is so far away, these conferences take a long time to plan. Although I have doubts about the value of these large conferences, what are we doing to prepare for it and what Departments are involved?  There is no good in just consulting the Garda, probation officers, schools, teachers' unions and the medical profession &mdash; are we also trying to involve those within the culture?</P>
    <P>In order to defeat this we need to get advice from those within the culture themselves.  After a certain length of time, many of them want to come out of that culture.  We have to look at our own society and see how much we are doing which supports rather than suppresses the drug culture.  Drug trafficking is big business.  Ecstasy is widely available here, as it is made here as well as imported, and costs only £5 a tablet.  It is not possible for the Garda alone to solve this problem.</P>
    <P>Our in-patient facilities are grossly inadequate to deal with people detoxifying. If one wants to come off drugs it is almost impossible as one has to queue up to do so.  It is not just the Department <Col N="646" /> of Health which can do something about this &mdash; the public will have to realise that satellite clinics have to be set up.  The chorus of &ldquo;not in my backyard&rdquo; will do no good because drugs are everywhere.  If people want to get drugs out of their area they will have to accept that clinics have to be set up for local addicts.  People are on drugs for about five years before they take any interest in getting off them and I urge people to allow these clinics to be set up in their areas.  Information is needed, as previous speakers said, but it is not just needed in schools but for all our young people and their parents.</P>

      <P>In seconding the amendment, I welcome the opportunity to debate yet again the issue which concerns all of us.</P>
      <P>During his contribution, Senator Mulcahy referred to the Labour Party and the fact that its members are not perturbed about the crime or drugs problem. For someone with legal training, the Senator should know that he cannot make such unwarranted and unsubstantiated allegations.  I wish to state, once and for all, that the Labour Party and its members are as concerned about drugs and crime as the Senator or anyone else.  Nobody has a monopoly on such interests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Throughout the years the Labour Party has been active at local and national level in tackling this problem while many previous Fianna Fáil Ministers for Justice disregarded it and the present Minister has been forced to deal with it.  It is not acceptable that Senator Mulcahy should make such grossly inaccurate and base comments, about a particular political party which his is unable to substantiate.  I have had my fill of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is undisputed that all Members are concerned about the seriousness of this problem.  Drugs wreck lives.  They wreck <Col N="647" /> the lives of addicts, their families and the community as a whole.  Drugs endanger society and this problem needs to be addressed.  However, the drug problem did occur overnight; it is not the sole responsibility of the Minister for Justice.  It is our responsibility as citizens to do what we can to counteract the evil drugs represent to society.  The Minister's proposals are all embracing and most welcome.  The fact that she had no difficulty in having those proposals approved in Cabinet by Labour Ministers shows the concern of my party on this issue.</P>
    <P>The hands of the Garda have been tied in relation to tackling the escalating problem of drug abuse.  It is time legislation in this area was reviewed.  It does not help that people suspected of selling drugs cannot be arrested.  It does not help that such people can be detained and released when the Garda Síochána know they have drugs concealed on their persons.  These practicalities must be tackled. and the Minister is doing so in the proposed legislation.  I am satisfied, from inquiries I have made, that individual matters of law &mdash; in terms of necessary changes &mdash; are being introduced.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Henry that this is an all embracing problem.  We need to consider the issue of education and the fact that so many parents are unaware of their children's actions. Many parents are unaware of the problems and symptoms relating to drug abuse.  It would be helpful if an all embracing programme were launched to allow parents to become aware of the problem in their locality.  This has occurred on a voluntary basis throughout the community.  A drug awareness seminar took place in my home town of Castleblayney last week.  People throughout the country are becoming personally interested in this issue.  Whatever the laws of the country, if people in the family home are unaware of the problem and are not in a position to identify it, we will lose the battle against drugs.  The battle will be won or lost in <Col N="648" /> the home.  It is very important to educate parents in relation to this issue and any measures required in that regard will have my party's and my support.</P>
    <P>People seem believe that once drug abusers are removed from the streets and placed in a methadone treatment programme that is the end of the matter. I find it ironic that the same people voicing the need for concern and the introduction of new laws in this area recently objected to the introduction of the community programme to a centre in Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator does not want it on his own doorstep but is quite prepared to criticise others.  I am annoyed by the hypocrisy in relation to this problem.  If the problem is to be dealt with seriously, it must be recognised that if drug abusers &mdash; who themselves are victims &mdash; are ever to recover from their addiction, they need help in a very practical way.  The establishment of a centre some distance from their place of residence is of no use to them. We should be serious about how we deal with this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In terms of what has been done in tackling the laws on drug control and drug trafficking, one thing has been overlooked.  With regard to those who gain from the sale of drugs, drug barons and traffickers, laws should be introduced to aid the Garda Síochána to arrest, detain and convict such people. That deals with one part of the problem. However, another means of attack would be to examine the income and lifestyles of those drug barons.  These people are obviously living above their official means.  One way to tackle the problem would be to give the Revenue Commissioners power to investigate how such people obtain their income. <Col N="649" /> This would hit them where it hurts, namely, in their pockets.  This area requires further examination because people in legal circles &mdash; particularly in County Cork &mdash; dealing with the drug problem have identified it as a possible source by which that problem can be tackled.  Further investigation is warranted.</P>
    <P>A co-ordinated approach to the problem is required.  The introduction of new laws is required to enable the Garda Síochána, Customs officers and the Naval Service to arrest people suspected of smuggling drugs.  That is what the Minister proposes to do and it is very welcome.  This move is long overdue but, to the Minister's credit, she is doing it.  When those laws have been introduced &mdash; they have the support of the Garda Commissioner and others involved in tackling the problem &mdash; a serious effort will be made by all concerned to reduce the problem.  It is a serious problem and tackling it is not a simple matter of placing laws on the Statute Book.  The laws will only control the availability of drugs, they will never be able to tackle the increased demand for drugs.  Until people are educated about the reality of drug addiction and its consequences, we will face an ongoing problem.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Government's intention to tackle this problem and I give it my full support.</P>

      <P>I welcome this timely debate.  Members are again afforded an opportunity to speak about the crisis in crime, drug abuse and drug trafficking. I do not like to criticise people, but I issued a statement last week in which I stated that the Minister was incompetent and did not enjoy the support of her Cabinet colleagues.  I stated that when decisions were made she was not consulted.  I had hoped that she would <Col N="650" /> come into this House and announce that more prison places and more resources would be made available to the Garda Síochána and the Naval and Customs Services.  However, nothing has been forthcoming.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>It is ludicrous and sad for her to say that she is adding her weight in the fight against drugs and drug importation.  This Government has been factual in what it said in the past but has done nothing about the problem. I listened with interest to the Senators opposite and to all the promises which have been made, yet no new legislation or any form of criminal code whatsoever has come into this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>This House does not sit regularly because we have nothing to debate.  There is no policy or initiative coming from this Government.  That is why we are debating the issue of crime which has escalated out of control.  No new resources have been deployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="651" /> The Minister might like to take a note of a few simple matters.  There is one sniffer dog to detect all the drugs which come through Dublin Airport; he must work 24 hours per day.  Can the Minister seriously tell this House the Government is providing adequate resources to ensure children can be reared in an environment where drugs are not freely available and old people can walk the street, sleep in their beds and feel they are safe in their homes?  That is what the Minister is presiding over.  That is what this Government has presided over for the last 12 months.  Issues and policies are not worth the paper on which they are written if the Minister does not have the ability to deliver at the Cabinet table.</P>
    <P>Let us take the Castlerea project and the delay in the building of prison spaces.  It has already been outlined by my colleagues that this project was badly needed and that the funding should have been made available at the earliest possible opportunity.  Yet, when Minister Owen was out, her Cabinet colleagues decided they could save this money and spend it elsewhere.  I sincerely hope the Minister stays at the Cabinet table from here on out for fear her budget is not cut further and we are left with fewer gardaí, customs officials, prison spaces and more crime.</P>
    <P>Let us look at ordinary everyday life in Cork.  A young person went into a night-club and was able to take four Ecstasy tablets and die.  That is how bad this situation has become.  We have had deaths in Ireland as a result of Ecstasy tablets; yet there is only one dog in Dublin Airport for drug detection in the largest airport in the country.  There are 12 people working in the drugs squad in Cork, the second city of the country. Like the dog, they must also work 24 hours per day.  These are the facts.</P>
    <P>This Government has failed miserably and it will be held accountable, not by me but by the tens of thousands of people who are victims of crime every year, a number which is escalating at a rapid rate.  The Minister <Col N="652" /> should take into account what we have said when she makes her contribution and should not give us more empty rhetoric in this House about crime, law and order and the ability of the Fine Gael Party in Government to ensure the safety of the people of this country.</P>

      <P>One serious crime every five minutes.  Something must be done. I have a number of suggestions for the Minister.  First, surely the Department of Justice can hire more than one dog? Another dog at Rosslare was kidnapped and they could not sniff anything until they got it back.  This is ridiculous.  It is absolute insanity.  I am not blaming the Minister.  She has the power, she is an intelligent women and she could put matters right if she just put her mind to it.  She has a month or two left before the end of the year.  One in 14 houses in the Dublin area have been burgled and people are mugged.  The amount of money stolen every year by some of <Col N="653" /> these drug addicts is phenomenal.  The Minister knows it as well as I do.</P>
      <P>Second, the Minister should get in touch with the Department of Defence. We all know who these drug barons are. Their names are printed in the newspapers and they are talked about.  I suggest the Minister gets the Irish Rangers to round them up, hang them up by the thumbs, leave them there and never go near them again.  The next time a drug baron surfaces, do the same thing.  No court case.  No trial.  Leave them up there because kids are dying out in the streets.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I am Minister for Justice, that something real and effective is being done.  The first drug did not come into this country on 16 December 1994, the first prisoner was not put into prison on that date and, sadly, the first person who died from drugs did not die since 16 December 1994.  The irresponsibility of the kind of debate which Senators are conducting here today worries me, quite frankly, because this is a problem which all of us have to tackle together.  Making grossly inaccurate political points is not going to help.  If Fianna Fáil returns to Government, I hope the Opposition parties in this House and in the other House will assist Fianna Fáil in the job which has to be done for society, not just for the Fine Gael, Labour or Democratic Left people but for the Senators' children, my children and everybody else's children in this country.  I urge Senators to be less political in their statements and a little more practical and realistic. Senators need have no worries about my partners in Government and their resolve to tackle this problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>In his preparation for this debate, Senator Mulcahy has clearly not had an opportunity, despite the fact that I think it is part of his portfolio, to read some of my speeches.  I will be happy to provide Senator Mulcahy with a bound anthology, if necessary, of my best speeches so he will understand why I have taken some of the actions I took in the other House.  I will be happy to let him have that as soon as I can get a binder to put it together.  I will put it in big writing so he can understand everything I said in the other House; why I did not accept some of Fianna Fáil's legislation and why I have accepted other parts of it.  Perhaps he would do his portfolio the honour of reading my remarks and he will understand.  It is easy to come into this House and other <Col N="655" /> places and use the expression &ldquo;declare a national emergency&rdquo;.  I am sure it is a grand headline for the newspapers &mdash; although I do not see much of the media here tonight &mdash; 98 FM, FM 104 and all the other radio stations which are heard in the Senator's constituency.  But calling for a national emergency will not move us one step further, although the Senator knows full well that that kind of expression will catch a headline.  I am taking real and effective actions, which, quite frankly, should have been taken long before now, to tackle the drug problem in this country; but that did not happen.</P>
      <P>I remind the Senators who are being so critical of this Government, and this Minister in particular, that even if Fianna Fáil had not been in Government for the last seven years, Fianna Fáil has been in Government for far more years since the foundation of this State and the drugs problem did not build up just in the last year of two.  I thank Senator Lydon.  I know he knows me a little better than some of the others.  I thank him for complimenting me on my intelligence.  It is a great comfort for me to know that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe not, but I will take a compliment from wherever it comes.  I will not look a gift horse in the mouth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year the problem of drugs was enormous.  From the fact that there were fewer drug finds last year Senator Mulcahy somehow drew the correlation that Fianna Fáil must take credit for that.  On the contrary, the fact that so many drugs were found this year is a clear indication of the more effective policies adopted by myself and other Ministers and the bodies under our control. The Senator's argument is absolute nonsense.  I remind him that last year the previous Government did not introduce any specific legislation aimed at <Col N="656" /> drug trafficking.  The Criminal Justice Act, 1994, contained provisions to deal with money laundering which will target the people making money through drug trafficking and other crime.  However, the effective targeted sections of the Act did not come into operation until I signed them into force during my term of office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>A hundred days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>They were not brought into effect while the Senator's party was in Government and Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn was Minister for Justice. The Senator should focus the criticism where it is due rather than where he thinks it is due.  Much of what I heard tonight is actually self criticism.  The figures quoted in most cases refer to 1994, when a member of the Senator's own party was Minister for Justice.  I have not read my script as I intended because it is better to respond to the debate and some of the inaccuracies.</P>
      <P>The most basic analysis of the problem reveals that drug abuse generates a great deal of crime.  We all know that drug related crime distorts the criminal justice system and ties up vast resources which could be used more productively elsewhere.  Since I became Minister I have accorded priority status to tackling the drugs problem, not because I think it has only just started but because I realise that there has not been enough co-ordinated effort between a number of Departments and institutions&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>The Departments of Finance and Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to tackle it.  People who take drugs do not just come within the justice system, as Senator Henry said.  I did not hear that mentioned by any of the speakers on my immediate right.  It is tragic to think of the waste of promise and potential which is caused by drugs in our society.  I do not need anybody to tell me that drug traffickers are waging a war on Irish society; the casualties are there to be seen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="657" /> The dimensions of the problem can be seen by the record amounts of drugs seized this year.  Some 2,000 Ecstasy tablets were seized in 1993, while 28,000 were seized in 1994 and, so far this year, 185,000 have been seized by effective and targeted police work, Customs work and the work of all the other agencies involved.  Some 1,284 grams of heroin were seized in 1993.  By the following year this had jumped to 4,650 grams and, so far this year, nearly 2,000 grams have been seized.  This last figure only takes into account the amount which has been analysed in the forensic science laboratory to date.  When all of the seizures have been analysed this figure will be undoubtedly be greater.</P>
    <P>Overall, by the end of October the Garda made 5,623 drug seizures, representing a 23 per cent increase over the same period last year.  That is excellent work, because those drugs are being seized and taken out of the system.  The more the Garda can seize and take out of the system, the more safeguards there are for our young people who are taking these drugs.  I am not taking the drugs and nobody else in this House is taking the drugs.  The young people in this community are taking the drugs and nobody is being forced to take them.</P>
    <P>Until society matures and realises that we, as parents and adults in this community, have a responsibility to get across the damage caused by drugs, we will only be picking at the edges of this problem.  We all have to share the responsibility, not just me as Minister or each of us as Senators or Deputies.  I will keep saying that until we all take responsibility.  I alone as Minister for the Justice or the Garda on their own will not tackle this problem.  The gardaí are not taking the drugs.  Young and not so young people are swallowing, shooting, smoking and taking these drugs. They are not aliens from some other country but our very own people.</P>
    <P>I want to give a special mention to the recent successful joint operation which resulted from the co-ordinated approach taken by myself and other Ministers to fight the drug problem and <Col N="658" /> drug trafficking.  The seizure of 15 tonnes of cannabis at Urlingford in County Kilkenny was a superb example of this co-ordination.  It was the largest seizure in the history of the State and is a measure of how hard the law enforcement agencies are hitting the drug traffickers. Everyone will agree that the Garda, the Customs and the Naval Service personnel involved in the operation deserve our thanks.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelleher mentioned Castletownbere. Perhaps he would take that issue up with the Minister for Finance and find out the real information.  I did not remove the Customs officers or seek to remove the Customs officers.</P>

Why were they not co-operating more effectively before now?  They have been co-operating since this Minister and others took control.</P>

      <P>We have examined the scale of the problem, but what of the people who organise this evil trade?  The blunt answer is that the people who seek to control the drugs trade will use all available means to defend their interest and protect their profits.  We have seen examples of that in recent times.  In dealing with such people the law must be enforced in a rigorous manner. We, as legislators, must ensure that <Col N="659" /> those we entrust with that job &mdash; the Garda, the Customs and the Defence Forces &mdash; have the required resources.</P>

Measures to tackle the demand for drugs, to which a number of Senators have referred, were also included.  They constitute a measured and serious response to a serious problem and not a knee jerk reaction.</P>
      <P>I am a politician, too, and we can all come up with wonderful, catchy phrases.  However, I must deliver a considered, measured, appropriate response to the problem.  I will not give up on that job just because somebody tries to belittle me or tell me I am unintelligent or incompetent.</P>

      <P>There is a thread running through the measures which recognises the need for a new approach to tackle the drug problem on a multi-agency <Col N="660" /> basis.  There have been approaches in the past which have not tackled the problem and that is why I am moving to multi-agency support.  I am glad to get support from wise Members such as Senators Henry, Gallagher and Neville because each of them talked about the need for a multi-agency approach.</P>

It is important that people who succumb to the abuse of drugs get treatment.  This is all part of the multi-agency approach on which I and other Ministers are working.  We cannot overemphasise that message.</P>
      <P>Success in the fight against drugs will rest on how effectively we tackle both the demand and supply of drugs.  I want to refer to the measures approved by Government, many of which have already been put in place and the results of which we saw in the Urlingford find.

      <P>I will ensure that Senators get a copy of my statement to the newspapers yesterday.  Another measure that the Government has approved and that is now being put is in place is a closer working relationship between Customs, gardaí and the Naval Service.  Do not ask me why this was not done previously.  It is now being done. An additional measure is a closer working relationship between the Revenue Commissioners and the Garda.  Again, do not ask me why they have not been working more closely together, but it is going to happen, and is happening now. They are preparing a review of the recommendations by the Law Reform Commission, which will be included and incorporated in the Finance Act, 1996.</P>
      <P>The Government also agreed to the setting up of the Garda National Drugs Unit.  We saw the effects of this national unit the week before last.  It is now operating under a Deputy Commissioner and a chief superintendent and it includes a number of the best minds and brains and operational people in the Garda, who have been brought together to ensure that there is a co-ordinated and effective targeting of the drugs traffickers in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reconstitution of the national co-ordinating committee under the chairmanship of the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy O'Shea. is in the process of being set up.  All the relevant Departments and agencies, including agencies that work on the <Col N="662" /> ground outside, have been written to requesting them to put forward their nominations.  Once received, these nominations will reactivate the committee. Reducing the demand for drugs can only be done by a co-ordinated and integrated approach.</P>
    <P>The introduction of drugs strategy teams under this co-ordinating committee, in Cork, Limerick, Dublin, Galway and Waterford to start with, will comprise representatives of the Garda, the Probation and Welfare Service, the Prison Service, the health boards, the Department of Education, local authorities and, for the first time, the local community.  These will work with the Garda to ensure that this kind of co-ordination can continue.  The Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill was approved by the Government yesterday and is now with the parliamentary draftsman.</P>
    <P>The legislation deals with three issues.  First, it will contain greatly increased detention powers in drug trafficking cases.  Second, Garda superintendents will be given power to issue search warrants in certain circumstances in drug cases.  Third, Customs officers will be allowed to be present when drug traffickers are being questioned by the gardaí.  Under the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, I will, by regulation, extend the power of search, seizure and arrest to Naval officers.</P>
    <P>Public house and dance hall licences have been referred to.  The relevant Act was introduced in 1935 &mdash; it was not today or yesterday that rave discos started.  I am now reviewing the Act.  Let me say to anybody in the House whose party has been in Government for a number of years, that huge changes took place in the dancing culture long before I became Minister.  Why did not somebody who is so active here today, especially somebody like Senator Mulcahy who is nearer the age of the clientele who go to raves than I &mdash; I am 50 years of age &mdash; not ask his party to do something a few years ago when he saw what was happening in discos and rave discos?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>No, he is not.  I am doing it now but it should have been done a long time ago.  I am examining this law to bring about the necessary changes, concentrating on the question of whether the power of the Garda to object to the renewal of public houses and dance hall licences where there has been a sale or misuse of drugs on the premises is adequate.  I do not believe it is.  Even where the gardaí object successfully we must ensure that drugs cannot be sold or misused again on those premises.</P>
      <P>As public representatives we must examine our consciences as to how many times we have been told by constituents that drugs are being sold in our own local favourite clubs and dance halls, but dare anybody go to the Garda and dare any public representatives or our constituents stand up in the courts and demand that a licence be withdrawn so that a pub will by closed.  Why?  It is because the pub is an economically viable entity in our community and we do not wish to be seen to be closing it down.  We must examine our own consciences as to whether we effectively use our power as members of communities to ensure that the pubs and dance halls in our areas are not misusing or abusing drugs or allowing them to be sold.</P>
      <P>The review will also investigate the supervisory role of the Garda in public dance halls.  Most people do not realise that the only way the Garda can gain entry into dance halls and discos is either in uniform or, if they are in plain clothes, through producing a warrant.  If one goes to the door and produces a warrant, the network is set in motion, for example, in the activation of mobile phones.</P>

      <P>The maximum penalty for holding unlicensed dances on a recurring basis is a mere £10.  The problems with regard to access to premises will be largely addressed in the new search warrants provision in the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill to which I referred earlier, but this review will examine whether more needs to be done.</P>
      <P>A successful clamp-down on drug sales or drug misuse at licensed dances may lead to a proliferation of rave parties. Since these are organised for locations not identified in advance it is difficult to prevent them.  The review will address the problem and come up with solutions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I know Senator Roche will read my script.  I am not worried that I will be unable to finish it as I circulated copies.  The issue of drugs in prison is of concern to people.  It does not concern them all the time.  Sometimes the attitude is to lock up people, throw away the key and it does not matter if they damage or kill themselves with drugs.  However, there are many caring people in the House and elsewhere who want the issue of drugs in prison tackled.  I am doing this.</P>
      <P>For the first time a number of measures have been taken in our prisons to eliminate drugs coming into prisons. With regard to the erection of a net over the main exercise yard in Cork Prison to prevent drugs being thrown into the yard from outside, the Governor told me that his simple measure had almost eliminated drugs from the prison.  I was laughed out of court by the other side in the Dáil when Deputies learnt of this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other measures to eliminate drugs from prisons include the fitting out of a special search room in Mountjoy Prison to facilitate thorough searching of selected prisoners coming off visits, the updating of the closed circuit television monitoring of visits, which is happening now under my Ministry, and replacement with a one foot high perspex barrier of the divider between inmate and prisoner in the main visiting room. While this barrier does not stop physical contact between the prisoner and the visitor &mdash; if it did most people would regard it as inhumane &mdash; it makes it easier for supervising staff to detect the <Col N="666" /> passing of contraband.  Approval has been given in principle for the expansion of prison visiting facilities in Mountjoy to further improve the capacity of the prison staff to monitor visits.  There has been a general increase in the intensity and frequency of searches for drugs.  In Mountjoy Prison alone drug seizures are running at between three and four per day and three outside visitors &mdash; perhaps the parents, girlfriends or other family members of prisoners &mdash; have been arrested at the prison on drugs charges in the past two weeks.</P>
    <P>Arrangements which will enable individuals who were availing of a recognised methadone maintenance programme prior to committal to prison to continue to receive such programmes following committal are at an advanced stage of preparation.  I am glad this is the case.  I want to emphasise, however, that the prescription of methadone is in every case a matter for a medical practitioner and that strict medical and other criteria must govern any such arrangements.</P>
    <P>At present drug addicted prisoners may avail of limited detoxification programmes. I am preparing proposals which will provide for the creation of a detoxification facility in the medical care unit in Mountjoy and the establishment of a secure drug free unit for prisoners who opt to go off drugs so that they can be away from the temptation of drugs being handed to them by other prisoners.  These facilities will be put in place as soon as practicable and will enable the prison authorities to accommodate those prisoners who do not have a background of drug abuse or who have decided to opt out of drugs in a totally drug free environment within the prison.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, 40 per cent of prisoners who enter Mountjoy have already been drug abusers in the community. The prison is first and foremost a place of detention; it is not an Eastern Health Board extension clinic.  As Minister for Justice, I am satisfied it is appropriate and humane to use the time <Col N="667" /> people are in prison to help them to give up this habit so that when they are released they do not return to a life of crime.  However, we must never forget that a prison is a place of detention for people who have committed crimes.  I will provide whatever resources I can to make sure there are effective treatment facilities in the prison; but, by and large, treatment should be provided to people in the community.</P>
    <P>With regard to demand reduction education, there are proposals in place in the Department of Education for a substance abuse prevention programme. A total of 482 teachers were trained on 26 training courses organised by the end of the school year 1994-95, when approximately 50 per cent of schools had begun to use the programme.  A further 15 training programmes for 230 teachers have already commenced in this school year and the target is to complete the dissemination to all second level schools by the end of the school year.  The programme has been well received by schools.</P>
    <P>At primary level it is proposed to launch a substance abuse awareness programme in all schools during the school year 1995-96, consisting of a seminar in each school area organised by school management boards for teachers, parents, representatives of the community and voluntary organisations and which will involve the Garda Síochána and health board personnel.  The purpose of these seminars will be to heighten the awareness of teachers, parents and the community in general of the dangers of substance abuse and to prevent primary school children from becoming involved in substance abuse. Who would have thought that we would have to tell eight and nine year olds about the danger of drugs?  However, we have to do this and are doing so.  It is proposed to allocate £200,000 over a two year period to the development of a substance abuse prevention programme for primary schools.</P>
    <P>I will not deal in detail with health measures at any length because I know <Col N="668" /> the Minister for Health has been in the House.  The Department of Health is involved in setting up a comprehensive nationwide awareness and information campaign on drugs.</P>
    <P>For many years drugs were a problem only in urban areas and people turned their backs on it because it did not affect their areas.  The problem is now affecting the smallest villages, hamlets and bigger towns as well as cities.  People everywhere are worried about drugs. There are calls for treatment centres, but the minute any institution tries to provide such facilities there is a hue and cry from individuals in the community, who are supported by individual politicians. We must all face this problem. It is not easy to do so; but if people from all parties accept the need for these kinds of measures, we will begin to have an effect.</P>
    <P>Neither I nor any other Minister in this Government can promise that by the end of our two and a half to three years in office we will rid society of drugs.  I do not know of any other society in the world which has done so. However, I can give a commitment that we will continue this co-ordinated and cohesive approach with the support of the community.  I believe we will at least begin to target the main drug traffickers and also the main sector of society which is most vulnerable on the demand side.  Without stopping supply and creating a climate in which young people do not automatically think they must try drugs, we will not solve the problem.</P>

      <P>This debate has been highly educational for me, not just in terms of the content of the Minister's <Col N="669" /> speech but also because I have some inkling from her style, panache and performance of what it must have been like for any poor creature who followed Michael Collins in a debate.</P>
      <P>I welcome the bona fides, commitment and effectiveness of the Minister in so far as it is possible to do anything in a short period.  The Minister said she did not know any country which had successfully dealt with this problem.  Is there a hierarchy of effectiveness of performance among other countries?  I assume the measures the Minister mentioned about improving co-ordination and so on, which are welcome, are in place in a number of countries.  How effectively do these countries deal with the problem?  Are they reducing it, or are they simply curbing it?  Are there targets we can expect in performance terms from co-ordination?</P>
      <P>I ask the same question with regard to the demand side.  Are there performance targets which can be achieved by programmes in schools?  I approve of these measures, but have we any way of knowing what would constitute success? The Minister asked who would have thought that in this day and age we would have to inform eight and nine year olds of the dangers of drugs.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry spoke about how raves provide a sense of belonging and bonding and how reality is replaced by fantasy.  How do we provide alternatives for this sense of belonging, bonding and fantasy?  If these are what the demand is for, I fear that unless we provide alternatives, programmes in schools, worthy though they may be, will be relatively ineffective.</P>
      <P>This brings us back to the basic values in society.  The Minister used the word &ldquo;responsibility&rdquo; several times.  I am beginning to sound conservative in my old age but partly what is happening is that what we used to call a sense of individual responsibility is gradually draining out of our society, as it is draining out of western civilisation in general.  I know of no way of holding back this tide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the measures proposed by the Minister and I hope they will make <Col N="670" /> some difference; but what percentage difference can they make if pressure is coming from all the influences on our value systems on children from the ages of five, six and seven upwards?  As I listened to the Minister it struck me that we are like a child on the seashore with a bucket and spade trying to hold back the waves.  We can have a bigger bucket and spade, but the waves will keep on coming.  I do not want to sound defeatist, but this seems to be the kernel of the matter.  The drugs system cuts the aortic core of the value system of our society and unless that is tackled, even the most effective, comprehensive and intelligent sectoral measures will not resolve the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to my colleague, Senator Lee, for sharing his time.  I agree with his comments about the Minister's performance.  When she was in the middle of her superb oration, I said to him it was not difficult to realise one was in the presence of a grandniece of General Michael Collins. It was a superb performance.  I also agree with Senator Lee's comment that in dealing with this problem, we are like children with buckets and spades trying to erect a defence against the tide. There is a simple reason for this; no Government is prepared to seriously confront this problem.</P>
      <P>The Minister is doing what she can within very limited parameters.  I am not aware of any Government which has the broadness of vision to address this problem significantly.  It is not possible to deal with the global drugs epidemic unless the economic base is addressed. This must be destroyed and this can only be achieved by complete deregulation. It cannot be done by one country on its own, and I am not advocating that Ireland should go it alone, because a lunatic junkies paradise would be created.  It would be a vacuum which would suck in every disaffected drug addict from all over the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a huge amount of hypocrisy on this matter.  For example, the United States has spent thousands of millions of <Col N="671" /> dollars, but it has got precisely nowhere. The level of drugs continues to increase and the American administration, when it suits it, such as in Korea, Vietnam and Nicaragua, covertly employs money the Government has illicitly generated&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I intend to vote with the Government this evening because &mdash; the Minister dealt much more effectively with this aspect &mdash; it is laughable to condemn the Government for failing within a year to do things which this side of the House failed to do for many years.  I will not overemphasise that point, but it is equally laughable to commend the Garda for finding 15 tonnes of cannabis in Urlingford?  Who cares?  I do not care and it would not have made that much difference if they had smoked it. Nobody really sensibly suggests the core of this problem is people smoking marijuana. Any intelligent person is aware of this point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Old women are not battered to death in pursuit of a joint.  They are battered to death by people craving heroin and who are massively addicted to that substance.  This is why the problem of heroin must be tackled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have been much more enthusiastic in my support for the Government if there had been more of an estimation of what the limited detoxification facilities which will be available in Mountjoy will involve.  This should be encouraged.  The medical services in Mountjoy are not up to standard. Although they may be better now than they were, they never have been up to standard.  They are still futile.  In Dublin city people who want to get off drugs <Col N="672" /> must wait a year to get on to a methadone maintenance programme.  How serious is our commitment?  They should be placed straight on to the programmes; the treatment should be available immediately.  Money should be poured into this area because this is how people will be removed from involvement in crime.  This is the kernel of the matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister said there was a 40 per cent rate of addiction among people who go into Mountjoy.  This is probably true and everybody says it is the kernel of the principal curve of the rise in crime, which has been most shocking.  In addition to a quantitative rise in crime, there has been a qualitative change.  I remember when I was a child, which is a mere 40 years ago &mdash; I am 51 years of age, just one year older than the Minister &mdash; the shock when two old ladies who had a sweet shop in Harcourt Street were threatened.  They may have received a crack on the head with an iron bar but the shock reverberated around Dublin.  There is now contract killing, which I did not think I would live to see in this city.</P>
    <P>It is probably true that 40 per cent of people are on drugs when they enter Mountjoy.  It is a most worrying aspect, but what is the percentage when people come out of the jail?  My information is that many people are introduced to drugs in the prison system.  I am not blaming the Minister for this &mdash; she is an active Minister &mdash; but we should deal with these matters.</P>
    <P>The Minister raised the important NIMBY syndrome, not in my back yard. However, before anybody says one should not be wary of taking these facilities into one's area, we should examine the demographics.  Why are they always dumped in the north side of Dublin city?  There should be a number of these facilities in Foxrock&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I extend my warm congratulations to the Minister for her strenuous efforts in tackling this matter during her short time in office.  In that period she has gone a long way towards making up for the failure of her predecessors over the previous eight years. When I read the motion, I foolishly took it at face value.  I came in to the House <Col N="674" /> to discuss it on that basis; but when I heard some of the contributions at the start of the debate from the Opposition benches, it was clear the main motivation was not what was proposed in the motion.  On the basis of the speeches made, the principle motivation was to use in a most cynical way the tragedy and suffering of families affected by drugs for cheap political advantage.  I regret that Members of the House would be so callous and disregarding of the pain and tragedy suffered by many people through drugs.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the need to deal with pubs and dance halls where this activity is taking place.  As somebody who is close to the pub scene, I hold no brief for any pub which utilises that despicable trade to their economic advantage in any way.  However, if it is my objective, as it is, and the objective of many other pub owners to keep our premises free of drugs, we must have the authority and power to refuse access to drug pushers without having to state the reason.</P>
      <P>Drugs are a matter of grave concern. It is a serious issue that concerns many categories of people, not only the unfortunate users but their parents and society as a whole.  There is a widespread and alarming growth in the use of drugs which should be of major concern as it damages and imposes costs upon people and society.  Society's attitude to this problem has to be taken into account.  We have to mobilise society's resources, particularly parents' resources, in addition to the forces of law and order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to tackle the drug barons and the suppliers in this multi-million pound racket.  I share with many a lack of understanding why the Revenue Commissioners were never able to get to grips with the sources of the wealth obvious in the lifestyle of these drug barons.  I have a small business and I was the subject of a Revenue audit some time ago.  I was challenged by the Revenue auditor as to where I found the money to buy my children's Christmas presents because it did not <Col N="675" /> appear in the accounts.  If genuine people trying to earn a living can be harassed to that extent and one sees the obvious wealth of the drug barons, it is evident the matter is not being tackled as it should.  I do not know if it is a question of fear, perhaps it is.</P>
    <P>The Minister has mentioned the many measures she has put in place and is to put in place to deal with this problem. We are already seeing the success of her policies in this regard; they are evidently working.  There should be no complacency in dealing with this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Howard for sharing time with me and I welcome the Minister to the House.  The record shows the good work the Minister has done in the eight months since she took office.  In 1993 2,000 Ecstasy tablets were seized and 185,000 have been seized already this year &mdash; an increase of almost a hundredfold.  Up to the end of October the number of drug seizures by the Garda increased by almost 23 per cent, on last year's figures. The Minister and the Department should be complimented for their work.</P>
      <P>Following the major find in Urlingford I welcomed the Minister's announcement that she has dedicated over 100 people to a special unit to tackle the criminals who will be directly affected as a result of that seizure.  It was a wise decision.  I agree with her that this is a matter for the community and not just the Minister for Justice.  We all have responsibilities in society and each of us can co-operate to ensure the drug problem is stamped out.  If many people who have information were more forthcoming and more courageous in confronting the problem it would be tackled much sooner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to note that the last time there was a downward trend in the drugs problem was when the Labour Party and Fine Gael were in Government in the 1980s.  The graph began to climb again around 1989 and has been rising since then.  This year, for the first time since 1988-89 we will see a downturn. <Col N="676" /> The Minister should be complimented for her work in this regard.</P>
    <P>I welcome the announcement made about the more effective co-ordination of the functions of the Garda and the Customs Service.  After the Urlingford find I was disappointed to hear a Customs officer telling the media how the Customs Service was also involved in the operation.  It is important that all elements work well together and co-operate effectively, and that one side does not try to outmanoeuvre the other. The bottom line is to prevent drugs getting onto the streets.  I wish the Minister every success with the plan of action she is putting in place.</P>

      <P>For some time there was a feeling that this problem related mainly to Dublin city and was less important for rural areas.  However, the drug problem has infiltrated every town and village in the country.  We have our own problems in this regard in County Clare.  There has been some criticism of the strength of the Garda Drugs Squad which is in the front line in tackling this problem.  I compliment the Minister on having recently set up new divisional initiatives to get to grips with that.  The Garda Drugs Squad has been under-funded, under-resourced and under-staffed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would compliment John Cushnihan, MEP, and his colleagues for the work done in the European Parliament in highlighting the need to put in place a response at EU level to deal with this problem.  The Naval Service is in a similar situation to the Garda Drugs Squad.  It does not have the resources to deal with the problem.  From 1 January it will face a new and increased threat from the Spanish fleet which will put more pressure on its resources.  The Naval Service needs more personnel and more ships.  We cannot expect the Naval Service to mount an operation unless it is given the necessary resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a belief that the co-ordination in the effort to counter this problem has not been successful.  While the Minister has taken some initiatives and is awaiting reports, it is important that a Cabinet subcommittee should deal with this issue.  Cabinet subcommittees have been established for far less important issues in the past.  If there to be a coordinated effort by various Departments it is essential to have a top level political committee in place.  I urge the <Col N="678" /> Minister to raise with the Government the possibility of having a Cabinet subcommittee under her chairmanship put in place which could ensure that the coordination she seeks would come about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>We could all speak on this issue at length.  I agree public policy in this regard is a continuum.  However, I do not agree with much of what the Minister said, although I welcome the commitments in her speech that certain actions will now take place.  No Minister, no matter what their politics, could be happy with the fact that we have gone past the 100,000 indictable crime per year barrier.  This is the year of crime when we should seek the Minister's attention and get positive responses.</P>
      <P>The Minister outlined a set of programmes which we all endorse. However, the fight against crime requires more than good intentions.  We must judge Governments by their actions to date.  However, the most dramatic incident which happened this year was the decision on Castlerea.  I accept that is not the Minister's decision and that if the Minister's colleagues in Government had given her the money she would have gone ahead with that prison.  But there is a collective responsibility as well as an individual ministerial responsibility in this regard. I cannot understand how the University Senators can be sanguine in the face of that fact.</P>
      <P>At this stage we have no evidence of legislation to combat drug trafficking. There was confusion today when the Taoiseach announced that a drug trafficking Bill would be introduced some time next year.  I know that cannot be produced overnight, but I would have expected a little more urgency in the matter.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister's speech and her determination in this regard.  The establishment of an interdepartmental working group in the Department of Justice and the Department of Health to tackle this problem is important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The country is facing a drugs plague which is unprecedented since the 1980s. The drugs crisis is not an urban and suburban problem.  The Minister mentioned <Col N="681" /> the scale of the problem and the amount of drugs seized over the past couple of years.  The drugs crisis did not affect Ireland's towns and villages until recently.  Rural communities feel they have been forgotten.  Young people have told me that drugs are being sold in discos.  That must be curbed because it has gone too far.</P>
    <P>The heart is being torn out of rural communities by unemployment, emigration and the slow winding down of essential services such as Garda stations and post offices.  Garda stations must be manned in the towns.  Young people in these communities are vulnerable to drugs and are being increasingly targeted by pushers and dealers, many of whom operate openly.  We must ensure that gardaí in rural communities are given the expert backup they need to tackle the problem and that their numbers are not further depleted by so-called reorganisation.  We must also ensure that drug abusers in rural communities have full access to drug treatment services such as the methadone programme.  I urge the Government to establish community drug prevention schemes.</P>
    <P>The Minister is making a good effort and we want that to continue.  Some countries have been successful in tackling this problem.  Perhaps we could get some ideas from them in this regard.</P>

Do her officials know about the Manchester education programme on drugs, which has also been a success?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be compulsory to video sport and entertainment venues.  This would mean that people would not have <Col N="682" /> to go to court to give evidence about drug pushing at these venues.</P>
    <P>Under what Bill are public houses allowed late night dancing licences?  I understood that only hotels got these licences.  Those who employ 70 to 100 people, including myself, have paid hundreds of thousands of pounds for such licences, yet public houses are allowed to hold late night dances to 3 a.m.  I do not remember such a Bill being passed.</P>

Perhaps it will help the civil list, but it does not make sense from a criminal point of view.  However, it is a step in the right direction.</P>
      <P>People are talking about the revolving door syndrome in our prisons.  The Garda Síochána and judges of the District Court in particular are tired meeting people four or five days after they have been sentenced to six months in jail for serious crimes.  There is a lack of space in prisons yet nothing is being done about it.  It is terribly unfortunate that the two prisons which were on stream have been put back.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for the opportunity to raise this issue.  I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Education.  It is always a pleasure to have him attend the House to deal with matters of mutual interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Eurathlon Programme was launched by the European Commission earlier this year in response to an initiative from the European Parliament and the European Sports Forum.  Following the experience of the first year, Eurathlon II has been amended and improved.  The programme exists to promote <Col N="687" /> sports related activities of all kinds.  For example, it promotes exchanges between European citizens based on the capacity of sport to bring people together.  The Commission specifically states that such exchanges should contribute to a greater understanding and acceptance of socio-cultural differences between member states.  It further states that Eurathlon 11 will support sporting activities with a social purpose, such as combating unemployment, exclusion, racism and violence, in addition to equality of opportunity between men and women.</P>
    <P>These are worthy objectives and I applaud the Commission for implementing this programme, albeit with a small amount of funds.  However, I am seriously concerned that the requirement for funds under this programme must originate in at least three member states.  I suggest that this will do little to foster good relations between Northern Ireland and the Republic and between our near neighbours in England, Scotland and Wales who have long and proud sporting traditions. A continuing inter-relationship exists in a wide variety of sports between the home nations and Ireland. I refer specifically to our national games, Gaelic football, hurling and, to a lesser extent, soccer.  The latter is one of the few island-wide sporting activities which operates under two separate administrations &mdash; the Football Association of Ireland in Dublin and the Irish Football Association in Belfast.</P>
    <P>The operation of the three member state ruling will inhibit the breakdown of distrust and ignorance which has bedevilled good relations between Northern Ireland and the Republic, and Britain and Ireland &mdash; especially Scottish-Irish relations where sectarian hatred is a sad fact of life, particularly in Glasgow.  I draw the Minister's attention to a recent television programme on Channel 4 which explored the tribalism of supporters of Glasgow Celtic and Glasgow Rangers football clubs.  Anyone who believes that sport should be a <Col N="688" /> unifying force for good in the community would have been appalled at the display of bigotry, hatred and intolerance expressed, by both sides, in language that belongs more to the Middle Ages than a modern, late 20th century civilisation.</P>
    <P>In a spirit of reconciliation and support for the liberal objectives enshrined in the Eurathlon II Programme, I respectfully request the Minister and the Irish Government to seek amendments to any future Eurathlon Programme to take account of the unique relationship between the peoples of these islands.  I specifically request a derogation from the three member state ruling, as it applies to Great Britain and Ireland, to permit sporting organisations on either side of the Border &mdash; and between Ireland, Scotland, England and Wales &mdash; to avail of funding under the Eurathlon Programme, if not now then perhaps in the future.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that the funding available under this programme is small. However, the Minister knows better than I that European programmes which are successful tend not only to be retained but are provided with significantly greater funding as each programme is implemented.</P>
    <P>As I stated at the outset, I fully support the concept of Eurathlon and wish it well but in order for it to have real impact on this island and with our near neighbours on the periphery of Europe, I believe the three member state ruling should be dropped.  I am particularly pleased that, as Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Allen has responsibility for sport.  We have often discussed sporting matters together and he was born into a sporting tradition in the proud and historic city of Cork.  I have no doubt that he is the right man in the right place to carry out any changes or improvements that must be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen) Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Mooney for his expression of confidence and kind remarks.  I also <Col N="689" /> thank the Senator for raising this matter and affording us an opportunity to discuss it.</P>
      <P>I share with the Senator a great interest in, and admiration for, our country's national games.  Camogie, hurling, Gaelic football, handball and road bowling &mdash; a sport peculiar to my own county, County Mayo and County Wexford &mdash; are outstanding games which have been part of the fabric of life in Ireland for many generations.  In fact, we read descriptions of hurling being played since the earliest days of our recorded history.  Cuchulainn is said to have played hurling and judging by his exploits, any county in Ireland &mdash; certainly some of the counties in Munster &mdash; would be glad of his talents today.</P>
      <P>I am convinced, however, and I have spoken publicly about this matter on a number of occasions, that the unique quality and traditions of our national indigenous games are of great importance to our country.  I am equally convinced that the significance of national games should be acknowledged and nurtured in the context of the European Union.  Ireland is fortunate to have its own indigenous games and a number of our European Union partners also have thriving national and regional sports.</P>
      <P>These national games bring joy and prestige to the countries and regions of the European Union.  They are a mark of a country's distinctiveness, uniqueness and show that &mdash; within the regions &mdash; there is a vibrant, live involvement in sports, many of them going back over hundreds of years of history and culture.</P>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of the Eurathlon Programme by the European Commission as a contribution to sport throughout the Union.  I commend the Commission on this initiative.  Concern has been expressed that perhaps the sport authorities in the member states were not fully involved in the drawing up of the programme.  However, I look forward to the further development of Eurathlon and the benefits it can bring to sport &mdash; particularly indigenous sport &mdash; in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="690" /> I will be meeting senior officials of the Commission in Brussels on Wednesday and Thursday of next week and I had already intended to raise with them the importance of our national games and the need for Europe to pay particular attention to indigenous sport in the regions.  I will raise this topic on a number of occasions with different directors in Brussels next week.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney raised the matter of the requirement of at least three member states be involved in order to benefit under Eurathlon.  I assure the Senator that I will bring these concerns to the attention of the appropriate officials in the Commission at my meetings next week.  The incidents in Glasgow and throughout the European Union to which the Senator referred are of concern to me.  This programme can address the issue of racism in sport which must be tackled.</P>
    <P>I thank the Senator for raising this very important issue.  Our native games are very special.  I am very aware of their importance in our society.  They are part of our culture and history.  I will do all I can to ensure that they continue to thrive and that our partners in Europe are made fully aware of their importance not just at home but in the wider context of the Union and its regions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his exposition.  I assure him that I have every confidence in his capacity to encourage his European colleagues to perceive the context in which this programme can hopefully improve and expand.  I wish the Minister well.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Matters. - Mullingar Barracks.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for Defence for placing himself at the disposal of the House to debate the serious situation facing the barracks in Mullingar. I am calling on him to maintain Columb Barracks at present staffing levels and I am seeking an assurance that these levels will be maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="691" /> We are all aware of the importance of a good employer in any town or village, particularly in the midlands.  The midlands are not the place people seek to visit on holiday, despite the presence of many fine lakes in County Westmeath. Mullingar, the capital of the midlands, has a population in excess of 13,500 people and its Army barracks, which employs between 200 and 220 people, is a major employer in the town.  This is about the Government cheque coming in every week and the security of having a State employer situated in the town of Mullingar.</P>
    <P>Over the last number of years we have witnessed the effects of decentralisation in various towns around Mullingar but the town was not as fortunate and no Department was established there.  All the other towns in the midlands and practically all around Ireland were fortunate enough to receive decentralised Government offices so the Minister can see how important this employer of over 200 people is to Mullingar. To put it in its proper context, it is as important to Mullingar per head of population as the loss of Ford to Cork or Digital to Galway.  It is an extremely important employer in Mullingar.</P>
    <P>We have been concerned that in north-west Meath and Mullingar barracks have been run down over the last while.  I ask the Minister to clarify the situation and give an assurance that our worst fears will not be realised.  I ask him to respond to RACO, the Army officers organisation.  Last week it named nine military barracks which they say may close following their analysis &mdash; and I accept it is their analysis &mdash; of a report which is to come before the Government.  Once more there have been denials that Mullingar is going to close.  The forecast has been dubbed as speculative but Mullingar needs an assurance because we all know from experience that there is never smoke without fire.</P>
    <P>The closure of Columb Barracks would seriously damage the economic future of Mullingar.  Despite all the best <Col N="692" /> endeavours of our chamber of commerce, our town's trades committee and all the other people who have been trying to keep employment in Mullingar over the years, they are extremely concerned about the rumour and innuendo which are circulating, particularly from RACO.</P>
    <P>Last Tuesday week, the supply and transport people were told by a high ranking officer that it was possible they would be transferring to Athlone.  Over the last number of years we have seen various services being transferred to the Curragh.  As the Minister knows, I frequently come before the House on the Adjournment to raise matters of a serious nature in the area I represent and I am glad to see Senator Belton, a near neighbour, here to listen to the concerns of the people of north-west Meath and Mullingar.</P>
    <P>The other point on which we seek clarification is why there is no recruitment being undertaken in Mullingar. We are told of the numbers to be recruited.  We are told a redundancy package will be offered which is attractive to people in their mid-40s and early 50s.  However, if the personnel in Columb Barracks in Mullingar opt for redundancy, what assurance can the Minister give that these positions will be filled?  Recruitment in our area leaves a lot to be desired to say the least.</P>
    <P>Is the Western Command Band Leader being transferred to Cork or is he transferring of his own accord?  If this is the case, is there anyone available with the necessary expertise to keep the Western Command Band in Athlone?  If there is to be recruitment, I understand between nine and 11 members of that band would be favourably disposed to accepting a redundancy package if the terms were agreeable.  In that context and from my experience as a musician, I understand the expertise will not be available in the Army to maintain the band in Athlone.</P>
    <P>These serious questions are being asked.  I can assure the Minister it is not scaremongering.  Employment in our area is a scarce commodity.  Let us look <Col N="693" /> at two parishes.  Castletown-finnea's population has fallen by one third in seven years and four of the last six funerals there caused four houses to be closed.  In Coole, County Westmeath, 80 jobs have been lost in Bord na Móna, 63 in forestry, the hospital closed a number of years ago and the Coole-Whitehall parish population has decreased by in excess of 28 per cent.  The Minister can see the serious situation we face in north-west Meath with the future of an employer such as Columb Barracks at risk.</P>
    <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing this matter on the Adjournment and await the Minister's reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett) Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity afforded me to clarify the present position regarding the review of the Defence Forces by replying to this matter which is raised on the Adjournment this evening.  It enables me to deal once again with some issues which have given rise to misconceptions surrounding the whole Efficiency Audit Group process.</P>
      <P>In July of this year the Government announced its response to the report of the EAG on its review of the Defence Forces and published a document detailing the EAG report and setting out the Government's approach to the reorganisation.  The Government did not announce any decision in relation to Columb Barracks in Mullingar or, indeed, any other barracks in the country. I might mention here in passing that in 1988 the then Government initiated a study on military barracks and certain proposals in relations to closures were made but were subsequently not acted upon.  As regards the current review, I have made it clear on numerous occasions since the announcement of our decision that there are no plans to close any barracks in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has embarked on a major reform of the Defence Forces aimed at increasing the efficiency and streamlining the structures and organisation. The programme, which will be phased initially over a three year period, <Col N="694" /> has as its objective the development of the Defence Forces as a modern organisation, staffed and equipped to effectively fulfil the roles assigned to them.</P>
    <P>An implementation group has been established to oversee the programme of reform and it will prepare a fully costed plan covering the first phase and setting out the detailed action to be taken over the next three years.  The first phase will be concentrated on the internal organisation of the Defence Forces and on addressing the age profile. It will include a voluntary early retirement scheme.  There will be an enhanced operational role for the new organisation with no reduction in the numbers of personnel who will be available for such duties.  That plan will be presented to me shortly.</P>
    <P>With regard to the position of individual barracks, I have made it abundantly clear on more than one occasion in the past few weeks that only at the end of the planned three years of the implementation process will the accommodation requirements be examined and therefore the question of barracks closures does not arise.  I repeat that this does not imply automatic barracks closures.</P>
    <P>This review should not be seen as a cost cutting exercise.  This review is not being carried out in order to produce a programme of cutbacks and closures. Key words which appeared in the EAG terms of reference were &ldquo;feasible&rdquo;, &ldquo;efficient&rdquo;, &ldquo;effective&rdquo;, &ldquo;optimum&rdquo; and &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo;.  Optimum implies best for achievement of a result.  This is precisely what the Government wants for the Defence Forces; an organisation that is best suited for the discharge of assigned roles.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned already, a key objective is to release more personnel for operational duties.  I know that this is what the military personnel themselves want.  The process of change will evolve over a number of years at a pace which will ensure that while momentum is maintained, the changes can be successfully accommodated by the organisation. Recent media speculation has <Col N="695" /> created the impression that a range of measures which would affect the organisation and deployment of military personnel would be introduced overnight. Nothing could be further from the truth. Issues will be tackled in such a way as to minimise disruption for serving personnel. Due cognisance will be taken of people's circumstances and measures will be adopted to address those issues.</P>
    <P>I am acutely aware of the importance of a military installation to a town such as Mullingar.  Both Deputies McGrath and Penrose have been constantly in touch with me on this issue.  What I said to them is precisely what I am saying to this House this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Was Deputy O'Rourke in contact with the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>No. Deputy O'Rourke has not been in contact with me directly. I am mindful that there are important human, social and economic dimensions to the process of reform.  These issues are of course more accentuated when dealing with military installations in the provincial and smaller towns and the Government will take due cognisance of that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to repeat that the overall objective for the Defence Forces is to develop a modern, efficient, organisation staffed and equipped to fulfil the roles assigned to them by Government. This objective is in the national interest; it in the interest of the Defence Forces themselves and it is an objective which is supported by all sides of the House.  I <Col N="696" /> have made it clear all along that there will be an extensive process of consultation. This process has been underway for some time now.  It goes without saying that there will be no compulsory redundancies.</P>
    <P>My priority is to ensure that any changes will be for the better of all personnel. Unwarranted speculation of the nature we have seen over the last few weeks is just unacceptable.  I am conscious that this type of speculation is deeply worrying for many families of individuals engaged and employed in the Defences Forces.  These people have mortgages and children in school and such speculation is deeply upsetting for them.  I ask that those people who engage in this wild speculation cease to do so, even in the interests of the families I mentioned.  Co-operation is the key to the success of this process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will there be recruitment after the redundancies to fill the vacancies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of the exercise is to address the age profile problem. This will be done through voluntary redundancies and recruitment which will take place over the three year period.  We are addressing two problems: we are bringing the number down to 11,500 and we are also deeply concerned that the age profile be addressed.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.25 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 29 November 1995.</P>
