      <P>I have notice from Senator McGowan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to provide a sewerage system for Ballybofey and Stranorlar in County Donegal.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Maloney of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to intervene with a view to saving the 90 jobs threatened in the Londonderry and Lough Swilley Bus Company, Letterkenny, County Donegal.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Sherlock of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to seek a report on recent events in Cork where a water pollution health scare forced the closure of schools in east Cork affecting over 260 children on 6 June, and in north Cork the destruction of seven miles of a salmon spawning river and <Col N="1614" /> the wiping out of tens of thousands of fish.</P>
    <P>I regard the matter raised by Senator McGowan as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I regret that I had to rule the matters raised by Senators Maloney and Sherlock as not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment on the grounds of lack of ministerial responsibility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business are items 1 and 11.  Item I will be taken from now until 6 p.m.  Time limit for speeches is 20 minutes per spokesperson for each group &mdash; and &ldquo;group&rdquo; includes the Progressive Democrats for this item &mdash; and 15 minutes thereafter. Item 11 will be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.  This is a Private Members' Bill being taken in Private Members' Time and I have no difficulty in making additional time available should the Opposition require it.  Discussion of the Bill is ordered to conclude at 8 p.m. but if the Opposition require further time the Whips can meet immediately afterwards and I will inform the House of what has been agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure many Senators wish to contribute to the discussion on item 11, Senator Roche's Bill.  We would welcome the Leader of the House allocating more time to it.  An energy policy was announced last evening outside of the Oireachtas by the Minister and we would welcome the opportunity to discuss his ideas and future policy on energy.  We ask the Leader of the House to order such a discussion as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I understand that <i>The Cork Examiner</i> is no longer covering Seanad proceedings. That is a retrograde step.  Perhaps the Leader would look into this matter and see if there is some way we could influence that editorial decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise a matter that has been debated here on many <Col N="1615" /> occasions.  That matter is East Timor and there is an item in that regard on today's Order Paper.  A group of us have just returned from Portugal and I understand that a motion will shortly be tabled to take note of the final statement of the conference &mdash; the Lisbon declaration.</P>
      <P>In that context, I wish to direct a specific question to the Leader of the House. He will recall that some weeks ago I expressed concern that preparations were being made secretly to entertain a senior member of the Indonesian Administration; I have since discovered that it was the Indonesian Ambassador to London and Ireland, Mr. Habiebie. Of course, it is appropriate that ambassadors should visit this country.  I asked about it but I did not receive any further information.  However, I was disturbed to read in <i>The Irish Times</i> subsequent to that meeting that a Minister of this Government, Deputy Enda Kenny, apologised to Mr. Habiebie for the fact that there was a group of people, including myself and the head of the East Timor Ireland Solidarity Campaign, outside the Department of Tourism and Trade.  It is most extraordinary in light of the motions passed by this House and those currently on the Order Paper and in light of the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs' clear indication that he would consider seeking European Union sanctions against Indonesia for its barbarous and genocidal regime, that a Minister apparently apologised to the Ambassador for the fact that we in Ireland, unlike people in Indonesia and in East Timor, can exercise our democratic rights.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Leader of the House any further information on this? If not, can he provide such information as soon as possible to the House?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the point made by Senator Norris, a motion has <Col N="1616" /> been put down, which I hope will be supported by all sides of the House, in respect of the declaration made at the inter-parliamentary conference in Lisbon last week.  We should take all the steps we can to ensure that self-determination is granted to the people of East Timor and that the abuses of human rights taking place there are ended. When the declaration was adopted in Lisbon it was supported by all parties, and all parties were present.  I hope all parties will support this motion.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Wright's comments in respect of an energy policy and the proposals being made about the future of the ESB.  Could the Leader of the House allocate time for statements or for a substantive motion on that matter at the earliest possible date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call to give delegates who went to the East Timor conference an opportunity to make a statement to the House and allow us to respond, in view of the continuing interest in this House over a number of years in the difficulties East Timor is experiencing and in view of the many motions passed in that regard.  I support the call for an opportunity to further debate this.  We had an Adjournment debate last week to coincide with the presence of our delegates in Portugal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I was amazed to hear this morning that <i>The Cork Examiner</i> is no longer reporting the events of Seanad Éireann.  This is a retrograde step.  I support the call from our leader, Senator Wright, that this service be brought back.  The only coverage we get in Munster is in <i>The Cork Examiner.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I unreservedly accept your ruling about the Adjournment matter, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, but I have a question which may be answered now or at any time in the future.  Do I take it that the Minister for the Environment does not have even a quasi-judicial role in the implementation of the 1990 water pollution legislation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the comments of Senator Wright and Senator Fitzgerald about <i>The Cork Examiner.</i>  It could be disastrous if the Seanad was not reported in that newspaper.  I hope the Leader will ensure that <i>The Cork Examiner</i> does its best to feature again in its pages particularly all of us who have an interest in the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised they decided not to cover the Seanad having done so for such a long time.  I do not think it is a question of cost, if it is, they should look at their own costs.  I understand one reporter was covering two papers at one time.  As I said, I do not think it is a question of money, if it is, serious questions must be asked.  The paper has a responsibility and a duty if it continues to say it is the main paper for the south and the Munster region.  I ask that the paper covers events in both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the recently stated policy of this Government and its abhorrence of people involved in politics being on State boards, would the Leader of the House agree with me and does he wish to criticise the appointments of Dr. Garret FitzGerald and Mr. Des Geraghty to the board of Radio Telefís Éireann?</P>

      <P>I support the call by Senator Dardis and Senator Norris for a debate on East Timor.  As one of the Fianna Fáil delegates at the conference, I think it is an important one.  We can neglect this sort of thing when it is happening on the far side of the world but it is important.  We must continue our fight for those people and their self-determination. I support the call made by Senator Wright and Senator Dardis for a debate on the future of the ESB.  I cannot believe we intend to import electricity generated from nuclear energy as it is against everything we stand for.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed at the decision of <i>The Cork Examiner</i> which has always claimed to be a national newspaper.  I am sure the efforts of the Leader to convince it to reconstitute its coverage will be aided by the knowledge that Senator Wright reads it in Dublin, Senator Fitzgerald reads it in Kerry and Senator Henry reads it also.  I believe Trinity College gets a copy now and again.  I ask the Leader to convey the best wishes of the House to <i>The Cork Examiner</i> and ask it to simply do its job.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to try to arrange a debate on the current difficulties in the agricultural sector.  I know the Minister was in the House recently but restrictions on the payment of grants are causing a serious problem.  A large number of grant applications for farm improvement schemes are at present with the Department and this is causing a serious problem within the agricultural community. I would welcome a debate on this issue, which is fundamental to farmers, so that we could get a clear indication of the procedure relating to farm improvement grant applications.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator McGowan's call in regard to control of farmyard pollution grants.  We had a debate on this issue in this House but the matter has not been resolved; if anything, the situation has deteriorated.  It <Col N="1620" /> is time we had a further debate or some further contact from the Minister because the situation needs his attention. I also support the call by Senator Wright for a debate on energy, in particular on the ESB.  This news is disturbing as far as the workforce of the ESB is concerned.  It follows hot on the heels of a decision to close down many ESB offices around the country; it is proposed to close three offices in my own county.  The proposals announced by the Minister outside the House, indeed the whole issue of the ESB, are disturbing and need to be debated here. I support the call to invite the Minister to come to this House as soon as possible so that we can debate this very important public issue.</P>

      <P>On the question of more time for the debate on the Second Stage of Senator Roche's Bill, the <Col N="1621" /> Whips will meet but we can take it that the Bill will not conclude this evening. We hope to see Senator Roche here on many evenings over the next couple of weeks to steer his Bill through the House.</P>
      <P>The question of an energy policy was raised by Senator Wright and a number of other Senators.  I will ask the Minister, Deputy Lowry.  He has not been in this House with any legislation so far and it is time he was afforded an invitation which I am certain he will accept. I will convey the invitation of the House to him to come in.</P>
      <P>The question of <i>The Cork Examiner</i> was raised by virtually every speaker. Like Senator Sherlock, I am not aware that this has been verified as a fact.  <i>The Cork Examiner</i> has given good, honest and full coverage of this House over a very long period and it would be a retrograde step for it and for this House if that service were to be discontinued.  I propose that an all party group would speak to <i>The Cork Examiner</i> to indicate our continuing interest in this matter, if that is agreeable.</P>
      <P>On the question of East Timor, I was interested to note such well informed unanimity among those who recently attended the conference on our behalf. If it can be arranged, I propose to make two hours available next Wednesday for a take note motion by having the House meet at 12 p.m. rather than at 2.30 p.m. if that meets what is required.  As regards the other matter raised by Senator Norris, I am not aware of the facts, but I will make inquires and report back to him.</P>
      <P>Senator Mulcahy has an interesting style on the Order of Business.  He invariably invites me to agree with him, but I rarely do and I certainly do not today.  Senator Magner put the point well that we are lucky that people who have served in public life are prepared to continue serving and the RTÉ Authority and the public are lucky to have people of the calibre of Dr. FitzGerald and others&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Senator's party when in Government and the man who appointed him to this House had plenty of opportunities to extend an invitation and, to the best of my knowledge, it was never so extended.</P>
      <P>The other point of substance raised related to the agriculture debate. Although it is a serious issue, I do not believe time will be available to debate it in the next few weeks, but I will see if a slot can be found.</P>

    <Title>Package Holiday and Travel Trade Bill, 1995: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Minister of State at the Department Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg) Minister of State at the Department Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to transpose EU Council Directive No. 90/314/EEC on package travel, package holidays and package tours into Irish law.  The Bill will also make a number of technical amendments to the Transport (Tour Operators and Travel Agents) Act, 1982, mainly to remedy a number of anomalies which have come to notice in the light of experience of operation of this Act since 1982.</P>
      <P>The EU Directive was designed to harmonise aspects of national provisions relating to travel in the Union, and to improve protection for the consumer in the travel trade sector.  Package holidays now form a fundamental part of tourism, but the laws governing these packages vary considerably between member states.  These disparities in national practices give rise to inconsistencies in the field of packages and package travel in the various member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1623" /> The directive aims to stimulate greater growth in the package travel industry by removing these disparities and distortions thus enabling consumers in the Union to benefit from comparable conditions when buying a package in any member state, in other words, to secure a level playing field between all member states.  The directive makes an important contribution to protection of consumers and to completion of the Single European Market by laying down common rules and a common framework for holiday packages in all member states.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House sets out a framework for regulating all the essential elements of the travel contract, including the information which must be contained in brochures and its accuracy and clarity; the information which must be provided by the organiser and/or the retailer to the consumer, both before conclusion of the contract and before the start of the package; the essential features of the contract and the responsibilities of organisers and retailers for the performance of the contract; the ground rules for cancellation or transfer of bookings; and the security to be provided by the package provider in the event of insolvency to enable the stranded holidaymaker to be returned to the point of departure or, in the event of the holiday not having commenced, to be refunded moneys paid over.</P>
    <P>All of these elements taken together are the essential features of any holiday package and contribute to ensuring that the consumer gets what he or she paid for and has adequate means of redress in the case of a genuine grievance.</P>
    <P>The Act will be brought into operation by means of a commencement day order under section 1.  I will be bringing the Act into operation on a date which will allow adequate time for its implementation in order to allow tour operators and travel agents time to prepare fully for the new requirements.  An important point here is that during the lead-in implementation time the onus <Col N="1624" /> will be on the travel trade to ensure that they stock only brochures which &mdash; on the date when the Act comes into operation &mdash; comply fully with the new requirements.  I know the trade has been following developments in this legislation very closely.  As soon as the Bill is enacted my Department will be bringing its provisions to the notice of all tour operators and travel agents.  In the interests of consumers it would not be reasonable that there should be a delay of longer than three months in bringing the Act into operation.</P>
    <P>At present the consumer buying a package holiday is in the vulnerable position of paying in full and in advance for a product almost entirely on the basis of the description in the brochure. In future, intending purchasers of prearranged packages will be able to rely on the descriptions in the brochure. Package organisers will not be able to make exaggerated claims about particular holidays and will have to be able to stand over any description given in advance.  In addition, the brochure must contain general information about passport and visa requirements, which apply to the purchase of the package, and health formalities required by national health authorities in the countries to be visited.  The information to be provided to the organiser before the start of the package must include the name, address and telephone number of the representative or agent of the organiser at the holiday location or, if there is no such representative or agency, a telephone number which will enable the consumer to contact the organiser or the retailer. This provision is, to my mind, very reasonable.  If the consumer gets into difficulties of some kind, it is only right and proper that he or she be able to contact some representative of the organiser to provide assistance.</P>
    <P>There has been much discussion about what precisely will constitute a package holiday under the new Bill.  The Bill defines a package as a combination of at least two of the following components: transport, accommodation and other tourist services accounting for a <Col N="1625" /> significant proportion of the package. The combination of two of these items must be prearranged by the organiser, sold or offered for sale at an inclusive price, and must cover a period of more than 24 hours or include overnight accommodation.  I understand that the Director of Consumer Affairs, who will be policing the legislation when it is enacted, has suggested that his office will draw up guidelines in conjunction with the travel industry on what exactly constitutes a package.  These guidelines will make it clear that business travel is not included.</P>
    <P>In the case of bed and breakfast accommodation, the Bill will not apply where such accommodation is offered on its own &mdash; in other words, to the vast majority of cases.  The Bill will apply where accommodation is combined with transport or with another tourist service, such as golf or fishing. People on these kinds of holidays will spend considerable amounts of money. It is only right and proper that they should have the protection of the kind provided for in the Bill, whether they are staying in hotels or bed and breakfast accommodation.</P>
    <P>The Bill is about regulation of package holidays.  <i>Ad hoc</i> arrangements made by travel agents, specifically for the requirements of individual customers, do not come within the scope of the proposed legislation.  If, for example, a business person walks into a travel agency, asks for a flight to London and also asks the agent to book a particular hotel, this is not a prearranged &ldquo;ready made&rdquo; package, it is a &ldquo;made to measure&rdquo; one, and does not constitute a package.  If, however, the travel agent advertises a weekend in London which includes flight and accommodation, this would be prearranged and would constitute a package.</P>
    <P>Questions have been asked about whether youth and educational exchange organisations come within the scope of the Bill.  The short answer is that they do.  Youth and educational <Col N="1626" /> exchange organisations are engaged in the business of selling packages to the public on a full-time basis.  Consumers in this sector are no less entitled than others to have the comfort of knowing they have the protection of this legislation, both from the point of view of getting what they pay for and having their money secure in the event of the organisations in question being unable to meet their obligations.  This is all the more important as those involved are often young people.</P>
    <P>This treatment of educational and youth exchange organisations is consistent with that taken by other member states, none of whom has exempted this kind of travel from their legislation transposing the directive into national law.  Packages in Ireland, organised on an occasional basis, such as scout camps and school or parish outings, are quite a different thing.  I will be exempting these packages by way of regulations made under the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that this Bill encompasses, in addition to travel agents and tour operators, everybody who organises or sells packages such as carriers and hotels.  The exception to this are organisers who organise and sell packages on an occasional basis; they are excluded from the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Following the enactment of the legislation, I will be introducing regulations specifying precisely the classes of persons who are deemed to be acting occasionally as package organisers. Examples of such classes would be community, social, sporting or voluntary organisations which organise packages within Ireland as part of the general objectives of that organisation, schools or educational institutions which organise packages, parish outings and pilgrimages and packages organised by charities or benevolent institutions in pursuit of the objectives of that body.  I should point out that this exemption will apply to home packages only.  The organisation and sale of packages abroad will, of course, continue to come within the provisions of the Transport (Tour Operators <Col N="1627" /> and Travel Agents) Act, 1982, as has been the case since 1982.</P>
    <P>One of the main features of the Bill is that it will make the organiser of a package holiday primarily responsible for the proper performance of the obligations arising out of the contract.  I am aware there is concern in the travel trade industry regarding the extent to which organisers could be held liable to the consumer following the implementation of this legislation.  In this regard, I would like to clarify that the retailers, liability to their customers will not be dramatically increased following the Bill's enactment.  Under the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980, the seller, or retailer in the case of the travel trade, is already responsible in almost all cases for the performance of their side of the contract.  The effect of the Bill will be to place responsibility on the organiser similar to that already on the retailer under the Sale of Goods Act.</P>
    <P>There has been some speculation that the new legislation will make the organiser liable for any or, indeed, all damage suffered by the consumer.  This is not the case.  Section 20 of the Bill makes it clear the organiser will not be responsible if the failure to perform the contract, or its improper performance, is not due to the fault of the organiser or the retailer or another supplier of services. If, for example, the consumer suffers damage entirely due to his or her own negligence, then the organiser would clearly not be liable.  In the event of a claim about failure to perform the contract, or improper performance, the specific conditions of the contract pertaining to the package would have to be taken into account in each particular case in determining the organiser's liability, if any.</P>
    <P>I must stress again that this is consumer protection legislation.  One of its main purposes is to ensure that the consumer can, without difficulty, seek redress from the retailer and/or the organiser in the event of improper performance of the contract.  Should this <Col N="1628" /> improper performance be the fault of a supplier of services, the retailer and/or the organiser will, of course, be able to seek legal redress from that supplier.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed in recent months regarding the safety of Irish holidaymakers overseas.  There have been cases of tragic accidents abroad in recent years resulting in injuries and even the death of Irish holidaymakers. While these have fortunately been small in number relative to the numbers holidaying abroad &mdash; it is estimated 350,000 Irish people will go abroad on holidays this year &mdash; I can fully understand the concerns raised.</P>
    <P>This Bill is meant primarily to transpose the EU Directive on Package Travel into Irish legislation.  It is not a vehicle for introducing wider measures. The Bill provides, in line with the EU Directive, that where a package in a member state includes accommodation the contract with the consumer must state the compliance of the accommodation with the laws of the member state.  This will put a greater onus on the package organiser to ensure all accommodation it provides for Irish holidaymakers is of an acceptably safe standard and to ensure all elements of the contract with the consumer are fully and properly performed.</P>
    <P>As this legislation is a consumer protection measure the Director of Consumer Affairs will, as I said, have the primary role in enforcing it.  The Bill will operate in addition to the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980, and the director is, given his other responsibilities in the field of consumer legislation, the appropriate competent authority to police this area.  As is standard practice, the Bill provides that breaches of specific provisions will be offences, either summary of indictable, depending on the gravity of the offence.</P>
    <P>Some worries have been expressed that the implementation of this Bill will affect the prices of holidays being sold. Any increase in the price of package holidays as a result of these measures will be minimal.  Travel agents already must carry insurance to cover their <Col N="1629" /> activities.  While some extra insurance by organisers may be necessary to cover the actions of foreign suppliers of services, there should not be any need for large increases in liability insurance because there will be little change to the levels of liability already carried under the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act.</P>
    <P>The price of holidays may rise modestly in the first year but the present high level of competition in the travel trade business will have a stabilising effect and bring prices down again quickly.  The Director of Consumer Affairs, who will be enforcing the legislation, will be vigilant to ensure the Bill is not used as an excuse for increasing prices beyond the level which is absolutely necessary.  The added benefits and security the consumer will enjoy will more than compensate for any small increase in prices in the short term.</P>
    <P>I have been speaking up to now about the various elements relating to regulation of the travel contract.  I will now turn to the second main area covered by the Bill, which also arises from the EU Directive.  The Bill lays down the arrangements for the security of moneys paid over by consumers to enable them to be brought back to their point of departure or, where they have not travelled, to be refunded deposits which they have paid over.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for two options for the package provider in arranging the necessary security for moneys paid over by consumers.  A package provider who is a member of a body approved by the Minister to administer bonds, such as a trade association, may provide security by means of a bond taken out with an institution authorised to issue such bonds, such as a bank.</P>
    <P>Alternatively, security may be provided by means of an insurance policy taken out by the package provider or retailer in favour of the consumer. Transport carriers, hotels and anyone organising holiday packages now come within the definition of package organiser as specified in the directive and under the Bill must have security <Col N="1630" /> against insolvency in respect of their package travel activities.</P>
    <P>The effect of the financial security provisions is to give people holidaying in Ireland who are customers of Irish based package organisers comparable protection to that which people going on holiday overseas enjoy under the Transport (Tour Operators and Travel Agents) Act, 1982.  It is only proper that Irish people spending their holidays at home should have this protection in the event of insolvency of the package provider or retailer.  People taking holidays in Ireland who are customers of package organisers in other EU countries will be covered by the legislation implementing the directive in their countries of origin.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned in my introductory comments, there is a third element to the Bill.  I am taking the opportunity to amend certain provisions of the Transport (Tour Operators and Travel Agents) Act, 1982, which has been the Principal Act governing the sale of overseas travel up to now.  Before turning to these amendments I will outline the reasons for the enactment of the 1982 Act and the philosophy underlying it.</P>
    <P>The House may be aware that prior to the introduction of the 1982 Act the Irish travel industry operated on an unregulated basis.  In December 1980 Bray Travel Limited, then one of the largest tour operators, went out of business resulting in the loss of holiday money and the deposits of over 1,500 people and the stranding of a number of holidaymakers abroad.  There were also a number of other collapses in 1981.</P>
    <P>While voluntary bonding arrangements have been introduced by the Irish Travel Agents Association and by a number of individual operators in response to these developments, it was evident that a need existed for a statutory framework to protect holidaymakers. The basic elements incorporated in the 1982 Act were a bonding arrangement for tour operators and travel agents for the protection of their customers; a backup travellers protection fund to be raised by contribution from tour operators and to be used where <Col N="1631" /> individual bonds proved inadequate; and a system of licensing to regulate entry to the trade.</P>
    <P>The Act sought to prevent failures in the trade as well as to provide remedies where failures occurred.  Consumer protection was the major motive, but the licensing and bonding elements had also as a major objective the imposition of certain rigours and disciplines designed to seek to prevent failures and ensure the financial viability and operational integrity of tour operators and travel agents.  These disciplines related to the financial affairs, the business and organisational resources and the general fitness of applicants to hold travel agent's and tour operator's licences.</P>
    <P>Following the passing into law of the 1982 Act, regulations were enacted which set out in detail for the travel trade how the new procedures would operate in practice.  Contributions to the travellers protection fund were suspended in April 1987 as it was felt that there was sufficient money in the fund to deal with possible contingencies. There are at present 320 licensed travel agents and 55 licensed tour operators bonded under the 1982 Act.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the system of existing licensing and bonding has worked well over the years.  Where there have been collapses of tour operators and travel agents, customers affected have been repatriated where necessary and moneys passed to the operator or agent have been refunded.  These funds enable the customers, if they so wish, to make alternative holiday arrangements.  I realise that is not as easy as it sounds. Apart from some minor amendments, I do not propose to change the 1982 Act. The Bill now before the House will operate in addition to this Act and will also provide added protection to the consumer.</P>
    <P>I propose to amend a number of the definitions in the 1982 Act to make them consistent with the current Bill. The Bill will also make it clear that the provisions of the 1982 Act now apply to all travel commencing in the State to <Col N="1632" /> destinations outside the State or Northern Ireland.  Problems were experienced with the operation of the 1982 Act in identifying what was encompassed by overseas travel.  In particular, the 1982 Act referred only to travel to a place outside Ireland and did not specify that the travel had to commence in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The 1982 Act excluded carriers from its licensing and bonding requirements, that is, persons whose principal business is the provision of transport.  The Bill before the House provides that carriers selling package holidays outside the State or Northern Ireland will in future require a licence from my Department. This will level the playing field between carriers and the tour operators with whom they compete.</P>
    <P>The principal benefits to the consumer of the Bill before the House are that consumers will have easier access to redress; more comprehensive and concrete information will be available; consumers will be guaranteed a minimum degree of protection; the quality of service will be improved; and there will now be provision for security against insolvency for domestic as well as outbound packages.</P>
    <P>I understand that the home holiday business generated approximately £400 million last year.  It is important to the national economy and makes a significant contribution to year round tourism. In recent years the trend has been one of steady increases in short holidays outside the peak months.  It also generates substantial employment.  Domestic tourism accounted for an estimated 20,000 jobs in the Irish economy in 1994.  I hope that the protection accorded to domestic holidaymakers by this legislation will encourage more people to stay in Ireland for their holidays generating additional business and assisting job creation.</P>
    <P>Outbound tourism is also a major business.  It is estimated that approximately 350,000 people will take holidays abroad in 1995.  For most customers a package holiday is a once a year experience for which they have gone to considerable expense.  They are entitled to <Col N="1633" /> a safe and enjoyable holiday which runs as smoothly as possible.  The new legislation will enhance even further the already high quality of the Irish travel trade industry.  It will provide a framework which will give a better quality of service and improved protection for the consumer while at the same time keeping to a minimum the potential costs for the package organiser.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I take the opportunity to express my appreciation of the large amount of preparatory work done on the Bill by the former Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Brian Cowen.  He was responsible for seeking and obtaining Government approval for the drafting of the text of the Bill and much of the initial consultations with the travel industry were held when he was Minister. It is only proper that his contribution should be acknowledged.</P>
    <P>I am happy to recommend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for his elucidation of this welcome legislation. I am sure I have misinterpreted his final remarks, but he might clarify his reference to the amendments he proposes to the Transport (Tour Operators and Travel Agents) Act, 1982.  Section 27 of the Bill amends the definition of &ldquo;carrier&rdquo; under section 2(1) of the 1982 Act as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;carrier&rdquo; means a person (other than a package provider where the package includes transport commencing in the State to destinations outside the State or Northern Ireland)...</P>
      <P>Given that Northern Ireland is mentioned in the Bill, does this mean it is encompassed within the island of Ireland for the purposes of this legislation and that holidays sold from the State to Northern Ireland are not treated as being overseas?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>He might start something new here; we may have more than we bargained for at the end of the debate.  The provisions of the Bill originated in a EU Council of Ministers decision during Ireland's Presidency in 1990.  It gives effect to a EU Directive laying down common rules for package holidays which will go some way towards reducing if not eliminating many of the different practices which have been in operation throughout Europe.</P>
      <P>Once implemented the Bill will bring Ireland into line with our EU colleagues and provide a large measure of protection to the 350,000 Irish people, referred to by the Minister, who travel abroad on package holidays each year.  Concern has been expressed in some quarters that, once enacted, the Bill will increase costs in the travel trade, especially insurance costs, where travel agencies would have to increase their cover in anticipation of claims from clients who feel aggrieved.  This problem surfaces regularly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Compliments have been paid to the Irish travel trade, both outside the House and in the debate on the Bill in the other House.  I endorse this view in the majority of cases but complaints against individual travel agencies are common, especially in the provision of <Col N="1635" /> accurate information and the quality and content of the destination.  In several celebrated cases, the holiday which the client booked fell far short of what was advertised.  I acknowledge that the Irish travel trade has operated a voluntary code of conduct in this regard and has usually compensated the victims, but too often shoddy and inefficient service, coupled with incompetent couriers have ruined holidays for many people.</P>
    <P>The Minister alluded to what, in theory, appears to be the ease with which aggrieved clients can seek refunds under the bonding scheme introduced under the 1982 Act.  However, in practice, it appears to be more intractable.</P>
    <P>I will not mention individual travel agencies or companies because the entire travel trade has been tainted by incompetence at one time or another.  It would be unfair to single out any company by name on the basis of one or two incidents and give the impression that it was any more incompetent than the rest.</P>
    <P>However, in a recent overseas travel experience &mdash; an area to which I will specifically refer later &mdash; four separate incidents occurred.  They did not individually impact adversely on the short few days that one was away from this country, but collectively they amounted to an unacceptable low standard from a travel agency which is taking people's money and which should provide the best possible service.</P>
    <P>Reference is made in the Bill to the obligations placed on a travel agent to ensure that it has a representative present at the destination.  However, in the above example, the courier accompanied the people on the journey but was not seen for the following three or four days.  In one of the three hotels there was no contact number or name publicly displayed for the people on the trip.  I am glad the Bill will place an obligation on the company to ensure that an agent or representative will be available to consumers if an emergency arises. This was not the case in this instance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1636" /> On two occasions a bus arrived at different times to those stated.  In one case it arrived half an hour early and left and in another it arrived an hour earlier than it was due.  The second incident occurred on the day of departure when many people were not in the immediate area of the hotel, although the courier was prevailed upon to go back to the hotel to be there at the time specifically stated.  I am not suggesting the people would have missed their train, but I know some people had left clothing behind which they were almost prepared to abandon because they thought the bus would not be going back to the hotel.  This all happened on a trip of four days duration.</P>
    <P>The last nail in the coffin involved an excursion.  In advance it appeared well organised in that a flier was handed around to everybody which gave details of the trip.  This included the time of departure, the content of the excursion and the price.  However, on the day in question the courier did not turn up and was not to be seen.  The coach driver, who was a local, seemed to be in charge and informed those travelling on the trip &mdash; the cost of which was £35, which is quite expensive for a couple of hours sightseeing &mdash; that he would be taking them to a particular destination some miles from their hotel, where they would be left for an hour before returning to the hotel.  The circular indicated that more detailed trips were involved in the excursion.  These four incidents were minor in themselves, but I am sure the travel trade would agree that they were unacceptable.  I am pleased the Bill will address some of these aspects; it is long overdue.</P>
    <P>I am pleased section 11 will place an obligation on the organiser or retailer of a package holiday not to include anything in a contract which contains false or misleading information and that there are stringent penalties for failing to comply with this measure.  The Bill is concerned in the main with the contract between the consumer and the travel agent and is the latest in a series of <Col N="1637" /> European inspired legislation aimed at strengthening consumers' rights.</P>
    <P>I accept the Government is responding to a specifically focused EU directive on package holidays and the travel trade.  The Minister stated that the Bill's focus is not wide, but I am somewhat disappointed that the Government has not incorporated any protection for travellers who purchase travel insurance.  Following a bitter personal experience, to which I will refer in detail later, I am convinced that this aspect of the travel trade is in urgent need of review.  The necessary legislation to protect the interest of the consumer should be introduced as a matter of priority and complementary to the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>All of us who travel abroad know that we are, if not legally obliged, certainly prevailed upon to purchase travel insurance.  Usually this travel insurance comes as part of the tour package.  In most instances consumers do not even question the cost involved because it is usually minimal; it is of the order of around £10 per person.  It is treated in much the same way as the £5 travel tax or the various airport taxes that are included in any travel package when one gets the bill.  Of course, people are aware that they should have travel insurance, but it is not highlighted to the degree that it should.  Consequently, it goes by default.  I am convinced that there are companies operating in the travel insurance area who, if it was more strictly regulated, would be out of business tomorrow morning.  To put it bluntly, travel insurance is a scam.</P>
    <P>In 1992, my wife and I travelled to Spain for the football international between Ireland and Spain.  Our personal luggage was stolen from a hired car within hours of arriving in Seville. We immediately contacted the local police and filed a theft report.  On returning to our hotel we contacted the courier attached to the travel agency with whom we travelled and informed her of our disaster.  She immediately reassured us that we could claim for our loss under the provisions of the holiday insurance <Col N="1638" /> cover which we had purchased at the same time as our tickets.  The courier further referred us to the copy of the conditions which accompanied the travel tickets, which were in our possession.</P>
    <P>A quick perusal of the cover confirmed that under section 4 of the insurance certificate, personal baggage was insured up to a limit of £1,000 for loss or damage</P>
    <P>... to personal baggage taken or purchased on holiday, including clothing and personal effects carried on the person, trunks, suitcases and like receptacles occurring during the period of the holiday by accident or misfortune.</P>
    <P>I submit that nothing could be clearer. We had our luggage stolen.  Section 4 of the insurance certificate specifically addressed our particular personal experience and we returned home safe in the knowledge, reinforced by the opinion of our travel courier who was more experienced in these matters than us, that it would be a simple matter of claiming.  How naive.</P>
    <P>On our return home we immediately filed a compensation claim with the adjusters enclosing all the relevant documentation.  Imagine my surprise and horror when I received a reply from the adjusters informing me that their liability was repudiated due to exclusion (c) to section 4 of the travel insurance certificate.  I will read part of this exclusion to illustrate the point that I am making.</P>
    <P>The exclusions to section 4 include</P>
    <P>.... damage due to various vermin, (b) loss arising from confiscation, (c) damage or loss to bicycles, contact or corneal lenses, spectacles, dentures, audio or video equipment, telescopes, binoculars, antiques, watches, furs, precious and semi-precious stones and articles made of or containing gold or silver other than personal jewellery, damage to fragile articles and loss or damage to unattended baggage, the loss of cash, bank or currency <Col N="1639" /> notes, travellers cheques, prepaid petrol coupons, travel tickets, documents, stamps, coins, works of art, loss or damage directly or indirectly occasioned by happening through, or in consequence of, war. invasion, acts of foreign enemies etc.</P>
    <P>One side of this insurance cover sheet tells me that I can claim up to £1,000 &mdash; a modest amount &mdash; while the other side tells me that I cannot.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This type of travel insurance is wholly unacceptable and weighed heavily in favour of both the travel agent and the insurance adjusters. It is anti-consumer and provides only a thin veneer of cover for those booking package holidays.  Despite efforts on my part to have some legal constraint placed on companies such as this one to sell this type of insurance, I was informed by the Department of Trade and Industry, the Consumer's Association and the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs that there is a legal vacuum in this area which needs to be addressed.  Following persistent correspondence with the company concerned they eventually made an ex gratia payment to me and my wife, without prejudice on their part, in order to keep me quiet.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provision in the Bill which states that information provided to the consumer before the start of the package must include the name, address and telephone number of the representative or agent of the organiser at the holiday location.  It is incredible that the Minister has to include this in a legal document as I would have thought it would be a basic requirement, so from that point of view the sooner he introduces the law the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is incredible that in a country with such a highly educated workforce the travel trade can still employ, with all due respects, people as couriers who can <Col N="1640" /> just about make a cup of tea or add two and two.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that organisations engaged in the business of selling packages to the public are included under the youth and educational exchange.  I know that some doubts and concerns were raised about this during the earlier debate in the Lower House, but why should young people be excluded from provisions of this nature in consumer legislation.  I heartily endorse the Minister's comments in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave us information on the price of holidays, and concern was expressed that the implementation of this legislation would lead to increased costs.  I would be interested to know where these increased costs will arise. The travel trade has expressed concern about this, but I would interpret that as a vested interest protecting itself.</P>
    <P>The Minister goes to some lengths to dampen public concern that there would be significant price increases for package holidays as a result of this.  It might be useful if he could elaborate on his comment that while some extra insurance by organisers may be necessary to cover the actions of foreign suppliers or services, there should not be any need for large increases in liability insurance.</P>
    <P>I raise this matter because of the tragedies that, thankfully, do not happen all that often.  However, when they do occur they are all enveloping as far as the immediate families are concerned. One can only sympathise with the family of the Dublin couple who were found dead in their apartment in the Canary Islands.  In recent weeks their sons have made a submission to the European Union for changes in the law in that regard.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to know from the Minister whether this legislation covers such eventualities &mdash; not necessarily where the supplier is at fault &mdash; and what legal steps need to be taken by travel operators to ensure that tragedies of this nature can be prevented &mdash; in other words, by inspecting the premises in which people will be spending their holiday to <Col N="1641" /> satisfy themselves that these buildings are safe and adhere to EU standards if they are within an EU country as, in this instance in the Canary Islands, they were.</P>
    <P>There may be some derogation which the Minister could clarify, in that the Canary Islands do not form part of the EU for some legal instruments, although I am not sure.  My reason for raising this is not so much to rake over it but to raise that point.  In this instance it was alleged that the authorities were not responsive to approaches from representatives of the family.  These serious allegations were made against the authorities in Spain which, as a member state of the EU, is one of our European partners.  So, what legal sanction is there within this Bill to protect Irish consumers' rights in another EU country where there is no official co-operative response to tragedies of this nature, or to something affecting holiday travel much less?</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for introducing this legislation.  While it does not happen often, we have increasingly been debating consumer protection legislation in this House, and it is to be wholeheartedly welcomed.  I would be grateful if the Minister would specifically address the question of travel insurance in the context of this legislation.</P>

    <P>We have to base our approach to the legislation on that aspect of it and for that reason I welcome the Bill.  When I first saw the Bill I had certain reservations about it, but following discussions with the Minister I am satisfied that my concerns were not justified. <Col N="1642" /> Consequently, I am in the happy position that I can fully support the Bill today.</P>
    <P>I intend to raise one or two questions with the Minister, who, I am sure, will be able to provide satisfactory answers. I was interested in Senator Mooney's experience of travel insurance and I will also be outlining a similar situation to the Minister.  As the Minister said, the Bill gives effect to the EU Directive on package holidays and makes a number of technical amendments to the Transport, Tour Operators and Travel Agents Act, 1982.</P>
    <P>There has been some delay in putting into effect in our domestic law the obligations of the EU Directive on package holidays, the intention of which relates to package holiday operators, including the large scale ones.  Initially, I was concerned that the scope of the Bill was being extended to cover small time operators such as bed and breakfast establishments.  I do not believe that that was the intent of the original directive, but the opportunity was availed of by ourselves to extend the implications of the Bill to the small operators, I do not know whether it is a good or a bad thing, but if we approach it from the point of view of protecting consumer interests then we have to accept that that is the way to go.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the legislation will insist that the kind of information given to the customer before the conclusion of a contract and the start of the package is accurate and that it truly reflects the content of what is on offer. It is also important that the rules for the alteration and cancellation of packages, which I will be dealing with later, be dealt with.  That is an area which has caused considerable dissatisfaction for many consumers.</P>
    <P>The Bill goes on to specify the essential features which a contract must contain. It also contains provisions on the security which must be provided by the package provider in the event of insolvency to ensure that stranded holidaymakers can be brought back to their point of departure and obtain <Col N="1643" /> refunds.  It is important that the consumers get what they have paid for and what they are assured is available.  If they have genuine grievances in relation to their holiday, it is equally essential that the machinery is in place to rectify that grievance.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point made by Senator Mooney, I have been dealing with a case on behalf of a person who booked a holiday with a national travel agency and paid a deposit.  I will give this information to the Minister.  The following week the person concerned took ill and on medical advice cancelled the holiday.  There was an interval of about eight weeks between that time and the proposed departure date.  The person was advised at the time of booking the holiday that they should have travel insurance.</P>
    <P>On their recovery to health they sought, first of all, a refund of their deposit, which the travel agency refused.  They then recalled that they had been advised to take out travel insurance which would cover such an event and they applied to the travel insurance company for a refund of their deposit.  They discovered from the travel insurance company that it had been billed by the tour operator for the cancelled holiday and it produced invoices to that effect.  This caused some alarm to the person concerned and I became involved at that point.  The person made further inquiries because he happened to be aware of other people who were travelling on the same aeroplane and he discovered that the aeroplane was full.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it appears that it would be in the interest of the travel organiser for as many people as possible to fall ill after having booked their passage because, first, they could hold onto the deposit; second, they could claim from the travel insurance company; and, third, they could fill the aeroplane with additional passengers.  This is the unacceptable face of consumer dissatisfaction. I have no hesitation in raising it here in conjunction with the issue which Senator Mooney raised and I will supply <Col N="1644" /> the Minister with the details.  I am not doing it so that &mdash; although I would be delighted if it could happen &mdash; a proper refund would be made to the person in question but rather to allow the Minister of State to consider for himself the arrogance and unco-operative attitude of this national travel agency.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister of State is allowing adequate time for the implementation of the Bill so as to allow travel agencies and operators to prepare fully for the requirements.  I notice that business travel does not come within the remit of the Bill.  The reasons which the Minister of State advanced for this exclusion are reasonable and satisfactory and I accept them.</P>
    <P>On the question of the home market, I said earlier that I believe that the intent of the EU directive was aimed at large scale operators, and I was referring to a large scale operator in the specific case which I mentioned.  Therefore, I was concerned that at an early stage the powers of the Bill would be extended to small operators.  The Minister of State stated that it will not apply to bed and breakfast accommodation if it is offered on its own, which he said happens in the majority of cases. However, he said that the provisions of the Bill will apply where accommodation is combined with, for example, transport and other tourist services such as golf and fishing.  If these elements are found to be unsatisfactory, I am not sure whether it is the bed and breakfast operator or the organiser who will be deemed responsible.</P>
    <P>The other aspect of that question which I wish to raise relates to agri-tourism. The reduced potential for expansion in agriculture and farming in this country has led to the development of what is known as agri-tourism, which invariably offers some sort of activity in addition to accommodation, such as fishing.  I am not sure to what extent golf forms part of agri-tourism, but perhaps if accommodation is offered in conjunction with a local golf course, it does. There are also walking, cycling, boating and open farm holidays.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1645" /> I am concerned that this provision might inhibit the development of agri-tourism which is important in many areas of the country.  There is no reason why it should do so if the arrangements are properly made and if both operations are dovetailed together. However, because agri-tourism is such a recent development, operators may regard this measure as something which will inhibit the potential growth and development of their industry.  I would be glad if the Minister of State would avail of the opportunity to assure those engaged in that industry that such fears can be dealt with.</P>
    <P>I accept the Minister of State's point that it would be unreasonable to expect that the implementation of this legislation would lead to a substantial increase in holiday prices, although there may be a marginal increase.  If there was an attempt by the industry to substantially increase the cost of overseas holidays in order to comply with the requirements of the Bill, such a move could only be regarded as a rip off and I am sure that the appropriate steps could be taken to deal with it.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney referred to the tragic deaths of a Dublin couple in Tenerife and I join in expressing my regret to the members of their family.  I have a special reason for referring to that because I stayed in that apartment complex prior to the accident.  I had a very enjoyable holiday and found it to be a particularly satisfactory apartment with wonderful facilities.  However, I am concerned by the information coming through that very few steps have been taken by the authorities to deal with the danger of an unfortunate recurrence.</P>
    <P>I wish to ask the Minister of State a somewhat different question to that asked by Senator Mooney.  If Spain has incorporated the effects of the EU Directive in its domestic legislation, what has the EU done in relation to this case to ensure that there is proper compliance by the Spanish authorities?  It is an excellent apartment complex with excellent facilities such as swimming pools, restaurants and everything that <Col N="1646" /> one could ask for.  A very close relative of mine was going on holidays there some weeks ago and asked me for my opinion.  My opinion was: &ldquo;Do not go near the place because I do not think it has been sorted out yet&rdquo;.  It is unfortunate that such a situation would continue.</P>
    <P>I would like greater clarification of the definition of the retailer, the organiser, the travel agent and the provider of bed and breakfast accommodation.  I am referring to the domestic market in this context.  The Minister says that the effect of the Bill will be to place responsibility on the organiser of the holiday.  He says that under the Sale of Goods Act the seller and the travel agent already have a legal obligation. However, in the context of smaller scale Irish tourism there is a multiplicity of characters or elements involved.  There is the organiser of the event, the travel agent, the seller, the retailer and the person who is providing the accommodation. That appears to be a group of five.  Does responsibility for the product rest more with one of the elements of that group than with another?  What is the individual responsibility of each element involved in the holiday?</P>
    <P>My concluding point relates to the arbitration process that must be installed.  It is evident that as a people we have become more ready to assert rights, be they legitimate or assumed rights.  A tendency to claim dissatisfaction and compensation with regard to various products has mushroomed in recent years.  There always will be certain people who will be dissatisfied with a particular product, and not always for good reason.  While our principal aim must always be the satisfaction of the consumer that they are provided with a genuine product, at the same time we must ensure that there is an adequate arbitration process so that unjustified claims of a product being unsatisfactory can be addressed in a fair and objective way.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill in broad terms.  I will have more comments to make on Committee Stage.  However, I congratulate <Col N="1647" /> the Minister on introducing this necessary and desirable legislation.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister and I welcome the Bill to a certain extent.  This is a consumer protection Bill that is being introduced on foot of a European Union directive.  The total emphasis of the Bill is on the protection of people's money for the package holiday, the quality of the service one receives and so forth.  That is fair enough.  However, the Minister would have been wiser not to mention the word &ldquo;health&rdquo; at all in the Bill if it is only going to be addressed in such an inadequate manner.</P>
      <P>I followed the debate on the Bill in the Dáil and in the Select Committee very carefully and I am not the only person to bring up concerns regarding the lack of protection <i>vis-a-vis</i> health in this legislation.  I would be glad if, perhaps, the Minister would consider changing other parts of the Bill in this House.  The old adage says that one's health is worth more than one's wealth.  Our health is being given little protection in this Bill. Not only is the health of the individual going abroad important but their entire holiday is spoiled if they go to an area where they contract some disease which makes them sick while they are there.  In addition, people returning from abroad with serious illnesses will have to receive medical treatment in the State and that might be a great financial burden on the State for quite some time. The treatment of many of the diseases which can be contracted outside this country can be extremely costly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to figures from the Department of Tourism and Trade about 350,000 people will go abroad on package holidays this year.  A large number will go to destinations outside <Col N="1648" /> the European Union or Europe in general. It is difficult to get the relevant figures because many people do not leave directly from Ireland but depart on package holidays which they pick up in other cities abroad.  However, people from Ireland travel to Africa, Thailand, Bali, Indonesia, China, South Africa and Brazil in quite large numbers.  They, I believe, would have little knowledge of the health regulations or health dangers in the countries to which they are travelling.</P>
    <P>I do not for one instant think that every travel agent must be an expert in tropical medicine.  Indeed, there is not one official consultant in tropical medicine in the State health service &mdash; everybody must rely on going to private practitioners. It is totally inadequate for the Minister to say that travel agents must give information about health formalities required by national administrations. National administrations will have, for a start, the minimum requirements for people travelling there and often those requirements are totally inadequate when one gets there.  It is quite common, for example, to be told that a disease is not likely to be prevalent in a country only to find when one goes there that the conditions are such that the disease must be there.</P>
    <P>It would be better if we made our own recommendations or followed World Health Organisation recommendations as to what people should know about the health problems in the country they are visiting rather than relying on what those countries require, as was the case in the past with regard to visas for countries with yellow fever and so forth.  We should make the recommendations for people visiting foreign countries.  There was a ridiculous situation in the past whereby smallpox vaccination was required to enter America although smallpox had virtually been eliminated &mdash; there were only a few cases left in the Somali desert.  This was not a procedure without risk.  The requirements for entering a country are not always those which are the most useful or suitable for the <Col N="1649" /> person who is visiting.  The Bill should be changed to provide for recommendations by our own Department of Health instead of the requirements of the national administrations.</P>
    <P>People from this country travelling abroad have another serious problem which people from some other countries do not have.  We have an appallingly low immunisation rate.  Ireland has the second lowest immunisation rate in the European Union for diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus.  We have the lowest rate for polio.  These diseases are to be found abroad so Irish people are more likely to go abroad inadequately protected than anybody else.</P>
    <P>I was fascinated to see that as a result of the number of young people who are backpacking abroad it was recommended in Great Britain that diphtheria and polio boosters should be given at the termination of the school cycle.  We would have to start with about one-quarter of our population being given their initial inoculations at that stage. This is a serious situation which we need to address at once.  Our attitude to vaccinations is casual, to put it mildly, and the fact that so many more people are going abroad now means that they are in far more danger than people from other European countries.</P>
    <P>I have a table which details the triple vaccine up-take rate for European countries: it is 99 per cent in Denmark and 95 per cent in Portugal while our rate is just 65 per cent and the Greeks are at 45 per cent.  However, even the Greeks have managed to push their polio up-take to 96 per cent while ours is the lowest at 81 per cent.  This has to be seriously addressed.  The Minister may not feel it is part of his brief to do this but warnings should be given with holiday details and parents should be asked if their children have been immunised against these diseases.</P>
    <P>These things do not just happen in the most exotic of places.  There is a serious situation in the former Soviet Union because of an increase in the number of cases of diphtheria and the number of <Col N="1650" /> deaths from it.  It is not as popular to go there now as it was immediately after travel to Russia became easier but a considerable number of people still go there.  Do they have any notion that booster doses are required or recommended? Occasionally there are outbreaks of polio in the most surprising places.  There was one in the Netherlands a few years ago.  How is an ordinary citizen to know that there has been an outbreak of polio in the Netherlands?</P>
    <P>There should be an onus on the Department of Health and package tour operators to let people know that risks have arisen in certain countries and that they should take appropriate measures. It is important to remember that countries are eager to attract tourists and will not be likely to publicise problems. Some countries have been notorious for infected water in certain areas.  This Bill does not place any onus on package tour operators to tell people that there have been outbreaks of diseases, such as viral hepatitis or one of the dysentries. One does not necessarily have to go to Indonesia to contract such diseases; they can be contracted within the European Union.</P>
    <P>We are more at risk from hepatitis A than other people because this country has cleaned up its act so well.  About 30 per cent of people in their twenties have no immunity to hepatitis A.  We could include that in our tourism brochures. Hepatitis A is spread by the faecal contamination of water or food.  We are so pure and clean here that the water is rarely infected by anything like this and a large number of young people travelling abroad have no immunity to hepatitis A.  The disease is not contracted in the same way as hepatitis B which is, of course, contracted through either sexual activity or blood.  There will not be a requirement on people going to southern Europe to be vaccinated for hepatitis A but it would be worth warning people that this would be a good idea.</P>
    <P>All I ask is that our Department of Health at least produce pre-departure information which tour operators would <Col N="1651" /> be obliged to give people when they are booking their holidays so they will make an effort to be vaccinated against diseases. As tour operators have pointed out in the past, it is important that information be given well in advance because there is no point in getting vaccinations the day before departure.  Many vaccinations should be given at least four weeks prior to departure.  This pre-departure information should not be a requirement of the country to which people are travelling but should be given by our own Department of Health.</P>
    <P>I cannot see why the information cannot be distributed to tour operators and travel agents and updated on a regular basis.  If there is a specific risk in a country at a certain time, people should be told about it.  It is not even suggested in the Bill that people be informed of the World Health Organisation recommendations. It is just a requirement on the country to which a person is going. A standard health leaflet should be produced. Those involved in tropical medicine &mdash; and in other branches of medicine &mdash; would be delighted to be involved in producing it.  I suggest the Minister look at that as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The most likely problems for people in Europe are caused by the dysentries, hepatitis A and other water borne infections. However, it is important to point out that risks may arise from time to time in certain countries, even within the European Union, and it is worth explaining what they are to people before they travel.  It is also important to point out that this does not relate only to drinking water.  There is also a question of sea bathing, etc., in those areas.  Typhoid vaccination for people travelling abroad has improved, perhaps this could be mentioned in leaflets.  This area has not been addressed adequately and I would like the Minister to do so.</P>
    <P>Are we involved in the Europe against AIDS programme as it affects holidaymakers?  I was at a meeting with other European parliamentarians in Barcelona recently.  Some of the people <Col N="1652" /> there had a package with them which I have not been able to find here.  It is produced by the European Commission for the Europe against AIDS summer campaign for 1995.  It is a factual campaign with leaflets and information which are to be given to young people.</P>
    <P>The winter AIDS campaigns and the occasional television advertisement are long forgotten at this time of the year. It is generally accepted that people's behaviour in all sorts of activities when on holiday differs totally from their behaviour at home.  This campaign is called the Flying Condom campaign.  I gather they have kites which one can fly but I do not think they are shaped like condoms.  This is the sort of thing young people should be told about before going abroad.  Sexual activity abroad can be as dangerous as it is at home.  We advise them when they are at home but, even though it has been shown that young people's behaviour is less likely to be circumspect when abroad, they appear to be in no way informed about this sort of campaign.</P>
    <P>I was fascinated to discover that the Scandinavians have a campaign called Hot and Safe.  Field workers go to popular tourist resorts and make contact with people to advise them against risky sexual activity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will leave this copy of the Europe against AIDS summer campaign with the Minister because our Department of Health should be involved in distributing these leaflets. There is no more obvious place to distribute <Col N="1653" /> them than in travel company offices.</P>
      <P>I would like some commitment from the Minister on my final point because it is one which everybody in Ireland takes very seriously, particularly after various sad events over the last month.  We should grasp the opportunity presented by this Bill to pursue measures for the protection of children from commercial sexual exploitation.  This Bill could make it an offence to promote, organise or profit from child sex tours.  If the promoter is a company, it could be liable if it is incorporated in Ireland or carries on its activities in the State; if the promoter of these tours is an individual, he should be made liable for the conduct of promoting, organising or profiting from sex tours outside the State.  The penalties could be very harsh; they could be loss of a licence for a tour operator as well as financial penalties and confiscation of property.</P>
      <P>Such provisions should be put in this Bill because Ireland has international obligations under the International Convention on the Rights of the Child. Article 19 of this convention places an obligation on the State to take appropriate legislative measures to protect children &mdash; not just Irish children &mdash; from all forms of abuse, including sexual abuse.  Article 34 specifically contains an undertaking by the State to protect children &mdash; again not only Irish children &mdash; from all forms of sexual exploitation and sexual abuse.  The way to do this is to pass legislation and this Bill provides an ideal opportunity to legislate to prevent the use of children in prostitution and other unlawful sexual practices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sexual exploitation of children is morally repugnant to most Irish people. A majority of Irish people would be very glad to see us show our concern for exploited and abused children.  We often talk about our great love of children, the protection afforded children by our Constitution and so on.  This would be a concrete way to show that we will not tolerate the exploitation of poor children in foreign countries and <Col N="1654" /> to discourage the participation of Irish nationals or businesses in this exploitation.</P>
    <P>If we were to criminalise the promotion and organisation of sex tourism involving children, we would be complying with international regulations and would also send a very clear message that this sort of activity is unacceptable if it is carried out by Irish nationals whether at home or abroad. Campaigns are already under way in France and Germany to have sex tourism directed against children treated in this way.  In both these countries it is now possible to prosecute nationals who have committed sexual offences against minors in foreign countries.</P>
    <P>In addition to that legislation, the Australian Government passed the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) (Amendment) Act, 1994, which creates specific offences of promoting, organising and profiting from child sex tours; New Zealand will also pass such legislation. Tourism organisers in general would be most supportive of such measures and I see no reason to think that the Irish public would not be equally sympathetic.  It would show our abhorrence of and voice our lack of toleration for such activities if we included such provisions in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome my friend and colleague, the Minister, Deputy Stagg, to the House.  I have tracked this legislation through the other House, through the select committee and the different issues which people addressed in their contributions are very interesting.  Many of the contributions I have read address this Bill from the vantage of the Irish traveller overseas.  Senator Henry, because of her background, was able to give us a medical perspective on travel which was very interesting and valuable. However, this issue was addressed elsewhere by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worth noting that this Bill is about the consumer.  We have in this House someone whose name is synonymous with providing excellence to the <Col N="1655" /> consumer; I refer to my colleague, Senator Quinn.</P>
    <P>I will deal with this Bill from the Irish perspective.  This legislation gives rights to people coming into this country. Ireland's business is overseas business. While the protection of our own citizens who wish to travel overseas on holidays is very important, of equal concern to us is the fact that people who choose to holiday on the island of Ireland and to spend their money here should also be guaranteed excellence in the product we are selling.</P>
    <P>When consumer legislation of any type is introduced, the providers of the services affected immediately and automatically become suspicious.  This was also true in the case of such legislation introduced in this House in the 1960s and 1970s.  The implementation of any such consumer legislation, we were told, would inevitably lead to massive job losses and factory closures.  The opposite is almost always true.  The improvement of standards of consumer goods and services has always resulted, in my opinion, in an increase in the use of those services or in the purchase of those products.</P>
    <P>When the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980, was introduced, giving consumers solid and substantial legal rights for the first time followed by the appointment of a Director of Consumer Affairs, businesses in general were begrudging in welcoming many of the provisions of the legislation because they feared they would not be able to meet the required standards.  We now know that this is absolutely untrue. When the Irish decide to get their act together, they produce a service or product which is second to none and is accepted internationally as such.  We do not lack the ingenuity, but sometimes we lack initiative and commitment to standards and this has sometimes resulted in damage to our reasonably high reputation abroad.</P>
    <P>The Minister has produced a Second Stage speech which takes us nicely through the various sections in the Bill <Col N="1656" /> and disposes of arguments which have yet to be made on Committee Stage.  I commend the fact that this is a comprehensive speech, it is extremely well laid out and very easy to follow.  Other Ministers might note that the layout and details given in the Minister's speech were of immense help to those of us who are spokespersons on this legislation.</P>
    <P>When I was growing up, foreign destinations were the preserve of the rich. One might get as far as Birmingham; a Dubliner might get to the Isle of Man on the ferry.</P>

      <P>In Cork one went to Youghal on the train, which unfortunately no longer runs, but in the main those who went to the continent or to America came from a certain stratum of society.  For most of us, the money simply was not there.  As the country grew in prosperity, people were better paid and travel became easier through technological advances such as the advent of jet planes and so on.  Then came the package holiday which opened up the world to the vast majority of ordinary people.  This was marvellous.  For many years it led to an exodus to places like Torremolinos in Spain, the Canary Islands and so on.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that people plan for holidays.  I am sure that now as in the past the greatest expense for people, apart from a car or a house, is a holiday. In many cases it is still not an annual event; it might be once every five years or a decade or once in a lifetime.  One thing we can be sure of is that it is always planned with greater concentration than Montgomery planned his desert campaign and with more anticipation. There was a belief &mdash; it is a bit like the Bible, the written Word &mdash; which I never shared&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In some cases it probably led to marital breakdown because if there is any pressure on a marriage, a bad holiday will bring it to the fore.  Murders have been committed while people have been on holiday.  A statistic &mdash; I will not vouch for its accuracy because I cannot recall where I read it &mdash; showed that pre &mdash; or post-holiday tension contributed to marital stress.  I am glad the Bill will make the job of the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, a lot easier when it comes to the divorce legislation.</P>
      <P>Those who will come within the remit of this legislation, perhaps 400,000 or 500,000 holidaymakers visiting this country each year and who will spend millions of pounds, need to be reassured that there are guarantees in place which protect them and which give the native provider the impetus to upgrade their services to ensure that their word is their bond.  There is no better assurance from a supplier of any service or product than that person or company's word which is their bond.  The Bill covers wide area in terms of people going on holiday abroad and visitors who we welcome so much.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an enormous number.  I do not know the amount of money generated, but it must be hundreds of millions of pounds.  Thanks to the situation in Northern Ireland, that is only beginning.  We hope the peace process will continue to develop and that in the not too distant future this will not only be a beautiful place to visit but one of the safest places in the world. This only around the corner.  I believe visitors should be afforded protection not only as regards their rights but also in relation to the valid points made by Senator Henry that are within the remit of the Department of Health and which are worthy of note.</P>
      <P>The package holiday trade &mdash; this is not meant to sound elitist &mdash; covers the mass end of the market.  Many people who use it for the first time are unfamiliar with the customs or mores of the country they visit and do not know where to go to complain or how to establish their rights while there.  They must overcome a language barrier and, in many cases, they have limited funds and cannot afford a protracted correspondence between a foreign country and home.  If the provider, whether Spanish or any other nationality, decides to play the language barrier for all it is worth, there is a dialogue of the deaf while people's money runs out and their holiday comes to an end.  This leads to tremendous frustration.</P>
      <P>From that point of view, this Bill will be welcomed by everybody.  Some people have reservations about minor aspects of it.  Reservations were expressed about the timing of the introduction of the Bill given that the 1995 brochures are already published.  I take it from the Minister's comments in the other House and here that he intends to give some leeway to take account of these reservations, which is fair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In most respects, the providers of the service, travel agents and so on, do a good job.  Those with whom I have dealt over the years have been diligent, fair <Col N="1659" /> minded in their approach and understanding and have provided a high level of service to the customer.  Dealing with the public is not an easy job; Senator Quinn might have something to say about that.  No matter what one does, one cannot please some people.  There are con merchants in the travel trade, but there are also con merchants on the customer side which we should not forget. I come from a city where a person is sued if they sneeze.  The local authority has no money because people have got used to the idea that, even if it is their fault that they fall, trip or whatever, they look around for something to fall over.  People have made a career from claiming.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney read out some of the conditions attached to travel insurance and I have no doubt they were inserted after long experience of fraudulent claims.  Jewellery, precious gems and coins are excluded.  There must have been an occasion when somebody decided to make a claim when their baggage was stolen for items which they did not bring with them, for example, a gem left to them by their granny worth £2,000 or £3,000.  Suddenly there is an insertion in the insurance certificate which excludes precious gems other than personal jewellery.  There is always a history as to why these conditions are included.  While the consumer needs to protected from the supplier, the supplier also needs some protection from unscrupulous customers.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, the Bill gives effect to an EU Directive.  We joined the EU and we must pay our dues in relation to the legislation which the Union, in its wisdom, decides to put in place.  Each member state has an obligation to conform to that directive. Given the exhaustive consultation process, the Minister was generous to pay tribute to Deputy Cowen, the then Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, a development which should encouraged.  Credit should be given where due, whether that person belongs to a different party or a previous <Col N="1660" /> Government.  If people put in the work, they are entitled to a modicum of recognition.  It is generous and a welcome development and I hope all future Governments give credit where it is due when Ministers, by the nature of their jobs, move on.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier on &mdash; I do not intend to detain the House much longer &mdash; the Bill has the ability to protect the indigenous tourist trade.  This is my main concern.  I heartily acknowledge the people who travel abroad on holiday.  I hope they enjoy themselves.</P>
    <P>I spent last week on the Shannon, however, and all I could see along entire stretches were cars with English registrations, people fishing happily on the banks and cruisers travelling up and down the river.  I was in Terryglass on Saturday night and an American family from Santa Monica were in the berth alongside mine, next to them was a German family and further on was a Swiss family.  The United Nations were in Terryglass last Saturday night.  This represents great business for this country and it is business we must look after.  We have not even begun to exploit it.  To consider the cruise-hire business alone, which yields huge amounts of money, there are 7,000 boats in Holland &mdash; a country the size of Munster &mdash; and only 800 boats on the Shannon, the largest water-area in Europe.  That gives an idea of what is awaiting this country in the future.</P>
    <P>Tourists travel to Ireland, hire cars and cruisers and spend their money in shops, pubs and stores in the midlands and areas which would never see a tourist. Banagher, a reasonably large village in County Offaly, is booming because of that kind of trade.  It is a cosmopolitan gathering place at this time of year for people from across Europe.  This was a community that depended on turf and the ESB's peat-fired power stations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I am pleased that the Minister is here to take the Second Stage debate on this legislation, which is the result of an EU Directive.  As Senator Magner stated, tourism is one of the greatest opportunities for the country in its long history of dealing with business and the attainment of future progress.  I could not agree more with what the Senator said.  With regard to the areas he spoke about in Leinster and along the Shannon, which flows into my own area of County Westmeath, the potential tourism is offering, and can offer, is way beyond our wildest dreams.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why are these people coming to Ireland from Europe, America and the rest of the world?  The ceasefire has made Ireland a friendly destination and has played a major part in attracting our near neighbours from the UK.  Until the ceasefire, Ireland was the only country in the EU not attracting the largest volume of tourists from its nearest neighbour. That will not be the case from this <Col N="1662" /> year onward.  It is a bonanza to be involved in the tourist business, the hotel business and the bed and breakfast business &mdash; as I am myself &mdash; at present.  It is absolutely stimulating. There are not enough working hours in the day to take on the challenges and opportunities being presented.  The Minister is probably aware of the conference which took place in this city two weeks ago.  Buyers from all over the world, particularly America and Europe, came to Dublin and Blarney Woollen Mills, House of Ireland, various hotels, the Wax Museum etc., displayed their wares for them.  It was the most successful conference of its kind ever witnessed in Ireland.  To say that at least 60 per cent of accommodation for the peak months of next year was sold would be an understatement.  That would be the low figure of the peak four months of sales of accommodation already sold in the various hotels and top-class guesthouses for next year.  This shows the opportunities which are available.</P>
    <P>I would also pay great tribute to the work of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins, in the film industry.  He has opened up, free of charge to the entire world, a massive promotional stage for the country. The famous Tullynally Castle is situated in my village of Castlepollard and during the next two weeks 220 people will be employed to make a film there. Not one guesthouse in Castlepollard, Coole, Multyfarnham or Castletownfinea has a bed available for the next fortnight. It is a great change to see the business that is now being attained in the lake district, the undiscovered part of Ireland, which Senator Magner referred to earlier.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the marvellous achievements of the Eurovision Song Contest during the past three years.  It has encouraged interest in Ireland from new and exciting young tourists.  The success of Riverdance in particular has shown the new, modern Ireland, not the Ireland portrayed in America as the home of the shamrock and the harp, <Col N="1663" /> which itself must be commended, but a place were 50 per cent of the population is under 30 years of age.  This is the new Ireland of high technology, the great standard of education, the great presentation of speaking the English language and the great, young, energetic country on offer to visiting tourists.  I must also pay tribute to Steve Collins for his magnificent victory over Chris Eubank.  This has helped to give Irish people, at home and abroad, pride in their sportsmen and women.  Sport is playing its part in showing Ireland as an island of success.</P>
    <P>As some Senators might know, I have been to America five times since New Year's Day to promote the businesses I am associated with, at my own cost and expense which is correct.  I travelled to Branson, Missouri, the centre of music marketing.  The town has a population of 7,200 people and the figure for visiting tourists was in excess of 4 million. I travelled there to see how they were achieving this marvellous success and I met some people who are coming to Ireland to celebrate St. Patrick's Day next year.  I asked them why they had decided to come to Ireland and they told me it was because they had seen the beautiful Christmas Day Special hosted by Perry Como.  He had recommended Ireland as a friendly, green country while filming his show here.</P>
    <P>While these points may have been trivialised by the business world in the past, many people in Government and the political parties are beginning to realise that this is a marvellous, free marketing opportunity in which endorsements can be received &mdash; endorsements that could not be bought in marketing terms &mdash; of how to promote and market Ireland.  No one owes Ireland anything and Ireland does not owe anything to anyone.  When given the opportunity and an equal break, tourists visit this country and meet a nice friendly people.  They experience a very high standard of service whether they stay in hotels or eat in the some of the best restaurants in Europe.  They meet people who speak good English, <Col N="1664" /> who are willing to show them around and who extend their hospitality.  I think we can hold our heads high in relation to this.  Standards have increased greatly here in the last ten years.</P>
    <P>Golf is the fastest growing sport in the world.  We have the highest <i>per capita</i> number of golf courses in the world. While golf was a game of the gentry in the past, it now offers enormous potential for attracting people to this country. About six weeks ago I was in the UK for seven days.  While there I did a great deal of market research on what Ireland was offering by way of package holidays.  A great number of these holidays were geared towards those who were interested in fishing and golfing. Golf courses are not available to them in England or, where the game originated, in Scotland.  Golf can be available to them practically on demand in Ireland, which has the world's finest courses.  The Minister's own town has the great experience of nearly having full employment because of the spectacular course there.  The Minister and I have discussed this on many occasions.</P>
    <P>We should examine where we are going to make progress and how we can create more jobs for all our people. There is now a tendency to think that people over 40 years of age find it very difficult to get jobs.  From my experience in the tourist industry, I would be delighted to employ men or women over 40 years who were willing to work because I know they would be willing to work for me until possibly the end of their working lives and would not be career hunting.</P>
    <P>Such workers would be anxious to please and satisfy the demands of the tourists staying in their employers' hotels and whom they would be taking on arranged trips.  They are a very satisfactory workforce.  People aged over 40 can regain employment in the tourist industry because they have the correct attitude and have obtained a fair amount of experience and expertise, particularly in telling the history and old stories of their areas, which are vital and important to give areas their identities. <Col N="1665" /> In my area the seven wonders of Fore are a unique tourist attraction.  Everybody wants to know where are the crosses, the water that will not boil, the tree that will not blossom and the anchorite over the door.  What better person to relate all this than a local person in their middle years who has time available and is seeking to regain employment.</P>
    <P>I agree with most of the sentiments in the Bill, the purpose of which is to comply with the EU Directive.  Irish people are much travelled compared to people in the US, which is the biggest English speaking country in the world.  It would not surprise the House if I said that only 10 per cent of Americans have a passport. This indicates that possibly only 10 per cent of Americans leave America.  I would be surprised if the proportion of Irish people who have passports and have left the country at some point in their lives is less than 40 percent, or even 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>My greatest experience and the greatest education I could have received has been the opportunity of travel which I call the &ldquo;university&rdquo; of travel.  Those who travel regularly update themselves in new technology, ideas and techniques of marketing.  They see and meet the demands of world business people, travellers and tourists.  This is the finest degree people can award themselves each year.  In the latter part of January, in February and in early March people should travel to see how the Australians succeeded last year and see the marketing plans of the Canadians for, not this year, but next year.  Some 60 per cent of all package holidays were put to bed by 31 May this year.</P>
    <P>Ireland is in a favourable position because of the visit last week by Prince Charles, the forthcoming visit of President Clinton, the visit of other foreign state dignitaries and our success in the Eurovision Song Contest.  These promotions and visits are doing us tremendous good.  This is also true of the films being made here.  I look forward with great enthusiasm to the future in Ireland <Col N="1666" /> with regard to employment and opportunities in the tourist industry.  It is very important that we update ourselves and tighten up regulations for those who, by not complying, fail to sell Ireland as it should be sold, whether they are in the bed and breakfast, hotel or package holiday trades.</P>
    <P>Some years ago planes taking people on pilgrimages to Medjugorje, Lourdes and Fatima used to be eight or ten hours late.  We rarely see planes being late now when we are travelling to America or anywhere else abroad.  They are pretty much on time unless there is an act of the God such as a storm.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of tightening up the law and regulations in this area.  I look forward to Committee Stage when we can tease out in more detail some of the Bill's provisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and his explanation of the Bill.  He explained that the effect of the Bill will be to place responsibility on the package holiday organiser similar to the one already on the retailer under the Sale of Goods Act.</P>
      <P>I want to make two main points about the Bill.  The first is to signal my disquiet about the length of time it has taken to translate the EU Directive into our national legislation.  Next Tuesday, 15 June, will be the fifth anniversary of the passing of the Directive by the Council of Ministers.  It happened not during the last Irish Presidency but the last Irish Presidency but one.  In other words, it happened a long time ago.  Five years is much too long for us to get to this stage. One of the main objectives I set out for myself when I became a Member of this House was that I hoped to encourage more speedy action in the mechanisms of Government.  This is a prime example of the unnecessary delay I had in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not unduly complicated legislation. Neither was the necessary process of consultation with the industry particularly difficult or contentious. There is nothing at all in this situation to justify taking five years to turn this directive into law.  I suggest the delay <Col N="1667" /> was simply due to a lack of any sense of urgency, perhaps to a feeling that delays of this order are par for the course, to use a golfing term, and are therefore acceptable at certain levels in our Administration.  I was not aware the Minister is a golfer until Senator Cassidy reminded me.</P>
    <P>I do not think these delays are acceptable and I hope the House will agree.  I think Ireland should, as a matter of general principle, move to enact EU directives as quickly and as promptly as we can.  It is one way of showing we take our responsibilities as a member State seriously and of keeping our credentials in order.  We should give an example to the other members of the EU and not drag behind with the rearguard as we too often have done in the past.</P>
    <P>In the present case there was an additional reason for moving more quickly.  An important aim of this legislation is to strengthen the degree of consumer protection in the tourism area. The Minister explained this very well.  If that needed to be done, and we all agree it did, it should have been done as quickly as possible if we were sincere about the interests of the customer.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to hear Senator Magner speak about the need to be customer-driven. In this area the customer needs a higher degree of protection than elsewhere but traditionally he or she has received less.  I grew up not as a grocer but in the tourism industry &mdash; my father ran Red Island holiday camp.  It succeeded from 1947 until he died in 1972 but at that stage it became threatened. As Senator Magner said, from the 1940s to the 1960s Irish and British people tended not to go to the continent.  After that.  Red Island was challenged by package holidays to Spain and France.</P>
    <P>The business my father built up was based on what is called the boomerang principle.  Senators may notice some of us wearing a boomerang in our lapel or as a tiepin.  The concept behind this important principle is that the objective of the business and every decision it takes is to get the customer to return. <Col N="1668" /> This is such an essential element of any business, especially tourism, that we must be driven by it.</P>
    <P>I moved into the grocery business in later years but the protection for the tourism customers is more important than for others.  A customer who shops in a supermarket does so at least 50 times a year and so has the opportunity to change the supplier immediately if he or she is not satisfied.  If something goes wrong with one item bought in the weekly shopping, it rarely creates a major family crisis.</P>
    <P>However, buying a holiday is different; such a purchase is made once or perhaps twice a year and is of huge importance.  If something goes wrong it is a family disaster, as Senator Magner said.  As well as that, buyers of holidays never become as knowledgeable about what they are buying as shoppers in a supermarket.  They must rely much more heavily on what the tour operator tells them.  With holidays the balance of information and knowledge is tilted in favour of the supplier.</P>
    <P>For these reasons buyers of package holidays need a higher degree of consumer protection.  I welcome this Bill and the Minister's explanation because it will strengthen protection but, at the same time, I regret that we did not act with more urgency to bring it about. There is nothing we can do now about the delay but I hope my remarks may have an effect on other Ministers and civil servants who have other measures languishing in the corridors of power; I exclude the present Minister from these comments.  We should not spend five years waiting to put an EU Directive into legislation &mdash; we must put a greater degree of urgency into the process.</P>
    <P>My second point can be achieved through amendment of the current Bill and I hope the Minister and the House will see fit to do so.  Senator Dardis will probably agree with me; he has strong concerns about words and he will be pleased that I could not find the phrase &ldquo;in relation to&rdquo; in the Bill.  However the word &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; is used 86 times.  I want the Minister and the House to consider <Col N="1669" /> changing these references so that on each occasion we talk about the &ldquo;customer&rdquo;, not the &ldquo;consumer&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am not dealing in semantics, there is an important issue at stake.  In my business I have found that if we talk about &ldquo;customers&rdquo; people tend to behave so that the customer benefits.  On the other hand, if we talk about &ldquo;consumers&rdquo; people behave in a different way and the customer does not benefit as much. For instance, my company holds regular &ldquo;customer panels&rdquo;, not &ldquo;consumer panels&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There are two main difference.  First, the term &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; is dehumanising. We cannot but think of customers as people with individual human needs but it is much easier to think of consumers as a commodity or a series of numbers. The philosophy of good customer service is based on treating customers as people and individuals, not as abstractions. Since this Bill is largely concerned with protecting people, the terminology should reflect that.</P>
    <P>Second, &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; is inappropriate because it reflects a view of economics in which the customer is the last link in a supply chain.  It is a top-down view of economic activity which is not in the interests of customers.  It suggests the role of the customer is merely to &ldquo;consume&rdquo; what the supply chain has seen fit to provide.</P>
    <P>We will never understand economic activity unless we realise the customer is not the end of the chain but the hub around which all economic activity revolves.  The customer is the point of the exercise &mdash; everything else in the equation is subordinate.  We deny that reality if we call the customer a &ldquo;consumer&rdquo;; we downgrade the customer's role and significance.</P>
    <P>This is important far beyond the present context.  There is immense potential to stimulate economic activity by making this nation much more customer-driven than in the past and the first step towards that is using language which reflects a customer-driven approach to business.  Using the word &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; in the Bill is therefore inappropriate <Col N="1670" /> and we should switch to &ldquo;customer&rdquo;. The thrust and the tone of the legislation would be greatly improved by doing so.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Customer&rdquo; can have exactly the same legal force and meaning as &ldquo;consumer&rdquo;; it appears in other legislation so we are not breaking new ground.  The parent directive we are implementing does use the term &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; but that is no excuse.  We should not allow our language to be dictated by bureaucrats who are more removed from market realities than we are.  In the definitions clause we can state if necessary that &ldquo;customer&rdquo; in the Bill has the same meaning as &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; in the directive.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take this on board and agree to introduce the necessary amendments on Committee Stage. It is fully in the spirit of this Bill to show that we regard the customer as king in the holiday business as much as elsewhere. I congratulate the Minister, not only on bringing the Bill thus far but on his contribution explaining why it is required.  I wish him every success with the remaining Stages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and this Bill.  It deals with tourism, which is an important aspect of our economy, especially in the sense of people coming to our country to spend money here.  Tourism is now a major business.  It is estimated that 350,000 people will take holidays abroad in 1995; this is the other side of the business. The Bill deals with people who come to Ireland and it underpins the quality of the product we give them.  It has a quality assurance aspect and it protects those who travel abroad for holidays.  The holiday business generates approximately £400 million per year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The trend, which has been growing over a number of years, of holidaymakers travelling to Ireland in the off-peak season is very welcome.  In my part of the country we have winter holidays to various sporting activities, and we hope that will continue for many years.  I welcome the protection the Bill accords to <Col N="1671" /> those travelling here to enjoy holidays and I hope it will attract more people in the future.</P>
    <P>This Bill, which should have been introduced three or four years ago, is a response to an EU Directive. I welcome the fact that it sets out a framework for regulating the essential elements of a travel contract.  It is important that information contained in brochures is correct because people make decisions about travelling abroad on the basis of such information.  This Bill ensures that will be the case.  Information must be provided by the organiser or retailer to the customer before the conclusion of a contract so that people have a clear understanding of what to expect when they go abroad on holidays.  The Bill is welcome in that regard.  It ensures that the organiser's responsibilities are clearly outlined in the execution of the contract which is completed between the person going on holidays and the travel agent.</P>
    <P>The Bill also covers the ground rules for cancellation, transfer of bookings and the security provided by the travel agent in the event of insolvency in order to enable the stranded holidaymaker to return to the point of departure or, if the holiday has not started, to refund moneys paid.  Too often in the past holidaymakers have had long planned holidays destroyed because of insolvency or difficulties within the organisation. People save for many months or years to travel on holidays and it is disappointing if everything is destroyed and they are given little information about what is happening.  I welcome the fact that the Bill will control this situation.</P>
    <P>This Bill ensures that the person buying the package holiday will be able to rely on the descriptions in the brochure. Package organisers will no longer be able to make exaggerated claims about particular holidays and they must stand over any description given in advance.  It is also important that brochures contain information about passport and visa <Col N="1672" /> requirements which apply to the purchase of the package and health regulations required by national health authorities in the countries to be visited.</P>
    <P>I do not envy travel agents their work in trying to arrange package holidays to the US because there is still confusion about those who travel to the US without visas.  People have been turned back at the point of entry because something was found in the computer which said they were not eligible, although they understood that under the new arrangements they could travel there.  I know people who, having organised their holidays and agreed with the tour operator that everything was in order, got a letter from the American Embassy a week before they travelled asking them to contact it to discuss the situation. They were asked if they had relations in America and doubts were cast on the bona fides of their returning home.  This is a grey area over which the Minister and the Government have little control. The American Embassy and Government should be informed of the people's concerns about this situation which we thought was clear cut following the changes introduced some months ago.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Bill will not apply to bed and breakfast accommodation. I pay tribute to the work done by the bed and breakfast community throughout the country because it has brought Irish life to the visitor. Owners of bed and breakfast accommodation bring people into their homes where they experience family life and have an opportunity to discuss aspects of Irish life which they would not be able to do if they travelled from hotel to hotel.  They make an enormous contribution to our tourism industry because those who stay in such accommodation will then market Ireland when they return home.</P>
    <P>Many owners of bed and breakfast accommodation group together in order to advertise or promote events and facilities in their regions.  For example, one such group in Adare, County Limerick advise people &mdash; they do not sell such advice &mdash; to travel to various <Col N="1673" /> places, such as aviation museums, heritage areas, etc., in the region.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this legislation and what the Minister said when introducing it to the House.  There is virtually nothing in it with which I disagree.  However, a couple of areas need to be strengthened, perhaps not by this legislation but by <Col N="1674" /> other methods.  One relates to the duties of the carrier to and from this country and the other relates to bus operators.  It has been my experience when travelling abroad on package deals that everything goes wrong when one gets into the hands of the tour bus operator who either fails to show up, shows up in the wrong place or the bus breaks down. This area in our domestic tourism industry needs attention because it is critical to the success or otherwise of the holiday.  The proliferation of tourism means that there is an urgent need to expand the fleet available for ferrying people around the country.  However, these must be of an acceptable standard.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a response to an EU Directive.  The point has been made that we have been tardy in our uptake of EU Directives.  It seems to take a long time for directives, which are mandatory, to become law.</P>
    <P>Several references were made to fresh water fishing.  As a practitioner of fresh water angling &mdash; the Minister is more successful than I am &mdash; I want to make some points.  This country is portrayed as one of the premier angling locations in the world and our wonderful water is available to anglers.  People who sit on the bank of the River Shannon without anyone else within a hundred yards of them think they are in paradise.  It is also true that we allowed the sea trout to disappear from the west of Ireland, that we destroyed Lough Sheelin and the other midland lakes &mdash; some of them are only now recovering &mdash; and that we had a general indifference to the quality of the waters and the fishing stock within them.  This must be accepted.  It is not a criticism of any specific Government but of successive Governments that these things were allowed happen.</P>
    <P>I recall that when I started to fish on Lough Corrib 25 years ago, people flew from America to visit the lake, hired a car at Shannon for a month, stayed in the best guesthouses and hotels, had a gilly every day of the week and left substantial amounts of money in the areas that they visited.  This was at a time <Col N="1675" /> when our tourism industry was not well developed.  Those people have gone.  As they have the money, they will go to Alaska, Russia, New Zealand or anywhere. Unless we provide a facility of the very highest quality and guaranteed sport they will leave, as they have left in their droves.</P>
    <P>There is a lesson for us in this.  It is to do with the quality of the product which we have to offer and in providing an assurance that it is maintained.  As one who has fished these waters in the west of Ireland, I am aware of their capacity and wish to see it exploited to the national advantage, as it can be.  Bord Fáilte have responsibilities in this respect.  When fishing was damaged, as in the case of the western fisheries, we were still promoting them.  To attract people in the knowledge that when they arrive the sport will not be there for them is the worst offence.  This comes back to the point made by Senator Quinn; it is to do with the rebound factor: once bitten, twice shy.  Such people do not come back, and they were big spenders.</P>
    <P>There are two aspects to the Bill.  The first is in respect of people coming into the country, the second is in respect of people travelling out.  We all know of the experience of people, as relayed to us on numerous radio programmes, who got a brochure with a picture of a hotel but when they got to the hotel they found it was a construction site with a kango hammer going outside the room, if they were lucky enough to get a room. They must be protected, as must those who booked a holiday, paid their money and then found that the company collapsed leaving them without recourse.  It is legitimate that people be fully compensated in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made, as you yourself referred.  Sir, to people who went on pilgrimages.  They were among the most abused.  It was such a thrill and experience for them to visit places of pilgrimage on the Continent, such as Lourdes and Fatima, that they put up with conditions that no other traveller <Col N="1676" /> would have tolerated, including being left in airports for hours on end.  The modern equivalent of the pilgrim is the football supporter.  When Ireland played in Rome in the World Cup, many of the football supporters had similar experiences due&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;solely to the ineptitude of the tour operators.  Many of us flew in and out satisfactorily and left people behind us at airports who had been there long before we arrived and long after we had left.  This is not acceptable and must be eliminated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>People who had that faith tolerated things that the business travellers would never tolerate in their wildest dreams.  They should not have to put up with these.  In this respect, Aer Lingus have responsibilities.  Brochures should be accurate.  I welcome the provision that the agent should be available.  It is essential, especially where people are far from home.</P>
      <P>With regard to the specialist holidays, the fisherman booking into an establishment on holiday will want to know if it has a deep freeze, an airing cupboard or an airing room.  Factors such as these are important when it comes to making decisions about such holiday destinations, apart from the quality of the water, which is the major consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been success in rural areas in terms of developing the product, through LEADER and similar programmes. We have also diversified it, which is to be welcomed.  As Senator Quinn remarked, the customer is king. We must remember this because if we do not, visitors do not return.  We are operating in a highly and increasingly competitive international environment. Those of us who visited Portugal in the past week will recognise how they have organised their tourism industry and <Col N="1677" /> how immensely powerful it is.  We must be aware that this is the type of product we are competing against in an international market.</P>
    <P>It was always said that if only we had the weather of Spain and Portugal we would have a marvellous tourism industry. That is not true.  The people visiting Ireland expect it to rain and they do not mind it raining.  I have met people from California in the west of Ireland who welcome rain,</P>
    <P>Senator Magner might like to note that I began fishing in Banagher when I was approximately ten years of age.  At that time there were fish in the River Shannon above Meelick weir and there was salmon in Meelick weir.  They are not there now because of the peat that has come down from the Bord na Mona works.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I was a little diffident about engaging in this debate until I listened to it on the monitor and decided to attend the House.  I then realised how unfocused were the contributions, so I do not consider that mine will be any worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely.  My first point is a specific grievance and is in respect of target focusing on a niche market in which many tour operators engage. They select specific categories of person and produce special benefits for them in terms of age and so on.  I especially resent the imposition of single supplements. This is a nasty and unpleasant way of doing business because it means, for example, that somebody like myself who normally travels on my own must pay a considerably increased amount of money simply for the pleasure of an extra couple of cubic centimetres of bed space.  Nothing else is provided.  It is a discriminatory practice and I ask the <Col N="1678" /> Minister to consider at some stage &mdash; whether it be within the provisions of this Bill or not &mdash; the creation of a level playing field for single persons.  We are considerably discriminated against by the operation of the single supplement.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Minister referred to the question of safety conditions, not simply the kind of comfort in terms of locations, but also within apartment buildings.  There was a recent case&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tansey family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The tragedy involving the Tansey family took place on the Canary Islands, which are under the jurisdiction of Spain.  The authorities did everything possible to frustrate the inquiries which the family made.  It became increasingly clear that safety provisions with regard to the insulation of gas fired central heating or water heating equipment had not been entirely complied with in the apartment block and the unfortunate couple had been gassed in the block. The Spanish/Canarian authorities made things extremely difficult for the investigators.</P>
      <P>A number of issues arose from this. One was the question of a general implementation and inspection programme to a kind of European standard of safety for all these holiday apartments. There was a British standard of safety involving the awarding of a kite mark.  Perhaps holidays which meet this standard should be awarded some kind of mark, such as an asterix, so that people would know that they are buying something that has been inspected and that is safe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister or his advisers will be more aware of the technical matters surrounding the Tansey case but, as I recall, there was a problem with regard to jurisdiction and there were some difficulties experienced by the children of the family in bringing matters before an Irish court.  This is something that needs to be examined.  Why should the grieving family have to travel backwards and forwards to make application in the <Col N="1679" /> Spanish courts in a situation complicated by official, bureaucratic obstruction? It should be possible to introduce an amendment which would make the tour operator liable in the country of origin for the standards of safety in the apartment buildings which form an essential element in the package, in other words, the entire package should be made subject to law in the country of origin of the passenger.  I am not sure if this is addressed because the Minister in his speech is slightly coy and says that not all matters raised by this tragic case are capable of being met within this framework.  I am not sure if this one is but it would seem to be very useful to locate total responsibility in the country of origin of the passenger.</P>
    <P>My third point relates to the question of health.  A number of us received briefing material from a distinguished former Member of the House and former Government Minister, Mrs. Nuala Fennell.  The burden of the information she sent &mdash; and I do not believe I will be the only person to speak on this issue &mdash; is that many Irish people are unaware of the risks they run, particularly in what are now termed exotic holidays, for which there are now, curiously enough, packages available.  They are very attractive, particularly for people who want to collect labels and gloat and boast to their friends.  I am having a wonderful time since my retirement. I am saying &ldquo;yes&rdquo; like Molly Bloom to absolutely every proposition that is but to me with the result that I have been in Paris, Lisbon, Barcelona, Beijing and I am just off to Brazil.  As a result, if the House will indulge me, I have a bum like a pincushion from the attentions of the tropical diseases unit in the Royal College of Surgeons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>This is part of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">

    <Col N="1680" />
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  They will be part of the collection I am donating to the State.  People are often not aware of the necessity to get this kind of precaution and vaccination.  I feel quite strongly about it because one of the principal infectious diseases, particularly in the Far East and also in South America, is the hepatitis family; hepatitis A and B are very dangerous, nasty diseases.  I speak with some feeling because, although I was inoculated for hepatitis A when I went to China two years ago, I managed to contract some other form of hepatitis from the drinking water in Eastern Europe, despite the fact that I was careful.  It is an unpleasant, debilitating disease that takes a long time to get through ones system.  Hepatitis A and B can be even more serious than the kind of hepatitis I acquired.</P>
      <P>People are also not always aware of the timescale.  If you visit the tropical diseases unit too close to the time of your visit, you may not be providing yourself with accurate protection.  In the light of this and the fact that there appears to be a decreasing resistance to hepatitis A &mdash; and this was revealed in some medical studies recently &mdash; it would be a good idea if the Minister gave a commitment to ask the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, to consider the production of a health guideline leaflet which would be included, perhaps voluntarily at least in the beginning, with the package brochures.  I am sure the Minister is aware that this exists already in the United Kingdom; there is a &ldquo;Protect Your Health Abroad&rdquo; leaflet.  It would be useful if we had this kind of leaflet produced by our Department of Health with the assistance of the tropical diseases unit in the Royal College of Surgeons.  It would prevent illness; I have no doubt about that.  It would mean that people approached the right authorities in time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, with malaria one must start taking the pills a fortnight before travelling, continue the dose while on holiday and a fortnight after returning. Depending on the part of the world, there are resistant strains of the malaria <Col N="1681" /> infection and travellers have to take a different medication which may not suit them.  With the latest medication &mdash; I cannot remember the trade name &mdash; one person in 10,000 has a severe reaction to it; it is not principally a physically toxic reaction but they suffer from a pronounced clinical depression as a result of the chemical operation of the medication on the brain.  If you start taking these pills about five days before travelling, you may find you are a very depressed little person walking along the Great Wall of China; you might even be tempted to jump off and I am not sure that would be a particularly good thing.  However, if you do feel inclined to jump off, you should at least have insurance so that your spouse and infants are looked after.</P>
    <P>It might be a good idea to make some minimal level of insurance mandatory as part of a package.  I am not sure if it is; perhaps it is.  The Minister is nodding so maybe it is mandatory.  My travel agent almost invariably includes a travel insurance element when I ask him to book tickets abroad for me.  Perhaps it is this baleful influence of Thatcherite economics where they slim everything down and remove the so-called fat from everything in sight, except myself, but I have noticed once or twice that I am not always covered.  A minimal level of health and travel insurance should be a mandatory element in every decent package.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to welcome the Minister to the House and to say how much I have been enjoying this debate. It has been almost as good as a package holiday.  However, it strayed a little over a number issues.  I was interested to hear Senator Norris say that he is accepting every proposition that is being put to him.  I presume that is in relation to travel. I will have to clarify that later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">

    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>On another matter, I want to inform Senator Magner that Banagher <Col N="1682" /> is a town.  They would be upset in County Offaly if he referred to it as a village.  I was delighted to hear the Senator wax eloquently on the attractive features of Banagher and, indeed, of the midlands.  I refer to his trip up the Shannon.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister said today, the purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the EU Directive on package holidays, package travel and package tours.  The purpose of the directive was to harmonise aspects of national provisions relating to package travel in the EU with a view to improving protection for customers and eliminating distortions of competition between the various member states.</P>
      <P>This is effectively a charter of rights for all EU consumers travelling on package holidays.  All of us are aware of the plight of many Irish holidaymakers who found themselves stranded abroad when the tour operator suddenly went out of business or, as has happened to many people, that holiday destinations and the actual services provided did not live up to what was promised in the brochure. The benefits of the Bill are twofold: it will benefit Irish holidaymakers going aboard because of the protection afforded to them and it will also be of immense value to the Irish tourism industry because it will give holidaymakers coming into the country the extra protection that is now required.  The latter will further improve Ireland's position as a tourism destination. This is most important because, as the Minister said, the home holiday business generated approximately £400 million last year.  This is most important to the national economy and it makes a significant contribution to the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total number of visitors to Ireland rose to 3.3 million in 1993, an increase of over 60 per cent on the 1987 figure.  According to the Minister, domestic <Col N="1683" /> tourism accounts for over 20,000 jobs, a substantial number.  Increased tourism and foreign travel earnings amounted to over £560 million since 1987.  This is the result of the huge investment which has been made in tourism, by the private and the State sectors.  The benefits to the Exchequer have been enormous and we all acknowledge that fact.</P>
    <P>It was agreed that I would speak on this Bill after Senator John Dardis took one look at the points made by Deputy Bobby Molloy in the Dáil and said: &ldquo;There is something in there about hepatitis.  I think, Cathy, that is your area so you can talk about it.&rdquo;  However, he was obviously stimulated by the level of debate in the House and decided to say much of what I intended to say.  I will deal with the health aspect &mdash; a point I intended to cover after I had made the points which Senator Dardis stole from me.</P>
    <P>We welcome the Bill and support it. However, some of its provisions, particularly the health measures, are causing some people concern.  We are all aware of unfortunate people who became seriously ill while they were abroad on holiday, perhaps from food they ate or by drinking contaminated water.  This highlights the type of information on health requirements which should be provided to people going on holidays abroad, but also the important issue, as Senator Norris said, of ensuring that people are immunised against infectious diseases which are prevalent in the more exotic holiday destinations to which people are now going.</P>
    <P>The two diseases which are particularly relevant in this context, and which have been raised by other Senators, are hepatitis A and hepatitis B, for which effective immunisation is available.  While the areas of price, accuracy of brochures and cancellations, etc, are important, the risks to people, particularly young people, of the infections they could contract while abroad are very important and should be highlighted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1684" /> Hepatitis A is one of the major diseases from which travellers are at risk. It is a very serious and debilitating infection of the liver and each year ten million people worldwide contract it.  It is transmitted from person to person by the consumption of food or drink which has been contaminated.  People who are infected with the virus are capable of spreading the infection to others before they become obviously ill themselves with the disease.</P>
    <P>Hepatitis A is linked to poor hygiene conditions.  Travellers to parts of the world where standards of sanitation are less than ideal and the public water supply is suspect should be aware of the risk posed by hepatitis A.  Young people, apparently those under 40 years of age, are particularly susceptible because, as Senator Henry said, many older travellers from this country have already become immune to the disease. They have been exposed to it earlier in life, but since our hygiene standards have improved so much, our younger people no longer have that exposure.</P>
    <P>Hepatitis A is not endemic in Ireland, northern Europe or North America. However, the level is quite high in Portugal, Spain and other Mediterranean countries, places to which many Irish people travel.  There is a very high incidence of hepatitis in Africa and South America so a very high risk is posed to Irish people who travel there.  Vaccination is now available against both hepatitis A and hepatitis B, but, as Senator Norris said, it is most important to get the vaccination in time.  Many people get the vaccination too late and they do not have the benefit of its full effect while they are away.</P>
    <P>Hepatitis B is an extremely infectious disease and can cause serious liver disease. The World Health Organisation estimates that one million Europeans are affected every year by hepatitis B and we must accept these figures.  As a result, it would be appropriate if the Bill spelled out in specific detail obligations on tour operators to provide people who are going on holidays abroad with fuller information about health risks.  It <Col N="1685" /> is important that the requirements in relation to health risks in a host country form part of the essential terms of the holiday contract and are spelled out in section 14.  I ask the Minister to consider this aspect.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis mentioned other areas which I intended to cover.  I am sure the Minister has enjoyed his afternoon in the Seanad and some of the Senators' contributions.  Senator Donie Cassidy encouraged us all to go on our package holidays to his area.  I listened to Senator Magner talking about the holidays of his youth, when he travelled from Cork to Youghal on the train.</P>

      <P>A number of questions were raised and Senators suggested amendments to certain sections.  Before addressing these points, I reiterate the importance of bearing in mind that the Bill's primary purpose is the transposition of the EU Directive on package holidays and tours into Irish law.  Ireland is obliged to transpose this directive by virtue of our membership of the EU.  By enacting this legislation we are fulfilling our obligations in this regard.</P>
      <P>A point was raised about the delay in bringing this measure before the Oireachtas.  Senator Quinn complained strongly about this.  The directive was not due to be implemented when it was passed, rather on 1 January 1993.  While it is two years since the process of bringing the legislation before the House started, it is not an unduly long time.  I agree it is longer than desirable and there was nothing preventing its introduction between 1990 and 1 January 1993, but we were not required to do so until that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Magner said, it was the opinion that the trade, as the providers of services, would circle the wagons and try to prevent the introduction of the regulation for as long as possible.  The consultative process was rather lengthy and gave rise to the delay.  However, there is now a new dynamic junior Minister in the Department who has introduced <Col N="1687" /> the legislation in both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to introduce the legislation in the Seanad and that there is such a level of agreement on it. In the Bill we are seeking to strike a balance between the rights of consumers and the cost to the travel trade.  I believe we have found this balance and I understand the travel trade, with which my Department has held a number of rounds of consultations, is generally satisfied with the Bill.</P>
      <P>A number of matters are still of concern to the trade, but a Bill which posed no concern to the trade would have been ineffective.  While there is some flexibility with regard to implementing the directive, it is quite limited.  We must implement it in both letter and spirit and the Government has sought to do this.</P>
      <P>I will now deal with points raised by Senators during the debate.  A number of speakers raised the issue of bed and breakfasts.  Some Members asked whether this legislation will apply to people who offer bed and breakfast type accommodation.  While I understand the reasons for the concern, I assure the House that it is not well placed.  The normal bed and breakfast operation will be outside the scope of this Bill.  The provisions of the Bill will not apply where bed and breakfast accommodation is offered on its own.  In other words, the vast majority of bed and breakfast establishments will not be covered by the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A similar situation will apply where a group of bed and breakfast establishments advertise their existence as bed and breakfast places and mention other services available in the area which would not be covered.  This type of agri-tourism, to which Senator Howard and others referred, will be outside the scope of the Bill because a package is not being presented.  They would be included if they offer not just accommodation, <Col N="1688" /> but either accommodation and travel or accommodation and fishing or golfing as part of the package.  In that situation they are offering a package and the people concerned would be entitled to expect protection in that situation.</P>
    <P>This is a piece of consumer protection legislation which highlights the responsibility of the package provider to ensure that the product and the manner in which it is sold is satisfactory.  While a greater onus is being put on package organisers, nonetheless customers will have to prove their claims and the organiser will not be liable where the customer is at fault.  Senator Quinn said that the word &ldquo;customer&rdquo; would be a more friendlier way to describe the type of person we are talking about.  The customer is the hub and centre of the tourism trade and I accept that.</P>
    <P>One of the problems I would have in accepting an amendment to change that word &mdash; Senator Quinn said that it was used 86 times in the Bill &mdash; would be that it would cause considerable further delay in bringing it into operation and may have the effect of it not being available for next year's travel trade.  One needs a long lead in period to allow the trade to adjust to the new regulations. The travel trade's 1996 brochures will be out in the autumn of this year and if these measures are not put in place well before the end of that term, the trade will not be able to take it into account. It may lead to a further year of delay before we would have the measures in place.  However, I will look at that matter and see if there are any means of including it in the Bill.  I would consider including such a provision in the Bill desirable as long as it does not affect its conditions or terms.  It is an indication of our desire to promote a friendly term for &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; and I accept that it should be &ldquo;customer&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators have raised the issue of health formalities.  The Deputies in the Dáil were concerned about overburdening the travel trade with requirements to provide information in this regard.  We are sticking <Col N="1689" /> closely in what we now have in the Bill to the terms of the directive.  While I agree that it is highly desirable for the customer travelling abroad to be given the fullest possible information in good time so that he can put it into practice, this is neither the business of my Department nor this Bill.  However, I will raise the matter directly with the Minister for Health so that the type of measure that is in vogue and in practice in Britain, where this type of information is available to all those travelling abroad from there, would be available to people travelling abroad from here through the travel trade.  I will ask the Minister for Health to bring in that type of information package on a voluntary basis.  If it does not work effectively on that basis, I am sure the Minister would consider bringing it in on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>The area of safety was also raised. The Bill will require and make liable the organiser or supplier of the service for anything less than the requirements of the country in which the service is provided. For example, the tragic Tansey case was mentioned.  Section 14 (c) of the Bill deals with that situation to some degree insofar as it will be a requirement that compliance with the law within that state will be a requirement for the supplier of the service.  If that had been in place prior to that tragedy, there would have been an opportunity for that family, or anybody else similarly affected, to take a case in the Irish courts.  That will be available in the future.  We have met the problems raised by that case as far as we could under this measure, and I am conscious that the EU Commission is currently looking at safety regulations for gas appliances to be applied to national legislation across the EU.  In that situation the organiser or retailer could be sued by the customer.  I have dealt with the delays in implementing the directive. The point that it was not due to be implemented until 1993 might have been missed by some of the Senators who commented on that area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1690" /> Senators have also expressed concern about the possibility that the implementation of the directive will result in large increases in holiday prices.  I do not expect any such large increases as a result of the legislation.  Additional costs, if they arise, will be because of the need for package providers to have additional insurance cover in respect of the activities of providers of accommodation abroad.  The travel trade business is highly competitive and this will have its own effect on keeping prices steady. I am satisfied that some of the figures used in the previous Dáil debate &mdash; I am glad to say that they were not used here &mdash; were way over the top and there was no basis for them.</P>
    <P>I will look at the possibility of changing the word &ldquo;consumer&rdquo;, which is mentioned 86 times in the Bill, to &ldquo;customer&rdquo;, but it could create a possible danger, which is the reason I am not saying that I will not accept it, although I see it as highly desirable.</P>
    <P>Some of the other points raised by Senators are not pertinent to either this Bill or my Department.  For example, I was not dealing with the additional charges for airline tickets or hotels for single people in this Bill.  However, I have dealt with health risks in this Bill and I will pursue that matter with the Minister for Health and ask that the system in place in the United Kingdom be established here as well.</P>
    <P>We are seeking to transpose the new directive as speedily as possible into Irish law to give our consumer protection and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The Freedom of Information Bill, 1995, is intended, by me and my party group, to address a real need which has long been recognised by all political parties.  Ireland's system of public administration ranks among the most secretive and centralised to be found anywhere in the developed world. With secrecy and bureaucracy comes a loss of confidence on the part of individual citizens who lose faith in the system that serves them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1692" /> The Bill I am presenting is an attempt to restore the confidence of citizens through measures which would improve a fundamental civil right.  The term &ldquo;fundamental civil right&rdquo; is not exaggerated in this context.  As it stands, people's access to information which is held in public institutions is seen very much as a privilege, and it is that perception which breeds public suspicion and which is probably responsible for a good deal of the cynicism that exists in this State.</P>
    <P>The central tenet of the Bill is to make access to all information in public administration a right.  When the light of public scrutiny is shone into the darkest recesses of public administration it is my belief that it will show up much that is good.  The citizen will be able to view those parts of the system which function capably and which would serve him or her well.</P>
    <P>Equally, it is my belief that it will illuminate many practices which are occasionally slipshod and sometimes ineffective.  In this case it will give us all the chance, for the first time, to take effective remedial action so that the rights of individual citizens can be vindicated and their entitlements always assured.</P>
    <P>It has been said that Ireland's public administration system protects its most commonplace file as if it contained the secret of eternal youth, a formula which must at all times be protected from vulgar public gaze.  Less fancifully, as far back as 1969, the report of the Public Service Organisation Review Group, the Devlin report, made the serious point that Ireland's public administration &mdash; and in particular the central administration &mdash; is secretive, operating behind a veil of anonymity and, accordingly, is far removed from the very public that it is meant to serve.</P>
    <P>There is a gulf between public administration and the citizen.  This Bill will effectively bridge the gap between the administrator and those whom the administrator is intended to serve.  The modern bureaucratic state, by its very nature, generates a mountain of information <Col N="1693" /> on individual citizens, public projects, operations, schemes and future policies, yet the vast bulk of this information is denied to the citizen.</P>
    <P>There cannot be a single public representative in this House or in this country who has not received daily requests in their clinics and advice centres for more and better information on any one of a host of issues that affects the lives of the citizen daily.  There cannot be a public representative who has failed to come to the conclusion that the inability to access this information is leading to a real credibility gap between ordinary men and women and their administrators.</P>
    <P>In a democratic state, where the citizen is seen as sovereign, the free access of every citizen to information is, in my view, a fundamental issue.</P>
    <P>A free society has nothing whatsoever to fear from freedom of information but a society which allows its public administration to be conducted with an air of suspicion, where concealment is the first order of the day, cannot escape the inevitable cynicism of its citizens.  Over all the years in the history of State, cynicism has grown up because there is a gulf between the citizen and the State. It is an axiomatic truth that the more information the citizen has, the better she or he will make an informed decision.  Our public administration has functioned for too long on the presumption that our citizens are not capable of making those informed decisions and I, like, I am sure all Members of this House, feel that this is not acceptable. This Bill aims at changing all of that. Ireland is not some socialist Orwellian state where information is the prerogative of some elite: this is a democracy, where freedom and information must be the right of all.  In any developed country, information is power.</P>
    <P>Only by allowing access to information to all will power begin to be equally distributed in our society and only by giving a distribution of information can we empower the citizens to more adequately look after their individual affairs.  Two broad approaches <Col N="1694" /> can be adopted in this matter.  One approach is to establish an information bureaucracy within the State machine &mdash; and this has been done in many countries &mdash; to handle the citizens's requests for information.  The second approach is less complex.  It simply provides that all information is made available on demand, on a statutory basis, to the citizen, with the minimum of exceptions; exceptions only required for the security of State or to protect the rights of a named individual.</P>
    <P>The second approach of simply liberalising access to all information is the one which is adopted in this Bill.  It is, in a sense, a far more radical approach than putting in place a structured bureaucracy.  It avoids the propensity to censorship which would exist within any bureaucratic structure.  No matter how one structures an information bureaucracy, the reality and the experience is that it becomes secretive in itself.  The approach, as proposed in this Bill, does not require any costly staffing structures. It also ensures that information is provided to the citizen on a value-free basis and not subject to any spin to protect the political powers that be at a particular time.  It is important that any information system that is put in place interposes the minimum of regulation and the minimum of structure between the citizen and the information that the citizen is seeking to establish.</P>
    <P>I want to turn to the Bill itself and to explain some of the elements of the Bill. Section 1 of the Bill is self-explanatory. It outlines the central feature of the Bill: the creation of an automatic and statutory right of each and every citizen to information in the public domain.  It is wide in its concept and universal in its application because, as will be seen in a few moments, the Bill is drafted in a way that will cover the bulk of the public administration.</P>
    <P>Section 2 deals with definitions. Documents are defined in this section in the widest possible way.  It is interesting to try and establish a meaning for the word &ldquo;document&rdquo; because information comes in so many different guises.  I <Col N="1695" /> have tried to establish the widest possible definition; and if Members had a view to extending that definition further, I would listen.  All State agencies are also included in the definitions part of this Bill and I have tied the Bill, particularly on the issue of State bodies, to a number of other pieces of legislation which provide us with the necessary scope and cover.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill provides that all documents, including those drawn up by an institution and those submitted to an institution, are to be made available to the citizen.  It is important that two way traffic in information be available to the citizen.  Section 4 recognises that in certain exceptional cases access must be either denied or limited.  It provides for the making of ministerial orders which, naturally, would be the subject of scrutiny by the Houses of the Oireachtas and of public debate.  Again, I have taken a somewhat conservative approach here because it is important that ministerial orders can be made so that the Bill itself does not have a detrimental impact.  That would never be my wish.  Incidentally, the Minister to make the orders would be the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with general exceptions. The second general exception in the list is the minutes of Cabinet.  Again, given recent legislation and court actions, I wondered about this; but there is, within our Cabinet system of Government, an arguable case for such an exclusion and many other pieces of legislation have a similar exclusion.  The first of the three general exceptions is proposals, drafts or unfinished documents. An unfinished or partially completed document, which is prepared purely for internal use, would give a misleading view if it were made accessible. The intention is that a document would be available when it is completed. Finally, I have excluded, as a general exemption, documents which are graded from time to time by the Oireachtas on a statutory basis as being confidential. We can all think of many cases of statute <Col N="1696" /> law where specific types of documents are excluded, either completely or partially.</P>
    <P>I followed this section with a number of specific exceptions in section 6.  The first of these is that documents which contain information on matters of significance for the security of the State, for relations with foreign powers or international organisations or for the country's defence should be excluded on a specific basis.  Again, this is a commonplace practice in information legislation and is one which will probably follow in this country.  There are a number of documents which are also regarded as exceptions under section 6 (1) (b) (i):</P>
    <P>out of consideration for the proper execution of the state and local governments' financial, pay and personnel administration,</P>
    <P>Clearly, documents on issues relating to internal negotiations, such as on a wage settlement, are something which the State would have to hold until discussions were completed.  Under section 6 (1) (b) (ii), I have also made provision for exclusion of documents where public accessibility would thwart public regulation and control.  One can foresee circumstances where people involved in criminal activity or activity which would be against the interests of the State or of the body of citizens would be given an unfair advantage or could thwart the State and the regulatory bodies if they were given access to information.  That should be a specific exclusion.</P>
    <P>The next exclusion is for documents which affect an individual's personal affairs.  This is, of course, unless the document on the person is released with the consent of the individual.  Documents provided to various State agencies, such as the Revenue Commissioners, would not generally be made available under freedom of information legislation because they could be damaging to the individual or they could be used where people wanted to pursue a prurient interest in some other person's affairs.  I have excluded those, but <Col N="1697" /> I have inserted a provision which would allow for the exclusion to be overcome or subvented if the person involved was prepared to give the necessary permission. I have also provided for the exclusion of documents which contain information about technical devices and procedures.  What is intended here is to protect patented papers and documents to avoid damaging the commercial interests of an individual.</P>
    <P>Documents on appointments or promotions in the public service are another general body of documentation which Members will find excluded in freedom of information legislation.  I have excluded it here, although there is a cogent case to be made for such documents to be made available, at least on a more limited basis, and I will be interested in the views of Senators in this regard.  Examination papers and reports clearly fall into the category, given that we are in the examination season, as do documents relating to long term budgets or internal financial planning.</P>
    <P>I have provided under section 7 of the Bill that documents which fall under section 6 shall be publicly accessible when, because of the lapse of time or for other reasons, it is obvious that the considerations which justified their exemption in the first place no longer apply.  Any of the exempted documents under section 6, which because of the lapse of time are no longer sensitive, should be within the public domain.</P>
    <P>Section 8 states:</P>
    <P>The public institution shall decide, out of consideration for the proper conduct of public business, how a document shall be made known to the person who asked for it, and so far as possible [should] provide upon request a copy or transcript of the document.</P>
    <P>There are practical considerations and sometimes it is not possible to lay one's hand on a file immediately.  However, section 8 is basically providing that rationality and reasonableness should apply in that case.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1698" /> An appeals procedure is provided for in section 9.  A refusal to make a document available must be given in writing and an appeal would then lie with the Ombudsman.  This is an entirely reasonable provision and it would not be an onerous extension of the remit of the Ombudsman's Office.  I believe, incidentally, that, as the provision of information is part of proper administration, the Ombudsman would be the appropriate body to oversee that.</P>
    <P>I have also provided in section 10 for permission for an individual to grant access to certain documents.  Under section 11, the Minister for Finance is empowered to make detailed provisions for the implementation of the Act.  The balance of the Bill is simply the normal citations.</P>
    <P>I have kept the provisions of the Bill to a minimum as I believe that legislation should be minimal rather than copious.  A Bill governing the rights which a citizen should have to information should be easily accessible, in the sense that any citizen, untutored in the fine black arts of parliamentary draftsmanship, should be able to pick up the Bill and understand such rights as she or he enjoys.  I believe that this Bill has much to commend it.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Minister of State has been working for the past two years on a freedom of information Bill and I know that she shares my enthusiasm and energy for this matter. However, it is regrettable that it has taken so long to bring forward the Government Bill.  I recommend the Bill which is before the House as an honest effort to move this debate forward.  If this House adopted this Bill, with amendments &mdash; we will be open to amendments from all sides &mdash; we would make history in that we would be making a piece of administrative law &mdash; which, I hope, would be endorsed by the other House &mdash; extending the rights of the citizens of this State into an area where their rights should never have been withheld.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Roche for his work in bringing forward this Freedom of Information Bill.  As he knows, I have a deep commitment to this area and I have already undertaken very extensive work in bringing forward legislation on freedom of information here.  There was a commitment in the Government programme to have my legislation before the House by Christmas.  In that context, Senator Roche is doing us all a public service by initiating debate in this House on the issues surrounding freedom of information. I listened very carefully to his contribution and he made very good points in relation to the importance of information as power and opening up a new relationship between the citizen and the State.</P>
      <P>Work on my Freedom of Information Bill is at a very advanced stage.  We have completed a draft Bill which is now being studied by Departments &mdash; Senator Roche will be very familiar with the process of circulating memoranda from his days as a civil servant.  We hope to put it before the Government within the next number of weeks and, at that stage, my Bill will be sent to the draftsman's office for its pristine English to be turned into legal language.</P>
      <P>What my Bill sets out to achieve is nothing short of a transformation in the way our system of Government works, in particular, how it relates to the public. We want to transform a system which has looked inward and replace it with one which looks outward to the public which it serves, and which is accountable to the public.  Freedom of information is designed to redress the balance between the citizen and the State in favour of the citizen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill which I have prepared is framed against a recognition that our democracy has matured but needs to be underpinned.  As government grows more complex, it is even more important to give access to the citizen to information held by the State on individual citizens, and information in <Col N="1700" /> relation to the whole operations of Government, to ensure that accountability remains the cornerstone of the operations of Government.  This has been recognised in other democracies and, in coming late to freedom of information in this country, we have the advantage of being able to learn from the experience of other democracies and base our legislation on best practice abroad.</P>
    <P>In the course of preparing this freedom of information legislation, we have undertaken a major study of similar legislation in other jurisdictions.  We have paid particular attention to those which, like ourselves, are based on the Westminster model of Government and the common law.  However, it did not stop there as we also looked at other regimes, such as the United States and European countries including Norway, on which Senator Roche's Bill appears to be extremely closely modelled.  I want to tell the Members that, with their agreement, I will be recommending to the Government that this important legislation would be introduced in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Before commenting on the specific aspects of the Bill before us, I would like to tell the House the main lessons learned through hard experience abroad.  We would be failing in our duty if we simply brought in legislation which gave us the illusion of freedom of information without paying particular attention to those features which, from experience abroad, ensure that freedom of information actually works in practice.</P>
    <P>There are five key features of successful freedom of information legislation. The first is a purpose clause which establishes a legal presumption of openness. It is a very powerful instrument and experience abroad suggests that if it is not included in this kind of legislation, the individual trying to get information from Departments can be disadvantaged, in other words, the balance is tilted against the individual in favour of the State and we are trying to help individuals in their dealings with the State. <Col N="1701" /> A purpose clause puts the onus on the bureaucracy to justify why information was not released and is of particular importance in the case of appeals against a refusal to release information because it sets the ground rules for deciding on appeals.</P>
    <P>A second important feature of well functioning freedom of information legislation is a public interest test.  As Senator Roche acknowledged, there will have to be some exceptions to the general availability of information on issues such as security, relations with foreign governments and budgetary information. This is widely accepted in jurisdictions which operate freedom of information. However, it does present us with a challenge &mdash; to ensure that exemptions are not over used, or used in such a way that public confidence is undermined.  That is why it is important to protect the public interest when the legislation is being framed.  Experience abroad indicates that effective legislation provides for the consideration of the public interest in key exemptions. Otherwise, all information could be buried under particular exemptions and instead of opening up the system, as we are trying to do, we would end up closing the system or enabling the bureaucracy to close up the system.</P>
    <P>The third important consideration is the definition of exemptions.  Exemptions must be very carefully and clearly defined in the legislation.  If they are loosely cast, they leave open the possibility of being used against the requester, or eagerly used by the public servant who is more used to withholding, rather than releasing, information.</P>
    <P>The fourth consideration is the whole area of time limits and a prompt response.  Delays in processing requests for information undermine public confidence in it.  Experience abroad clearly shows the need to specify explicit deadlines before which requests must be answered, and the need to assist people in their quest for information.</P>
    <P>Fifth, it is important that there is a powerful independent appeals mechanism in place as this is at the heart of successful <Col N="1702" /> freedom of information legislation. This means giving the appeals commissioner or ombudsman powers to access material, interview officials and examine information, so as to issue informed findings.  Responses to appeals must be prompt and efficient.  Experience abroad also tells us that an internal review mechanism is very useful.  It mediates and resolves disputes between individuals and public bodies and works to prevent a build up of cases before an appeals commissioner or ombudsman.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, Senator Roche's Bill does not address these issues in the kind of detail which is required if we are to have a Freedom of Information Bill which actually works.  We are both trying to have an information regime which transforms and revolutionises the delivery of public information and actually succeeds in opening up the system to the public which we are trying to serve. My fear is that a loosely framed Bill, such as that before us, could prevent the release of information.  Its exemptions, for instance, could be widely interpreted.</P>
    <P>We have looked carefully at how freedom of information works in jurisdictions similar to our own.  In particular, it is important to take into account that we have been operating in the culture of the Official Secrets Act since the foundation of the State.  It is a culture where information is kept hidden and where Government Departments and public bodies do not easily share information with the public.  In the public service the Official Secrets Act has left a legacy which will take some time to overcome.</P>
    <P>That is why we need a freedom of information Bill that is powerful, that has the type of detail necessary to make it work, that looks at the experience of countries which have freedom of information legislation which has not worked particularly well and that identifies the features of such legislation abroad which have been the key to successfully functioning information regimes.  The legislation we are framing takes such considerations into account.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1703" /> It is not sufficient to simply state principles and hope they will work.  We need to do the homework.  I share Senator Roche's frustration that such homework takes time.  However, we have done that homework over the last year and we have good legislation which will shortly come before the House.  The legislation in preparation will deliver what both Senator Roche and I are trying to achieve &mdash; to genuinely open up the operations of Government to the public. It is important to build in mechanisms that are flexible enough to deal with problems as they arise.  That is critical to the success of legislation.  We do not want the legislation to fall at the first hurdle.</P>
    <P>It is also important to look at access to personal information concerning oneself. Ninety per cent of requests under freedom of information legislation abroad are requests for personal information. It is important to specify in some detail how that will operate.  We must look at provisions analogous to those in the Data Protection Act whereby individuals can seek to correct information which public agencies may have about them on file which may be incorrect.  It is important that citizens can know the rules and regulations by which their individual cases are judged. It is important &mdash; and this has been a problem with the American legislation &mdash; that individuals are given a guide to the information that is available.  Otherwise they will be faced with a huge indigestible mass of information and will be unable to access it.</P>
    <P>I share Senator Roche's concern about the American situation where a huge information bureaucracy of private consultancies has developed which broker information from the public service to individuals.  Individuals are really not in a position to access that information themselves.  It is important that we establish mechanisms to ensure that access to information is not a theoretical right for citizens but that it works in practice.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1704" /> I am delighted that there is crossparty agreement on the need for and the value of freedom of information legislation. That is why I welcome Senator Roche raising the issue in this way.  In the long term, freedom of information legislation will transform the way Departments do business and, in particular, how they deal with the public.  If the legislation is effective it will mean that accountability will become a reality rather than just an aspiration.</P>
    <P>I look forward to being before this House in the autumn to introduce the freedom of information legislation.  I look forward to the debate which will take place on the issues and principles surrounding freedom of information. These are important issues and principles for the way Government works, how it interacts with the public and how our democratic system operates.</P>
    <P>I again thank Senator Roche for his commitment to the principles underlying freedom of information.  I look forward to his comments on the Government's Bill when it comes before the Seanad in the autumn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to say a few words on freedom of information.  Since the foundation of the State we have operated what I call the &ldquo;oyster policy&rdquo; with regard to information.  Everything is clammed up and we must prise out each bit of information.</P>
      <P>An interesting system has evolved which we on the Independent benches find most entertaining.  Nowadays when teachers hear of an additional teaching appointment in a school they do not do so by way of a letter from the Department or through an official method of communication; they find out by way of a phone call from their local public representative. That tells us much about how we regulate information in this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Information is power; it is the gravy train of influence.  The way it has been jealously guarded and carefully doled out &mdash; and this is not a reflection on any particular Government &mdash; means that <Col N="1705" /> the bearer of the good news is given the information in order to be such a bearer of good news and is thereby rewarded later.  The trickle down effect of carefully guarded dosages of information is the reason for this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given a most incisive and interesting contribution.  I am sure she will be the first to agree that the saddest thing is that there is a need for this legislation.  If Government operated in a satisfactory way this legislation should not be necessary.  Not a week goes by when I am not frustrated by lack of access to information.  It happens time and time again.  The policy appears to be that the person who guards and who can release the information is the person with power.  That applies everywhere.</P>
    <P>I can give an example of how that system works.  This week a briefing document was sent to every Member of the Oireachtas.  On one page there was reference to a calculation whose conclusive figure was £20 million or £30 million.  I could not figure out how that conclusion was reached.  I contacted the two Departments involved and asked for the calculations which led to the conclusion that the proposal was costed at £20 million or £30 million.  This was something that was in the public domain and about which the Minister had taken the trouble to brief every Member of the Oireachtas.  I cannot get that information and I find that extraordinarily frustrating.  I went one step further and asked them to indicate the assumptions that were made in order to make the calculations which led to the concluding figure.  I still cannot get that information. That practice leads to mistrust in what the public service is about.  If the public service is responding to the needs of the public and is supposed to make information available it should make such information available.  There was nothing confidential about my query.  It will not surprise the Minister to hear that it refers to teachers' pensions. However, it could be a different issue next week.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1706" /> I also agree with the Minister's statement that 90 per cent of requests for information relate to personal information. That is another aspect of this issue.  The personnel sections of the public service have files or packages of information of a personnel and personal nature for each public service employee. In most developed countries employees would have access to that information with perhaps an embargo for a period of years on certain aspects of it.  Let us say, for example, that somebody applies for promotion to a particular position and fails to secure it.  The basis on which the decision might have been made should be made available but it is not available.  I could speak at length about this issue.</P>
    <P>My other huge frustration is that not a month goes by but I have an argument with the personnel of one Department or another.  My bottom line always is: if you do not give me the information I will simply put four questions down in the Dáil to secure the information.  It will then cost the taxpayer a great deal of money, it will cost your Department a great deal of time and I will get the information at the end of the day so could I please have it now?  That is disgraceful. The whole business of Dáil questions is disgraceful.  I would love to be a Minister long enough to answer a question during Question Time by saying: &ldquo;You can have that information by dialling 1234567, extension YZ&rdquo;.  In that way we would save the taxpayer money. There would be greater accountability because, if the information was wrong, there would be a way to deal with it.</P>
    <P>The appeal should not simply be about the need to access information. There is also the question of misinformation and disinformation.  There is a growing need for accountability in that area.  I see documentation issuing on a regular basis which goes far beyond putting a policy spin on information but is, in fact, misleading and inaccurate.  Inaccurate might be a subjective term but there should be some way of establishing whether people are being misinformed through a process of disinformation. <Col N="1707" /> This is critically important, particularly in light of the current debate on ethics and accountability in public life.</P>
    <P>There is an extraordinary amount to be done.  I concur with every one of the issues which the Minister of State said should be included in a freedom of information Bill.  I will support the Bill before us tonight until such time as the Minister of State brings forward another Bill.  I agree with the issues she suggests should be in a Bill.  Any Bill without them would be flawed.  I hope the Minister of State will intervene in the process to ensure we can deal with those issues.</P>
    <P>My father always held the view that there were two outstanding lacunae in the legislation of this State since its foundation: the absence of a freedom of information Act and a privacy Act. Both are equally important.  It is important to guard jealously the personal details of people's lives when the public does not need to know them. Both matters could well be dealt with in the same legislation.</P>
    <P>If the Minister of State is correct, what is lacking in Senator Roche's Bill is some method of determining whether somebody is complying with the legislation. I missed the beginning of Senator Roche's contribution and I do not know how he envisages dealing with this point.  Since it would be cumbersome in the extreme to have to go to court to establish that somebody was not acting within the requirements of the legislation, it is crucially important to have a regulator or commissioner.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Government's legislation but we should support this legislation until we get something more comprehensive from the Minister, and the sooner we have that the better.  I ask the Minister of State to let the openness, transparency and freedom of access to information, through some process of osmosis, to trickle down or move through Government and Departments so that we would have less need of this legislation.  It would, indeed, be a victory to create a climate where we would <Col N="1708" /> have access to information without recourse to the law.  It is unfortunate that legislation is required to change attitudes.</P>
    <P>Most people have an instinctive understanding of what should be kept private.  It is an issue on which many of us must make a judgment on a day to day basis.  Common sense is often the best regulator in those instances.  Can we move forward in line with what is being talked about here without the hackneyed use of terms such as openness and transparency?</P>
    <P>Access to information is important and could save the time of public servants and Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I do not see why there should be an Adjournment debate on an extension to a school in Dingle.  That information should be made available and it should be known to be available. While such information is subject to control, it is almost a political coup to say that one dragged information out of a Minister through an Adjournment matter or a question.  Much of the heat would be taken out of these issues if a person could say they rang the Department and got the information.  Could we move towards that?</P>
    <P>The present Taoiseach has had two views on this matter.  He has always taken the view that parliamentary questions are expensive and there should be an easier way to deal with them.  I recall that, as spokesperson on Education, he put down more education questions than any Education spokesperson ever known.  The joy of the current Taoiseach is that he is open to all sides of an argument.</P>
    <P>Access to information is crucial.  It is necessary to create a sense of accountability, access to and availability of information in order to understand public policy.  Until the Minister of State introduces legislation, which sounds attractive and I would be happy to support, I will support the only other legislation available.  Do not ask why I did not draft a better Bill myself because I have not done so.  I support this Bill and I look forward to the Minister's Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to have this debate, I thank Senator Roche for introducing this Bill and I pay tribute to the Minister of State for her commitment to the legislation on which she is working at present.  As other Senators said, this is a radical and necessary change, not just to our legislation but to the culture of Irish society. The results of freedom of information legislation will be widespread and radical in terms of how it affects our attitude to public life, public bodies, Government, legislation and so on. There is definitely a them and us culture which is at best passive in the context of public bodies and public information.  If it is not passive, it tends to be frustrated and sometimes angry because there is a feeling that information that should rightly be available to people is not. This legislation is long overdue in that respect.</P>
      <P>We live in a culture where, as is specifically stated in the Official Secrets Act, unless information is specifically authorised, it should not be given.  This legislation tries to turn that on its head and provide that information should be available to people unless there is a particular reason it should not be given.  It is a totally different approach to information. In that context the Minister's indication that there would be a purpose clause in the legislation on which she is working is important.  This purpose clause would establish a legal presumption of openness.  It would be presumed that information should be available unless there are specific reasons it should not.  Her emphasis on a clear list of exemptions in the legislation is essential if there is to be no ability to hide behind badly framed exemptions.  It will be clear what is exempt and what should be in the public domain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1710" /> One cannot over-emphasise how this will change our approach to information. As Senator O'Toole said, information is power.  By giving the public information we are enabling people to become full citizens and to play a greater role in public life.  This is actually much broader than the question of freedom of information.  We have had a number of debates here; for instance, we had one on the newspaper industry a couple of weeks ago and we debated the whole area of education.  We debated the Green Paper on Broadcasting, which the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht published.</P>
    <P>There is a whole discussion around people's right to be full citizens, to take part as of right in decision making.  To do that it is necessary to have access to the kind of information that has at times been withheld from the public.  In giving that information to all citizens we are giving them the right to to play a fully informed role in public debate.  That goes a long way towards ensuring that we have a mature society which makes decisions on an informed basis, rather than the kind of society in which we tend to leave such decisions to others because we feel that we are not part of the decision making process, the kind of society where information is available to only a small number of people.  That is not the way an informed democracy should operate.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that she has been getting information on how freedom of information works in other countries.  A number of different countries could be cited, including EU states like Denmark, Holland, France, Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg, Sweden and Finland.  All those countries have freedom of information legislation, as do Canada, the US, Norway, Australia and New Zealand.  It is appropriate that we learn how their legislation operates so that ours will be the best possible legislation and will operate in the most open way possible.  In countries like Sweden, for example, the culture of freedom of information has ensured that theirs is a more participative <Col N="1711" /> democracy than we have had here or in Britain because of our culture of secrecy.</P>
    <P>We have all come to expect the kind of experience Senator O'Toole described, but with this legislation we will no longer expect that.  We will, I hope, react in a way that will ensure that people will use the legislation in a positive way, with positive results both for society and for the institutions that have not been used to disseminating that kind of information.  Freedom of Information legislation has to benefit those institutions as well as benefiting the public.</P>
    <P>It is probably necessary to define the scope of the legislation, to state what sort of bodies should be covered under the legislation, whether it would just be Government Departments or whether other bodies which receive public funding and which hold information that would be of interest to the public should also be included.  I have a book here called <i>Democracy Blindfolded: The case for a Freedom of Information Act</i>, which was circulated to all Members of the Oireachtas.  It suggests including all sorts of bodies such as the blood transfusion service board, universities and schools, the Office of Public Works, corporations and health boards, Bord Fáilte, the Abbey Theatre and so on.  I am interested to know what the scope of the legislation will be.  Not only the Government and the Civil Service but many other bodies have information about people, so I would be interested in how broad ranging the legislation should be.</P>
    <P>The Official Secrets Act is the legislation under which information has been kept from the public.  I hope that the forthcoming legislation will lessen the effect of the Official Secrets Act to some extent.  I know there have to be official secrets, but I hope that the Official Secrets Act will be superseded in its spirit by the Minister's Bill.  We have a culture of secrecy and anonymity which we need to replace with transparency and democratic accountability so that information is given freely to <Col N="1712" /> people.  We should have the intention of giving the information unless there is a good reason not to.  The commitment to this legislation is in the Programme for Government and it was being prepared under the last Government, which is a clear indication that all sides of the House favour such legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that 90 per cent of information sought abroad is about personal issues.  The Minister has signalled her intention not just to give people the right to find that information about themselves but also the right to make comment on that information and if necessary to amend it if they consider it to be wrong, misleading or misinformed.</P>
    <P>The other type of information is policy information, which is generally available to Ministers and officials but which is not normally available to the public. In order to access that kind of information it is necessary to know how it is kept, what sort of information particular bodies have and what functions they perform.  The public needs guidelines as to the kind of information they have and how to access it.  If people do not know where to look it will be difficult for them to find out what they need to know.</P>
    <P>References were made by Senator Roche, by the Minister and by Senator O'Toole to the need for an independent appeals system.  The preferred option is some kind of information commissioner, whether it be the Ombudsman or somebody specifically appointed to this area. An independent appeals system is essential if people are to feel that they are being fairly treated.  It is important that this is done properly.  The Minister is consulting widely to ensure that she gets feedback from all of the interested parties as well as the public.  Tonight's debate is part of that process.  It is important that the legislation works and that institutions and individuals are not able to hide behind legislation which is intended to provide openness.</P>
    <P>There is a broader aspect to all of this. I hope that young people will be taught how they can relate to public bodies <Col N="1713" /> while they are in school so that they know what information is available, how decisions are made and on what basis they are made.  In this way people will learn to use the available information. Most of us have seen &ldquo;Yes, Minister&rdquo; on television.  The culture parodied in that programme, where as much information as possible is kept from the public and the Minister, is the culture we want to move away from.</P>
    <P>I was at the Bell Table arts centre in Limerick last night where two dances were presented.  One was by the Dagda dance company, which is based in Limerick. The whole theme of the dance was people's frustration in dealing with bureaucracy.  There was a little box on stage with an official in it.  The other dancers were all dancing around this box, forming queues, trying to jump queues and trying to get the attention of the person in the box.  It was a very educative experience as well as being entertaining, but at the end of the performance they turned the box with the official in it upside down so that the official could not get out.</P>
    <P>I do not know what message was meant to be conveyed by the dance, but the message I received was that the public is becoming so frustrated with its inability to deal with bureaucracy and to get information out of the person inside the box that they eventually just turned him on his head.  That is anarchy and we do not want that either.  I hope that by introducing effective and well thought out freedom of information legislation we will avoid having to turn bureaucrats on their heads and that we will develop a society with a fundamentally different approach to what we inherited &mdash; a culture of keeping information from the public &mdash; and that instead we will give information unless there are clear reasons why it should not be given.  I welcome the fact that we are discussing Senator Roche's Bill tonight and that the Minister is committed to introducing well thought out, wide-ranging and copperfastened legislation in this area so we <Col N="1714" /> will be able to develop that culture of openness.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Miss Ormonde Miss Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I congratulate Senator Roche on initiating this necessary discussion tonight.  Listening to the debate so far, there seems to be all party support for it.  Freedom of and access to information is a basic concept.  We should be able to get information whenever we want it.  That is a fundamental right of anyone seeking information.</P>
      <P>Why have we suddenly become aware that we do not have access to information? We have grown up in a society in which we have been inhibited.  I suppose it is because of the way we were brought up and the fact that our Civil Service is a throw back to the ultra secretiveness of the British Civil Service. We are still learning how to open doors.  We have an open education system and most young people are educated. They ask questions at an earlier age than previous generations, which did not experience such openness, which had an inferiority complex and always looked to their elders and superiors and did not dare to ask a question. This was probably a throwback to our education system where three or four decades ago people listened and took in information and did not question anything.  Educationalists are now telling people to ask questions and to do research rather than to rote learn, which is also the philosophy of life today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Freedom of and access to information should be the right of every citizen. People should not have to go to their public representative when they seek information.  They should only have to make a telephone call or write a letter to get information.  When citizens ask me to get information or documentation, I find a closed door.  I get a gobbledegook reply &mdash; I call it a Civil Service reply &mdash; which I cannot send to the citizen because he or she would not understand it.  I often got a letter from a Department which I had to read three or four times to try to get its message. Sometimes sentences continue for ten <Col N="1715" /> lines rather than briefly making the point in simple English.  It shows that civil servants have been trained not to give information, because people will look for more.  I have learned the hard way from my experiences dealing with public servants.  I ask local authorities, in particular, to give simple answers.</P>
    <P>We live in a democracy where power devolves from the people.  Members are able to put down questions and to get replies in that way, or table a motion for an Adjournment debate.  I do not know why we get gobbledegook replies because we can get the information anyway. It would save time and trouble if doors were opened and we could get access to information.  We understand that there are areas where information cannot be given, and perhaps the legislation would highlight them.  When doing research I could not get information from Departments dating back to the 1960s and 1970s.  I do not know why they would not release the documentation.</P>
    <P>I understand we have studied models from Sweden, New Zealand and Australia in this regard.  We should be able to open doors.  Our population is educated and should be able to assess information. We have one of the best leaving certificate programmes in the world.  To say that the people would not be able to assess information and that they should be kept in their place and not given information is to say power corrupts and that people in high places control.  If we open doors, that control is weakened.  It reflects an inferiority complex on the part of those who do not release information. We should look at our strengths and give out information which we should be able to stand over.  It would be a much healthier society if we were to do so.  I hope this legislation will not be put on the long finger.  This is a welcome discussion.  We should open doors and move forward because we have the potential to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and the introduction of <Col N="1716" /> Senator Roche's Bill, which gives the House an opportunity to debate a matter that is fundamental to our democracy. Late converts are always welcome and I am delighted that Fianna Fáil, albeit belatedly, has recognised the need to tear apart the veil of secrecy which has in the past shrouded the workings of Government.</P>
      <P>Over the years we have become accustomed to under the counter Government.  Our Constitution contains no specific vindication of the public right to know.  Successive Governments have used provisions ranging from Cabinet confidentiality to the Official Secrets Act as a pretext for denying the public access to the most innocuous information.</P>
      <P>Central Government is not the only culprit in our culture of secrecy.  Local authorities are notoriously reluctant to divulge information.  This is true of environmental information in particular. EU Directive 313/90, which provides for freedom of access to environmental information, has still not been fully implemented by many local authorities. I hope that future freedom of information legislation will pay particular attention to this area.</P>
      <P>Together with its Coalition partners, Democratic Left is committed to transparency in Government.  Senator Roche will be aware that the programme for <i>A Government of Renewal</i> contains a number of specific commitments in this area.  I understand that the work on this is already well advanced.  I welcome the fact that it is to be introduced in the Seanad also.  In addition, the Government is committed to reviewing and updating of the Data Protection Act, reviewing the Official Secrets Act on a regular basis and the introduction of a referendum on Cabinet confidentiality. These measures together with the freedom of information legislation will form a comprehensive package designed to vindicate the rights of the citizen and make the State more accountable to the individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, the Bill proposed by Senator Roche is extremely limited in <Col N="1717" /> its scope.  It contains a number of proposed exemptions which, I believe, would render its provisions virtually useless.  For example, the legislation would give the Minister the right to make regulations limiting accessibility as he or she sees fit which would give future Ministers a virtual licence to censor. In addition, section 8 provides that public institutions may decide how a document is to be made available and that they shall, as far as possible, provide a copy or transcript.  The words &ldquo;as far as possible&rdquo; are a favourite legislative cop-out.  I do not believe we should go down that road.  If freedom of information legislation is to have any impact, its implementation must be guaranteed and regularly monitored and a comprehensive appeals procedure must be established.  I welcome Senator Roche's proposal that any refusal may be appealed to the Ombudsman.  However, citizens should also be entitled to full information on the reasons for an appeal being refused.  There should be a charter of information rights stating the maximum time which the processing of a request can take.  An independent review and appeals mechanism should be incorporated into the legislation.</P>
    <P>Freedom of information legislation is long overdue but the hasty introduction of an ill-considered legislative measure will serve no one.  I am confident that the legislation to be introduced by the Government will strike a workable balance between the rights of the individual, considerations of security and the public's right to know, which must be at the heart of any democracy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister.  I compliment her on her speech.  I think we have seen another good day for parliamentary democracy in the Senate.  I am now becoming an enthusiast for the Seanad and its role within the parliamentary system.  First, we had the Arterial Drainage Bill which produced overdue and welcome legislation from the Government.  Now we have Senator Roche's Bill which, if I read the Minister's speech correctly, will have a similar <Col N="1718" /> effect in this area.  Perhaps the Opposition voting majority can be used responsibly and to good effect.  We hope that it will continue in this vein.</P>
      <P>I do not regard Senator Roche's Bill as ill-considered or rushed.  It has been very well considered given the resources available to the Senator in drafting the Bill.  I welcome the Bill and support it. That is not to say that some of points made by the Minister could not be used to improve the Bill.  I believe it could be improved but that is true of every piece of legislation that comes before the House, even legislation which has gone through its tortuous passage through the Lower House.  Areas are frequently found where Bills can be improved and I believe this one can be improved.</P>
      <P>The central problem is the question of exemptions.  How do we define what should be exempt?  We can all think of things which should be exempt. Obviously, there should be exemptions where State security is involved.  Files of that nature should not be subject to public scrutiny.  Senator Manning, as a historian, might find himself at a disadvantage if he could not consult the files after a period of years when they are revealed in the Library.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>We could draft the Bill in terms of knowing which files were available and which were missing.  There is a question of balance.  The basic problem in the system we inherited is that the balance is one which says that information should not be revealed, rather than that information should be revealed and the circumstances defined where it should not be revealed.  That is the fundamental change taking place in attitudes.  We now believe that society has a right to know and that that is a fundamental right.  It was probably a vestige of colonialism which created the attitude that we should not know, that there was a simple peasantry which could not be trusted with valuable information which should be reserved for <Col N="1719" /> functionaries in Dublin Castle or the centre of colonial power.</P>
      <P>I believe it is a vestige of colonialism and probably a vestige of totalitarianism. It was the sort of attitude which said that negroes could not be trusted to govern themselves because they did not have the required educational or mental capacity.  Thankfully that sort of nonsense is gone.  However, it strikes me as curious that a republic which went to great lengths to show that it was distinct from the British model, has based itself on that model in so many ways.  We inherited a Civil Service and parliamentary system from Britain.  I believe the parliamentary system is a good one. Nevertheless, I believe that is the origin of the system which said that information was power and should only be revealed in exceptional circumstances. The consequence of this is that it leads to a suspicion in the public mind that, always and ever, there is a conspiracy and that Departments and local authorities are trying to hide things.  That is not the case.  There are times when they do wish to conceal things or are not as forthcoming as they might be but the consequence of the system we have inherited is for the public to assume that there is something being done to prevent them from knowing.</P>
      <P>As a member of a local authority I can say &mdash; Senator Ormonde was one of the people who referred to this frustration &mdash; that it is extremely frustrating to receive replies from local authorities and Government Departments which must be read and reread to discover the substance of that reply.  Having done that rereading it is discovered that the objective of the reply was not to give information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take, for example, a sewerage system being built locally.  The local authority is contacted to find out the up to date position of the process and how long the work is likely to take.  One reply is received and the Department of the Environment is then contacted. Another reply is received which totally contradicts the first.  I have seen replies <Col N="1720" /> from Departments which are totally contradictory to the replies from local authorities.  The only logical conclusion to be drawn is that somebody somewhere is not telling the whole truth.  I can assure the House that such fundamental contradictions do arise.</P>
    <P>People have a right to know what is in their medical files.  If, as a patient of the hospital, I have a right to know what is in my file, then I have a right as a citizen to know what is in a planning file in my local authority office or Government Department.  If, as someone who has a computer, I am required to register that I have information data on the computer, I also have a right to find out what data are in Government Departments with the proviso of knowing what are the exemptions.  I do not know where the line should be drawn but my feeling is that we should be as liberal as possible and that as few things as possible should be concealed.</P>
    <P>Senator Sherlock spoke about environmental information.  The Minister for the Environment recently circulated a document which showed what we are entitled to know about the environment. This is a reasonable model for other Departments and should be extended.</P>
    <P>I am disturbed by what I describe as administrative ping-pong.  This goes back to the point I was making about the relationship of local authorities to central Government.  Those of us who are public representatives, particularly those of us who are members of local authorities as well as Members of Seanad Éireann, know very well what I mean by &ldquo;administrative ping-pong&rdquo;. Information gets bounced from place to another but never seems to land anywhere. It is always in the air so that we cannot nail down what it is we are trying to find out.  As Senator Ormonde said, this leads to a significant amount of frustration.</P>
    <P>In the beef tribunal report Mr. Justice Hamilton said that if questions had been answered in the Dáil there would have been no need for the tribunal.  That is a very telling point and demonstrates the <Col N="1721" /> need for answers to legitimate questions to be given fully and openly.  I am not confident that, when we raise matters on the Adjournment or go through the expensive process of asking parliamentary questions on routine information we should have been given earlier, we always get the information.  We are so limited in the cross-examination which can be conducted that, when answers are evasive and continue to be evasive, it does not lead to us finally finding out what is the information.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the exemptions could be widely interpreted and I think she is correct about this.  I am flexible as to where the line should be but, in my view, the balance should be in giving the information as fully as possible. She made an interesting observation at the end of her speech.  Perhaps she is party to information to which I am not. She said she looks forward to Senator Roche's comments on the Government's Bill when it comes before the Seanad in the autumn.  She is obviously confident that Senator Roche will return to us after his by-election campaign in Wicklow.</P>

Deputy Higgins was as to when the legislation will come before us.  This <Col N="1722" /> is a prudent course of action on her part.  She suggested the legislation will come before the House in the autumn and I look forward to this.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister. Over the last two years she has shown herself to be a good reforming Minister and not afraid to stand on the odd corn or to say the odd unpopular thing.  She has been a breath of fresh air and has tackled issues which needed to be tackled and which are only now coming on to our political agenda.  This has been a good debate and I welcome it.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis made the point, which I think the Minister will appreciate, that one of the good effects of a debate like this is that, rather than putting pressure on a Minister, it strengthens the case of a Minister who is seeking to get legislation through Cabinet more quickly than might normally be the case.  The fact that there is all party agreement on the principle and need for this legislation will strengthen the Minister's hand and indicates the extent to which the political culture of this society has changed over a comparatively short time.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis made the point that, in my historical research, I may find that files are missing and this is the case. Files which do not make it into the National Archives can be of great interest.  Over the years I have gone to the archives at the beginning of the new year to look at the new batch of files. One of the great games is to guess which files have been kept back; the files which are kept back are always far more interesting than those which get through.  In fairness to the State and the people who work in the National Archives, the vast majority of files come through and are available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reading old Dáil debates, a person would be struck by the extent of the secrecy culture in our society.  Over 30, 40 or 50 years Ministers from all parties went out of their way to give as little information as possible at Question Time.  Frequently answers were given in the negative and no supplementary <Col N="1723" /> questions were allowed.  Replies such as &ldquo;The matter will be dealt with in due course&rdquo; were given.  When it was asked what period of time was &ldquo;in due course&rdquo; the reply was &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo;. When it was asked when is &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo; the reply was &ldquo;in due course&rdquo;. Looking at the old parliamentary records, it is extraordinary to see how little insistence Members made on their rights to know.  It was almost as if the secrecy culture was accepted.</P>
    <P>This culture permeated all aspects of Irish life such as education, as Senator O'Toole pointed out, the church, health and hospitals.  It affected people's rights to know throughout the entire system, even to the extent that the so-called Government Information Bureau was there almost to prevent information being given.  It was not until Mr. Muiris MacConghaíl became head of the Government Information Services in 1973 that a real attempt was made to put on a professional basis the dissemination of information to the media and the wider public.</P>
    <P>This was also true of journalists and our journalist culture.  I have often heard of journalists in these Houses who, in the earliest days of the State, were legends in their lifetimes.  It was often said that they died with information in their heads which they never committed to paper.  They became the confidants of politicians because they listened and did not speak or write.  This may not have been all bad.  We may have gone a little too far the other way today.  Senator O'Toole spoke about not only a right to information but a right to privacy, and there are issues here which must be balanced.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to bring in legislation before society is ready for it.  To have introduced this legislation five or ten years ago would have been too soon because society would not have been able to accept it naturally.  The Minister, as she outlined this evening, seems to have a grasp of what society wants and will be able to absorb and take at present.  This is why I look forward very <Col N="1724" /> much to the continuing debate on the Bill.</P>
    <P>What is important on Second Stage is the general welcome which has been given to the Bill and the support the Minister has.  Where this Bill goes from here is a matter for the House.  The Minister has pointed out certain deficiencies in Senator Roche's Bill.  I would agree from what I have studied of these deficiencies that the Bill to a certain extent &mdash; and Senator Roche admits this &mdash; has been largely borrowed from the Norwegian experience. Perhaps on Committee Stage we might be able to have the deficiencies ironed out.  I suspect it needs a more fundamental and radical overhaul.  To a great extent authorship and ownership are not what matters.  What matters is that the principles the Bill seeks to express are fully debated in both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given a commitment that she will recommend to the Government that her Bill be introduced in this House.  I know that if she recommends this to the Government, it will agree and the Bill will be introduced here as soon as it is ready.  This evening we have got off to a good start.  We have had a discussion which I hope will be taken further when we resume the Second Stage debate on Senator Roche's Bill. For the information of Members who were not here at the beginning, although no date has been fixed for the continuation of this debate, it will not conclude this evening, by agreement. This is to suit Senator Roche.</P>

The continuation of Second Stage is to be agreed and I suspect it may not be for a couple of weeks.  If the Minister is right, it will continue; if she is wrong, the Bill may have to find a new sponsor. <Col N="1725" /> Be that as it may, I am delighted it has brought the subject into the open.  This has been a positive and good debate, passionate in ways, and it augurs well for the legislation the Minister will put on our Statute Book before long.</P>

      <P>I compliment Senator Roche for bringing forward the Freedom of Information Bill.  It is important legislation and the Government must accept it.  The Minister's reply indicates moves to make information available without interfering with the system in place at present.  I agree with that, but I have had experience of obtaining information from various Departments and local authorities.  I can understand that certain information from the Judiciary and the Garda on the security of the State should not be readily available.</P>
      <P>As Senator Manning said, if a person makes an application to any Department of State, he will be told someone is looking into the matter.  Over the years I have heard complaints from constituents about agricultural and other issues. When I made representations to the Department I would be told the matter was under scrutiny, was being examined, was on file, or was being investigated. As an elected representative on a county council and in the Oireachtas, I felt I should be entitled to look at the file.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of years ago in my county, Kerry, the practice was that if a planning application or other file was submitted, a councillor could see it to find out who the objectors were or who was interfering with the file.  The councillor did this in a discreet way.  This suddenly changed to a Civil Service system, whereby the bureaucracy within the local authorities kept the information to itself.  The only way elected representatives <Col N="1726" /> could obtain information was through a motion in a county council or the Oireachtas or a reply from a Minister.</P>
    <P>The right to information is important for citizens.  It should go further; if a person is refused a loan by a bank or other institution and a file has been put in place by another party, the individual should have the right to look at it so he can reply and redeem his name.</P>
    <P>This is an interesting Bill and a worthwhile debate.  The Minister will have to examine it because it goes to greater depth than most people would expect; it covers all the institutions and structures of this country.  I compliment Senator Roche for bringing it to the House.</P>
    <P>I will listen with interest to what Government Members say about the right to information.  For years they have sought it and now it is within their power to give it.  Will they give information to citizens who are refused social welfare allowances, housing allocations or other funds for which they may justifiably apply?</P>
    <P>These are the important aspects of the right to information.  A citizen may have to ask someone like Senator McGowan to inquire of a section of a local authority why he will not be given a reconstruction loan or a disability grant.  At times the Senator may not be able to get the information.  We have been elected by the people to represent them and we should be entitled to be given information for them.</P>
    <P>This should happen not only in local authorities but in other State institutions and banks.  It should not happen within the Garda because certain information on the security of the State must be held back.  However, if a citizen has entitlements under the Constitution or otherwise, he should be entitled to see these files.  We will watch the Minister closely on this matter because it is important not only to us but to all citizens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Senators, I welcome the introduction of this Bill to the House.  I am glad that through a discussion <Col N="1727" /> of freedom of information the issue of suppression of information has been brought before a public forum, because it has beset this country, among others, for many years.  It is easier to get information from a local authority than a Department.  Perhaps this has something to do with the fact that in the past civil servants thought that if they gave out too much information they might lose their jobs, or that the Ministers for whom they were working might know too much and, therefore, might upstage them.</P>
      <P>Freedom of information is a fundamental right, but it also brings responsibilities. In the age of high technology, we cannot allow hackers to get into our semi-State or private organisations.  If we have freedom of information we must ensure that hackers of any description will not be able to access information which they should not have.  This applies to our private as well as our public lives.  No one could envisage the day when information about every individual in the State would be open to scrutiny. That is the danger when we talk about freedom of information.</P>
      <P>As regards the excesses which occurred in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, information was disseminated by people working for the state and this was one of the reasons for the fall of the former monolithic single party states of eastern Europe.</P>
      <P>A clear definitive line must be drawn between public and private information in this Bill, or in one which I hope the Government will introduce in the near future.  When the Minister introduces her Freedom of Information Bill &mdash; if this Bill is not accepted, although I hope it will be &mdash; there must be a clear definition between the dissemination of information which is useful to the public and freedom of information on private matters between people or public institutions, including banks, as was mentioned earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand why we only find out what is in a Bill, which has been talked about for months, when we get <Col N="1728" /> our post on the morning that the Bill is going through the House or when it is hinted that it might be introduced in a week's time.  This makes it difficult for any Member of the House to analyse the Bill.  One must then work from the Minister's speech or the explanatory memorandum, which are not as easy to follow as they should be.  We should be told about what will be included in legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the draft Bill will be sent to the draftsman's office to be turned into legal language &mdash; in other words, make certain that the public will not know what it contains, but that the legal profession will.  The inference is that the public is stupid and does not understand English, but lawyers do. They will make hay from the modalities of language which are of no importance to ordinary people.  Language is supposed to give people the opportunity to learn about things.  Legal language is nonsense.  Language would be simple and understood if parliamentary draftsmen did not exist.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>A draftswoman would make it more simple.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>If parliamentary draftsmen lost their jobs, Bills would be easy to read and they would possibly withstand the scrutiny of lawyers or judges, because it would be the language of the day and not the modalities of language which legal people use.  We should speak in plain English rather than legalese.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned five main areas where problems have arisen.  She said that the purpose clause &ldquo;puts the onus on the bureaucracy to justify why information was not released&rdquo;.  The onus should not be on the bureaucracy, but on the Minister and the Government. Bureaucrats produce the language in the Bill, but the Government should produce the legalities.  The onus should not be put on the bureaucracy unless the Minister considers herself a part of it.  If that is so, she is not taking into account the difference between <Col N="1729" /> what the bureaucrats want, what the Government wants and what the people want in legislation.</P>
    <P>Public interest means different things to different people and trying to define it in a Bill leaves it open to challenge.  I am not sure how one can deal with the public interest to ensure that exemptions are not overused or used in such a way that public confidence is undermined. Public confidence in what and undermined in what way?  If I or the public require information on the drafting of legislation in order to determine where the Government is going, one cannot say it is not in the public interest to give out such information.  If discussions are taking place on a Bill, it is in the public interest that every piece of information required by the public should be available to it.</P>
    <P>I agree that there must be exemptions for national security &mdash; we must be extremely careful in this area &mdash; and that these must be clearly defined.  We must also define national security. National security in Russia has produced the most repressive groups of people.  In America the Central Intelligence Agency decided to eliminate Governments in the public interest.  It did so much against the rights of the person that it is difficult to think what is or is not in the public interest in terms of security.  The public has a right to know the Government's responsibilities to it.  It is extremely difficult to determine if this is being adhered to.  If the exemptions are loosely cast they leave out the possibility of being used against the requester, or by the public servant who is more used to withholding information.</P>
    <P>This is a broad area and the problem is how to define it.  Indeed, I am not sure if exemptions should be in place at all. This does not mean that people should not be able to discuss the pros and cons of various aspects of decisions that are being made.  In addition, if somebody came up with an idea contrary to the opinions of the majority, it could be used against the person making it.  In <Col N="1730" /> view of this, the exemptions must be clearly and carefully defined in the legislation, yet it is virtually impossible in a Bill of this kind to do so in a way which would give the public the freedom of access to the thinking behind legislation while at the same time giving protection to those drafting legislation or rules and to those who propose contrary ideas without having such ideas brought into the public forum where others could be badly hurt.</P>
    <P>Areas such as the prompt response and the appeals mechanism can be worked out very easily.  A prompt response system would have prevented the previous Government from falling and perhaps could have avoided the Government's present difficulties. Within a family, business or any other group, prompt response is a courtesy that should be extended and should not have to be a legislative requirement. Those who do not give a prompt response to a request act extremely discourteously and against their own interest.  As recent events have illustrated, such actions are against the democratic process and created the problems which led to the fall of a Government.  In addition, the extreme embarrassment of the Government arose because a prompt response did not materialise because of the self-interest and arrogance of certain people in a certain office.  This arrogance dictates against democracy, the public interest and the wishes of elected Members.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that, unfortunately, Senator Roche's Bill does not address the matters outlined in her five points. There are other points that could be addressed in a different manner.  Nevertheless the Bill presented by Senator Roche would give the public access to information and, as far as possible, to those who need it.  His Bill contains protection for the State &mdash; perhaps overprotection &mdash; and protection for the individual.</P>
    <P>We cannot go far enough.  Why should there be official secrets legislation? What have we to hide?  We are <Col N="1731" /> not going to invade Russia in the morning and if it decides to invade us it will do so, whether we have official secrets legislation or not.  The Bill addresses problems which have been in existence for many years in a cogent and specific way.  It is facetious to suggest that it is the Norwegian Bill or the Finnish Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">

      <P>It would not be the first Bill presented to the House that was copied from other legislation.  If it was good enough for the Norwegians, it could be good enough for us.  Hopefully the Minister's Bill will include the same provisions and will be enacted.  I ask her to consider the excellent terms of this Bill when drafting her legislation and to ensure that her Bill will protect the individual as far as possible and not allow for information to be given about private individuals in their private capacity.  This is the only danger emanating from any freedom of information legislation because other information should be in the public domain.  There is no reason Ministers should know more about what is going on than a backbencher or somebody who has an interest in legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  She is conscientious enough to bring the message I will give her to the Minister for the Environment. I do not often raise local authority matters in the House even though I have been a Member for some time.  I <Col N="1732" /> ask the Minister to take this Adjournment Matter seriously.</P>
      <P>The Ballybofey/Stranorlar sewerage problem has been in existence for 11 years.  The population of the area totals almost 3,000 and we have no sewerage system.  We had a small box along the River Finn which was washed away in a flood and the raw sewage is now going into the river, a tributary of the River Foyle.  I have with me a submission to the EU for funding to develop the River Foyle.</P>
      <P>Some weeks ago, the Minister for the Environment made available £2 million for sewage disposal works for Ballybofey/Stranorlar and Muff.  This may appear to be a generous contribution and we welcome the initiative. However, it was offered after a long time &mdash; 11 years.  This is not a political statement; I am not attaching blame to the Minister.  I have made similar representations to several Ministers and Governments, so it is not a new situation.</P>
      <P>However, what is new is that the planned development of the Foyle Estuary involves the two Governments.  In addition, the Foyle Fishery Commission has a substantial development plan for the development of the River Foyle.  It is conscious of the fact that there are at least two raw, untreated sewage outlets, one at Ballybofey and the other at Muff and at a number of other small towns, such as Killygordon, Castlefinn and Lifford, which have no means of sewage disposal other than to allow the untreated sewage enter the river.</P>
      <P>We feel the Minister has not done enough.  After waiting 11 years and after an other Minister was prepared to give £4 million to complete the sewerage provision in Ballybofey/Stranorlar, we believe the present Minister has not done enough, especially when the £2 million he provided is INTERREG funding.  The reason INTERREG funding was provided is that this is untreated sewage going into a tributary of the River Foyle where there is an application for EU funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1733" /> That situation cannot be allowed to exist.  There is nothing political in this.  I am obliged to bring this matter before the House and I must bring a message back.  What is the current situation? How many more years do we have wait? Are we going to be fobbed off with a promise that we will be included in provisions down the road at another time?</P>
    <P>The current situation in the Ballybofey/Stranorlar area is that we have a major development plan for the twin towns.  A limited company, formed by 12 energetic business people, is collecting £5,000 per month.  There is no other small community doing that.  It is their contribution to an environment plan.  Every Minister I ever knew said they would respond when there is a contribution from the local people, and that is as it should be.  I appeal to the Minister to consult with the Minister for the Environment to try to persuade him of the need to provide sufficient funding, not only for the treatment works but to provide a sewerage system.</P>
    <P>The environmental plan is now at a standstill.  The International Fund for Ireland has given some funding toward the environmental plan in the Ballybofey/Stranorlar area.  They ask whether the streets of the town and the backstreets will be ripped up to provide a sewerage system.  The Minister for the Environment should make a statement supporting the Ballybofey/Stranorlar development plan and a new sewerage system for the town that has waited so many years for it.</P>
    <P>In this day and age we have stone drains carrying sewage in a progressive town in the centre of Donegal.  The town is close to the Border and has suffered quite seriously from the deprivation that has take place over the last 25 years.  The people themselves are doing something about the problem. The local authority is prepared to help. It has provided a environmental plan that is acceptable and encouraging to the business people.  It would be unfair, and less than the expected response, if we are told we got £2 million, which is <Col N="1734" /> INTERREG funding, and we will get nothing from the Government.</P>
    <P>I am saying nothing more here than what I said at the local authority meeting in Donegal as my colleague, Senator Maloney, knows.  This is not an outburst. I have assessed the situation.  Our sanitary services engineers dragged their feet.  They were part of the problem for 11 years.  A person has to be vicious, angry or frustrated when he calls for somebody to be sacked in a local authority if he is within a few years of retirement.  I have been at that point because the people of Ballybofey/ Stranorlar cannot accept the situation prevailing there any longer.  I implore the Minister of State to take this issue seriously.  I hope the Minister for the Environment's response will be positive. If it only states that the Minister will endeavour to include Ballybofey/ Stranorlar in future developments, that will not be sufficient.  I am sorry, but for the reasons I have given, it will not be acceptable in the prevailing situation. First, the development plan for the River Foyle, which is jointly managed by the two States, North and South, through the Foyle Fisheries Commission, has a problem in that the EU will not continue to fund their application if there is not a positive response here.  Second, the Minister and the Government must recognise people who partly fund their own projects. There are not many situations like this in the country.  Other people look for handouts.  They want somebody else to come along to solve their problems.  I ask the Minister for a positive response.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Minister for the Environment, I thank Senator McGowan for raising this matter.  The Minister is aware of the need to provide a sewage treatment works for Ballybofey/Stranorlar.  This twin township on the River Finn is the commercial and industrial centre for a large agricultural hinterland.  It is an area which has also seen considerable housing <Col N="1735" /> expansion since the early 1970s, resulting in extensive use of septic tanks.</P>
      <P>Despite scarce resources, considerable progress has been made in recent years with the provision of water and sewage treatment facilities in County Donegal.  An important new water supply scheme in now in place for Killybegs at a cost of some £18 million.  Only recently, the Minister turned the sod for the Pollan Dam Scheme, a major water supply scheme for Buncrana, which is estimated to cost £27 million.  Donegal has therefore enjoyed high priority in the apportionment of resources for water and sewerage services.</P>

    <P>Under the EU Initiative, INTERREG 2, the Department of the Environment operates a joint sub-programme for environmental protection with the Northern Ireland authorities. This sub-programme will expand the work of INTERREG 1 in recognition of the potential contribution which the physical environment can make to economic development.  This applies particularly to tourism and industrial development. The protection and conservation of the environment provides a strong basis for North/South co-operation.  In particular, the Border areas offer considerable <Col N="1736" /> scope for co-operation in relation to the management of water resources and the control of pollution.</P>
    <P>As part of the Department's programme under INTERREG 2, Donegal County Council has received approval for funding for the Ballybofey/ Stranorlar Stage 1 and Muff sewerage schemes.  Muff sewerage scheme has been allocated £1 million and the Ballybofey/Stranorlar Scheme £1.9 million. In addition, a total of ten projects have been approved for the county under the small schemes measure of INTERREG 2, at a further total cost of almost £1 million.</P>
    <P>Stage 1 of the Ballybofey/Stranorlar sewerage scheme consists of the provision of a secondary treatment works to cater for the existing and future sewage loads.  Treated effluent will be discharged to the River Finn.  While a number of issues remain to be resolved before contract documents can be approved, Donegal County Council are seeking to complete the planning of these works very shortly.  The Minister is confident that these matters can be resolved so that this project may be advanced later this year.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.09 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 8 July 1995.</P>
