      <P>On behalf of the House, I thank Senator McGowan for chairing this part of today's business.  I have great honour in proposing Senator Liam Naughten to be Cathaoirleach of Seanad Éireann.  Our last Cathaoirleach left an indelible stamp on the office of Cathaoirleach.  He did this because he <Col N="834" /> respected the office, he did not seek to personalise it and he upheld the highest standards of integrity and impartiality in the Chair.  In proposing Senator Naughten, I am conscious that he follows in the tradition of the late Seán Fallon.</P>
      <P>Senator Naughten is an experienced Chairman.  He has been Leas-Chathaoirleach since 1989 and we have all seen at first hand his fairness, his courtesy and his honesty.  Senator Naughten is not confrontational but he is firm.  He has a strong sense of this House and a great respect for the office of Cathaoirleach.  He will bring to the office of Cathaoirleach his vast experience, his patience and firmness, his fair play, his integrity and a great sense of natural courtesy and personal goodwill towards all Members of this House. Most of all, he has a sense of humour which, in the office of Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, is a quality often called into play and is much needed.</P>
      <P>I have great pleasure in proposing my good friend.  Senator Naughten for the high office of Cathaoirleach and, in so doing, I thank the parties of the Opposition, and especially Fianna Fáil, for continuing the tradition of sharing the top offices in this House.  It is one of the things that contribute to good relations in this House and it is much appreciated.</P>

      <P>Molaim toghadh an tSeanadóra Liam Ó Neachtain mar Chathaoirleach.  It is a great privilege and personal pleasure to second the nomination of my good friend and colleague, Senator Liam Naughten, to the position of Cathaoirleach of Seanad Éireann.  In his 21 years in public life, he has given distinguished service in the various roles in which he has served. Senator Naughten has served as Leas-Chathaoirleach since 1989 and has carried out his duties to the satisfaction of Senators by his fairness, his knowledge of procedure, his good humour and, at times, his patience.  All these qualities give us confidence that he will continue to serve with distinction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="835" /> The Seanad has come through difficult times in the past few weeks with the loss of our Cathaoirleach, the late Senator Seán Fallon, who did so much to improve and maintain the workings of the House to the highest standards. We all owe it to his memory to ensure that the fine tradition is continued and, with the devoted support of our loyal staff, I am confident that it will be.</P>

      <P>I thank most sincerely my proposer, Senator Manning, and my seconder, Senator Cosgrave.  I also thank the Members of my party for selecting me and the Members of the House for electing me to the most prestigious position in this House.  We are all extremely conscious that we wish things were different and that this occasion did not arise as a result of the death of our Cathaoirleach.  However, I want to assure Members that I will endeavour to continue the same high standards, fairness and efficiency in which he carried out his duties.  I also wish to continue the reform which has commenced in this House over the previous few years as it has been beneficial to the Members of <Col N="836" /> the House and the people whom we have the honour to serve.  I intend, with the co-operation of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, to continue that work.</P>
      <P>It was a great honour for me to serve as Leas-Chathaoirleach of this House for the last five and a half years.  I have worked in co-operation with the Clerk, the Clerk Assistant and the other staff in the Seanad, past and present, and it has been a great honour for me to have worked with those people.  I have no doubt they will show me the same courtesy and kindness which they showed in the past, and that that will be extended to every Member.  Their door has always been open and my door will also be open.</P>
      <P>I thank every Member most sincerely. Our job is to make the Seanad an efficient and effective democratic institution.</P>

      <P>I have great pleasure in formally offering my congratulations to you on your election.  It is a great tribute to you that all parties and groups in this House have welcomed your election.  It is reassuring to hear you believe that the process of reform of this House, which has been ongoing for the past couple of years, should be continued.  I wish you every success in the high office which you now hold.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Group I extend our congratulations to you.  We have seen over the past number of years, in your role as Leas-Chathaoirleach, your fair mindedness and impartiality in running the House. On many occasions the late Cathaoirleach, Senator Seán Fallon, confided in me the high esteem in which he held you.  If a member of the Fianna Fáil Party was not to take his place, I am sure he is very happy that you have taken over the most onerous task of Cathaoirleach.  I assure you of the respect and courtesy of my party and wish you every success and a long and happy stay as Cathaoirleach of Seanad Éireann.  Congratulations.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Independents, I congratulate you on your appointment.  While today must be tinged with sadness for you because of the death of our late Cathaoirleach, I am sure you will continue not only with the fairness and efficiency which he showed but also with his great good humour.  With two such women on your right hand, who could fail to run the Seanad in the manner in which it has been run to date?</P>

      <P>I expect that you will explain, as Cathaoirleach, in the kind way you have, to both Senator Honan and myself that when we cannot speak on various amendments we can, of course, speak on the section.  This will lead to an even more exciting time for some of us in the Seanad while you are Cathaoirleach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I join with other Members in extending our congratulations to you.  It comes as no surprise that your election was unanimous, given that you have served a very distinguished apprenticeship and have always conducted matters from the Chair in a very even handed and courteous manner.  There must be something about Athlone because it has produced its second Cathaoirleach in succession and we miss Senator Fallon very greatly. If you can continue the tradition and standards he set for us, you will have done very well indeed; I know that is your intention.  You have our support and we look forward to working with you in the future.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Labour Group I congratulate you on your unanimous election as Cathaoirleach and we will fully support you.  I have no doubt that you will continue in the fine tradition of the late Senator Seán Fallon in promoting and facilitating consensus in the running of this House.  I know you worked very closely with him as Leas-Chathaoirleach, <Col N="838" /> as a friend and as a colleague from the area.  In your five years as Leas-Chathaoirleach you have shown the same standards and attitude to the House of promoting consensus and working with all groups.</P>
      <P>Our group will not be contesting the position of Leas-Chathaoirleach which falls vacant on your election as Cathaoirleach.  We support the tradition of an Opposition Senator filling that post.  We believe that facilitates the operation of the House and constructive rather than confrontational debate, which is very much the style of this House.  That results in a positive input to legislation and public debate and we are very anxious to continue that tradition. I wish you well and assure you of our full support in your role as Cathaoirleach.</P>

      <P>A Chathaoirligh, ba mhaith liom comhghairdeachas a dhéanamh leat ar do roghnú d'aon ghuth mar Chathaoirleach ar Sheanad Éirinn.  Tá súil agam go mbaineadh tú taitneamh agus sásamh as do théarma mar Chathaoirleach.  Tá mé lán cinnte go gcomhlíonfaidh tú do dhualgaisí go diagrasach agus go dícheallach agus go dtabharfaidh tú cothrom na féinne do gach ball den Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very pleased to have the opportunity to express to you my warmest congratulations and very best wishes on your elevation to the high office of Cathaoirleach of Seanad Éireann.  I probably know you for longer than any other Member of the House as we were both elected to Roscommon County Council in June 1974.  Even though we were on opposite sides of the political divide, we have had a friendly and cordial relationship over the last 21 years. You served as Chairman of Roscommon County Council and, more recently, as Chairman of the Western Health Board.  In both offices you carried out your duties with courtesy, efficiency and impartiality.  For almost six years you have carried out your duties as Leas-Chathaoirleach in a similar manner.  I am satisfied you will be <Col N="839" /> a worthy successor to our much loved colleague, the late Senator Seán Fallon, and that you will uphold the high standards he set in the office of Cathaoirleach. I wish you a happy and successful term of office.</P>

      <P>It is a great honour for you and your family that you have been elevated to this high position.  I join with my colleagues in congratulating you and wishing you well.  We have known each other for many years; we come from the same electoral area of Roscommon County Council and our paths have crossed on many occasions during Seanad election campaigns.  You have done an excellent job in the offices you have held over the years and I am satisfied you will do the same as Cathaoirleach. As I said, your election is a great honour for you, your family, your county and your party and I wish you well in the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I add my voice to that of Senator Henry on behalf of the Independents. I speak as one of those who became Members of the House two and a half years ago and, therefore, I speak as a rookie who witnessed the efficiency and fairness exercised by the late Senator Seán Fallon.  I am convinced that what we saw in him was not just efficiency and fairness but also a sense of humour which I know you also possess. Those of us who became Members over two years ago have been impressed with your firmness and dedication and your commitment to making this House carry out the work entrusted to it.  I know I speak for everybody in the House when I offer you congratulations, wish you well and praise you for your effort and work over the last two and a half years.  The fact that your election is not contested is evidence of the great regard, respect and confidence the House has in you.</P>

      <P>I wish to be associated with the congratulations offered to you on your attainment of the position of <Col N="840" /> Cathaoirleach.  I have no doubt you will perform as efficiently and effectively as you did when you were Leas-Chathaoirleach. Senator Dardis said that Athlone has now had two Cathaoirligh in a row. Roscommon has had three in a row as far as the Chair of this House is concerned. Beir bua agus beannacht Dé leat sa Chathaoir.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>For you, your wife and family this is a day in your political career which is unsurpassed.  We are all delighted with your success.  Even though your county, Roscommon, has challenged my county, Galway, many times in the football arena and is now taking us on in hurling, I am delighted for you.  You have a high standard to follow in the late Seán Fallon, who was outstanding in every sense of the word and we all miss him greatly.  We have great confidence in your ability and know you will adhere to the highest standards.  You have a great deal of talent, you are unassuming and you are eloquent without being verbose.  We can look forward to distinguished leadership from you.</P>
      <P>One of your greatest qualities is that you believe in public representatives, regardless of political affiliation, and you will see to it that Members, regardless of the parties to which they belong, will get fair play at all times.  I congratulate you, wish you well and hope you have an enjoyable, successful and long term as Cathaoirleach.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate you on your elevation to this high office.  You carried out your duties as Leas-Chathaoirleach in an exemplary manner.

I am sure that, because of your experience over the last few years and the manner in which you conducted affairs in the House in the absence of the Cathaoirleach, the burden of office will not be too heavy on you.  I wish you every success and will give you every co-operation.</P>

You are good humoured and you have great patience, particularly with some of us who became Members for the first time two and a half years ago.  You, the late Senator Seán Fallon, and the staff of the Seanad Office ran the House and made it look easy but this was obviously due to the efficiency, professionalism and competence of all those behind the scenes.  I wish you a successful term as Cathaoirleach.  This is a great day for you and your family.</P>

      <P>I come from a neighbouring county and we see this as much an honour for the west as for you, Mary and your family.  Perhaps the best way of describing your standing in our part of the country could be reflected in the feeling of disappointment, which transcended party politics, on the loss of your Dáil seat in Roscommon.  I do not mean to raise this to cause pain but to express the deep esteem in which you are held by people across the political spectrum.  Perhaps that is the greatest tribute that can be paid to anybody, if one thinks of the biblical reference of no man or woman being a prophet in their own land.  County Roscommon, the west and County Leitrim are particularly proud of you and I wish you well in your new position.</P>

I take this opportunity to ask the Leader of the House to convey our congratulations to three gardaí, Donncha O'Sullivan, John Talbot and Séamus McGirl, who saved many old people in the Malpas Court flats on Lower Clanbrassil Street last Monday night.  Vandals sank to an all time low in putting petrol and firelighters into the letter-boxes of the flats of old persons, many of whom are in wheelchairs.  If those gardaí had not seen the smoke and raised the alarm, we would be burying many of these old people today.  I appeal to the Leader to ask the Minister for Justice to come to the House so that <Col N="845" /> we can talk about it.  We have been mollycoddling these people, sending them to psychologists and psychiatrists and carrying out assessments for far too long.  Many innocent people are killed or their lives put in danger and it is about time that positive action was taken to put an end to this.</P>

      <P>I am not asking the Leader to find time for a debate on crime and drugs.  However, will he stress the urgency of the matter to the Minister for Justice, particularly with regard to the release after a short period of time of those who have been accused?  I mention this because I know the Minister has declared her intention of looking at bail laws and a possible referendum. I understand a method of holding the accused for longer than the six hours they are now entitled to be held is being put to the Cabinet today.</P>
      <P>This House has stressed to the Minister the importance of dealing with these offences, and not only in the drugs area, on a number of occasions in the last session.  It is important the Minister understands that if we are to maintain some control on crime not unlike that which Senator Farrell referred to, we need some urgency in this matter. Suggestions have been made but there is likely to be a delay.  I wish the Leader would stress to the Minister the urgency of taking action in regard to the release of those accused after a short period of time, which is shorter than any other state in Europe.</P>

Will the Leader say if we will have an opportunity to discuss and make a decision on these regulations before they are finally made?  In the absence of that opportunity, perhaps the Leader could ascertain from the Minister for Health what the situation is, if he is fully aware of the serious implications these regulations will have for people seriously affected in the psychiatric services and <Col N="847" /> perhaps he can give us some indication before the regulations are made of what the situation will be.</P>

      <P>Any legislation, public debate or press article on service charges is always of great interest to Members of the Oireachtas, local authority members and the public.</P>
      <P>Local authorities have discretion in deciding whether to charge for services provided by them in their functional areas and the scale of any such charges. Elected members of local authorities, in considering the question of service charges in the context of framing their annual Estimates of expenses, have careful regard to the needs of their areas, the level and range of services to be provided and all sources of revenue available to finance those services.  This local discretion, provided under the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Act, 1983, is a critical element in supporting the concept of local government, that is, the concept of decisions on local issues being taken locally and being implemented and financed by local resources.  Service charges now represent a valuable source of income for local authorities and sustain the provision and maintenance of a wide range of local services.  It is estimated that in 1994 domestic service charges generated income of about £50 million for local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senators will know, the question of local government financing, particularly the issue of service charges, has been a thorny subject for many years. In an effort to tackle this question, the Government in its policy agreement, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, has given three specific commitments which have direct relevance to service charges.  First, we have decided that the time has come for a complete and fundamental review of the entire system of local government finance.  To that end, we undertook to commission a professional study to see <Col N="850" /> how best to introduce a fair, equitable and reasonable system of local authority funding and to publish a White Paper on the subject.  We recently announced that I had nominated a firm of consultants to carry out the study.  We expect stage I of the study to be completed before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The second commitment given was to grant a tax allowance at the standard rate up to a maximum of £150 in respect of service charges paid.  This commitment, which was made having regard to the fact that service charges are seen by some as a form of double taxation, was implemented by section 7 of this year's Finance Act.</P>
    <P>Third, we agreed to amend the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1962 to delimit the power of local authorities to disconnect domestic water supplies for non-payment of service charges.  The Bill before us is designed to implement that undertaking.</P>
    <P>Since the 1800s, sanitary authorities &mdash; that is, county councils, county borough corporations, borough corporations and urban district councils &mdash; have been charged with the task of providing good quality water supplies to our homes.  This they have done in an efficient manner down the years.  The fifth annual report of the Environmental Protection Agency on water quality, which was published last week, highlights the fundamentally good quality of Irish drinking water, with compliance levels of over 99 per cent recorded in respect of the stringent standards which apply to the main health related parameters. The cost of maintaining a high standard of water supply can be a considerable burden on the resources of a local authority.  To meet some of this cost, almost all local authorities now levy a charge in respect of water supplied by them.</P>
    <P>Where a person refuses to pay a water charge it is open to local authorities to endeavour to recover the charge as a simple contract debt through the courts.  Alternatively, local authorities are empowered, under the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, <Col N="851" /> 1962, to withdraw the service from the defaulter, that is to disconnect a person's supply of water.</P>
    <P>The issue of discontinuing a person's water supply for non-payment of charges has always been a contentious one and has given rise to controversy and, on occasions, acrimony.  Many local authorities, after many years of dealing with defaulters, have found that disconnection of a water supply is the most effective method of recovering outstanding water charges.  It is a matter for each local authority to decide how they propose to recover charges having regard to local circumstances.  This is as it should be, and I have no intention of removing that discretion.</P>
    <P>Although local authorities are statutorily empowered to disconnect water supplies, this does not mean that disconnection is a common occurrence.  The power to disconnect has, in practice, been used sparingly by local authorities over the years.  Disconnection should not be used as a first line of attack in the face of refusal to pay.  Neither should it be used where a person cannot afford to pay a water charge.  Disconnection should only be considered after all other reasonable avenues towards recovery of outstanding charges have been explored by the authorities concerned.</P>
    <P>Although disconnections are not commonplace occurrences, it is important that the power to implement the sanction remains and is seen to remain.  Local authorities across the country will confirm that the preliminary steps taken in advance of proposed disconnection generally succeed in coaxing payment, and that it is only in a small minority of cases that they have to resort to the stage of actually cutting off a supply.  It is of interest to note that only 910 disconnections were carried out by county councils and county borough corporations in 1994.  This represents a tiny fraction of the number of people to whom these authorities supplied water.</P>
    <P>When the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1962 conferred <Col N="852" /> powers of disconnection on local authorities, it did not establish any procedural arrangements or controls in respect of the implementation of that power.  There are no statutory criteria or procedural regulations in place for local authorities to follow concerning disconnection. Neither are there statutory safeguards in place for consumers.  Procedures in regard to disconnection will therefore vary from one local authority to another.  This Bill will put those absent procedures and safeguards into place.</P>
    <P>As the Minister, Deputy Howlin, has said elsewhere, no inference should be drawn from the introduction of this Bill that local authorities have acted thoughtlessly or in a cavalier fashion in the use of their disconnection powers. Local authorities have generally adopted a responsible and sympathetic approach in considering disconnection. The figure for the number of disconnections, which I quoted earlier, supports this fact.</P>
    <P>While applauding the pragmatic attitude of local authorities, it must be fully appreciated that the withdrawal of a water supply from a person is indeed a very severe sanction, especially when one considers the effect this can have on the sick, the very young or the elderly. The Environmental Protection Agency's report, to which I referred earlier, underlined the importance of a water supply indicating that it is &ldquo;arguably the most precious of all substances.  It is essential for life, and each day we consume and use significant volumes of it. Over 80 per cent of our body weight is made up of water!&rdquo;  Bearing this in mind, it is essential that a clearly defined set of procedures and safeguards backed by statute are put in place to provide protection to consumers.</P>
    <P>These procedures are being legislated for by section 3 of the Bill and the Schedule.  Section 3 (2) provides that a local authority may only discontinue a supply of water where it receives an order of the District Court authorising it to do so.  Under section 3 (3) the District <Col N="853" /> Court can only grant an order where specified notification procedures have been followed by the local authority. The procedures, which are listed in the Schedule, are as follows: first, a demand for payment must issue in writing; second, at least two reminders must issue; third, two warning notices about possible court action leading to disconnection must be given &mdash; Senators should note that these warning notices can be given in conjunction with the reminders; and finally, the local authority must secure the delivery to the consumer, or send by registered post, a final notice indicating that it is proposed to seek a water discontinuance order from the court.</P>
    <P>Arrangements similar to these are already being operated by many local authorities.  However, legislating for specified procedures to be taken prior to disconnection will not only ensure that consumers are fully aware of where they stand, but will also guide and support local authorities in the implementation of their functions.  Indeed, by circular letter of 4 April this year, I asked local authorities to implement these arrangements pending introduction of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Under section 3 (3) (a), the new procedures will not apply to cases where an individual defaults on a payment due under an instalment order which had been granted by the courts on a previous occasion where the local authority had recourse to the courts to recover an outstanding charge as a simple contract debt.  This will obviate any requirement on a local authority to use the courts on more than one occasion in respect of disconnection.</P>
    <P>In meeting the commitment in <i>A Government of Renewal</i> to amend the Sanitary Services Act, 1962, the Minister, Deputy Howlin, was keen not to abolish or erode the powers of a local authority to disconnect a person's water supply where the person has the ability to pay but refuses to do so.  In dealing with water charge defaulters, local authorities are now being given the backing of an order of the courts if they wish to <Col N="854" /> invoke the sanction of disconnection to ensure everybody pays a fair share.  If local authorities were powerless to take effective action in the face of default by those who can afford to pay, the service charge system would crumble, as other consumers would justifiably question why they should be asked to carry an unfair burden to make up for the default of some who are happy to scrounge off the rest of the community.</P>
    <P>While the power to disconnect is preserved, the Bill provides safeguards for those who do not have the resources to pay.  I am satisfied there is no justification for cutting off a person's water supply because the consumer simply cannot afford to pay a water charge.  To cater for such situations, section 3 (3) (b) specifically provides that the District Court may not issue an order authorising a local authority to disconnect where the default in payment was as a result of hardship.  I am sure Senators will agree the protection afforded by this section to the less well-off in our society is to be welcomed.  Although in practice people who were suffering hardship would not have been cut off by a local authority if they were unable to pay their water charges, this legislation will remove any doubts or worries about it. To copperfasten this protection for the less well-off, section 3 (5) prohibits a local authority from disconnecting in any case where it has granted a waiver of a water charge on the grounds of hardship.</P>
    <P>Hand in hand with these provisions, section 3 (4) requires the court to take into account the personal and household circumstances of the consumer when considering whether to grant a water discontinuance order.  This measure is included so that vulnerable people in a household are not put at risk as a result of disconnection, people who perhaps have no control over whether the water charge is paid.  For example, if a person's medical condition might be dangerously affected by the withdrawal of a water supply, the court would have discretion not to grant a water discontinuance order.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="855" /> I am happy with the extent of safeguards in the Bill for the less well off sections of our society.  At the same time I am happy that it allows for strict measures to be taken against defaulters with the ability to pay.  To deal with these cases, the power to disconnect remains.  As a further disincentive to those who may consider not paying, section 4 provides that where a court grants a water discontinuance order, the consumer will, in the absence of any special or substantial reasons, be liable to pay the costs and expenses of a local authority in its court application.  Not only that, should the consumer wish to be reconnected following action by a local authority on foot of a water discontinuance order, that person will be liable for the cost of disconnecting the supply in the first place and any subsequent costs incurred by the authority in reconnecting the supply.</P>
    <P>This Bill is worthy of support.  I know it will be the subject of constructive debate in this House and I commend it to Members.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be no need for this Bill if Democratic Left and Labour had been honest with the people about water charges over the years.  Those parties misled people into believing they would abolish water charges and would find a mechanism whereby there would be no charges for local domestic services. They knew that over 500,000 people had paid water charges whereas less than 1 per cent, about 900 people, had had their supply cut off by local authorities last year.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to resolve the dispute between the Government partners on the application of charges for domestic water supply.  I may propose an amendment to the Title, to replace it with the following: &ldquo;An Act to provide for the resolution of the dispute between Democratic Left, the Labour party and Fine Gael in relation to the application of water charges&rdquo;, although I do not wish to be cynical or mischievous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="856" /> The Bill is a whitewash.  If Democratic Left believes this legislation will convince the public that it is taking action on behalf of people who find it difficult to meet their water charges, it will receive a rude awakening.  The people will not be fooled with this measure.  It is a far cry from the outrage and concern about water charges and disconnections expressed by Democratic Left and the other parties when they were in Opposition.  There is little regard for the crocodile tears of Democratic Left, which have suddenly dried up.  It now desires to hold onto office and recognises everyone must pay a contribution for the provision of these services.</P>
    <P>Under the method of financing available to the Department at present, there is a combination of funding from the EU, the National Development Plan and contributions from local consumers, which are estimated at £50 million. Included in that figure is an element for services other than water supply.  In the week the Minister, Deputy De Rossa, said it was likely that he would not be able to make long term predictions about the availability of finances to pay pensions, the left-wing, socialist element of the Government introduced this legislation, which will add further insult and penalty to the consumers who already find it difficult to pay.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister of State indicate what the charge will be if a disconnection is made?  The consumer, the local authority and the courts will have to adjudicate on a demand for £100, where a person does not have the financial ability to meet that payment.  The result of this procedure is that the bill for £100 will increase to perhaps £1,000 and will put reconnection far beyond the capacity of the person involved.  It will condemn hundreds of householders to join the 3,000 who still do not have the basic facility of a water supply and will make it more expensive and difficult for them to be reconnected.  At the same time, it will create further problems in the litigation area and for local authority financing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="857" /> This Bill is a joke and a charade and it should be withdrawn.  All Members knows that when people are told that for the foreseeable future they will have to make a contribution towards the provision of these services, they will follow that lead and abide by that decision. Many local authorities who were not securing substantial payments of domestic charges are now finding it easier to do so.</P>
    <P>Section 3 authorises the court to look into the personal and household circumstances of water consumers.  What will happen in these cases?  District Courts will be turned into social welfare offices and District Court Judges into welfare officers, adjudicating on personal circumstances and hardships.  It is totally unacceptable and undesirable that the decisions on hardship issues and whether a person can meet his or her water charges will be made in the District Court.  Coming from this caring Democratic Left wing of the Government it is a most unusual procedure and one that will create enormous problems, with people's personal details likely to be splashed all over the local newspapers. This is outrageous and the measure should be roundly condemned and withdrawn.</P>
    <P>The most amusing part of the Bill, which I have been trying to work out, is in part 3 of the Schedule which states:</P>
    <P>Where the name of the consumer cannot be ascertained by reasonable inquiry, the initial demand, reminders, warning notices or the final notice may be addressed to &ldquo;the consumer&rdquo; without naming the consumer.</P>
    <P>So some imaginary consumer will be brought before the courts where some imaginary procedure will be entered into.  This Bill is the biggest joke I have ever seen in my time both in this House and the Lower House.</P>
    <P>The environmental action programme has made the major public funding of water supplies a priority.  During the last decade, environmental policy has been working towards bringing drinking <Col N="858" /> water standards in all areas fully into line with the statutory regulations.  The policy has been to eliminate both inland and marine pollution and fairly sizeable amounts of capital have been invested to achieve that.  A sum in the region of £442 million was invested in the provision of water services from 1990 to 1994.  The Environmental Protection Agency and the environmental action programme have committed a further £300 million over the decade for new and improved public water supply schemes.</P>
    <P>It is only fair and reasonable that in a situation where the European Union and the Government's national development plans are committed to sizeable expenditure on water services, the community at large who benefit from domestic water supplies must share some of the cost.  That share is small compared to the benefits of the facility being provided.  This facility is already denied to between 2,500 and 3,000 people, and many more will be denied when this new procedure is put in place.</P>
    <P>Dragging people before the courts to have their personal circumstances discussed in public and having them broadcast on local radio as well as in the <i>Clare Champion and the Limerick Leader</i> is a disgraceful way for any Government to behave.  They should be endeavouring to find an improved mechanism for collecting charges for sanitary services.</P>
    <P>Every agency or organisation involved in any type of financial collection from customers or consumers is improving its customer services.  Easier methods are being put in place to help people to deal with the hardship of outstanding arrears.  Instead of pressing ahead with this legislation the Government would be well advised to call in the Director of Consumer Affairs along with departmental advisers and county managers to work out a sensible formula to resolve the problems facing the 1 per cent or less who get into difficulties. Firm guidelines should be laid down so that for the foreseeable future charges for domestic services like these <Col N="859" /> will to some extent be met.  The Government cannot expect the taxpayer to fund the lot from Exchequer resources.</P>
    <P>I have a few questions arising from the legislation to which I would appreciate answers from the Minister before we conclude.  The Minister said that a study of the greater Dublin area was under way to assess what the water supply was like there, to make recommendations for the future development of services and to secure domestic water supplies for that area.  That study is well under way and a report is expected towards the end of this year.  Can the Minister indicate what the present state of play is in relation to that study?  What will the financial implications of the study be?</P>
    <P>I understand that the European Union is preparing some development plan for this area.  Can the Minister indicate what the Irish input is likely to be? What undertakings can the Minister give on the future long-term security of domestic water supplies?  We have already seen quite an amount of concern being expressed with the recent dry spell causing water supply shortages in some isolated areas.</P>
    <P>Rather than waste Government time on the spurious type of legislation before us today, which is totally unnecessary and draconian in holding a guillotine over the heads of water consumers, the Minister should withdraw this Bill.  He should find a formula to deal in a humane way with the less than 1 per cent of people who have difficulties.</P>
    <P>The Minister should indicate what the Government programme will be for the management of ground water supplies, protecting resources and funding.  There must be some realistic prospect of tackling and resolving the problems of the 3,000 people who still do not have a basic human right and are reduced to Third World status through the absence of a domestic water supply in their homes, rather than the charade we have before us today.</P>

This is in accordance with the programme, <i>A Government of Renewal</i> which contains three commitments with a direct bearing on service charges.</P>
      <P>The Minister is also responding to a number of submissions from the General Council of County Councils of which I am a member.  In June 1994 the General Council made a submission on local government funding and finances to the former Minister for the Environment, Deputy Michael Smith.  A further submission was made on 23 March 1995 to the current Minister relating to the scope and terms of reference for the professional study on local government financing.</P>
      <P>This is an important area and I am glad that the Government has grasped the nettle by proposing to publish a White Paper on local government financing.  I hope there will not be a prolonged delay and that the White Paper will be published in the near future.</P>
      <P>Former Governments have shied away from the real issue but now we have a Government with backbone and courage which is prepared to face it. The idea of disconnecting water supplies to houses is draconian.  It reminds one of the landlord system when eviction was the norm if tenants failed to pay their rents.  We all abhor the idea of eviction which brings back memories of the Famine 150 years ago.  This year we are respectfully commemorating the terrible famine in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The disconnection of water supply to a house is an open and manifest procedure which can have a detrimental effect, particularly on the children in the household.  They are the innocent victims. One never knows the reasons for non-payment but, regardless of the <Col N="861" /> reasons, children should not be embarrassed. One can imagine children going to school the morning after the council moved into an estate to cut off the water supply.  The type of remarks passed and the hurt caused and felt can have a lasting and detrimental effect on young people.  There is merit in this Bill if we consider deeply the implications of cutting off water supplies from householders and the effect it can have on other members of the family who, through no fault of their own, are involved.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed &mdash; but not surprised &mdash; by the statements on this issue by my good friend and colleague, Senator Daly.  I know he was advancing the policy of his own party, Fianna Fáil, which stands for patriotism, nationalism and defence of the people.  He would prefer to see contractors with machines move in and publicly disconnect water supplies rather than give people the opportunity to bring their case before the courts.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are very sensitive to people's needs and problems.  Over the years the action of cutting off water supplies has been taken only in the most extreme cases.  Recently, I took it upon myself to conduct a survey on cutting off water supplies and I wrote to the various secretaries and finance officers around the country.  I thank the professional people involved in the councils for their quick responses.  I will not go through all the letters I received from the councils; I have a plethora of replies for which I am thankful.</P>
    <P>It is an indication of the sympathetic approach of councils to cutting off water supplies that this measure has had limited use.  I will refer to three of the letters. Monaghan County Council advised me that a total of 17 householders had their water services disconnected over the last five years.  They asked me to note that four of the properties in question were vacant during that time.  This is a very small number of disconnections. In my county of Galway, the second largest county, the number of householders cut off by Galway County <Col N="862" /> Council over the last five years is approximately 70.  This represents about 14 disconnections a year which is very small.  Cork Corporation has not carried out any water disconnection for nonpayment of service charges.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that disconnection has not been used as a first line of attack or in an uncaring fashion by local authorities.  The contrary is true.  The authorities in general have adopted a reasonable and sympathetic attitude in this sensitive matter. We should look at the limitations on the powers of local authorities to discontinue water supply services.  Section 3 (2) provides that before an authority may disconnect a supply of water for non-payment of charges it must first obtain an order from the District Court and such an order may only be granted by the court following clearly defined procedures set out in the Schedule.  The demand must be issued in writing; at least two reminders of outstanding charges must be issued; and at least two warnings must have been given, either separately or in conjunction with the reminders.  The Minister has already outlined that procedure in detail.  Any fair minded person would say that this gives people every scope and opportunity to pay the service charges.  If they are not able to do so, they can make a case to the council.</P>
    <P>The Bill will establish a standardised Statute backed procedure ensuring that people will be in no doubt as to where they stand in the matter of paying water charges.  It is important in terms of equity that everybody who is liable to pay and can afford to pay charges does so. In this way the burden of paying for the provision and maintenance of much needed and vocally demanded local services is fully shared.  If everybody pays a little, there will be an equitable burden placed on all.  The great English writer, GK Chesterton once said that trifles make perfection but perfection is no trifle. If we all do a trifle, we may not achieve perfection but at least we will have a better system of local government.</P>
    <P>Every support and protection is there for people who are under pressure and <Col N="863" /> unable to pay.  A section of this Bill provides that the court may not grant an order authorising disconnection in any case where the default in payment arose as a result of hardship.  Another section prohibits disconnection in any case where a local authority has granted a water charge waiver on the grounds of hardship.  This is a solid, well balanced Bill.  It is tough on those who will not pay and sympathetic to the needs of those who cannot.</P>
    <P>In general I welcome the terms of this Bill and the protection enshrined therein for people who could be described as hardship victims.  Local authorities are made up of people who are sensitive to the people's needs because they deal with ordinary people on a daily basis. They should be commended for their outstanding service and their sensitive and sympathetic approach to the many people who approach them daily.  I am confident they will operate the measures enshrined in this Bill in a fair minded manner.  Like the Minister I commend this Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I join other Members of the House in welcoming the Minister. I believe there will be more conviction in his deliberations on other issues than on this issue.  The Minister's heart is not in this proposal and he could not be honest or sincere.  He talked about a White Paper and Senator Daly talked about a whitewash.  The country knows that this is unworkable, even if we all went along with it 100 per cent.  The special courts are being reintroduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My county has water charges of £4 million and they constitute a major part of the county manager's estimate.  We have two major schemes.  The first is the Pollen dam in Buncrana, requiring funding of £30 million which must be funded by taxpayers, ratepayers and the EU. We are on our knees making our contribution to that funding.  The Loughmoran water scheme will cost another <Col N="864" /> £30 million and the fishing industry in Killybegs, County Donegal, is demanding more money.  There is an ongoing demand for extending the water supply while the Minister is scuttling it and pretending that it is all right.  I cannot foresee anybody, whether using four gallons of water a day or one million, having any difficulty proving to the court that they cannot afford to pay.  Any of us could go to the court and prove that we are under financial stress.  Financial difficulty is not about not having a job.</P>
    <P>I have been a public representative for many years and it gives me a pain to hear somebody pleading to have their water charges waived when I can see a satellite dish bolted to their roof.  In such situations I look around and make an assessment.  Many people will not pay.  I told the House of a case where somebody had a problem, they were not getting their supplementary welfare allowance.  I listened, I took out my notebook and started writing down details.  Before I had finished &mdash; I have put this on the record and I am saying it again today &mdash; I established that the person, with his unemployment assistance income, his medical card and his family, was better off than a Senator elected to this House.</P>
    <P>The Minister is giving people an opportunity to revolt against paying for the expedience of keeping a promise the Democratic Left made when they never expected to be part of Government. Before the last election, a candidate, whom out of charity I shall not name, tore up water bills in Letterkenny and said that if he was elected the people would not pay water bills, that water bills should not be paid.  That kind of nonsense is not accepted by a majority of the people.  Millions of pounds of somebody's money must be spent to provide a basic essential service for the people, and for industrial, commercial and domestic use.</P>
    <P>Clean water is an essential service and it is becoming more important and scarce.  In some countries a bottle of water costs £2.  The Minister is forcing <Col N="865" /> the local authority into court.  Donegal County Council has one of the best administrators in the revenue office.  He has a staff and a bank of computers; some people have four or five different connections, numbers, farms and meters. The whole system is a maze and the Minister is offering a way out for people who want it.  This is utter madness.  He will not get credit for it on any ballot paper on which he puts his name in future.  This Bill is totally dishonest.</P>
    <P>Some £4 million of Donegal County Council's revenue depends on water charges at a time when we do not have a warm pound note.  The Minister cut £1 million from the Donegal County Council county road maintenance allocation this year.  I talked to Mr. Kevin Quigley in the engineer's office and asked him to cut a few hedges and fill a few potholes. He said he did not have a penny to carry out the work with.  I asked if he had enough money to pay his own wages and office staff until the end of the year and he told me that all the local engineers are having a meeting to see if there will be enough money until the end of the year.  Now the Minister intends telling them that he has scuttled one of their sources of finance.</P>
    <P>Everyone who has to pay will be under some financial pressure.  It is easy to present a case in such a way that a person appears to be under pressure. Everyone I know, except a few lucky people, is under some financial pressure, and if a person is offered a possibility to opt out, that person will take that option.  I am in the office of Donegal County Council every week trying to resolve problems for people who do not have the funds to meet their water bills and who are pleading for sympathy and understanding.</P>
    <P>The Minister has scuttled the structures that the county manager in my county put in place on the day he presented the estimates to the council. The members of the Minister's party and of the Labour Party walked into the lobby and voted for the county manager's <Col N="866" /> estimate.  The Minister has pulledthe rug from under them as a sop to a party that is only temporarily in office, that was extravagant in the promises it never thought it would have to keep.  He has broken his back to accommodate that party because he has no other solution. The Irish people must understand that to do so is utterly dishonest.</P>
    <P>It is about time the Minister told us what the White Paper will do for local authorities.  Will it provide a single extra pound of finance?  No White Paper is of any interest to a local authority member if it does not.  The Minister can shuffle the deck as much as he likes but is there any money on the table?  How can he explain where the money will come from when he has cut county road maintenance finance by £1 million?  The Minister should credit ordinary people with some intelligence.  He cannot expect to be taken seriously if he talks about a White Paper while he is legislating to make it difficult for local authorities to collect charges.</P>
    <P>My county has a very generous waiver scheme.  Before the Minister thought up this legislative gimmick, my county, and every other, had established a very generous waiver scheme where hardship cases are looked at on their merits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but look at the characters whose water supply we disconnected. Their supply was not disconnected without due consideration and correspondence.  We only disconnect where it is established beyond doubt that the people have the resources to pay and they have refused to do so.  My county is very generous in administering the waiver scheme.  If the county council is forced to go through the court, we will have to establish a special court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has done the country a major disservice.  The Government has paid too high a price for the support of Democratic Left and time will prove this beyond doubt.  This could have been <Col N="867" /> done some other way.  The Government could have smothered this Bill and allowed the Democratic Left to fade away.  Democratic Left would not back out because they have ministerial office and they will never have it again.  It is unacceptable to put this kind of pressure on a Government.  We expect more from the Fine Gael and Labour Parties who have at least some experience of Government.  The Minister should and will pay a price for this totally dishonest and destructive approach to the financing of local authorities.  He compounds the whitewash by talking about a White Paper which will solve some of the problems. I appeal to the Minister, as somebody with guts who can take a stand, not to proceed with this legislation.</P>

      <P>A Leas-Chathaoirligh, I welcome the Minister to the House and I welcome this Bill.</P>
      <P>In discussing water supply, we are concerned with having a good, decent and reliable service in local authorities areas.  I welcome the Bill because it gives local authorities a set of procedures to catch those people who have money but will not pay.  I do not know why Opposition Members are making a fuss about this legislation because what we want is a fair system whereby people with money pay their share.  That is the basis of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation will ensure that people who will not pay their water bills are brought to court.  It is clear that the system is designed to deal with cases of hardship, if they arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cutting off a water supply is very serious.  I have been a member of Cork County Council since 1974 and I know that council members, managers and staff regard having to cut off the water supply to a house as a very serious matter. Consequently, it is not the policy of county councils simply to cut off water supplies.  Local collectors will know, and <Col N="868" /> representations by local authority members will prove, if the person involved is a genuine hardship case.  The council will then operate the waiver scheme, abolish the charge or find some way for the person to pay over a short period.  There have been cases where councils have allowed people up to a year to pay.  We have been very helpful to people in difficulty.  The real purpose of this legislation is to catch the &ldquo;cowboys&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A procedure must be in place for the process of cutting off water supplies as a last resort.  I have a letter from Donegal County Council which states that, in the vast majority of cases, charges were paid within hours of the supply being cut off. This proves the point that cutting off the supply sends a message to the defaulter that they will not receive water unless they pay for it.</P>
    <P>I am happy to see the extension of the hardship provision in the Bill.  If a household's water charges are not paid the council and the courts will consider the fact that a person in that house &mdash; perhaps not the person liable for the charges &mdash; may be in great need of water.  This could include the sick, the young or the elderly.  Where hardship is involved, the courts have no power to cut off the water supply.</P>
    <P>Local charges are an essential part of local authority finances.  If people refuse to pay those charges, from where will the money come?  In the past we saw what happened to local authorities with the abolition of rates.  In 1977 two thirds of local authority finances were supplied from central funds and one third from local charges.  The reverse applies at present.  The rate support grant has been tremendously reduced with the result that local authorities are starved of finances.  The very unwise decision to abolish rates in the 1970s, as a method of vote-catching, is one of the main reasons local authority financing is in its present state.  I welcome the reform of local government and the means provided for local authority finances.</P>
    <P>The Government of renewal which is running the affairs of this country promised <Col N="869" /> a review of the entire system of local government.  That review will be the subject of a White Paper.  The tax allowance has also been set at a standard rate of up to £150 because it was felt that the charges represented a double taxation.  That has been alleviated.  It was also part of <i>A Government of Renewal</i> to delimit procedures to local authorities to disconnect water supplies. At present a local authority can cut off a household's water supply.  This gives people the opportunity to go to court and say that the local authority is wrong and is not taking the hardship provision into account.  We are making this easier for people who experience hardship.</P>
    <P>I come from a rural part of the country where innumerable group water schemes are in operation and many houses have local, individual or private water supplies.  Many people have told me that they would like to be in a position to pay the charges because water freezes in winter and pumps have to be maintained.  In towns and surrounding areas, which have large group schemes, there is a steady, regular supply of clean water.  In country areas people have to sink a well, build a pump house and provide and maintain a pump.  These people would love to be in position to pay service charges and have a proper water supply.  I cannot let the opportunity pass to put this on the record.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to speak about procedure which is very well laid out in the Bill.  The Minister has stated that a person will receive a written demand for payment followed by two reminders, which may include notice of possible court action.  People are not playing ball if they do not respond to these demands.  They are avoiding the charges.  If a person in my area receives a notice, particularly when it states that possible court action may be involved, they approach me asking what they should do.  I immediately arrange for them to receive a waiver form.  The local authority takes into account that the waiver is being considered and court proceedings are either dropped or not proceeded with.  The whole matter is <Col N="870" /> often worked out in a reasonable manner for the local authority and the person concerned.</P>
    <P>I want to compliment council officials. Those in the office in Clonakilty, which is responsible for the collection of payments, are most considerate.  People have been fairly treated there.  It would be a last resort for any official in the Clonakilty office of Cork County Council to consider cutting off anybody's water supply.  The local rent collector, who is available once a week in the local engineering offices of the county council, also provides a very good service by consulting people about how they want to pay.  People often include £1 or £2 per week with their rent to cover water and refuse charges so that they will not have to make one large payment for those charges.  This Bill was long overdue to provide county councils with procedures for a fair system of obtaining money from people who can well afford to pay but want to avoid it.  We will have done a good day's work if the Bill achieves this.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister.  I was disappointed when I saw him coming in with this Bill because I would find it much easier to be annoyed with a Minister from Democratic Left.  I am very critical of the Bill and I hope the Minister will not take my criticism personally. The Minister said he believed the Bill was worthy of support; I do not believe it is.  I would like to be constructive, but I will find it extremely difficult because I am annoyed about this Bill. I listened to what the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, said in the other House when he introduced it and to what the Minister of State and the two Government speakers said this morning, but I did not hear a solid argument for introducing it.  I could use most of what the Minister for the Environment said in the other House and what the Minister of State and the Government speakers said today as an argument against it.  It has been a waste of the Minister's, officials in the Department and our time discussing this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="871" /> Since I have been a Member of the House I have heard Senators raise issues about funding for roads, potholes and library services on the Order of Business, in Private Members' Time and on the Adjournment, but I did not hear a Senator raise as a matter of concern that somebody's water supply was cut off.  I do not believe it has been raised in the other House either.</P>
    <P>I am sure it is difficult for the Minister to come into the House to listen to this, but this Bill is being introduced because of a commitment given to Democratic Left when it went into Government. Everyone in the Department of the Environment, including the Minister and the Minister of State, and members of the Government accept that local charges must be collected.  From our experiences on local authorities, we have seen the caring way in which they handle the collection of water charges.  I discussed this matter with the two local authorities in my area of Laois and Offaly, with the finance officers concerned, those who collect the charges and those who discuss them with people who have problems.  None are in favour of the introduction of the Bill and they believe it will affect the money being collected.</P>
    <P>Laois County Council has two methods of raising funds locally &mdash; rates, which raise £1.8 million annually, and service charges.  Last year the estimate in Laois was that £1.03 million would be collected in local charges and £1.029 million was collected.  The Minister can see the compliance rate.  Last year Laois County Council cut off water supplies to two people.  One man already had a pump and requested that the water supply be cut off because he did not want to pay for something which he was not using.  The other person could only be described as a messer.  He never paid his charges and gave cheques to the council which he stopped or which bounced.  He did not co-operate in any way.</P>
    <P>A speaker said this Bill would catch the cowboys, but it will make it easier <Col N="872" /> for them not to pay charges and to drag local authorities through the courts to get a court order.  The only sanction against them until now was the threat of cutting off the water supply, which was very effective.  In 1987 before Laois County Council introduced the procedure of disconnecting water supplies, it had arrears in local charges of £1.7 million when local charges were half of what they are today.  These arrears have been reduced because of the sanction the council had to cut off a water supply. The council only had to apply that to one person last year.  It is concerned that people will use the powers under this Bill and will allow it to take them to court if it wants to cut off their water supply.  Those who have made arrangements to pay a couple of pounds each week have already said this to the collectors. I also spoke to Offaly County Council, which only cut off two people last year.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonagh said the Government had backbone and courage.  I cannot understand how anyone could say that.  It is bringing in a Bill which will only suit those who are effectively telling local authorities to go to hell, that they will not pay them and that if they want money or to disconnect their water supply they can incur further expense and take them to court.  No public representative, Member of this or the other House or the Government has time for such people.</P>
    <P>A finance officer to whom I spoke in the county council said he was concerned that a court may not grant a water discontinuance order in any case where it is satisfied that the default in payment was due to hardship.  There is no evidence in Laois or in Offaly County Council that anybody has been cut off because he could not pay.  A hardship case is given a waiver or an arrangement is made with the council.</P>
    <P>Laois County Council has a unique way of dealing with this.  As well as sending notices to those involved, it sends a list to local councillors to ask if they know of any reason a person would not be in a position to pay or if there <Col N="873" /> were problems in the family.  The council believes it may not be aware of difficulties. In one case an illiterate person who got demands from the council was not able to read the notices and obviously could not respond.  The local councillor was aware of that and was able to sort out the situation.</P>
    <P>The council will send out an overseer if it is contemplating cutting off a water supply.  The overseer will tell the individual that if an arrangement is not made within a couple of days his water supply will be cut off.  The council will make a new arrangement at any time with anybody even if he has defaulted on a previous arrangement.  I cannot understand how anybody could say that local authorities have not been extremely reasonable, fair and accommodating to anyone who has had a problem paying local service charges.</P>
    <P>This is a bad move against local authorities. We constantly expect them to do more, yet we are reducing their base for collecting revenue.  The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Rabbitte, was in the House last night to deal with the Casual Trading Bill and he spoke about devolving powers on local authorities. On the one hand, they are being given more powers and are expected to do more work, while on the other hand, we are reducing their revenue base.  I am angry about this.</P>
    <P>We are supporting a small number who have no regard for the State and local authorities and who believe that somebody else should pay for everything. They are vociferous in their demands for services from local authorities, but will say they have a principled objection to paying for those services. They have no principles when they demand services from the county council.</P>
    <P>I have been asked to raise another problem by officials in the local authorities. In a case where an individual has been granted a full or a part water charges waiver by the sanitary authorities, the local authority cannot then get an order to disconnect.  Officials in <Col N="874" /> the local authorities are concerned that this will harden their attitude to giving somebody a waiver.  They have been sympathetic, have reduced hardship cases and have been willing to give people waivers.  However, if by giving a person a waiver, it effectively means that they have no sanction to collect the balance of what is due, they will be slow to give waivers to borderline cases.  In effect, this will cause more hardship to people.</P>
    <P>I am not pleased about having to chide the Minister and I do not want him to take it personally.  I do not believe that in his heart he supports this measure.  I am sure the Minister agrees, as we all must from our experiences with them, that local authorities are reasonable, caring and fair.  I cannot support this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. He is my former colleague here and a former Lord Mayor of Cork city.  As a Deputy he represented the north side of the city for many years and is highly regarded.  I also congratulate him on his openness, sincerity and concern, and most importantly, on the way he conducts his business as Minister.  It is a great pleasure to have him here today. I never thought in 1979 that I would be speaking to Deputy Allen as Minister, and I am proud to do so.</P>
      <P>Like myself, the Minister has been involved for many years at local authority level with the problem of charges. He now has the responsibility to restructure local government, which is long overdue.  The Taoiseach gave, this responsibility directly to the Minister and he could not have given it to a finer person, especially given his knowledge of what is happening at local government level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and I represent the second largest city in the country, where we had long arguments with others regarding the problem of a second charge or tax.  The Minister was especially aware that such charges amounted to second taxes.  I agreed with this, and between us we ensured the <Col N="875" /> introduction of tax relief on service charges in the budget, after long argument going back to 1985.  I pushed for this measure and the Minister always agreed with it.</P>
    <P>The Bill protects those who will not consider paying a second tax in the form of charges for their domestic water supplies, which will not now be cut off except through a court order.  Nobody but the courts should have the authority to cut vital supplies.  In this respect it could be argued that electricity supply constitutes a vital supply.  It is clear that water is a vital necessity and only the courts should have the right to disconnect water supplies.</P>
    <P>The collection of moneys for local authorities is long overdue, especially since their undermining from 1977 following the elimination of rates, after the reduction in these by one quarter in 1976, a reduction which illustrates that other Governments were prepared to consider eliminating them.  When rates were eliminated, however, it was never explained how local authorities were to be funded.</P>
    <P>In introducing legislation to protect people from disconnection of their water supplies, it is time for the Minister to look at restructuring local authorities, a move which is long overdue.  It is shameful that we allowed the local authorities in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford to deteriorate so much and that we are not prepared to acknowledge, following the demise of rural areas, that the vast majority of people live in cities and big towns.  We have not maintained the infrastructures of these centres, much less upgraded them.  At the same time we pride ourselves on building motorways.  I am sorry for anybody who wishes to cycle in and around towns as the deterioration in our footpaths, roads, parks and so on does not do us proud.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides us with the opportunity to take a broader look at our local services.  In the narrow sense it is concerned with the protection of water supplies to people, However, in the <Col N="876" /> broader sense we should go beyond this. In this respect, the Government will, I hope, ascertain what is needed at local government level.  Is there a need to consider a general charge in respect of services in our cities and towns?  Is it not true that most people will say that their town is not looking as well as it should? As a former Lord Mayor of Cork city, I am not proud of the fact that all is not looking well in our city.</P>
    <P>There has been a rapid deterioration in the older parts of our cities, yet nothing is being done and no answers have been provided by any Government over the past ten to 12 years.  This situation has gone on for too long.  I am, therefore, pleased to note the commitment in the Programme for Government to restructure local government and, more importantly, to restructure the finances of local government so that responsibility rests with people locally.</P>
    <P>Are people prepared to accept their local responsibilities?  Do we have authorities and councils which have no authority because they do not have any finance? Responsibility must rest at local level.  However, is this good from a national viewpoint or for our national politicians?  We must address this issue. Unfortunately, the national politician must be involved in every little thing that happens at local level.  This should be restructured in such a way that the national politicians become the hawks: they should ensure that the finances are available.  However, if they are not being spent properly they can highlight this at national level or express unhappiness with a group of local politicians from a given area.  Following this, a reexamination could be implemented.</P>
    <P>It is a sad reflection that we must introduce legislation to protect people from having their water supply cut off. The Bill provides this protection, except in unforeseen circumstances and where people are not prepared to pay any charges, at which point the courts decide.  Nobody should have the authority, except in very serious situations, to cut off water supplies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="877" /> At one stage it appeared that some authorities were in conflict with each other over the issue of service charges. For example, Limerick Corporation abolished service charges, but this created a false impression as it introduced another type of charge.  Dublin Corporation did not implement service charges for a number of years.  It was right to do so as it receives substantial funding at local level from high valuations that other towns and cities do not have.  We should examine the situation in these towns and cities to ascertain why they should have a charge and in what way they spend their money.  We should also look at the city of Cork, where valuations continue to be in Victorian figures.</P>
    <P>Factors such as these must be understood when considering the situation in towns and cities.  For example, every Cork man will readily admit that there is not one part of Cork city which is free from these factors.  It worries me to see the decline of parts of the city and to see its infrastructure deteriorating.  No politician will gain votes by allowing infrastructures to deteriorate because they will not grasp the political nettle.</P>
    <P>We must tell the people once and for all that we have a responsibility to make sure we do not allow a rapid deterioration of our infrastructure in rural or urban areas.  Some towns fare better than others; older towns are not being kept up to scratch.  One can, however, be proud of the way in which many have been kept.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and the Minister's commitment.  Over the next two years I hope we will see a rapid and serious restructuring of the collection of moneys so that areas can be better looked after.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is unnecessary and will lead to utter chaos in local authorities.  I will not go over the history behind the Bill; however, rainbows come and go but the cost of providing a proper water supply to householders in all areas goes on and somebody will have to pay.  Will it once again be the <Col N="878" /> taxpayers, those few who are paying too much?  The Government will promise to reduce personal taxation leaving borrowing as the only alternative and sinking the young generation, many of whom are without jobs, further into debt.</P>
      <P>The Minister told us that an estimated £50 million has been generated for local authorities.  Where will that come from? Will there be more taxation or more reckless borrowing?  The Government cannot shirk from either option as there is no crock of gold in Leinster House.</P>
      <P>There was no need for this Bill.  I have no experience of urban local authorities, but Dublin has a large income from rates and for many years it could balance the books without having water charges.  However, in most local authorities that is not possible.  Most of the county councils are heavily in debt: the debt to the banks is over £100 million and they are paying high interest rates. This will be the straw that breaks the camel's back.</P>
      <P>Money is already so scarce that in rural areas, in particular, the service is no longer provided at weekends because the councils cannot afford it.  If one lives in the country and the water goes off on a Friday evening one would be lucky to have the supply back by Monday or Tuesday.  In other words, the councils will deal only with towns and villages with higher populations.  This Bill will lead to hardship for many people.  A situation will arise where the bank managers will be calling in the county managers and telling them that matters are out of hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>South Tipperary has the best record in the country for the collection of water charges, at about 98 per cent.  Most of the schemes came about through people putting their own group water schemes in place over the last 25 to 30 years.  In 1968 a large scheme was developed in my area for over 300 houses at enormous hardship and cost to those concerned. We all contributed our share, private householders, cottiers and farmers. We got a grant from the Department but we provided a top class water <Col N="879" /> supply scheme and handed it over to the county council.  After all that hardship and expense we are now told that nobody can be cut off.</P>
    <P>A &ldquo;pay nothing&rdquo; culture has developed.  Ultimately, it is the taxpayer who is paying for the houses, roads and water supply, who will be bled again or there will be more reckless borrowing. This is a reckless, unnecessary Bill.  As I said, rainbows come and go but the expense of maintaining a proper water supply remains and has to be paid for. There are no free lunches.  It is sad this has come about as there was no need for it.</P>
    <P>The present Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, introduced charges in the early 1980s and a U-turn is now being made.  Where is the crock of gold?  We hear a lot about transparency and accountability but the Government should come clean and tell us if it will tax people more or borrow more to make up the £50 million.  The local authorities will cave in.  As it is they are paying unnecessary interest to the banks just to keep afloat.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Allen, well even though Cork put Tipperary out of the hurling championship. The greatest growth industry in the country over the last 25 years has been the employment of consultants.  What a great merry-go-round it is.  The beef tribunal would be seen as nothing if an analysis was done of the amount of money spent by local authorities and Departments employing consultants. There have been so many reports on local authority reform in the last 20 years they would make a pile as high as Nelson's Column &mdash; if it was still standing &mdash; all at enormous expense to the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>A consultant's report is a joke as it only puts off the evil day.  A report may be produced by the end of the year, the Department officials will examine it for another nine months, there will then be an election, nothing will be done and the report will be put in the pile with all the others.  It is sad state of affairs for a small country with a small base of taxpayers <Col N="880" /> who are paying too much and also have to pay rates.</P>
    <P>The waiver scheme operated by local authorities has been very fair.  Some people want to blackguard the system, pay no rent on their house and no water charges, but they have two or three televisions and a car, indeed, a high standard of living generally.  I am in favour of looking after the unemployed, the sick and the handicapped.  However, one must render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's; someone has to pay the bill. We cannot continue borrowing and taxing people because it has gone too far already.</P>
    <P>This is a positive development for the legal profession as it will make a mint in mock courts all over the country.  This will be better than any beef tribunal and the legal profession is clapping its hands in anticipation.  The cost of the legal aid system will rocket and the taxpayer will again be caught.</P>
    <P>There was no need for this Bill as the waiver scheme is fair and operated with great care.  I am disappointed the Government has introduced it.  Local authorities have enough problems keeping afloat without having to follow this course.  People in rural areas will suffer because, for health and other reasons, repairs will be carried out in the villages and towns.  However, if there is a breakdown in rural areas it will be four or five days before it is repaired because the councils do not have the funds.</P>
    <P>In many cases the rural communities provided their own water supply schemes at their own expense.  I was a member of the scheme in my area in the late 1960s.  A large scheme involves a lot of work and responsibility.  These people will now be pushed aside and told they do not matter; the council will tell them that the supply faults will not be repaired immediately.  This is already happening and will lead to chaos in the months ahead.  The councils have no money.  Perhaps the Minister has a crock of gold somewhere.  I advise him not to tax the people any more or borrow any more because the people will punish him for it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="881" /> Perhaps at this late stage a little common sense might prevail and this unnecessary Bill will be withdrawn.  All the false promises about reductions in taxation and maintaining borrowing at a proper level are moonshine.  This Bill will lead to more taxation and borrowing and that will be unfortunate for us all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to contribute to the debate, but I felt something was amiss when I heard the arguments being put forward.  The Minister said the Government had agreed to amend the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1962, to delimit the power of local authorities.  However, since 1974 when I first became a member of a local authority, I have heard people, who are members of the parties in Government and members of local authorities, make the case that powers should not continue to be removed from local authorities.</P>
      <P>This Bill removes powers from local authorities; it takes power from local representatives on county and urban councils and corporations to make a case to the county manager or sanitary officer that a person should be granted a full or part waiver of the water charge. I totally disagree with the Bill from that point of view.  The position should have been allowed to stand.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Senator McDonagh for taking the trouble to write to every local authority to find out how many consumers were disconnected.  The Senator said there were no disconnections in one county, 17 in another area over a period of five years and 19 in another county. If there are so few disconnections, why was it necessary to introduce a Bill to allow people to be brought to court so that their supplies could be disconnected? I am only posing these questions and I will not labour the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If somebody is taken to court, to what year does the case relate since water rates are paid in advance?  For example, although one has paid water rates for the period up to the end of December 1995 one has not yet received supply for <Col N="882" /> that entire period.  How can somebody be taken to court until they have received the full amount of their goods? It is similar to one going into a shop and the shopkeeper saying that one must pay for an item but wait until the end of the year to receive it.  This is what local authorities are doing.  In a legal context, how can a person be taken to court on the basis of something which they have not yet received?</P>
    <P>The Minister wishes to reply to the debate but I wanted to make these points.  The Bill erodes the powers of county councillors.  If there are so few disconnections, why is this Bill necessary?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully agree with the Bill.  Water is so important that if a supply is to be disconnected, an application should be made in court and a court order obtained.  The vast majority of waivers are granted and there are no problems in that regard.  However, I have doubts about the way in which many waivers were administered.  We are talking about very poor people and we must be careful to protect their rights.  The courts are the best arbitrators in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions to the debate.  In so far as time allows, I hope to address the main issues raised.</P>
      <P>The Bill meets the commitment in the Government policy agreement to delimit the power of local authorities to disconnect domestic water supplies for non payment of a water charge.  It balances administrative efficiency with social considerations.  It is essential that the Bill, which sets out a clear series of steps which must be followed by local authorities prior to disconnection, will not jeopardise the ability of local authorities to raise their own revenue.  The evidence from local authority collection rates for the first quarter of 1995 clearly demonstrates this is not the case.  I will return to this point later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="883" /> By giving statutory backing to the new procedures, the Bill will protect an essential element of local democracy, the ability of local government structures to generate the revenue necessary to provide and maintain an acceptable level of services and facilities while, at the same time, providing protection to individual citizens.  It will not impose any unnecessary workload on the authorities.</P>
    <P>The Bill is, in essence, a charter for people who pay water charges.  The power to disconnect will remain with the local authorities but only where they follow a set of statutory procedures, which will involve the notification of consumers and the procurement of a court order.  These procedures will ensure that consumers are fully aware, through the issue of the initial bill, reminders and warning notices, of the consequences of refusing to pay an overdue charge.</P>
    <P>The Bill protects those who cannot afford to pay.  The effect of water charges on people on low incomes has been fully considered by the Government which has proposed that a water supply may not be disconnected in cases where failure to pay the charge is due to hardship.  We are also conscious of the need to ensure that the circumstances of all members of the household are taken into account by the court in considering an application from a local authority to disconnect.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the worry that possible disconnection could cause to people on low incomes, the Bill prohibits disconnection in any cases where a water charge waiver has been granted on the grounds of hardship.  Restricting disconnection on the grounds of hardship will not significantly affect local authority income as the majority of these cases already come within the scope of these waiver schemes.  We should not make any apologies for these measures which are designed to protect the less well off in our society.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly has a problem with sections of the Bill in so far as they provide <Col N="884" /> that the personal and household circumstances of consumers will be taken into account by the courts when considering an application to disconnect a water supply.  Is the Senator suggesting, for example, that if a member of a household is seriously ill and has no control over whether the charge is paid, the local authority should be empowered to cut off the supply?  Senator Daly also mentioned dealing with consumers in a sensible and humane way.  I submit that this proviso, which would allow the personal and household circumstances to be taken into account, is a move towards dealing with the issue of disconnection in a sensible and humane way.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly does not seem to understand what coalition Government involves.  The Bill was promised in the policy document agreed by the three parties in Government.  Consensus and coalition is all about agreement between different parties.</P>

      <P>Over 100,000 Dubliners have a disability.  One in four families have been affected by disability and experience disadvantage and discrimination as a result.  The number of Dubliners with disabilities is growing as the population grows older.  People with disabilities experience, on a daily basis, man-made handicapping features in the environment, despite being entitled to enjoy the same choice of activity and freedom of access as any other person. Additional barriers, mainly physical, force people with disabilities to resort to segregated arrangements when all they want to do is to fully participate in life, as is their right.</P>
      <P>The barrier we are discussing is the absence of adequate access to public transport in Dublin for people with disabilities or for anyone who experiences mobility difficulties.  To them, Dublin buses are inaccessible and the DART service is unsatisfactory because the majority of stations are inaccessible. The DART system was constructed in the early 1980s and the stations were reconstructed then without being made accessible to people with disabilities. The wheelchair accessible public hire vehicles licences for taxis have gone some of the way to meet disabled people's transport requirements. However, exorbitant travel costs are a deterrent to full participation by disabled people in Irish social, economic and cultural life.</P>

      <P>InCare states in its submission that transport makes the difference between opportunity and exclusion.  Transport makes it possible for people to socialise, take up employment and to actively contribute to society.  Without affordable accessible transport, people with disabilities are like prisoners in their own homes.  It is every person's right to participate in society.  Exclusion due to the absence of affordable accessible public transport amounts to a breach of human rights. The Centre for Independent Living was established at Carmichael House in 1992 by people with disabilities, in order to fight for their human rights.  It is a consumer led organisation which aims to enable all disabled people to achieve self-determination, independent living and control of their own lives.</P>
      <P>People with disabilities recently spent over 55 hours outside Leinster House protesting against the failure of the Government to cater for them in mainstream public transport.  I thank the Leader and all the Members of the House who have organised this debate today.</P>
      <P>The attendance of disabled people in the House is a great credit to everybody. Their policy favours full inclusion, and their goal is to make mainstream public transport accessible to disabled people. They do not want to be provided with a special or segregated transport service. They are not demanding that Dublin Bus replace their entire fleet overnight with accessible buses.  They are calling for a change in its fleet replacement policy. An old bus should be replaced with a bus accessible to disabled people. They fully accept that the replacement of Dublin Bus rolling stock with accessible buses will take time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To overcome the short term problem, the Centre for Independent Living has developed Vantastic, a transport initiative which will be owned and controlled by people with disabilities.  It envisages Vantastic as a co-operative which will provide an accessible door to door transport service, initially for people with disabilities and then for anyone <Col N="887" /> who experiences mobility difficulties. The Vantastic concept will consist of twenty accessible buses providing a door to door service from 8 a.m. to 2 a.m., seven days a week, and giving employment to 68 people, six of whom will be people with significant disabilities.</P>
    <P>The Centre for Independent Living has come up with a novel idea to finance the cost of Vantastic.  It points out that each year the Government and the Department of Social Welfare spend tens of millions of pounds on free travel passes for the elderly and disabled to encourage the elderly and disabled to remain active in the community.  This year £29.5 million will be spent on such passes for 465,000 people.  However, a significant proportion of these people do not benefit from this scheme because they cannot get on to public buses and avail of a scheme that was designed for them.  People with disabilities would prefer to pay for a bus they can get on to than be given a free travel pass for a bus that is inaccessible.  The purpose of Vantastic is to enable people with disabilities to become active in the community. The transfer of just 7 per cent &mdash; £1.8 million &mdash; of the £29.5 million spent on free travel passes would be sufficient to fund Vantastic.</P>
    <P>Dublin Bus has recently made a token effort to address the problem of inaccessible public transport with the introduction of its OmniLink buses. However, these were introduced without any consultation with its customers, mainly people with disabilities, and only operate on a limited route in the city centre, failing to accommodate the majority of people who are still faced with the problem of how to get into the city centre.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about making public transport accessible to those with disabilities it will be necessary for Dublin Bus to purchase low floor buses.  I understand that in Belfast Ulster Bus recently announced its decision to purchase 60 low floor accessible buses locally and its chairman stated that not <Col N="888" /> only will these buses transform public transport for disabled people, but the elderly and mothers with buggies will also benefit from the low no-step-up fleet of accessible buses.  This will mean faster boarding which will result in a quicker service for all passengers.</P>
    <P>The document &ldquo;Towards a Full Citizenship For All&rdquo; which was submitted to the Dáil and Seanad by the justice commission of the Conference of Religious of Ireland states:</P>
    <P>Full citizenship is not simply about political rights such as the right to vote, to equality before the law, to possession of a passport.  It is also about social rights such as the right to adequate income, to meaningful work, to participate in society.</P>
    <P>Those with disabilities are being denied full citizenship because they are being excluded from participation in society by the non provision of affordable, accessible public transport.  I hope they will never again have to protest outside Dáil Éireann in order to obtain that basic civil right.</P>

However, we will continue with the debate and I hope that our deliberations will be brought to the attention of the Minister by the Leader of the House.

    <P>
      <Col N="889" /> While today we are dealing to a large degree with the lack of accessibility for the disabled to Dublin Bus, this is only the tip of the iceberg.  What is disability? The definition should apply to a person with a physical or mental impairment which has substantial and long term adverse effects on his or her ability to carry out normal day to day activities. A long term impairment should be defined as one that has lasted, or can reasonably be expected to last, at least 12 months.  Where an impairment ceases to have a substantial adverse effect on a person's ability to carry out normal day to day activities it should be treated as continuing to have that effect if that effect is likely to recur.</P>
    <P>An impairment should be taken to affect normal day to day activities only if it affects mobility; manual dexterity; physical co-ordination; continence; ability to lift, carry or move everyday objects; speech, hearing or eyesight; memory or ability to learn or understand; or perception of the risk of physical danger.  A mental impairment should include a mental illness or disorder if it is a clinically recognised condition.  People with severe disfigurement should not be required to satisfy the substantial effect provision but the condition should be required to be long term.  The definition should also apply to those whose disability is regulated by medication or by the use of a special aid.  Those with progressive conditions, for example, cancer, multiple sclerosis or muscular dystrophy, should be covered by the definition when the condition would be expected in the future to have a substantial effect on the person's ability to carry out normal day to day activities.</P>
    <P>Those definitions should be enshrined in law and I call on the Minister and the Government to bring before the House, as a matter of urgency, a disability anti-discrimination Bill.  The Bill should provide for a statutory right of non discrimination in employment and access to goods and services.  It should also provide for the creation of a national disability council which would have the power to make regulations to include or <Col N="890" /> exclude specific conditions or the day to day activities not specified in the primary legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill should have wide ranging anti-discrimination measures which would provide for a statutory right of non discrimination against disabled people in the field of employment, including a duty on employers to make a reasonable adjustment to working conditions and the working environment to overcome the practical effects of a disability; a statutory right of access to goods and services, including the removal of barriers and the provision of aids, which is reasonable and readily achievable; and the elimination of any potential discrimination in financial services.</P>
    <P>A national disability council could advise the Government on issues and measures relating to the elimination of discrimination and the strengthening of policy and programme guidance for local authorities.  Government Departments, in particular the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, and commercial State-sponsored bodies should ensure that new buses are of low floor construction and extend the new right of access to cover parts of the transport infrastructure such as railways and bus stations.  There should be new access standards for schools and consultation on imaginative ways to encourage schools and school transport providers to cater for disabled pupils and to bring forward proposals for a scheme to identify cost effective solutions for increased accessibility.</P>
    <P>Where access is wrongly denied, a disabled person should be able to take civil proceedings to recover damages for any financial loss suffered as well as injuries to feelings.  Attitudes must change as we need a major swing towards the positive. Until now, the tendency has been to dwell on what the disabled cannot do rather than what they can do.  I reject the notion that the disabled should be given something as a concession as it must all be part of a human rights issue. Independence is the most important issue for the disabled.  Education will <Col N="891" /> enable people to achieve a measure of independence but only good legislation will ensure it.</P>

      <P>I will clarify the point. This decision was taken some years ago as part of a general package of Seanad reforms to give flexibility to the House when it wants to have debates and discussions on issues.  We express our views and they are put on the record.  The people on whose behalf we are speaking are assured there is a voice on their behalf.  I would like the matter to rest there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the statements which have been made on both sides on this issue.  It is the right of everybody to have access to public transport and public buildings and the State should recognise this.  It is wrong that in 1995 this is not the case with Dublin Bus and in other areas.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Centre for Independent Living for bringing this to our attention.  Until last year, when it made its positive protest, I was unaware of the difficulties concerning Dublin Bus.  It is a reflection on many of us that such issues have to be brought to our attention. Since then I have been aware of the difficulties of the physically disabled and I compliment the centre for its work and campaign on their behalf.  It is a disgrace that organisations like Dublin Bus are inaccessible to disabled people and the policy should be changed.  The centre also brings to our attention that the DART service is unsatisfactory and work should also be done in this area. The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications should impress on these organisations, of whom he is the sole shareholder, the need to change policy on this issue and the urgency with which this should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Public travel is important for everybody, especially for the disabled, not all of whom have private transport.  It is important for all areas of their lives.  A proportionately larger number of disabled people are unemployed and this <Col N="893" /> is unsatisfactory.  Lack of proper public access affects people's employment opportunities as well as their social and family lives.  They have difficulty visiting sisters, brothers, uncles and aunts.  Simple things we take for granted when using public transport are not available to them.  They are excluded from certain aspects of society because they are not able to use public transport.</P>
    <P>In addition to the issue of public transport, I am also concerned about the recognition by the State of the general needs of the disabled, particularly the physically disabled.  A reply to a parliamentary question in the Dáil a year or 18 months ago showed that there are approximately 45,000 physically disabled and 25,000 mentally disabled people in Ireland.  The mentally disabled do not receive adequate resources from the State to ensure their rights are preserved. However, relatively speaking, they do better than the physically disabled, who are not catered for fairly or reasonably.</P>
    <P>I have suggested to many organisations representing the physically disabled that one of the reasons for this is that the mentally disabled have a coordinated organisation which does excellent work in lobbying very successfully on their behalf, although not as successfully as we would like.  The physically disabled do not have the same coordinated representation and influence. The Centre for Independent Living has made a bigger impact on politicians than any other organisation for the physically disabled over the years.  Many organisations do excellent work and I have advised and worked with several of them.  I always impress on them the need to form a united lobby to assist the physically disabled.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of the Centre for Independent Living are relevant and I support them.  It has recommended that the Minister should instruct CIE to change its fleet replacement policy so that all new rolling stock &mdash; buses, trains and coaches &mdash; is fully accessible; that regulations should be introduced which stipulate that licences for new rolling <Col N="894" /> stock are conditional on that stock being fully accessible; that the term &ldquo;fully accessible&rdquo; be defined by the user and not by the company; that CIE consult in the fullest possible sense people with disabilities on the matter of which accessible rolling stock to introduce; that disabled people be more fully involved in the transport decisions which affect them; that the transition from inaccessible to accessible public transport occur within an agreed time scale; that funding is provided for Vantastic, an interim solution to the transport problem; that the Department of Social Welfare, in conjunction with CIE, should reassess its free travel policy from the perspective of the intended user &mdash; to many intended users a free travel pass is of no use; that the Department and CIE agree to transfer a percentage of the funds for free travel passes to a service which would genuinely help to achieve the objectives of the free travel scheme, that is to encourage the elderly and disabled to remain active in the community; and that existing and future funding, which reinforces the disabled person's dependency, should be ceased.  Rather than spending European funds on propping up systems and structures which inevitably lead to marginalisation, which we seek to avoid, it is preferable that this funding should be stopped completely and redirected to projects and enterprises managed and controlled by people with disabilities.  I have put these recommendations on the record for the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment InCare for putting so much pressure on us that we have had to have this debate.  Over the past few months I met many disabled people outside Leinster House who try to travel around Dublin.  This topic is most important and it is depressing to look at the figures InCare has produced on transport for people with disabilities in other European capitals and to see the extent to which we are shamed because we spend nothing on promoting the increased use of public transport in <Col N="895" /> this city by people with disabilities, particulary those in wheelchairs.</P>
      <P>I strongly support what InCare is trying to do.  It points out that it is not only those who are currently unable to get on buses who would be facilitated by better provision of lower entry buses.  When I was getting on the bus at Leeson Street yesterday, I had to help an elderly woman to get over the first step of the bus; getting her over the second step also required assistance.  This elderly woman was trying to go about her normal business and this poses a grave inconvenience and difficulty for all those who are trying to get around the city on public transport.</P>
      <P>The fact it pointed out that the low access buses are being assembled locally is also important.  Therefore, we would be promoting industry and employment on an all island basis, which is one of the more attractive reasons for getting its recommendations implemented urgently.  There are extremely good social reasons for urging better access to buses for people in wheelchairs or those with other mobility difficulties. However, and this was mentioned by many Senators, while disabled people have been given bus passes, what is the use of having them if they cannot get on the buses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We promote people to get involved in second and third level education.  Great efforts have been made in universities, technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology to try to improve access for the disabled so that those with a disability, and there are many of them, who need better access to public buildings can become involved in third level education.  I am extremely pleased that one of these young women currently studying in Trinity College &mdash; I will not mention her name or I will be accused of promoting her too much &mdash; got a second class honours degree in her examinations recently and it is good to see her here today.  She is enthusiastic about continuing her involvement within the university.  However, as she pointed out to me, getting in and out of <Col N="896" /> the college is a nightmare task for her. When one thinks of the effort she made in attaining entrance to the university and successfully continuing her studies there, we should ensure it is made as accessible as possible.</P>
    <P>As one would expect, I have also looked at this matter from the health point of view.  Of course, many people with disabilities, particularly those who are wheelchair bound, have to avail of the health services more frequently than many other members of our population.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that providing taxis for disabled people is the solution to this problem and would be a cheaper proposition.  When Brendan Corish was Minster for Health, he introduced the most humanitarian policy of letting people who were literally imprisoned in their own homes to avail of a taxi to go to hospital.  We treated people who had not seen doctors or been able to get to clinics for years.  It was unbelievable. The forecourt of Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital was packed with taxis. However, the scheme had to be abandoned within months because its cost was astronomical.  Before anyone again suggests such a concession, they should look at what happened in 1968 and the enormous expenditure incurred by the Department of Health in ferrying people to hospitals by taxis.</P>
    <P>I have also seen a number of ambulances drawing up at hospital doors bringing people who were not able to get to hospital on public transport.  They are perfectly well able to tell bus conductors where they want to go and to organise their travelling arrangements but because they cannot get on any form of public transport, extraordinarily expensive arrangements have to be made, such as sending our Eastern Health Board ambulances to adjacent houses, to bring them in.  It is not only the costs but the logistics that are incredible.  These people then have to hang around hospital outpatients' waiting rooms for a considerable time before an ambulance can come back to ferry them home, which may be a distance of as little as half a mile.  It would <Col N="897" /> be much easier if they had access to a bus to get there.</P>
    <P>I am delighted this issue came up today.  In the past, I have written and spoken about the lack of access for people in wheelchairs to the DART, taxis and trains.  The situation regarding the DART should also be covered because many of the buses that need to be converted to lower access are feeder buses to the DART.  Some of the doors in the DART are fairly accessible for non-electrically operated wheelchairs but there is grave difficulty for those using electrically operated wheelchairs when they get inside.  There is a metal bar in the DART which makes it almost impossible for people to turn around to get out.  Not all stations have good access for people in wheelchairs.  One DART station I have written about is Sandymount, which is near the Rehabilitation Institute training centre. It seems essential that this station, above all others, should have good access so that disabled people can get in and out of it easily.</P>
    <P>I also wrote to the Minister about taxis.  It is amazing the information one can get when going abroad.  I attended a meeting about AIDS with Senator Norris and Mary Banotti MEP in Barcelona. When we were there, I noticed that one of the delegates from the House of Lords was a wheelchair bound woman.  I was fascinated to see that there are a considerable number of taxis in Barcelona that have two slips going under the taxi which make them more convenient for disabled people, which would be more convenient than the difficulties we experience in getting disabled people in and out of taxis in this country.  I hope this sort of facility could be promoted in Dublin and I have written to the Minister about it.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention the situation with regard to trains.  I do not know if Members travel by train &mdash; I am sure many do &mdash; but it is appalling to see the way in which disabled people are shunted into a corner and left there. There are little facilities in our trains for <Col N="898" /> them to go to the lavatory or the dining car.  When I travelled to Cork on the train, I witnessed the terrible difficulties experienced by a man who was able to get out of his wheelchair, admittedly with great difficulty, in getting to the lavatory and the dining car to get something to eat.  We have to try to improve the facilities, although I know some carriages are better than others and I was travelling on elderly rolling stock at the time.  If Brian Crowley had not been appointed to this House, would we have seen such an improvement in the facilities for the disabled within it?  It is incredible what it takes to get action in these areas.</P>
    <P>Further access to other public places is needed.  Many disabled people find it difficult to get access to post offices. When one remembers the need of people with a disability to get into places where they have to claim benefit, these are important topics which we can link with their tremendous effort in making us look seriously at the situation regarding Dublin Bus.  It would also be a great help to me if I did not have to make such a high jump to get on the buses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate regarding the position of the disabled. There is currently no accessible public transport for people with disabilities.  In all walks of life, people with disabilities experience problems from the time they get up in the morning to when they go to bed at night, if it only means dressing themselves, eating at the kitchen table, getting out or coming into their houses, trying to get into their cars or on a bus or doing their shopping.  One finds much of the time that footpaths, public buildings and supermarkets do not have access for people with disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The document which the Department of Health recently published, <i>Shaping A Healthier Future</i>, asked if there were areas where we could improve the way of life not only for people with physical disabilities, but also those with psychiatric disabilities.  What can we, as politicians, do to help these people?  European <Col N="899" /> policy advocates full inclusion of people with disabilities.  This country is receiving funding for the transport services and CIE is getting a subvention from the Government and disability funding, yet it is making no effort to improve the way of life for disabled people who use Irish transport.</P>
    <P>I worked in the psychiatric services for many years and I know how hard we had to fight to get funding and to get people to accept psychiatric patients in the community.  Those with physical disabilities also experienced the same problem.  We must educate the public to accept that people with disabilities must be given special consideration.  The attitude of some people when we tried to move those in the psychiatric services into the community was unbelievable. They did not want these people living beside them.  We must educate society from an early stage so that it realises it has a duty towards people with psychiatric and physical disabilities.  We are sometimes referred to as a caring society.  Many problems start early in life and if proper education was available, the public might show more support.</P>
    <P>Two weeks ago I attended the British championship of the Disabled Fly Fisheries Association in Bundoran.  I was amazed at the courage of the people who attended because they had all types of disabilities, including those who were paralysed on one side and had lost legs and arms.  These people strive to get on with their daily lives.  They came to the championship in wheelchairs and they were hoisted on to boats so that they could fish.  It gave them an opportunity to lead as normal a life as possible.  They were not looking for favours from anybody; they were looking for fair play, just like any group in society.</P>
    <P>It was wrong that people with disabilities had to sit outside Dáil Éireann for three days to try to get their message across.  They have a contribution to make to society and we in the Houses of the Oireachtas should do all we can to help them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="900" /> When I shop in a supermarket or visit the district hospital, as I do on a regular basis, I notice that disabled parking spaces have been taken by people who do not need them and do not care.  I have major concerns about the attitude of the public in this regard.  Parking places are specifically left for people with disablements, yet other people would drive a horse and cart into them. This is unfair to those who need to use them.</P>
    <P>I read recently that Ulsterbus in County Derry has purchased 60 low floor accessible buses in order to make life as easy as possible for those less agile.  The low floor buses have a front door step which is no higher than 350 millimetres above the ground and a slide out ramp which bridges the gap between the kerb and the step.  These are important considerations which bus companies must take into account.  CIE and other bus companies are reluctant to do something about this situation. Excuses are offered in the South, but bus companies in Northern Ireland have taken the initial step.  These coaches are made in Ballymena and Belfast, therefore I cannot understand why Dublin Bus does not purchase a number of them.  It is failing in its duty to the public by not doing so.  These buses are also suitable for elderly people and mothers with prams.  If one watches a mother trying to manoeuvre a buggy along the road and up on a footpath, one can understand the problems which disabled people face.</P>
    <P>Accessible public transport would facilitate a better way of life for people with disabilities because they would not have to pay for taxis.  Taxis are not suitable because it is difficult to get in and out of them.  It would be cheaper if public transport was available for disabled people.</P>
    <P>It costs approximately £2.25 billion to run the Department of Health each year.  That is a lot of money and there is pressure to see that it is spent correctly. Disabled people are only asking for approximately £1.8 million.  They have set up a programme called &ldquo;Vantastic&rdquo;<Col N="901" /> which will allow them to have their own independent service.  Some £1.8 million is a small amount of money when one compares it to £2.25 billion and when one considers the benefits which would accrue.  I urge the Minister to accept this request for the benefit of these people.</P>
    <P>Recently disabled people met the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, in Letterkenny.  Some of my friends who were at that meeting are outside today.  They told the Minister in no uncertain terms what they wanted. These people have been marginalised, but they have a lot to gain through accessible public transport.  We, as Oireachtas Members, must ensure that something is done to allow them to live life as independently as possible.</P>

      <P>I welcome the delegation from the Centre for Independent Living who travelled here at great inconvenience and who are in the ante-room because the Public Gallery is inaccessible to wheelchair users.  That says a lot about this House.</P>
      <P>The Leader has stated that the attendance of a Minister is not required when a debate is agreed by all parties.  I accept that, but this is a special debate. This issue requires a change in ministerial policy and a statement by the Minister outlining his attitude towards the problem which has been brought to our attention by members of the Centre for Independent Living.  In response to a Dáil question, the Minister said that fleet replacement was an internal matter for CIE and had nothing to do with him. That is a deplorable attitude and it goes against the Government's stated commitment to equality for people with disabilities. It is not my desire or the desire of the people in the ante-room that this should be a slanging-match, but they feel that the Minister should respond to the points made.  I reiterate the need for the Minister to be present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not mean any discourtesy to the people in the ante-room. I only said it would be better if the Minister could respond to the points raised.</P>
      <P>I may not make my points as well as those which were made to me by the people in the ante-room, but I will do my best and I will refer to their briefing document when it is helpful to do so.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that participation depends on access and when people do not have access to education or employment, they are discriminated against.  To quote the InCare document, which was written by the people affected, &ldquo;Without affordable, accessible transport, we, people with disabilities, are like prisoners in our own homes&rdquo;.  This point needs to be made again and again.</P>
      <P>The thrust of my contribution will relate to public transport.  It should be inclusive and that is the point made by the Centre for Independent Living Limited. They are reasonable people and accept it is not possible to replace the entire bus fleet immediately but they ask for a change in policy so that where there is a need to replace buses, they are replaced with accessible vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>InCare says that huge amounts of taxpayers' money are used to provide the public transport system.  People from InCare, some of whom are in the ante-chamber, are among those contributing revenue.  A sum of £40 million is spent by the Department of Education on school transport and £5.8 million of that is specifically earmarked to cater for <Col N="903" /> those with disabilities.  Yet there are no facilities for disabled people to enable them to use the public transport system. Taxpayers are not getting value for money and money earmarked for a specific purpose is not being used to that end.</P>
    <P>A sum of £30 million is provided for the free travel scheme.  Again, this money is aimed at specific groups many of whom cannot avail of public transport. Of those who use the free travel scheme, 304,000 are over 66 years of age.  They may have a problem with ordinary access to public transport and 78.6 per cent of those entitled to free travel have difficulty accessing public transport.</P>
    <P>According to InCare, 40 per cent of commuters have problems with access to public transport.  I was probably one when my two children were young; I carried one in a sling and the other in a buggy.  I thought that was difficult but it was pointed out forcefully by a member of InCare that at least it was only temporary. The position for disabled people is that the difficulties they encounter will not ease unless transport policy is changed and they will face these problems for the rest of their lives.</P>
    <P>We can speak of the physical difficulty in getting on and off buses and we can mention statistics and costs.  I had the advantage of being given a copy of a video of a disabled person accessing DART and Dublin Bus services.  We could have dispensed with the three hour debate and simply watched the video because it exemplifies the problem. Seeing somebody crawling up steps dragging a wheelchair behind them speaks volumes.  It is a dreadful way to treat a human being.  If we could concentrate our minds and those of the decision makers on that video, we need not bother with this debate.</P>
    <P>InCare drew attention to the fact that £500,000 of EU money earmarked for the disabled was used by Dublin Bus for an Omni-link service, which runs only within the city limits.  If disabled people could access that service, they would not <Col N="904" /> need a separate bus service.  If they could get into town to use it, they would have no problems.</P>
    <P>There is need for low-floor buses and that is the thrust of InCare's argument. They are being reasonable and ask, in the meantime, that the Government supports the &ldquo;Vantastic&rdquo; service, which they are providing.</P>
    <P>I asked InCare if they wanted a segregated public transport service and they do not.  They are reasonable, they do not expect the public transport system to change overnight and they realise that even if the money was available it would take five to six years so they need a stopgap.  They are not looking for additional finance.  I would be the first to say that we cannot keep screaming for money.  It was not available when we were in Government and it is not available now.  We can transfer funds within existing resources.  InCare says £1.8 million would set up the &ldquo;Vantastic&rdquo; service the first year and it would cost around £1.4 million per annum thereafter; 7 per cent of the free travel pass grant would fund it so we are not looking for additional taxation or money from areas where it does not exist.</P>
    <P>Last week, the Minister for Social Welfare was interviewed on the radio and he was asked to address the problems of our greying population.  By 2006 and beyond, we face the problem of a large aged population.  The change in public transport, which is being forced on us by the disabled, will be needed by the older population in future years.</P>
    <P>The public transport system is appalling in terms of the disabled but they wish to express their thanks to the CIE workers who do their best to accommodate the disabled in spite of their lack of training in assisting people with disabilities. That kind of training could be given by people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>InCare wants the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to give a commitment that he will ensure that the public transport system in Dublin will be accessible to people with disabilities within a specific timescale.  The key element to this is that he use his <Col N="905" /> power as sole shareholder in the CIE group to require that the company's fleet replacement programme involve purchasing only accessible rolling stock. InCare also wants the Minister to provide an interim solution by supporting its &ldquo;Vantastic&rdquo; scheme.</P>
    <P>I have not done InCare justice.  This is not a question of a transport or health problem, it is a question of equality.  As long as we continue the present public transport system, we discriminate against those who require our assistance, with obstacles being placed in their way.</P>

      <P>I welcome the members of the Centre for Independent Living Limited who are in the ante-chamber.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator McGennis that this is an equality issue.  Like other Members I have spoken many times of equality in terms of gender.  We also have a problem in relation to equality for disabled people in society.</P>
      <P>Mr. Justice Fergus Flood, chairperson of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, highlighted in his 1994 report the depths of isolation and exclusion of disabled people because they are denied access to public transport.  The single issue of transport is a major obstacle in giving people with disabilities greater equality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to a recent parliamentary question tabled by a member of my party, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications said Bus Éireann had no immediate plans to introduce wheelchair accessible buses on its services.  Frankly, I was amazed at this rejection by the Government of basic public transport for people confined to wheelchairs.  I do not think any Member supports the contention of the Minister that it is outside his remit.  The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, is the sole shareholder in Dublin Bus and the regulator for the transport industry.  He must be in a position to direct Dublin Bus to take heed of what he wants, so he should direct it immediately to introduce <Col N="906" /> what is requested by the Centre for Independent Living.</P>
    <P>There is no adequate accessible public transport for people with disabilities or for anyone who experiences mobility difficulty.  As many Members said, transport is the difference between opportunity and exclusion.  All of us who do not experience disability take for granted our ability to travel, because our lives are not affected.  As Senator McGennis said, the fact that representatives from the Centre for Independent Living cannot come into the Chamber is an indication of the difficulties experienced by people throughout the country. When the former Senator Crowley became a Member, changes were made to the buildings but the only reason they were made was to help him.  The changes were welcome but we were not aware of the difficulties experienced by people in wheelchairs until a disabled person became a Member.</P>
    <P>Accessible transport makes it possible for people to move around, take up employment and actively contribute to society.  It enables people to socialise and is an important factor in disabled people's lives.  There is a responsibility on the Minister to examine fleet replacement in Dublin Bus and to see what can be done in other public transport services throughout the country, because this problem is not specific to Dublin.  In the capital people have access to taxis which are specially equipped to take wheelchairs.  However in remote and rural areas the disabled have extreme difficulties getting around and, therefore, the problem is nationwide.</P>
    <P>The Centre for Independent Living has lobbied us on its proposal to the Minister.  That scheme would deal with Dublin in the short term and could then be expanded to other towns and cities. The centre has been reasonable in that it feels it would be expensive to replace buses overnight.  It has demanded that when an existing bus is in need of replacement it should be replaced with an accessible bus.  Deputy Lowry, as the relevant Minister and the sole shareholder <Col N="907" /> in Dublin Bus and Irish Rail, is in a position to achieve what he wants.</P>
    <P>EU social policy advocates full inclusion of people with disability.  The transport system is receiving funds from the EU which should be spent in accordance with this policy.  The absence of accessible transport is evidence that European money is being spent to reinforce exclusion of people with disabilities. Dublin Bus and Irish Rail are guilty of anti-social practices.  This money should be spent on that for which it was allocated and the EU would not condone this practice.</P>
    <P>Legislation has been passed in other countries which requires the operators of bus fleets to replace them every six years.  Vehicles are available which would be fully accessible to wheelchairs at the point of manufacture and it is time we passed similar legislation here.</P>
    <P>In its briefing document the Centre for Independent Living stated that Dublin is the only European capital which showed no willingness or intention to provide an accessible public transport system, despite the massive investment it receives from the EU.  This is disgraceful and we should not accept it.  It is shameful that we have not been more vigilant in this regard and that members of the Centre for Independent Living have had to place a picket on the Oireachtas to demand what they are guaranteed under the EU Convention and our Constitution, which guarantees equality to all citizens.  This equality should be provided to them by our politicians and Government.</P>
    <P>Most of the points I intended to make have been made by other Senators.  The Centre for Independent Living has been extremely reasonable; it has shown the Minister where to find the money to implement its wishes, has outlined what can be done in the short term and what it hopes will be done in the long term. The centre should expect no less than a reasonable response from Members and from the Minister who has the power to bring about change.</P>

The centre's campaign is a symptom of the overall lack of support, resources and facilities for people with impairments and disabilities. This will have to be fundamentally tackled by Government at national level but specific areas are in urgent need of attention and if the will exists Ministers can deal with them quickly.</P>
      <P>There is no justification for CIE introducing a fleet of buses which are not adequate to deal with the problem of access.  It is beyond my comprehension why the company purchased them.  During the centre's picket the Omni-Link service passed the gates every 20 minutes; it was empty.  One of the demands made by the centre is that this type of inadequate service should be terminated until it is adequate to deal with the problem of access.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications should intervene with a view to resolving this problem, or at least set out a timeframe in which access can be given to people who do not have it at present.  Buses are travelling through this city which are not catering for people who could avail of them if they had access.  The Minister should indicate this afternoon that he is prepared to intervene.  He is intervening in CIE in other respects, as can be seen in the newspapers in recent days but I do not wish to distract from this debate.</P>
      <P>This House has been snubbed, for which no blame attaches to the Leader. The Minister responsible has an obligation to the House precisely to set out the policies in these areas.  He should at least send a policy statement if he is not prepared to come here.  He knows this debate is taking place and should not be bound by&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>With respect, the Leader told me earlier that the Minister was aware this debate was taking place. Other Ministers are available.  The Minister of State left the House when this debate began.  When I was Minister I was here on several occasions when I had no responsibility for the debate taking place but out of courtesy on the part of the Government, I stayed to hear the views expressed and I conveyed them to the relevant Minister.  That is the least we could have expected this afternoon but I will not let these inadequacies distract us from the debate.  The people who came here are fully aware of the position and will judge for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In society generally, we have treated people with disabilities and impairments in a shabby manner over the last number of years.  The Government made commitments about special financial contributions to deal with the problems. The Acting Chair is as aware as I am of the position in the mid-west, where people like Mr. Ger South have been campaigning for years to have action to deal with the problems.  All we hear are more commitments to White and Green Papers but no practical solutions.  Where are the finances coming from to deal with these problems?  Were it not for the fact that we had Brian Crowley here as a Senator, who is now an MEP, some of the improvements that have been made to facilitate handicapped people would not have been made at all.  He created an awareness of the necessity to deal with these issues.  Even today, due to lack of accommodation, many people cannot gain access to Leinster House to hear Members of the Seanad and to <Col N="910" /> hear, if we can, what the Government proposes to do about these things.</P>
    <P>This discussion is centred mainly on the problems experienced in Dublin Bus.  It is, however, a symptom of a malaise throughout this country and in every area of Government administration which needs to be addressed. Do we have to wait until the European Union or some other institution forces us to introduce a bill of rights for people with impairments and disabilities?  Why can we not get our own Minister to do it?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Equality and Law Reform is sheltering behind a Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.  Everybody in the House knows what the disadvantages, handicaps and disabilities are and what is required to deal with them.  Resources are needed to make education more available and we can positively discriminate in favour of disabled people by providing them with access to university. How many professional people suffer from incapacity or disability in the Four Courts, the Oireachtas or in public life generally?  There are very few, mainly because they do not have the means of access.</P>
    <P>In the mid-west we have seen &mdash; and I am sure the situation is the same elsewhere &mdash; the lack of accommodation, training places and workshops.  In addition, there is a shortage of skilled personnel to help train people who could, in spite of some of their disadvantages, make a meaningful and worthwhile contribution to the economy and to society generally.  In such circumstances handicapped people could make far more rewarding careers and lives for themselves.  They do not want charity handouts from us but they are seeking a fair and decent regime that will recognise their problems and provide the finances to deal with them.  Above all, Government Ministers should demonstrate some real commitment to deal with these problems.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications has already tried to break up the board of CIE.  Maybe it <Col N="911" /> is time to do it, but I am not so sure what is behind those moves.  However, if he could now intervene in this issue, set an agenda for change and provide the prospect that something will be done soon about this, then the debate may have been worthwhile.</P>
    <P>I thank you, Acting Chairman, for the latitude you have afforded to me.  I do not want to get emotional or hysterical about these issues but we are sick and tired of raising them through health boards and other organisations.  The disabled continuously complain about the lack of job opportunities and prospects to make a meaningful contribution to society.  It is time we made an effort to resolve these problems, otherwise we will be dragged screaming into the 21st century on this as on many other issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The note struck by my friend and colleague, Senator Daly, is the correct one in the circumstances.  It is right to be angry and emotional about this issue.  If we cannot attempt to articulate the frustrations felt by those less capable than ourselves &mdash; the disadvantaged among us &mdash; then we are really serving no useful purpose in this House.  From that point of view we should all be emotional about it.</P>
      <P>At some point we should have a statement from the Minister responsible.  If he cannot be in this House a statement should come from him this afternoon in relation to the points that have been raised here.  Otherwise we are just talking to ourselves.  I cannot help but think that it is a bit like Hamlet without the prince as we stand here.  However, we will do what we can in the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Senator Daly and others, I have spent some time talking to representatives of the organisation which picketed Leinster House today.  It was regrettable that they had to go to such extreme lengths to put across a legitimate point of view.  The debate on this issue seems to have started somewhat late in this country.  It is very far advanced in Europe and is all but completed in the <Col N="912" /> United States following the proactive campaign by the American counterparts of our Irish friends.  They managed to persuade federal and state governments to invest the moneys necessary to ensure that many of the points raised here today are redundant.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan raised the question of European funding wherein lies part of the answer.  I refer to the <i>Operational Programme for Transport, 1994-1999</i> which, under the heading &ldquo;Economic Context&rdquo;, states:</P>
    <P>The purpose of the programme is to assist the fundamental aim of achieving further substantial progress towards the national and European Union goal of economic and social cohesion.  The programme is designed to underpin and support local development.  Article 130a of the Maastricht Treaty will strengthen economic and social cohesion and in particular reduce disparities between the levels of development of the various regions and the backwardness of the least favoured regions including rural areas.</P>
    <P>When one reads on to discover the amounts of money being allocated under this operational programme, the figures are quite staggering.  Over £2.6 billion is currently being allocated under the Operational Programme for Transport between 1994 and 1999.  Of this, £356 million is being allocated specifically to the Dublin Transport Initiative and other transport uses in the capital city and region.  Another sum of £275 million is being allocate for rail development nationwide.  This is an astonishing sum of money.  If one looks at the Exchequer subvention to Iarnród Éireann and adds to it the amount of money from Europe for bus and rail investment &mdash; but primarily for rail investment &mdash; over the next five years, the actual amount of money which CIE themselves are going to generate from their own resources in terms of fares and other commercial activities is quite a small percentage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="913" /> It is disingenuous of the Minister responsible to pass the buck and say he has no role in the day to day operations of CIE in this area, or for CIE to say they have no plans to implement any of the proposals which our lobby group has been asking for.  Something is definitely wrong.  There should be linkage.  The European Union should request this Government to ensure that there is an adequate response to the points raised by the lobby group.  It does not matter who is in Government because it is an operational programme that started in 1994 under one Administration and by 1999 will, I hope, be operating under another Administration.  The only way forward to shift this mind set and the culture of indifference which seems to have built up at State level is to persuade the European Union to refuse to give the State a penny unless it is prepared to implement proposals such as those outlined.</P>
    <P>There are also commercial considerations. An estimated 7,000 people in this country use wheelchairs.  It is estimated that about 1,000 of them use specially adapted motor vehicles.  This leaves approximately 6,000 wheelchair users who would use public transport were it not for the restrictions placed on them. There are people who are disabled in other ways, including the aged who would be the walking disabled.  These people, because of age or physical disability, do not have the confidence to confront the restrictions placed on them by the current public transport system. They are afraid to use a bus or a train because adequate provisions are not made for them.  Bus stations, railway stations and public transport generally tend to attract a mixture of people which can be quite intimidating, particularly for elderly people on their own.</P>
    <P>Recent figures indicate that we are a rapidly ageing population.  By the year 2020 a significant percentage of our people will be over 65.  We should not just implement these decisions for today; they should be implemented so that they will be in place for future generations. Commercial considerations <Col N="914" /> centre around those figures.  Some 70 per cent of public transport in Germany is in line with the suggested proposals. This has resulted in a 25 per cent increase in public transport usage in Germany.  What would be the commercial impact of these proposals on Irish society?</P>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare provides travel cards for Iarnród Éireann.  Increased usage would mean that Iarnród Éireann and Bus Éireann would have more money to invest instead of having to come cap in hand, as they do on a regular basis, to the State for further subventions.  Hundreds of thousands of people in this country have travel cards.  Following the recent initiative of this Government in extending the travel plan to residents of Northern Ireland, there is now a significant and growing pool of people who would use public transport more readily but are intimidated by the difficulties.</P>
    <P>I am grateful for being allowed a little extra latitude.  My final point relates to an experience I had in the last two years in a county which relies to a great extent on tourism.  A couple wanted to extend their house to provide facilities for handicapped people wishing to take activity holidays beside one of our nice lakes.  The grant aid made available to them was derisory.  They had to source most of their finance from their own resources and had to borrow.  If we are serious about tourism, specifically niche tourism, there must be a change in the culture and mind set of State agencies.</P>
    <P>If we do nothing else today, we might change the attitude which seems to have built up over generations that the voluntary sector can look after the disabled; the disabled can look after themselves and the State just stands back and says, as the Minister stated in a reply to a specific question, it does have any operational role.  That is not acceptable.  If we do nothing else today but change that attitude, we will have done a good day's work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the plea made by Senators to ensure that people with disabilities have access to public transport and other facilities.  I can <Col N="915" /> speak with a little authority.  I was confined to a wheelchair for four months in the 1960s when I had the misfortune of breaking my right leg in a farming accident. I was anxious to continue farming and, before that leg had fully recovered, I was driving a tractor one day which went out of control and I broke my other leg.  This necessitated my being in a wheelchair for four months.</P>
      <P>I know the handicap these people experience where mobility is concerned. I am anxious, therefore, to make a plea for proper money and facilities to cater for the needs of the handicapped.  There was a debate on this issue when I first came to the House a long time ago.  The former Senator Jago mentioned that there were no facilities in this House for incapacitated people who had to use wheelchairs but that has improved since then.  I do not see why it could not improve for the general public.</P>
      <P>I met some of these people today and I pay tribute to the organisation. InCare, for the great work they have done, and especially for highlighting the problems these people face in terms of mobility and access to public transport. They mentioned Dublin Bus and the difficulties people living in Dublin suburbs experience when trying to use public transport.  They have no facilities and this will have to be addressed.  People need buses which cater for people in wheelchairs.</P>
      <P>There are organisations, including the Cheshire Homes, in my own area which cater for these people.  However, the midwest area needs extra funding to meet the needs of the disabled.  When speaking on a different motion some time ago I mentioned that money can be found for other areas.  This area is the most deserving of all and disabled people need whatever assistance they get.  I ask the Minister responsible to provide money for these people.  My experience tells me how difficult it is for them to get around.  I hope their needs will be met and that they will be pleased with this debate.</P>

      <P>I add my voice to the call for support for people who are less well off than ourselves and find it difficult to go use public transport, not only in Dublin but in every town in Ireland. It is a pity that they have to come to us to ask that these facilities be made available.  Over the years successive Governments have done little to support these people and the time has come to take a major step forward.  There have been many meetings and many statements about what could, should and might be done.  If the Minister makes the money available, all of the rights these people demand could and should be met.</P>
      <P>Every one of us knows somebody who has a physical disability.  One of our own Members who went on to become a Member of the European Parliament, former Senator Crowley, demonstrated for us more than anybody else could the problems of being confined to a wheelchair. This House has never had facilities for people in wheelchairs.  In a matter of days after Brian Crowley was nominated to the Seanad, the whole House was changed and money was found to fund that.  Where there is a will there is a way.  Brian Crowley is now in the European Parliament and is making a great case for people with disabilities. If he starts there and we start here, in the next couple of months buses of a type that would allow access to people with disabilities could be in use.</P>
      <P>We seem to be very Dublin-oriented; we must make a case for all those throughout Ireland who have to use a wheelchair.  They are in every part of rural Ireland.  I fully support their every demand, not because it is the popular thing to do, but because I feel for these people and they have the same rights as everybody else.  I ask the Minister to make funds available immediately.  The time for talk is over, the time for action is now.  I support the people who are here today and I want them to know that in me they have a friend who will support their cause now and in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am privileged to have the opportunity of supporting this call for the necessary facilities to be provided for people with disability in our national transportation system.  I say that deliberately, as I am nominated to contest the Seanad election on behalf of the Irish Wheelchair Association.  I and those who were privileged to have a nomination before have a special responsibility and obligation to promote on all occasions the rights of people with disabilities to enjoy the same access to public buildings, public transport and the exercise of all rights characteristic of citizenship in this country.</P>
      <P>Before people with disabilities can exercise their normal rights, one of which is freedom of movement, many of the barriers that are unwittingly but nonetheless practically erected against them must be dismantled.  We take access to public transport for granted and walk up or down the steps of a bus and get aboard a train without effort, but access to buses and trains is not available to people who have demonstrated time and time again, because nature does compensate, their intellectual and mental capacity and their conviction that they are at least on a par with the rest who do not have physical disability.</P>
      <P>I have been struck at all times in any contact and association with people with disabilities by their capacity to be concerned as well for others, but they must of course fight their own battle first.  We are living in an era of interdependence. We cannot discharge our responsibilities in society without ensuring that others who have exactly the same rights will be allowed to discharge theirs and will not be frustrated by lack of provision for their needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objective studies of any group who examine this issue, for instance the Centre for Independent Living, make two reasonable demands.  The first is that the Minister for Transport should give a specific commitment to ensure the public transport system in Dublin will be made accessible.  Is that too much to ask?  It must be made accessible <Col N="918" /> to people with disabilities within a specific timescale, because if public transport is not accessible then CIE is not providing transport.  It is public transport which does not cater for those who have a very special right to be included, those with physical disadvantages.  It cannot be properly called a public transport system unless and until that anomaly is corrected.</P>
    <P>As the sole shareholder in CIE the Minister is in a very special position to implement the recommendations of the report, particularly in relation to the replacement of existing stock by wheelchair accessible rolling stock.  Interim solutions along the lines of the Vantastic scheme are also desirable.  This would involve a fleet of fully accessible buses designed specifically for the mobility impaired and owned and controlled by disabled people.</P>
    <P>The impact on this House and on the nation of a Member with physical disability has been quite dramatic.  Wheelchair access to this House has improved considerably as a consequence.  All people, not just those who happen to have a disability, not only expect but demand that in all public facilities, including public transport, we will pull down the barriers which have been unwittingly erected against those in our society who are often most gifted in terms of their intellectual capacity and conviction, if somewhat disadvantaged in terms of a physical disability.</P>
    <P>During promotional activity, many of us have spent perhaps 30 minutes to an hour in a wheelchair doing simple things such as trying to enter shops, to experience what it must be like for our fellow citizens every day.  That must make us aware of the difficulties we unwittingly impose on our fellow citizens.  I hope this motion will enable us to pull down the barrier that has been erected in public transport.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with most Senators who have spoken eloquently on the need for a greater awareness, particularly in Bus Éireann and Dublin Bus of the need to make our public bus service <Col N="919" /> more accessible for people with a disability. This problem could be overcome for what seems to be a relatively small amount of money.  A lack of thought, planning and consideration has contributed to the situation in which we now find ourselves.  Listening to Senator Daly one would think his party did not have access to finances during the past 40 years.  He became very agitated when speaking about the failure of the present Government to do anything about this. I remind him that, not so long ago, he was in a position to do something.</P>
      <P>There are areas, other than transport, which could be considered to see what the Government, and people in general, can do to break down the barriers and ensure that the lives of disabled people are made easier.  How many local authority houses are built with wheelchair users in mind?  A scheme of houses was recently built in my town and I challenge anybody with a wheelchair to use those houses with any freedom.  The steps to them are quite steep.  I would like the section of the Department of the Environment with responsibility in this area to draw up plans for local authorities to build specific houses in housing estates that are wheelchair accessible.</P>
      <P>Very few of our public toilets are wheelchair accessible.  All that is required in this regard is a gentle reminder from the Department of the Environment to local authorities to encourage them to provide wheelchair accessible toilets.  The provision of a small grant would not be out of place here.  We need to be that little bit more thoughtful and careful in our planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I add my support to this plea to help people with disability.  I am disappointed with the lack of interest of CIE &mdash; in which vast amounts of money have been invested by successive Governments &mdash; in providing a proper service for the disabled.  It only provides a very poor service for the general public. I recently took a trip on the Cork-Dublin train which was overcrowded <Col N="920" /> and resembled a cattle train.  Two people in wheelchairs had to travel between carriages, from Dublin to Cork, in disgraceful conditions.  I have raised this issue at local level in connection with the manner in which people, particularly the handicapped, are being treated.  I received inadequate information regarding long term plans.  That is not good enough.  One wonders where the money invested in that body over the years has gone and it is sad that disabled people have been neglected.</P>
      <P>I have been a member of the Joint Services Committee for 13 years.  It takes a long time to get anything done because of red tape.  Different Departments are responsible for different things, files are lost and nothing happens. A pothole inside the gates of Leinster House cannot be filled, never mind those outside.  However, when Brian Crowley became a Senator many things happened out of necessity.  No one could pass the buck in that situation. The work needed to allow that young man to enter this Chamber was done in a matter of weeks.  This has also happened in Brussels where Brian Crowley is now a member of the European Parliament.</P>
      <P>The greatest waste of money occurs in employing consultants to consider problems.  Our disabled young people should not be left on the sideline while consultants work and able bodied people should thank God that we have the use of our limbs and can walk around and complete our daily duties. State bodies should be more alert to the needs of people with disability and the use of consultants to tackle problems should be stopped.  It is of very little use to handicapped people.  Bus Éireann, which is heavily subsidised by the taxpayer, should move swiftly to accommodate disabled people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The CIE subvention for free travel passes has been mentioned.  At present CIE buses are travelling around empty like &ldquo;Wanderly Wagons&rdquo; and will only stop at certain points.  Old age pensioners and disabled people are forced to walk two or three miles to get a bus. <Col N="921" /> This is madness and a waste of public funds.  A little common sense would make all the difference and a little Christian thought should be spared for disabled people.  I ask those responsible to move to solve this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a document from the Centre for Independent Living which includes a section entitled &ldquo;Transport: The Key to Opportunity&rdquo; and says that transport is the difference between opportunity and exclusion. This is the key for people with disability. This issue about access to transport only comes home to us when we experience it.  I was once incapacitated with damage to my leg and forced to use crutches. People forget how difficult it is to enter buildings or use transport in such a situation.</P>
      <P>We are committed to cherishing all of the children of the nation equally but when it comes to people with disability we have been remiss.  I can see why CIE cannot afford to carry out work in this area.  It is concerned with paying large severance sums and handouts.  When people leave the company they are presented with cars, etc.  It probably cannot afford to take care of people with disability if it has to take care of its executives.  Maybe the Minister knows more about this than I do.  Why did the Minister not see fit to come in?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Senators I welcome this debate.  Access to public transport is a basic fundamental human right and we have denied a significant proportion of the population a basic right for long enough.  A number of years ago, courtesy of the Irish Wheelchair Association, I spent part of a day in a wheelchair in Bray.  It was one of the most extraordinary consciousness raising experiences of my life.  I felt as a citizen confined to a wheelchair, albeit for only part of a day, that I was excluded from a series of things which I regarded as a right.  I was excluded from shops, from getting onto pavements in part of the town, from toilet facilities, a basic requirement if one is out on the town, and from public transport.  This illustrated an extraordinary and an unacceptable oversight by planning, public and statutory authorities across the board.  It is not an issue of partisan <Col N="923" /> politics.  People are sympathetic to the appeals being made here.</P>
      <P>Public transport companies are seriously underwritten by the taxpayers, including those who are physically challenged. We are denying those taxpayers the right to participate in publicly, State owned transport.  The situation on DART is unacceptable especially as it was built in the last decade and a half. The issue of access should and could, without any great cost, have been factored in.  In fleet replacement of buses the issue of public access could and should be factored in.  A point about access on the mainline rail was made.  Sweden, for example, is including in its fleet replacement, trains accessible to wheelchairs and removable tables which allow a wheelchair to be parked to allow people to fully avail of publicly subsidised public transport.</P>
      <P>The Centre for Independent Living has made a valid point of which we should be conscious.  We should regret that we have not been conscious of it until now.  The economic cost penalties, which are heaped on people who already suffer a physical disability and are confined to a wheelchair, represent positive discrimination against people who already face a challenge.  This debate is timely and we, as legislators, should take steps to ensure that this reprehensible discrimination ends.</P>
      <P>As a result of my experience with the Irish Wheelchair Association I asked the planning, urban and county authorities in County Wicklow to write into new development plans an access code which would become a code for all public and major buildings.  For example, in every housing estate being built there should be dished footpaths not only as a facility for those who are physically challenged, but for women and men who push prams and people with burdens. It is a simple matter of thinking through the issue of access.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we take steps in the next year or two in our local authorities &mdash; most of us are members of county councils and are representative of councils around <Col N="924" /> the country &mdash; we could force an access code through.  It is extraordinary that &ldquo;planners&rdquo; at local government level have overlooked this basic right.  This debate focuses our attention on an issue which should be to the forefront of our minds.</P>
    <P>I am honoured to be the Central Remedial Council's nominee in Seanad Éireann.  We represent a wide spectrum of the public and we should from time to time, as in this debate, focus on minorities, those who are excluded and who are unfairly discriminated against and end all types of discrimination.  Discrimination against those who are physically challenged is odious and unacceptable in a civilised society.  I compliment the centre and those who spent 55 long hours outside the gates of the House.  I assure them that as far as I am concerned their struggle and efforts have not been in vain.  I am sure that is true of every Senator.</P>

    <Title>Local Government (Delimitation of Water Supply Disconnection Powers) Bill, 1995: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The requirement for the local authorities to obtain an order from the court before disconnecting a water supply will provide the consumer with the highest level of independent protection possible, that of the courts.  Measures have been taken to ensure that the Bill will not clog up the courts, which was suggested may happen.  Provisions relating to evidence and the burden of proof have been included, which will minimise the possibility of delays and prevent protracted court proceedings.  In addition, measures have been taken to simplify the evidence to be produced by local authorities in court proceedings. Furthermore, the Minister for Justice recently announced that she has obtained approval to prepare a Bill which is aimed at reforming the courts and the judicial system.  An important element in the new initiatives proposed is an increase in the number of District Court judges available to deal with the workload of the District Court.  The Government is committed to ensuring that the resources available to the District Court will more than adequately cater for the demands of the new legislation.</P>
      <P>Senator Daly suggested that it is inappropriate for the courts to consider the question of disconnection.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The courts are perceived by the public as independent.  This is most important.  It is a procedure that will ensure openness and transparency on a sensitive issue.</P>
      <P>Senator McGowan suggested that the Bill would result in a decrease in the income local authorities can generate from service charges.  As this suggestion has been repeated over the past number of months, my Department undertook a spot check on local authorities and the returns to local authorities over the past number of months.  The opposite has been happening.  The returns on the payments made to many local authorities for the first number of months of this year are up substantially on the returns of last year.  This argument cannot, therefore, be sustained.</P>
      <P>I fully appreciate the importance of service charges for local authority revenue. Steps have been taken to ensure that collection rates will not suffer from the introduction of the Bill.  It must be remembered that the power of disconnection has not been removed from local authorities.  Indeed, it will now be backed up with an order of the courts. In addition, the Finance Act, 1995, provided for a new income tax allowance in respect of service charges paid on time. It is a significant incentive.  Furthermore, the Bill provides that where a supply is disconnected the consumer will, unless there are special reasons to warrant otherwise, also be liable for the costs and expenses incurred by the local authority in its application for a water discontinuance order.  The consumer will also be liable for the disconnection and subsequent reconnection costs.  This is further disincentive for people to refuse to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am confident that the Bill will not result in a fall off in the local authority collection levels.  The evidence suggests that the opposite is happening.  A once off survey of local authorities with regard to collection rates for the first quarter of 1995 reveals that in more <Col N="927" /> than 50 per cent of cases, collection rates were higher than in the same period in 1994.  By giving statutory backing to the new procedures, people will be in no doubt as to the possible outcome of the refusal to pay their charges.  The Bill will encourage, rather than discourage, payment of charges.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan suggested that there was no need for a study of local government finance.  Is he happy with the present situation?  If he is not, something has to be done.  The Government is following the proper course.  It is fully committed to addressing the issue of local authority funding which has not been adequately addressed by successive administrations since the rates were abolished in 1977.  It is not possible to have real and meaningful local Government unless a proper funding base is established.  It is my aim that any decisions necessary, some of which may be difficult, will be brought to Government in the short term.</P>
    <P>I am certain that all Senators agree it is time for the finances of local authorities to be sorted out once and for all. Everybody will have an opportunity to give their views when the study is completed. It will be concerned with addressing local authority funding in a realistic way.  In tackling this issue now and over the coming months, we can bring about an effective and meaningful local government system.  The time-frame <Col N="928" /> is tight but I am anxious that progress is made, the right decisions taken and the broadest consensus achieved. The study will deal with the real problems of local authority funding and it will not avoid any issues whatsoever.</P>
    <P>One of the problems of the present discontinuation policy is that it differs from area to area.  In this respect Senator Honan said that County Laois has a unique process for recovering water charges.  The Bill provides that a minimum standard of care is now being afforded to water consumers in all local authority areas.</P>
    <P>In a graphic contribution, Senator Cregan outlined the manner in which our cities and urban areas have been run down in recent times.  It is a commentary on what has been happening in local authorities because of the absence of policy.  I understand that amendments have been submitted, but I find this difficult to understand because when the Bill went through the Dáil the Opposition failed to table any amendments.  I compliment all the Senators who contributed to the debate and I hope the Bill will now be passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 43 and 44, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) Where the Court is satisfied that a consumer has made a reasonable effort to pay the charges for domestic water supply the Court shall waive the costs and expenses incurred by a sanitary authority in making a disconnection.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If a consumer's water supply has been disconnected high costs and expenses could be involved in reconnecting the supply.  The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the court, which would adjudicate on whether the supply should be disconnected, has the jurisdiction to waive the cost of disconnection and reconnection if it is satisfied that the consumer is making a reasonable effort to pay the charges.</P>
      <P>The amendment would provide for situations where a consumer was in a position to give an undertaking to the court in relation to the payment of outstanding amounts.  If a disconnection had already been made or permission for it had been granted by a court, the amendment would allow some consideration to be given to the consumer's undertaking and he or she would not be faced with huge bills.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment as the entire ethos, thrust and purpose of the Bill is ridiculous.  The Bill creates litigation and circumstances where people, who should never find themselves in the courts, will be encouraged to go to them.  The Bill does not have the heartfelt support of the two major partners in Government or the most sensible public representatives.  The amendment is logical if a Bill is to be passed which encourages people to go to court &mdash; people who should never find themselves in court.</P>
      <P>The courts will probably ultimately take the view expressed in Senator Daly's amendment on this issue. However, it is better to remove the ifs and buts at this point.  The legislation is fundamentally flawed but we should proceed along the lines proposed by Senator Daly and at least include some semblance of rationale in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support the amendment and I agree with Senator Roche that it is crazy legislation.  If the Government was not prepared to go the whole hog and abolish water charges, it should not have bothered to introduce this Bill.</P>
      <P>In the Dublin local authority of which I am a member, the Bill has created confusion. For the first time since 1984, service charges were introduced in Fingal County Council by the Labour Party chairperson, which, to be fair, the manager tried to collect.  The authority was controlled by Fianna Fáil from 1985 to 1991 and charges were not introduced. This had an effect on the finances of the authority but the Labour chairperson took a difficult decision and introduced water charges, which the manager went about collecting.</P>
      <P>However, as a result of the change of Government in November 1994, it appeared the charges would be abolished. The net effect was that a collection rate of something in excess of £1.8 million was achieved.  That has diminished considerably since <i>A Government of Renewal</i> was published, because the public still do not understand what this legislation is about.  When the new Government was being formed they thought these service charges were to be abolished; it appeared that was the price of Democratic Left's participation in Government.  Of course, that has not happened.  The net effect is that my constituents face ending up in court.  It was bad enough to suffer possible disconnection but, as Senator Roche said, they will now find themselves in court.  Constituents have come to me and said they have not paid the charges this year because they believed they had been abolished.  I told them that was not so. Service charges which were introduced by the governing group on Fingal County Council are legal and are collectable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a further confusion &mdash; and we have asked for clarification from the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin &mdash; about the practicalities of going to court for permission to disconnect <Col N="932" /> the supply of water.  Our local authority charges £85 per annum.  I do not know of any court in the land where proceedings can be taken for less than £85.  The cost of going to court, even if one were to take bulk or group action, will be high.  The memorandum the Minister sent to the local authorities about this legislation was not clear &mdash; and it is still not clear to me &mdash; on who is liable for costs.  It is at the discretion of the judge whether he will allow costs to the local authority and, if he does, the resident or householder will face legal costs.  If the Minister reads the memorandum by the Minster for the Environment, he will see that it is not clear and that this is at the discretion of the judge.  We have asked for clarification, but so far it has not been forthcoming from the Minister, Deputy Howlin.</P>
    <P>Because of political processes and formations of Governments, people feel they have been conned and they are withholding payment of charges, particularly in Dublin.  There is a serious campaign to support people who are withholding payment.  They are holding collections and they say they will go to court on the issue.  The whole issue is a nonsense.  It would have been better for the Minister either to have supported his colleagues &mdash; there is a Fine Gael-Labour alliance running Fingal County Council &mdash; in their action and say it was a difficult action to take but the local authority needed additional finance and it was not available, or the Government does not support the concept of service charges and is therefore abolishing them.  Neither position was taken and we are left with legislation which is probably unconstitutional in a number of places, and I imagine that was referred to on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>To further fudge the issue, we heard a declaration that the system of funding of local government is to be reviewed. Both the Minister and I know that the previous Government had a similar&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>It specifically referred to financing of local authorities but it was shelved.  There is a simple solution and this has been said to me by my local authority.  If local authorities demand autonomy, there is the possibility that they will be told to raise their own finance.  If Government is to fully support local authorities to the extent that it did before the abolition of domestic rates, that will mean more money must come from central Government. That is the answer.  Any firm of consultants can mess around with it.  It simply means the Government has a choice: it can tell the local authorities to raise their own finance by way of charges for bin collection, recyclable waste collection and other collections or say that because our system of local government is so absolutely centralised, it is not given to subsidiarity.  Was &ldquo;subsidiarity&rdquo; the buzzword in the Barrington report? I think it was subsidiarity.  We talked about it but did nothing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the Government is not.  Fingal County Council was one of the results of that subsidiarity.  What we have is exactly what went before &mdash; three miniature Dublin county councils with no increased functions and they are not the kind of local authority Dr. Barrington was talking about.  If this Government goes the direction of requiring local authorities to bring people to court, then they are going to have to do something about costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A former colleague &mdash; a Minister for whom I have the highest respect &mdash; Deputy Owen, is trying to grapple with real crime and lawlessness and our huge drug problem.  I do not want my constituents locked in gaol.  They say that if they go the route of the courts, they will <Col N="934" /> go to gaol.  This is nonsense and stores up unbelievable problems for the Government in the future but, more importantly, for those who are members of local authorities, it is going to be hell.</P>
    <P>I advise, even at this late stage, that the Minister withdraw the legislation until he gets his fiscal rectitude report. This Bill is nonsense and is only placating the baby member of Government, but the public have not been conned by the Democratic Left on this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand how Fine Gael can support this legislation.  I support the amendment.  It defies logic that, within 24 hours, we have heard one Minister say it was to be welcomed that we devolve powers to the local authorities and let them issue casual trading licences &mdash; a Minister from the Democratic Left Party told the House yesterday evening how wonderful it was that local authorities could now make marvellous decisions and central Government was not getting involved &mdash; and now we hear a totally contrary position from the same Government &mdash; now the local authority must not make the decisions.</P>
      <P>The local authorities have made sensible decisions on these matters over the years.  They know the circumstances. They know the people who are willing to pay but are unable to; they know who is able to pay but is unwilling to do so, and they make that distinction.  I know of a case where somebody had their water disconnected because they were unable to pay but when some payment was made, the water was reconnected without a fee.</P>

      <P>This was a field supply; it was not even to a home.  The person has no running water in their home.  There has to be flexibility.  The people who know best what is happening are the local officials and they are well in a position to make decisions.  It will now cost more to collect the money than it will bring in.  That, in any man's economic language, does not make sense.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking section 4 (2) as it is, because it is in effect addressed by the amendment, the point is that, at the moment, local authorities have discretion and the Minister and his Fine Gael and Labour Party colleagues in local government with us have all bitten the bullet and have introduced service charges.  We all accept that there is no tooth fairy at the bottom of the garden who will service local government.  At present, as the local service charges are constituted, there is flexibility.  The local authorities can &mdash; and do &mdash; operate waiver systems and do so with a good deal of discretion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a case in my area where a husband in the house takes a &ldquo;principled&rdquo; stand on service charges.  He has done so to the point where the local authority turned off his water supply. He went out and turned it back on and then the local authority came along and turned it off.  He turned it back on and then they turned it off and put pitch over the stopcock.  The man melted the pitch with a blowtorch and turned the water back on.  The local authority then dug up the footpath, causing several hundreds of pounds worth of damage, disconnected the ferrule, sent a plumber in for the day, cemented the whole thing up and put somebody sitting there to make sure the cement dried.  His unfortunate wife came to me and to other public representatives, including one from the Minister's party, and told us that she and her husband were entitled to a waiver anyway.  The waiver was granted and the whole process had to be reversed.  The local authority could take the view that this unfortunate woman had a series of problems heaped on her <Col N="936" /> head, not least a husband who was involved in principled decisions.  I remember her saying that she left the solving of world problems to her husband and she ran the household.</P>
    <P>Under section 4 (2), the judge cannot take the simple flexible decision that a local authority can take in those circumstances. I put it to the Minister &mdash; who is a man of eminent good sense with much experience at local government level &mdash; that the judge will not have the ability under section 4 (2) that a local authority has, with all its understanding of the frailty of human nature and the problems of cranky husbands.  That is very bad law.  We will create a situation where some character, like my constituent, hung up on principle and Guinness, talks himself into a <i>cul-de-sac</i> and cannot reverse out of it and we will then find ourselves in court and there will be no way in which common sense can intervene.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly's amendment is an imperfect amendment to a bad piece of law.  It would be simpler and better law to open a hole in this wall.  We are creating problems for ourselves at local government level and for our constituents with this legislation.  I am not speaking from a high moral ground because our party scored political points on service charges&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The French Minister for Finance at the time of the French Revolution said that that which Government gives, Government must first take away in greater measure.  The reality is that this is fundamentally stupid legislation which will raise the cost of collecting service charges.  I do not know if the Minister has done any calculations but I suggest that this will add very considerably <Col N="937" /> to the administrative overheads. We all know that because of politics people were discouraged from paying service charges but they have been educated to pay them.</P>
      <P>I am not claiming any righteous mantle &mdash; I will leave that to other parties, particularly Democratic Left who seem to be on every side of every fence &mdash; I am simply saying that we are storing up problems for ourselves.  The amendment may be imperfect and not as the Department would wish but the Minister should look at the logic in it.  I do not believe this would be the choice of the Fine Gael or Labour Parties if it was left to a straw poll of the Members of this or the other House.  There are flaws in this law, of which the inflexibility in section 4 (2) is a major one. Although the next amendment may be tongue in cheek, this one is not intended to score a point.  The Minister can see the logic of what is intended.</P>

      <P>At least Senator Roche made an open confession here this afternoon and I compliment him.</P>
      <P>It is very important for families to have proper water supplies and people should be given every opportunity to make their case before their water supply is disconnected.  I have seen cases where water supplies have been disconnected from homes with young babies, some of whom were ill.  On occasions I felt it was grossly unfair and made strong representations to local authorities to prevent the disconnection of the water supplies to those homes, but to no avail.  Those decisions were taken at local authority level.</P>
      <P>In a number of instances the families concerned were unable to pay the water rates and had applied for waivers which were refused.  Local government officials make arbitrary decisions to disconnect water supplies.

I have great faith in our courts and the vast majority of judges are fair.  If somebody makes a case in court &mdash; unlike Senator Dardis, I do not think this is funny.</P>

      <P>Somebody should have the right to make a decision.  A court is much fairer where the case is argued in public, the local authority has to fight its corner and it is up to the judge to make a decision.  I do not think costs will be awarded if that will cause hardship.  I think the judges will go a long way towards meeting Senator Daly's concern.</P>
      <P>What we are doing here is a political circus.  It is not Democratic Left who are to blame but the Opposition.  Fianna Fáil decided to do away with car tax; suddenly they brought it back and now a person's car is taken away for not paying their car tax.  We have gone full circle.</P>

      <P>As I said earlier, I have great difficulty with this Bill.  It is, as Senator Enright said, a political circus.  I do not know whether judges can do <Col N="940" /> what Senator Daly is proposing because I understood that the local authority has the power to recover charges in making a disconnection under the 1962 Sanitary Services Act.  Will we have to change that Act to allow them to do this? Senator Enright talked about Fianna Fáil abolishing rates in 1977 and Senator Cregan said that Fine Gael would do likewise by reducing them by 25 per cent per annum.  I thought he intended to make the same point as Senator Enright but, in case somebody was getting credit for abolishing rates, he wanted Fine Gael to get some.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not disputing that but it is extraordinary that Senator Enright takes a different view as he and I are from the same area.  Last year Offaly County Council cut off the supply of two people and Laois County Council cut off one person's supply, none of whom was ill or women with young children.  In the two cases in Offaly, after several attempts were made to seek payment from the people involved, officials went to talk to them. In one case the door was slammed in their faces; in the other the person was abusive.  In Laois the person who was cut off had given the county council cheques which had bounced or which he had stopped.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand how Senator Enright believes that going to a local authority, perhaps accompanied by their local councillors, to explain their circumstances to officials in privacy can be worse for people than going to court. Most people find it difficult to go to court because the legal system is alien to them.  It is not alien to Senator Enright because he is used to court in his work as a solicitor.  Some judges make odd decisions and it would be easier for people to go to their county councils, on their own or with their public representatives, to work out arrangements with officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="941" /> Arrangements can be devised whereby people can pay £2 or £3 a week, even in the case of people who have defaulted on arrangements they made in the past.  County councils are willing to do this.  It is an insult to officials in county councils and to county managers to say that judges can handle the situation better than they have handled it.  I compliment local authority officials and representatives who try to sort out genuine cases.  Dragging the matter into court is a disgrace.</P>
    <P>The Government should put proposals for a proper system of financing for local government before the House; Members on all sides want this.  My party will support the Minister if he does this because we recognise the great difficulty with regard to financing local authorities.  The public also recognises this problem; people are not fools and they know that if they want something done in their area it must be paid for.  There is no point in listening to people who have principles on this matter because the only principle they seem to have is they want everybody else to pay for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Daly asked earlier about the Dublin water supply study but I did not have the information at the time.  The contract was awarded in January to a French company, which is being assisted by a Cork company, MC O'Sullivan and Company Limited.  The study will cost £0.5 million and will look at the water supply and future demands for the greater Dublin area.  The report is expected to be completed by the end of 1996.</P>
      <P>There were 910 disconnections carried out by county councils and county borough corporations last year.  Many authorities did not carry out any but as many as 265 were carried out by others. Senator Dardis's area is an example of the latter.  Donegal County Council was also active in disconnecting supplies. This poses the question of the uniformity of approach of authorities and must be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not accept amendments Nos. 1 and 2.  Senator Daly indicated his concern <Col N="942" /> about the use of the courts to adjudicate on disconnection cases. However, the impact of amendment No. 2 would be to require the courts to become involved in the issue of reconnection, apart altogether from the issue of disconnection, and both would have to be considered separately.  A court will only grant a water discontinuance order under section 3, when they are satisfied that the default was not due to hardship.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable to conclude, therefore, that where a water discontinuance order has been granted by a court, the consumer had the resources to pay his charges.  It is also reasonable to conclude that the person should be responsible for paying the disconnection and reconnection costs, which should not have to be paid by the local authority and compliant water consumers.</P>
    <P>Senator Roche said that Bill encourages the public to be even more litigation conscious than they are now. However, he is supporting an amendment which proposes further court action in the case of reconnections.  He cannot have it both ways.</P>
    <P>Senator McGennis said it is not clear from the Bill who will pay the costs.  If a member of the public loses a case and the court awards costs in favour of the local authority, it is clear that this person will pay the costs.  This will be a major disincentive to people who know they can afford to pay charges and that the court will find against them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Countrywide there is a greater response to payment of service charges this year compared to the same period last year.  Senator Roche and Senator Honan asked about reconnecting. Local authorities, having disconnected the supply, can, without recourse to the courts, reconnect it at any time.  A judge is not needed to bring about a reconnection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not question the Minister's bona fides because we are old friends but he is mishearing or misinterpreting what I said.  Section 4 (2) states: &ldquo;Where a supply of water is disconnected pursuant to a water discontinuance order, the cost of reconnection shall be payable by the consumer and such cost shall include the cost of discontinuance.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I agree that people should pay for the cost of their folly but that is not the point I am making.  The minority party in Government is trying to create an illusion in people's minds and this is what the Bill is about.  I refer to Senator Enright's specious contribution.  Regurgitation of partial and grotesquely inaccurate views of history is not a useful contribution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Waivers of up to 100 per cent of the amount of charges are allowed.  In most local authorities there is a threshold below which waivers are not granted.  Wicklow has one of the highest levels of service charges and the waiver does not go below £25.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When people are hung up on some principle or silly intransigence, the flexibility which exists in local authorities is not present in the courts.  It is extraordinary that Senator Enright, with his years of experience as a public representative, <Col N="944" /> suggests that courts are more in touch with the people than local authority members and staff.  When Senator Enright has the opportunity to reconsider what he said, he will realise not only that it was nonsense but it was far removed from reality.  For all the flaws and warts in local government, there is a great amount of common sense there. There is also a considerable amount of common sense in all parties.</P>
    <P>I again ask the Minister to consider the use of &ldquo;shall&rdquo; as opposed to the usual use of &ldquo;may&rdquo;. &ldquo;Shall&rdquo; seems to prevent any latitude for judges. These amendments may not be the most perfectly worded, but the inclusion of &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, as opposed to &ldquo;may&rdquo;, which allows the court to make the order, seems to be the problem in this regard.</P>
    <P>I have no problem with any member of the public paying the full cost of his folly.  A public representative worth his salt should not try to argue that we should mollycoddle defaulters in all circumstances. However, I am worried that a judge could say that the inclusion of &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in section 4 (2) means that he may have no latitude.  The section would be worded better if this latitude was built into it, but the use of &ldquo;shall&rdquo; removes the latitude which Senator Enright suggested might exist within the Judiciary.  Maybe the Minister would be able to put my mind to rest on that matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a member of a local authority that has had many problems in regard to water service charges.  I agree with the other speakers that people in local authorities who handle the waiver forms have some common sense.  However, I do not understand the argument made as regards &ldquo;may&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill makes a person feel he should not pay water charges.  A local authority knows if a person cannot pay them.  This stand is being taken on principle. In Cork, some people went to prison for this principle.  They felt this service charge was a second tax.  This did <Col N="945" /> not happen anywhere else.  There is now tax relief on water charges and I have always said this should have been granted.  Full tax relief should be given on any moneys paid to local authorities. When a person pays their commercial rates to a local authority, he is entitled to any tax benefits and reliefs that may accrue from it.</P>
    <P>Senator Roche wants to change &ldquo;shall&rdquo; to &ldquo;may&rdquo; in section 4.  However, is it not true that this and other sections deal with a person who is in court because of a principle rather than a payment? It is not the case that they cannot, but rather will not, pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>Do we all agree the waiver system is fair?  I have dealt with it at local authority level and people accept that they will have to pay 25 per cent if they earn £120 a week, 20 per cent if they earn £110 a week and nothing if they get £100 a week.  The elderly do not pay water charges unless they have a second pension.</P>
      <P>Some local authorities are disconnecting water supplies more than others. We did not disconnect any service in Cork city.  The Minister has the major responsibility to ensure that nobody is without water at any time unless the court says so.  If people refuse to pay the water charges on principle, why should we defend them?  Senator Roche said these people should pay for their folly but he also says that &ldquo;shall&rdquo; should be changed to &ldquo;may&rdquo; in section 4 so the judge can be given some latitude.  The judge already has the right to decide if he feels the person has a case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing with a matter of principle, with people who want everybody except themselves to pay.  This Bill is relevant to those who do not want to pay charges on principle.  I do not for a moment deny that they may have a case. I do not want to pay water charges but I have to pay them.  The vast majority of our people pay their water charges. Some 92 per cent of people in Cork city <Col N="946" /> paid them last year.  We still have problems with some members of the public who are well able to pay these charges &mdash; many of them work in Government, State and semi-State bodies &mdash; but will not do so because they consider it a second form of taxation.  They may be right but we, as legislators, will not sanction another form of collection.  We must ensure there is no rapid deterioration of the infrastructure in our cities and towns.  Another previous Senator said it is about time local government was restructured.  Of course it should be restructured and the Minister has the responsibility to do it.</P>
    <P>Senator McGennis said the previous Government was involved in restructuring local government.  I was not aware of that.  The commission report said there should be restructuring, but the Government did not implement it.  However, this Government favours restructuring and a special committee has been set up to do that.</P>
    <P>Do we really think that the wording in section 4 should be changed from &ldquo;shall&rdquo; to &ldquo;may&rdquo; to satisfy people who do not want to pay these charges?</P>

      <P>As the Minister said in his Second Stage speech this is an emotive issue.  If a public meeting was called on service charges in any county tonight, there would be a packed hall.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Enright.  Politicians of all parties are responsible for this mess.  All of us knocked on doors during local elections, particularly in 1985, which was my first election, with our manifestos telling people we would abolish service charges.  Indeed, some political parties did it.  We did it in the old Dublin County Council and Dublin Corporation is still doing it.  It depends on the type of resources available.  All political parties in all local authorities had to bite the bullet and vote for these charges.  I have never voted for service charges to date, although I may have to do so in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I told the Minister this legislation is provocative.  Senator Cregan mentioned Cork but I am familiar with Dublin. <Col N="947" /> There have not been service charges in Dublin city or county since 1985.  Their introduction is new in Dublin and we had to get the public to accept them.  I did not vote for them and I am not making any case for them but the local authority managers are gingerly trying to convince people to pay them.  I do not think Fingal County Council has disconnected any water supply yet but it tried to re-educate people that this was an additional charge.  It produced good literature telling them the services the local authority provided on their behalf and that it was looking for an additional financial contribution.</P>

      <P>The Minister is not calling into question the manner in which it was done.  It does have to be uniform to work.  The Minister has now added fuel to a huge campaign in the Dublin area.  I presume this is also happening in Cork.  There is a militant wing of the Labour Party, an offshoot of the Democratic Left or a group which did not join Democratic Left, in the Dublin local authority which is mounting campaigns of civil disobedience and telling people not to pay.  It is collecting a fighting fund and it has told people that it does not matter what they do because it will go to court with them.  As Senator Roche said, these people will turn the water on again or they will sit on the <Col N="948" /> stop cocks and not allow the local authority to turn them off.  It does not matter if the Minister tells them they will be liable for costs.  This legislation has done more to cause civil disobedience and anarchy than service charges would ever have done.</P>

    <P>This amendment is not designed to deal with those who have a principled objection to paying water charges.  The law will deal with such people.  This amendment is designed to deal with the person who is trying to cope with payments, but who is finding it difficult to do so.  Section 4 (2) means that a judge will be constrained in that he will not be able to tell a local authority to reconnect the person's water supply.  He will not have any choice in the matter because he will be bound by this subsection to make the person pay the disconnection and reconnection charges, which could be £400 or £500.  Last week I saw a bill for £600 for water reconnection charges.  I do not know what reconnection charges are, but this is a sizeable extra burden on a person who is making <Col N="949" /> a reasonable effort to pay.  However, section 4 (2) means that a judge will not be able to deal with this situation.</P>

      <P>They will be taken to court if there are arrears and this is a fairly long procedure.  If someone goes to court because of their circumstances, the judge must make a disconnection order.

      <P>The Minister said there was a contradiction in what I said about the court not being the place to deal with such issues.  I still believe it is not the place, but we must deal with the contents of this Bill.  I did not draft this Bill. If I had, I would not have the courts involved with home assistance officers, social welfare officers, deciding officers and investigating officers.  The Minister is turning the court into a social welfare office.  We are trying to improve this legislation.  I am sure the Minister will get advice between this and Report Stage that there is a case to be made for people with genuine grievances.  The court has no choice but to issue an order to disconnect supply to these people, which will place a further burden on them.  This Bill is not designed to deal with the principled objection to paying water charges.  We are not being mischievous about this issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we dispose of the debate on what is reasonable and unreasonable?  The county council could decide that a person had not made a reasonable effort to pay.  However, what it thinks is irrelevant; it is what the court decides which is relevant and the court could decide that what the council thought to be unreasonable was reasonable. <Col N="950" /> The amendment applies in those circumstances.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to how well Kildare features in the disconnection league table.  The reason is an organised, orchestrated campaign to stop people paying their water rates.  At successive meetings of Kildare County Council, Democratic Left and the Labour Party voted down service charges when other parties voted them through.</P>
      <P>When this Bill is enacted there will be fewer disconnections because county councils will not want the expense and effort of going to court.  We will then be told that this legislation works because there are fewer disconnections.  Democratic Left will tell us the legislation is wonderful and has achieved its objective.</P>
      <P>I look forward to future legislation. We will have legislation for Telecom Éireann, ESB and Bord Gáis Éireann. By the end of the year we could introduce consolidated legislation which will put it all together.</P>

      <P>Senator Cregan left a question hanging in the air to which the answer is yes.  It may have been lost in some of the obscure arguments.</P>
      <P>The Minister argued that the situation we foresaw where someone could find themselves in court would not happen. Although the Minister is a humane person who wishes this would not happen, a person could easily find themselves in such a situation.  I will give the Minister a specific example of a case which I dealt with recently and which I passed on to the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This case concerned an unfortunate woman who was going through the process of separation and who did not pay her television licence fee.  When the summons was sent to her, she tore it up in fright because she could not handle the situation.  She also ignored a summons to court and when the court action came up, she could not attend.  She was then ordered to pay a fine of £500. However, she could not pay that amount of money, so she ignored it.  A <Col N="951" /> garda then served her with a notice &mdash; she was looking after five children &mdash; to go to prison.  The garda, reflecting the humanity which the gardaí show on these occasions, suggested that she should get in touch with one of her local representatives.  She then approached me.  The Minister for Justice, to her credit, saw the humanity of the case and was able to allow flexibility.  This happened before political correctness damned ministerial intervention in this area.  I can foresee cases where people, who should not be in court, will find themselves in court for whatever reason &mdash; perhaps, because of an intransigent partner or fear of facing reality.  The use of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; will bind the courts.</P>
    <P>I am not looking for a charter to let dodgers through.  I have taken the lash about service charges and I make no apologies to anybody.  There cannot be any kind of State-run service without somebody paying the bill.  While service charges are not the best way to go about it, I cannot propose a better alternative so I had better keep my mouth shut about it.</P>
    <P>The reality in political terms is that we have people who will continue to beat the drum.  The Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, was one of them in Kildare.  He was banging the drum and arguing against service charges while Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, the ultimate irony of political life.</P>
    <P>I simply suggest that the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is excessively inflexible, which we will regret in due course.  Nobody wants to create a taxdodgers' charter.  What Democratic Left will do we do not know because, as usual, they will hide their wisdom under a stone until some time in the future when it becomes politically wise to unveil it.  I will not push the argument any further than that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is 98 per cent in Tipperary. If I had a small industry and my water charges were about £2,000, would I not be a terrible fool to pay it because it would be two years before it would come to court?  The Bill encourages people not to pay service charges.  As a result, cash flow will dry up and maintenance services across the country will be in chaos.</P>
      <P>I want to correct a point made by Senator Enright.  I was surprised he made it as he has a legal mind.  He said Fianna Fáil did away with rates.  That is not true.  The courts &mdash; the second tier of Government with which we seem to have to deal in recent years &mdash; did away with rates on agricultural land.  It was unfair of the Senator not to complete his sentence and say that it was the Supreme Court&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If the Senator wants a copy of his party's manifesto, he can call to my office and I will give him one. If he wants to do a little soul-searching, the sins are there.</P>
      <P>It was the courts that removed the base for agricultural rates on land which constituted an income for local authorities.</P>

      <P>It seems that the Minister does not see the danger in this Bill.  It will open a floodgate.  We will have no <Col N="953" /> cash flow.

      <P>Some of it may even coincide with what the historical truth will turn out to have been.  I am grateful for that.</P>
      <P>I have the luxury of being able to be opposed to charges for domestic water supply in principle but I am not a member of a local authority.  If I were, I might not be able to think of a better alternative, like many Members.</P>
      <P>I seek enlightenment because I am sympathetic to the principle behind the amendment.  I am genuinely confused, perhaps partly because of my own obtuseness, and partly because of different emphases in the debate.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 1 states, &ldquo;Where the Court is satisfied that a consumer has made a reasonable effort to pay the charges...&rdquo; and the Minister gave the impression &mdash; and this will determine how I vote &mdash; that where a court was so satisfied, it would not authorise the discontinuation in the first place.  Is that a correct interpretation?  If it is, what is the purpose of the amendment?  Is it because there can be different subjective interpretations of what constitutes a reasonable effort?  Even if that were the case and the court assumed there had been a reasonable effort, presumably it would not allow the imposition of the charge.  Even if there are differences between judges, at least in any particular court there would be consistency in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Am I correct that a disconnection would not have been imposed in the first place if the court was so satisfied? If that is the case, what is the purpose <Col N="954" /> of the amendment?  If it is not the case, I would be in favour of the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Lee has got to the nucleus of the problem.  The individual would not be in court at all unless the local authority felt the person was capable of paying the charge.  Unless the court is satisfied that the person is being unreasonable, can pay and will not pay, the court will obviously not make a decision to disconnect.  The court will only make a decision to disconnect where it is satisfied that the person has the ability to pay and will not pay. Therefore, the subsequent costs of disconnection will not be passed on unless the person's supply is being disconnected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see a problem arising.  If the court decides that a person cannot pay, it will not give an order to disconnect.  If it decides that the person has the ability but that for some other reason &mdash; political or whatever &mdash; is refusing to pay, the court will decide to issue an order to disconnect and the subsequent cost will be passed on to the <Col N="955" /> person.  As I said earlier, that is the greatest disincentive of all to somebody flouting the law.</P>

      <P>The Minister said there was no uniformity about disconnection. My understanding is that there is no uniformity about the ability to pay. Fingal County Council has a generous waiver scheme.  Perhaps that is not as generous as the one which operates in Kildare where people are not cutting off supply to consumers.  How does a judge decide someone has the ability to pay but is not paying because there are hardship causes etc.?</P>

If it goes that step further into the courts, the Judiciary will have the common sense and good judgment to spot a valid case.  The greatest incentive to pay is the cost imposed on the person found not to have a genuine case.</P>

      <P>Under Article 16 of the Constitution a revision of constituencies must be carried out at least once every 12 years. However, it also provides that the ratio between the number of Members to be elected at any time for each constituency must, as far as practicable, be the same throughout the country.  The practice now is that the constituencies are revised whenever a census of population shows significant change in the total population or in its distribution.  Over the past 35 years a revision has taken place after each census.</P>
      <P>The census taken in 1991 showed a decrease of almost 15,000 in the population since the previous census in 1986. While the overall change was not significant the degree of change in some areas since 1986 was quite substantial.  In some constituencies the number of persons represented by each Dáil Member was considerably above the national average while in others it was well below it.  In the Dublin area, for example, the average number of persons per Member in Dublin North was 23,718 while in Dublin South-Central the average was 20,056.  In other parts of the country the situation was also far from satisfactory in areas such as Tipperary, Galway and Mayo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="957" /> Following the now established practice, an independent commission was set up by the previous Government last November to advise on the formation of constituencies.  The terms of reference given to the commission were, essentially, the same as those given to previous commissions.  The commission is purely an advisory body; the Constitution places the responsibility of revising constituencies on the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Richard Johnson, a Judge of the High Court, was appointed chairperson of the commission on the nomination of the Chief Justice.  The other members of the commission were Mr. Kevin Murphy, the Ombudsman; Mr. Brendan O'Donoghue, Secretary of the Department of the Environment; Mr. Kieran Coughlan, Clerk of the Dáil and Ms Deirdre Lane, Clerk of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The commission was independent in carrying out the task given to it, constrained only by the Constitution and the terms of reference.  I am glad of this opportunity to thank the members of the commission for the conscientious and even-handed way in which they did their job.  The commission reported at the end of April, the report was accepted in full by the Government and published.  Copies were given to each Member of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to fix the total number of Members of Dáil Éireann and to revise the constituencies to bring them into line with the provision of the Constitution regarding equality of representation.  The Bill proposes to implement in full the recommendations in the commission's report. An explanatory memorandum has been circulated with the Bill and maps illustrating the proposed changes in constituencies have been lodged in the Oireachtas Library.  A set of maps to a smaller scale has also been made available to each Member of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill fixes the total number of Members of the Dáil at 166, which is the same as at present and the number of constituencies will remain at 41.  The proposed new constituencies <Col N="958" /> are set out in the Schedule to the Bill. The new constituencies will come into force on the next dissolution of the Dáil. Until then, the present constituencies continue in force, for example, for the purposes of by-elections.</P>
    <P>There will be no change in the number of different sized constituencies. The scheme provides for 12 three-Member constituencies, 15 four-Member constituencies and 14 five-Member constituencies. Mayo and Tipperary will each lose a seat and Galway and Kildare will each gain a seat.  The Bill will restore the county boundaries of Mayo, Galway and Kildare as constituency boundaries.  The new constituencies will involve breaching county boundaries in Carlow, Clare, Tipperary South Riding and Waterford.  The Clare and Waterford county boundaries are already breached under the existing arrangement of constituencies.</P>
    <P>Twenty of the constituencies are identical in name, area and representation with an existing constituency. There are three new constituencies &mdash; Kildare North, Kildare South and Mayo.  The remaining 18 constituencies retain the name of an existing constituency but are subject to boundary changes to one degree or another and in two cases, Galway East and Tipperary South, to changes in seat allocation.</P>
    <P>In the Dublin area, the number of seats will remain at 47 and there will be no change in the number of Members to be returned for each of the existing 11 constituencies.  There are boundary changes in every constituency with the exceptions of Dublin North-East and Dublin South-West.  The general pattern of constituencies in Dublin will, nonetheless, remain very much as it is.</P>
    <P>In the rest of the country, the principal boundary changes stem from the adjustment in seat allocation.  County Mayo will become a single constituency with five seats.  The parts of County Galway currently in Mayo constituencies will be returned to Galway.  Galway East, which will be extended westwards, will get an additional seat and will become a four-seater.  An area of Tipperary <Col N="959" /> South will be transferred to Tipperary North.  A part of the area of County Waterford which is currently included in Tipperary South will be returned to the Waterford constituency. A part of County Carlow will be added to the Wicklow constituency but the area of east Kildare, at present in Wicklow, will be restored to County Kildare. In Cork a small area of the Cork NorthWest constituency will be transferred to Cork South-West.</P>
    <P>At this stage I would like to refer to a related development which will put future commissions on a more formal basis.  The Electoral Bill, 1994, which is currently awaiting its Second Reading in the Dáil, provides for the establishment, on a statutory basis, of an independent constituency commission to prepare proposals for the revision of Dáil and European Parliament constituencies. That Bill provides that the commission will be set up on the publication of the Census Report following each census of population, with the same membership and essentially the same terms of reference as the Dáil commission which has just reported.  The statutory commission will be required to invite and consider submissions and to report within six months of its establishment.  Implementation of its report will continue to require legislation.  The debate on the Electoral Bill, 1994 will provide an opportunity to review, on a comprehensive basis, the experience of constituency commissions over the period of almost 20 years during which they have functioned, and to consider any changes of a procedural or other kind which may be appropriate.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the Seanad would wish me to comment in detail on the scheme of constituencies proposed in the Bill.  The commission has provided us with a pretty full report, in several instances spelling out the different options which they examined in particular areas.  This is useful in helping us to understand why a particular arrangement is recommended rather than another.  Apart from what is contained <Col N="960" /> in the report, no further information is available to me in relation to the work, procedures or decision making process of the commission.</P>
    <P>As I said, the commission's role is purely advisory; under the Constitution the ultimate responsibility rests with the Oireachtas.  However, the practice of appointing an independent commission to advise on constituency revision has been universally welcomed and is now the accepted procedure.  The scheme of constituencies in the Bill is the product of an agreed process, operated in accordance with acceptable rules by a manifestly independent and impartial body.  In the Government's view, the commission's recommendations constitute a package which should be accepted in its entirety without any change.</P>
    <P>The Government is proposing in this Bill to implement the commission's recommendations in full.  I trust the Seanad will accept this view and give the measure a speedy passage.</P>

      <P>I regret I was not present for all the Minister's speech.  I was attending the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs where we had the privilege of being addressed by the Ambassador of the People's Republic of China.</P>
      <P>I support the provisions of this Bill to the extent that they give effect to the independent commission's report on the constituency revisions in the light of the 1991 census report.  I also feel obliged to support it for another reason, that I was a member of the Government under the former Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, who initiated and introduced the highly desirable principle of an independent commission to establish a fair and equitable constituency designation throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We came to that conclusion after serious consideration of what we saw as the damaging effects of the Minister of the day, whoever that Minister might be, in reaching decisions for what would be perceived to be, and sometimes <Col N="961" /> intended to be, party political advantage.</P>
    <P>The last constituency revision was undertaken exclusively by a Minister for Local Government without the benefit of an independent commission's report and ironically, had consequences which were far different from those intended.</P>
    <P>At this remove, it would be inappropriate to make any political capital or criticism of the 1975-76 constituency revision by the late Minister for Local Government, Deputy James Tully, during the 1973-77 Coalition Government. Suffice it to say that the landslide victory for Fianna Fáil in 1977 &mdash; and I was subsequently a member of the Government &mdash; could never have occurred if it had not been for the fact that the calculated designation of three-seat constituencies exclusively in Dublin and in the greater Dublin region backfired in the election results.  It proves that even when we set about pursuing political advantage we sometimes achieve the very opposite.</P>
    <P>The intention of the Bill is that an electoral system should always have as its first priority the efficient and fair functioning of parliamentary democracy.  The current system of multi-seat constituencies designated by an independent commission is fair, but experience has shown that it is far from efficient.  In many ways it actively obstructs the effective discharge of democratic parliamentary responsibility.</P>
    <P>As a young Senator I was privileged to be a member of the 1966 constitutional committee which was established by the then Taoiseach, Seán Lemass.  A casual reading of the report of that all party committee representative of Fine Gael, Labour and Fianna Fáil, discloses that even then all the Members had a distinct preference for a single seat transferable vote system of election balanced and combined, if necessary, by a list system.  The arguments produced by that committee in favour of that change are even more relevant and cogent today than in 1966.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="962" /> One of the things the committee mentioned in its conclusions was that, significantly, the system had not given rise to a proliferation of small parties and independents.  If it interfered with what they saw as the efficient and effective functioning of Government and parliamentary democracy, the view was expressed that the system should be looked at again.</P>
    <P>An electoral system should give rise to efficient representation where the energies and abilities of the representatives can be channelled into a healthy and vigorous parliamentary democracy. That is the only test of an electoral system. Our fundamental role in this Oireachtas is to act as legislators.  If we are honest we must acknowledge that that responsibility &mdash; the fundamental role of legislator &mdash; as a priority under our current system is very low indeed in the priorities of the vast majority of Members.</P>
    <P>We must acknowledge that the current multi-seat constituency requires Members to devote their time almost exclusively to internal constituency competition to accommodate their personal needs and priorities on the basis of the demands of their individual constituents, not necessarily the national needs and priorities.  The courts regularly refer to the intention of the legislation as framed and written in the laws we pass as the basis for their decisions. The intention of the Legislature as the court sees it is often more a matter of fiction than fact as far as the input of representatives to the text of the laws is concerned.  How much time do we have to devote to the basic details of the legislation, even with the new committee system?  Is it not fair to say that the parliamentary draftsman who is not directly answerable to the people can have a much greater input into our laws than elected representatives in either the Lower or Upper House?  We are elected to represent the people in Parliament and not just to respond to individual requests.</P>
    <P>An old usher in Leinster House in 1969 when I was about to enter Dáil <Col N="963" /> Éireann for the first time said: &ldquo;Remember this.  I have seen many people go out of the Dáil because they said too much but I cannot think of one who went out because he did not say enough.&rdquo; My experience vindicates his assessment.  It calls into question our system of parliamentary democracy. Incidentally he might have made the same comment in respect of the panel system of election in Seanad Éireann. The more time one devotes to scrutiny of proposed legislation, the less likely one is to be rewarded by electoral success which depends on individual attention to constituents, in this instance local authority members.  We can all use that system but can we honestly say that as a group we are serving the fundamental purpose of parliamentary democracy in the Dáil or the Seanad?</P>
    <P>There is evidence of growing public cynicism about politicians and this is an unhealthy trend when major social and economic principles demand our attention. The competition between Deputies from the same party under the multi-seat constituency system leads to a negative and wasteful expenditure of the representative's time and of public money.  Some representatives are lucky enough to be the only representative from their party in a constituency.  The minority parties have not yet, and maybe will not, experienced the real test of the PR system.</P>
    <P>If we were honest we would acknowledge that political representatives in multi-seat constituencies are obliged to devote far too much time to protecting &ldquo;my seat&rdquo;.  There is far too much chat, comment, shrewd manoeuvring and intense competition between party colleagues in the same constituency.  It is time we told the public how that undermines the exercise of parliamentary democracy in the Oireachtas.  It gives rise to unnecessary personal tensions and sometimes bitterness which does nothing to serve the cause of parliamentary democracy.  It also involves so-called tactical voting.  Canvassing is encouraged by elements who support <Col N="964" /> one member of a party over another and people are dissuaded from their voting intentions to achieve a result. They are asked to give their preference votes to someone other than the person they want to support in the interest of the party.  Is this how we want democracy to function?</P>
    <P>I have played the system as much and probably more than the majority of people in the Oireachtas for 30 years and that is why I feel compelled to refer back to the conclusions of 1966.  It is time people were told the unvarnished truth about the current multi-seat system and its damaging effect on parliamentary democracy.  I accept that the single seat transferable vote, with built in balances and protections if necessary, cannot be introduced under this legislation. However, I urge the constitutional review committee, set up by the Taoiseach and the Government, to look at this issue as a matter of urgency to ensure we will not suffer the frustration of another 30 years of wasted, ill directed energy for personal rather than national political priorities.</P>
    <P>I support this Bill for the two reasons I gave initially.  I hope I have encouraged the Minister to look, in the national interest, at a system which of the many systems in the democratic world encourages and promotes internal division and tension within parties in our parliamentary system.</P>

      <P>It would be remiss of me not to start by welcoming the Minister. I wish her well in her new portfolio. It would also be remiss of me not to note that the Dáil constituency commission was established on 2 November and was asked to report within six months.  At the end of that short period the Electoral (Amendment) Bill is before the House to give effect to the commission's recommendations.  The commission must be complimented for the way in which it set about its work and the speed with which it reported. Credit is due to Mr. Justice Richard Johnson and his team and we must also <Col N="965" /> mention the contribution of the Clerk of the Seanad, Deirdre Lane.</P>
      <P>As somebody from Galway, I am glad that for the first time in a long time all County Galway voters will vote within the boundary of the county.  There is much rejoicing in Galway because we have gained an extra seat.  I regret that seat comes at the expense of our neighbouring county of Mayo which is a large sprawling county, the representation of which will be an enormous task.  Galway has the extra seat but I am afraid the commission has not been kind to me because I have been left like John the Baptist crying in the wilderness.</P>
      <P>My electoral area is situated about one mile from the borderline of east Galway while most of my council area stays in west Galway.  We all know of major decisions over the years about crossing borders.  When Julius Caesar crossed the Rubicon, he said: &ldquo;I came, I saw, I conquered&rdquo;.  We would all like to cross the border and be able to write back to our leader and say: &ldquo;I went, I saw, I conquered&rdquo;.  I am sure a <i>modus operandi</i> will be put in place and the problems of people like me who are left in no man's land will be temporarily resolved.</P>
      <P>In general the extra seat in Galway must be welcomed.  We deserve it because of the population explosion in the county.  It is great for me to be in a position to welcome this Bill and we look forward to the next election.  In any discussion regarding electoral Bills the provision of the best facility to allow the population to vote and the most appropriate voting day could be mentioned. Voting at weekends, possibly on Sunday, might be a better idea since it might bring out more people and increase the poll.  I am involved in education and literacy and I would like to see the photograph of the candidate inserted on voting papers.  This has been promoted by literacy groups throughout the country over the years and it could be addressed in future discussions or papers which may issue on this subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this discussion on boundaries it would be no harm to mention the <Col N="966" /> Seanad voting system which is the most difficult in the world and tests the ability and endurance of any man or woman who is destined to go on that campaign. I do not know where this should be addressed but I am sure the Minister in her reply will guide me on that matter.</P>
    <P>The time has come to bring in a regionally based Seanad voting system. People are asked in all types of weather at different times of the year to travel thousands of miles right around the country in search of votes.  A much better system could be established.  I hope that this could also be looked at in the future and that a more compact, viable and realistic system could be introduced. Seanad voting could be introduced on a regional basis.  I am sure every Senator would welcome the setting up of such a system.</P>
    <P>In the context of local government elections some of the council areas could also be looked at.  For example, I represent Galway rural district.  Most of that area is in north Galway and part is on the other side of Galway city in south Connemara.  I am sure this type of situation prevails in many other counties.  I hope that could also be looked at in future revisions.  The Seanad voting system could be examined with a view to improving it and the county council electoral areas could be examined with a view to making them more compact.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and commend the members of the commission for the way in which they have expedited their work.  I am very pleased that it is an independent commission which sets out the recommendations for the boundaries for the next general election.  I hope that the commission will always remain independent.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire.  Tá súil agam go bhfeicimid go minic sa Teach seo í, mar Aire, ar ndóigh, agus ní mar Sheanadóir.  I had not intended speaking on this Bill but I found myself so interested in Senator O'Kennedy's opening remarks that I <Col N="967" /> came across to the Chamber.  I missed what he was saying in the interim, naturally. I hope I will not repeat him.</P>
      <P>This is potentially a very important subject, almost one for a long lecture.  I will confine myself to a couple of minutes of quiet observation, however. I concur in the congratulations on the speed with which the commission discharged its responsibilities, but I hope it is the last time that a commission has such limited responsibilities because the time has come for fundamental reform of the electoral system, as Senator O'Kennedy intimated, and not for simply modifying its operation in accordance with demographic change from time to time, worthy though that objective is.</P>
      <P>Since we shifted from what one might politely call the massaging of electoral boundaries by whoever the incumbent party was to the independent commission we have achieved much greater objectivity and fairness.  This new objectivity has also been a significant contributory factor &mdash; this is not the commission's fault &mdash; to electoral instability, because the Government of the day has not been able to make provision for those extra few seats which would have changed what has usually been a fairly evenly balanced election result to enable one party Government &mdash; we know which party historically that was. The failure of any party to form a single party Government since 1981 has been not unrelated to the introduction of a commission of this type, which I welcome despite that.  We did not fully contemplate the implications of that spinoff, however.  This instability has further implications down the line for the way our Government will be conducted in future years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope this is the last time that a commission with these restricted terms of reference will find itself operating in this manner.  The commission points out that the terms limited it to providing for between 164 and 168 Members in the other House, although the Constitution would have permitted any number <Col N="968" /> between 117 and 176.  One could have reduced membership of the other House by one third at a stroke if one so wished.  I do not believe that one should so wish although I know there is a view among some members of the public that we have too many TDs.</P>
    <P>I could align myself with more austere members of the public in demanding fewer public representatives but the problem, as Senator O'Kennedy has identified, is that the system by which the Oireachtas manages its own affairs prevents individual Members giving of their best.  It has been one of my persistent complaints about Irish performance in general going back to independence that while on a one to one basis we can compare with any in the world, we manage our individual talents badly in a collective sense.  I can think of nowhere to which that applies more than to the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>There is a large number of very able people in the Oireachtas.  My opinion of politicians has risen since I have come here.  Perhaps there is a self serving element in that but my opinion of them has risen as I have come to know them better.  However, I am also convinced that many of them are trapped and are not allowed by the system to deliver of their own full potential.  As long as the electoral system remains as it is, as long as we have the multi-Member seats, we will shackle Deputies and suffocate them and will not permit them to deliver of their full potential in terms of public service.</P>
    <P>We will all always remain children of original sin or of whatever the current theological equivalent may be.  No electoral system in the world will prevent tensions arising or prevent the usual blood sport of politics operating from time to time but I am convinced that the PR system in multi-Member constituencies has now served its purpose.  Historically it was very important that in times of much more acrimonious relations between parties there should not have been a system where the winner took all because in very bitter situations that would have driven whatever <Col N="969" /> party was the loser to near despair and might have driven more extreme elements on either side into activities which would not have been conducive to civilised government.</P>
    <P>We have now reached a stage, through evolution and electoral fortunes, where the positive potential of the current electoral system has been largely exhausted and where the more negative features are increasingly coming into prominence.  It is high time that a root and branch review of the electoral system took place with a view to achieving the full potential of our public representatives.  I am convinced that however much internal Oireachtas reform takes place, it will be inhibited, and rendered null and void, by the very natural concern of Members to protect the electoral base that is inflicted and imposed on them by the system they operate.</P>
    <P>The first Private Members' motion I put down in this House dealt with improving research facilities for Members of the Oireachtas.  Those research facilities still seem to be primitive and, even if Members wanted to, would not allow them to pull their full weight.  I am convinced that, even with the best facilities in the world, our electoral system would still impose a primacy of other considerations on elected Members.  I hope that the Whitaker Commission, the Constitutional Review Committee, will take this dimension into account.  It cannot decide it or make proposals for the Oireachtas to determine. However, as a result of the impetus it provides, I hope all-party agreement will be achieved on moving in the direction of the Norton amendment &mdash; as it was known 25 years to 30 years ago &mdash; to retain proportional representation of a kind but in single member constituencies.</P>
    <P>Making allowance for all the legitimate concerns involved, I hope it will be possible for our political system to arrive at an agreed measure of electoral reform which will allow members of all parties to do themselves full justice. That requires consensus which has not <Col N="970" /> been hitherto noticeable in our parliamentary system.  However, we are increasingly moving toward a form of consensus politics which has its own advantages and disadvantages.  If, out of that consensual dimension, agreement could be achieved on electoral reform it would be a major gain in the evolution of our institutions and political culture. While I welcome this report, and agree with the plaudits it has justifiably received, I hope it will be the last of its type before a new electoral system is put in place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister.  I agree with Senator McDonagh's point in relation to Sunday voting which should be considered by Government. Younger voters are not getting the opportunity to cast their vote since the reduction of the voting age to 18 years. The huge increase in numbers receiving third level education means that they are usually in school.  If voting takes place on a Thursday, students from my county can be in Galway, Letterkenny, Dublin, etc., and cannot return home. This defeats the element of democracy.</P>
      <P>Another point referred to earlier was that of one-seat and multi-seat constituencies. I guarantee that if ten people in the street were asked to explain the PR system they could not do so.  One of the reasons is that it was never explained to them.  PR should be explained at school level because it is the fairest system.  It has been admired by democracies across the world as a fair system.  Senator Lee is a man of extreme&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>He settled for the best of both worlds, with the PR system in a one-seat constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter which has always intrigued me is that in a general election <Col N="971" /> it may take 5,000 to 6,000 votes to elect a Member to the Dáil.  In the case of a by-election it might take 20,000 to elect a Member to the Dáil from the same constituency.  This is an anomaly in our system which has never been considered or explained.  Four out of the past five by-elections have been won by Members who had previously held a seat or who had done very well in the previous general election.  There is a continuance of opinion among the electorate which must be honoured and respected.</P>
    <P>I was elected to the Dáil from the Longford-Westmeath constituency in 1989.  That constituency was divided up by the Independent Commission in 1992 and became the constituency of Longford-Roscommon. Under the current commission, the situation remains the same.  I do not know if it is in order to comment on this issue.  However, I will do so without casting any reflection on the individuals involved.  We were given the opportunity to make a submission and were not sworn to secrecy as to its content.</P>
    <P>I informed the commission that County Longford is part of Leinster, comes under the remit of the Midland Health Board, is part of the European constituency of Leinster and that there is not one inch of land connection between counties Longford and Roscommon. The only connections are two bridges and a lake which is ten miles wide.  The commission's terms of reference pointed out that natural boundaries were one of the factors which had to be taken into consideration.  I understand, from the commission's report, that it took county boundaries as the priority and it succeeded in many cases. For example, County Galway is divided into two constituencies and County Mayo forms a single constituency.  While some of the directives laid down were breached in relation to my constituency of Longford-Roscommon, I can see that &mdash; if County Longford remained in Leinster &mdash; it would have a roll on effect across the province.  With decisions such <Col N="972" /> as this the commission has to decide to go one way or the other.  Unfortunately, County Longford was chosen to halt spin-offs in other areas.  It has been the topic of conversation and has caused anger in County Longford.  Many people do not understand the reason for this, although they would if they read the report.</P>
    <P>Another interesting point on the electoral system relates to urban and county councils, in particular.  When a member dies or retires from a county council, councillors from the county have a say in who fills that vacancy, which is unfair. The electorate in that area is denied the opportunity to select a replacement.  I suggest that the political party to which the member belonged should get the seat.  In the case of independent or non party members, they should nominate at the time of the election a replacement candidate.  It would be a fair system and would represent democracy at local level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is based on a report put together by a group of impartial objective people who have done their best within the terms of reference given to them.  I do not believe we should have any complaints.  I feel sorry for some Members of this and the other House who have found that certain areas have been cut off.  It brings home to us that politics can be a brutal business at times where, through no fault of his or her own, a Member may find that an area in which they have worked for many years disappears from their constituency. We cannot blame the commission for that.  Judge Johnson and the commission, which included the Clerk of the Seanad, Ms Deirdre Lane, did as good a job as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, it brings home to us the more brutal side of politics.  We have seen this in Westminster where not only have there been changes in constituencies, but constituencies have been swept away.  A Member could find that his or her constituency is wiped off the map and they must look for another one.  The situation here is not as bad as that.  We <Col N="973" /> all subscribe to the idea of an independent commission.  Mr. Jack Lynch, having seen the results of earlier political attempts to redraw boundaries, decided that never again should this type of power be exercised in that way.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment on a point raised by Senator O'Kennedy in his interesting speech and by Senator Lee in his speech, which centred on the same topic &mdash; electoral reform.  A great deal has been written about the problems caused by the multi-seat constituency, the concentration on internal party fighting and that between parties and the demands this makes on TDs time at the expense of other work which they might do.  There is no doubt that there is a great deal of wasteful duplication and competition.</P>
    <P>Like Senator O'Kennedy, I hope the question of parliamentary reform is placed firmly on the agenda of the Whitaker Commission.  I do not know what would be the ideal electoral system for this country.  There may be strong arguments that proportional representation is best suited.  On two occasions the people have been asked to change it. The second time more emphatically than the first, the people said that PR was the system they wanted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  However, the people were not given a fair choice. The recommendation of the constitutional committee was not put before the people the last time.  I say that about a Minister from my party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a valid point. There was an element of winner take all about the options put to the people who were not, as Senator O'Kennedy rightly said, given a wide choice.  We may follow the line taken by New Zealand which recently had a national debate on what its electoral system should be after which a referendum was held.  People may prefer to keep the system they know and which, in many ways, has served this country well over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody here would advocate that we adopt the British system which is, in <Col N="974" /> effect, one of disproportional representation. Mrs. Thatcher, for example, was allowed to dominate British politics, although her party never received more than 50 per cent of the vote &mdash; indeed, it frequently received well under 50 per cent.  She was allowed to implement major, almost revolutionary policies, as if she had a clear mandate which, for the most part, she did not have.  In large areas of the country the feeling against her was the contrary.</P>
    <P>The Norton amendment was mentioned by Senator Lee.  It may have been one of the great mistakes in our history that the people were not given the opportunity to vote on the Norton amendment.  It might have been the system which enabled strong parties to emerge while preserving the rights of smaller groups, their ability to be elected and the idiosyncrasies of individual areas.  The best system for this country may be the list system as advocated by Dr. Garret FitzGerald, based on the German model which is a mixture of proportional representation and a straight votes system where people are selected from the list.  I know the bad systems, but I am not sure which is the best one.</P>
    <P>I hope that when the Whitaker Committee carries out its work it puts the question of parliamentary reform and the options open to us on the agenda.  If we are to have a debate, I hope it will not be the type of crude debate we had in 1959 and 1968, which became partisan. The motives of those seeking change were easily suspected of being partisan and the people were not given a wide choice.  There is probably divided opinion in all parties as to the best system. I recommend this Bill and I hope it has a speedy passage, which will give people time over the next two years to prepare for the election and to get their constituencies in order.  I would like the Whitaker Commission to heed the views expressed by a number of Members.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators for participating in this <Col N="975" /> debate and for raising many points, some of which are not directly related to the Bill.  I welcome the fact that there is general consensus on the wisdom of an independent commission and not tinkering with its recommendations.  It was an enlightened decision to take at the time and it has proved its worth. Some of the points raised as regards its terms of reference will be debated when the Electoral Bill, 1994, which will put the commission on a statutory footing, is discussed.</P>
      <P>I listened with interest to Senator O'Kennedy's and Senator Lee's strongly held views on the multi-seat system.  It is important to put on record that there are opposing views.  I am concerned that in changing the multi-seat system we might lose the possibility which exists to allow for the wide range of political parties and representation of a diversity of views inherent in the multi-seat system.  I would argue that there is no empirical evidence that TDs who do a lot of constituency work are necessarily poorer legislators.</P>
      <P>I understand and recognise the tensions in larger parties which the multi seat system generates.  While it raises a question about the multi-seat system, it also raises one about the ethos of political parties and their function and nature. Much material for debate may well arise following the work of the expert group on the Constitution, with regard to electoral reform and the Seanad.  I hope we can continue to look at the question in the future.</P>
      <P>Senator McDonagh raised the issue of Sunday voting, to which there is no statutory bar, although it has not happened. Doubtless, many school children would be upset at the notion.  The proposal could be made to the Dáil from the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs, which was asked to look at various items relating to electoral law and procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The expert group to review the Constitution will consider the Seanad and electoral reform for the Seanad.  It would be difficult for it not to do so considering <Col N="976" /> the provisions for the composition of the Seanad in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>We could not accommodate the points made on the Bill because they are not relevant or appropriate.  The Bill is specific and its proposals are understood by Senators.  It results from an independent commission, the members of which I thank for their conscientious work.  It is not possible to satisfy everybody. They did minimum damage with regard to altering county boundaries and the nature of the constituencies that have developed over the years.  I look forward to further debate in future on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for attending to address a very important matter for the people of County Galway and Galway city, the urgent necessity to provide finance for a new road &mdash; the Kingston road from the Knocknacarragh area &mdash; from the west of County Galway and for the expanding west part of the city into the city centre.  This has become probably the fastest urban growth area in the country over the past number of years as a total of 2,200 houses have been built in the relatively short space of a few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, because of bad planning, proper provision for infrastructural services in this area has not been made.  Residents in Knocknacarragh and along the coast road in Connemara leading to Spiddal and Carraroe are now delayed at peak times for up to one <Col N="977" /> hour because of the major traffic using the road.</P>
    <P>Repeated efforts have been made over the past number of years to have money provided by the Department of the Environment and many politicians made repeated requests to the previous Minister for the Environment in this respect, unfortunately to no avail.  I ask the Minister to consider providing money on a phased basis over the next few years for the construction of this road, which, it is estimated, will cost approximately £4 million.  To date, the Department refused to recognise the urgency of the project.  While significant money is being invested in national primary roads, this is the busiest road outside the Pale.  Will the Minister ensure it gets the priority it deserves within the Department of the Environment?</P>
    <P>I realise that money is in short supply and that this is the reason it has not been provided to date, but we cannot put this project on the long finger.  The only advice given to Galway Corporation by the Department of the Environment is to provide funding for the road from its block grants.  The block grant is not significant and if Galway Corporation were to follow this advice nothing would be done over the next few years apart from the construction of this road.  Extra financial resources must, therefore, be made available to Galway Corporation to enable it to get on with the job.  The only other alternative is for developers to build the road as development takes place.  This is not acceptable because if this approach were to be taken, the road would take ten to 12 years to build.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister give an indication of the volumes of traffic, the nature of the delays on this road and her plans to provide funding?  People in Galway would be happy if it was provided over a number of years.  They do not expect it to be provided all at once.  We need an indication that money will be provided over the next few years to do this urgent job. A great deal of frustration is caused to residents who find themselves in a new <Col N="978" /> area with no access because of the lack of proper roads.</P>

      <P>The overall road project which is the subject of this motion and is generally referred to as the Galway western relief road, is a distributor road, the purpose of which is to relieve the existing narrow road system which has substantial housing developments along it.  It is estimated the new road will cost in excess of £4 million to construct.</P>
      <P>As the proposed road would be a non national road, the responsibility for its construction is a matter for Galway Corporation, and it will be a matter for the corporation to fund the road from its own resources supplemented by annual State grants.  This is an important point as some people seem to be under the mistaken impression that responsibility lies with my Department.</P>
      <P>It may assist the House if I outline the types of grants available for road developments such as the one under discussion. To begin with, there are the annual discretionary block grants to local authorities, which give them a very wide degree of discretion as to how the moneys should be used.  Urban authorities can decide not only on which road schemes the moneys should be spent, but how the grant moneys should be divided between maintenance and improvement works.  Under this heading Galway Corporation received a grant of £300,000 in 1995.</P>
      <P>The second source of State funding for non national roads is under the EU co-financed scheme of specific grants for road improvements which promote employment and economic activity. Under this scheme co-financed projects must have a significant and quantifiable economic impact, particularly as regards employment and development.  It is for local authorities to prepare and submit annually to my Department proposals in respect of improvement works which can be considered for funding under this heading.</P>

      <Col N="979" /> Under this scheme Galway Corporation will receive grants of £247,000 in 1995.  This compares favourably with 1994 when the grants amounted to £150,000.  The road under discussion was not the subject of a formal application for an EU co-financed improvement grant, either in 1994 or 1995.</P>
    <P>Overall, grants of almost £103 million will be paid to local authorities in 1995 for non national roads.  Total State grants for non national roads to Galway Corporation amount to £547,000 in 1995, as compared with £520,000 in 1994.  This represents an increase of over 5 per cent in a year in which many local authorities experienced reductions in their grants.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for Galway Corporation to decide how to proceed with this matter. It is open to it to finance the proposed road over a number of years out of its own resources, supplemented by the block grant from my Department. Equally, the corporation, if it is satisfied the scheme would qualify under the criteria applying to the EU co-financed scheme of grants, may wish to consider submitting an application to the Department for funding in 1996.  If it decides to do so the application will be considered on its merits in conjunction with other applications received from other areas.</P>

      <P>What are the qualifying criteria for the co-financed scheme?  I realise the Minister is not responsible but I am disappointed several aspects of my question have not been answered &mdash; the extent of the traffic delays, for example.</P>

      <P>I indicated the requirements under the scheme whereby co-financed projects must have a significant and quantifiable economic impact, particularly as regards employment and development.  The factors related to that are specified in the circular the corporation will have received.  This road may well qualify and it will be up to Galway Corporation to decide that.</P>
      <P>It is also for the corporation to be aware of the delays being experienced and their extent.  It would not be appropriate for the Department to assess a localised problem of this nature.  The problem the Senator raises is genuine, but it is a matter for the local authority to be aware of the extent of the delays and to look closely at the EU co-financed regulations to see if it is possible to apply under that scheme.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 5.50 p.m. until 10.30 a.m.  on Thursday, 13 July 1995.</P>
