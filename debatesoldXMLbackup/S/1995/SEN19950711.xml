      <P>I have notice from Senator Honan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to reconsider the proposed changes in health insurance in relation to psychiatric care.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Henry of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Government to ensure that healthy people carrying abnormal genes are protected against employment discrimination.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Cosgrave of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to ensure that the job sharing arrangements which exist in the Central Remedial Clinic in Clontarf continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senator Honan, Senator Henry and Senator Cosgrave as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Honan's and Senator Henry's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Cosgrave <Col N="694" /> may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>Today's Order of Business is items 1 and 2.  It is proposed to take item 1 until 6.p.m. with 20 minutes for spokespersons and 15 minutes for each speaker thereafter.  I seek the co-operation of the House in trying to bring the Second Stage of item 1 to a conclusion by 6 p.m.  The Committee and remaining Stages will be taken on Wednesday, 19 July.  We will take all Stages of item 2 today.</P>

      <P>An extensive Whips notice was issued this week.  We recognise the reasons for this are due to the unprecedented situation the House has faced recently.  We will do our best to co-operate in every way.  I welcome that the Leader has decided to allow a second day for the Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill, 1995.  We are taking all Stages of the Casual Trading Bill, 1994.  Does the Leader have any time in mind as to when we will conclude tonight?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>We will agree with that. This House has raised the question of the Irish Press Group on many occasions and the Leader has had the opportunity of speaking to the workforce at various public places.  The Leader will be aware from correspondence and representations made by the workforce that it is ironic that, in their effort to save jobs in the Irish Press Group, they now find themselves outside the social welfare system.  This situation is unprecedented; this is an anomaly. Could the Leader use his good offices with the Minister in question to see what measures the Minister can take to alleviate the situation faced by the workforce?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of business we have to cover this week and next is understandable in these unprecedented circumstances.  Nonetheless, it is important to ensure that all legislation is given due consideration.  The Casual Trading Bill may take longer than the Leader is expecting and it is important it is given as much time as it needs.  Earlier the Leader gave a commitment to have a debate on foreign affairs before the end of this session.  I recognise that circumstances alter cases and the difficulty in which we find ourselves but the Leader has given commitments to have debates on foreign affairs and a number of other outstanding issues and motions on the Order Paper.  There is a need for debates on education, on disability and related matters.  Could one day be devoted to these issues when the House resumes after the summer recess?  It would be possible to clear a great deal of business at the beginning of the next session by providing a day to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It is reasonable, in view of the congestion in the Order of Business &mdash; and I can understand the reasons for it &mdash; that we are flexible on the matter.  Having said that, a few urgent matters warrant attention, possibly by way of statements.  One of them is the remarkable events that took place in the Pacific Ocean with the <i>Rainbow Warrior II</i> and Greenpeace, who endeavoured by peaceful means to stop something we condemned in this House some time ago.  Seeing the television pictures showing that boat being rammed and tear gas being thrown on its bridge demonstrates an attitude on the part of the French that I, and I imagine everybody in the House, finds totally unacceptable.  I hope the Leader will ask the Government to bring our strongest possible protest to bear on this matter.  We might possibly consider dealing with it by way of statements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While accepting there is a requirement to take all Stages of the Casual Trading Bill expeditiously, I ask the Leader of the House if, in that event, we <Col N="696" /> can enter amendments up to the end of Second Stage?  It is possible that on the basis of what we hear on that Stage there might be a need for some amendments.</P>
    <P>My other question is to do with item 10, the Consumer Credit Bill.  The Leader is aware that we voiced dissatisfaction about the way this Bill was brought through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  There were 200 amendments, mostly from the Government side, when we debated the Bill.  Now we have a further instalment before us, which takes up a page on the Order of Business.  The middle of that message says that &ldquo;Dáil Éireann has not agreed to amendment 77 and desires that Seanad Éireann should not insist thereon.&rdquo;. Can the Leader clarify to what the Government takes such exception in the way Seanad Éireann dealt with the Consumer Credit Bill?</P>
    <P>We should welcome the freeing of Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma by the Burmese Government and hope it heralds the dawn of democratic politics in that country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call from Senator Wright as regards the entitlement of the <i>Irish Press</i> workers to social welfare payments.  It seems extraordinary that people who have been out of work for the last number of weeks have received social welfare payments while the <i>Irish Press</i> workers have been excluded from such entitlements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator should propose legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader promised on a number of occasions during this session that there would be a debate on health.  This has not materialised and there is no indication in this week's Order of Business of such a debate. While I appreciate time will be provided for statements on disability, that is not in keeping with the commitment I understood was given to the House regarding a debate on health.  There are many outstanding issues under that <Col N="697" /> heading that need to be debated.  Maybe the Leader will address this matter when he replies?</P>
      <P>We asked for a debate on agriculture, especially as it applied to the withdrawal or curtailment of grant aid under the farmyard pollution scheme.  That is now a major matter of public concern around the country.  We have all been invited to public meetings on the matter &mdash; I have attended such meetings &mdash; and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry has not yet responded.  Some weeks ago I asked the Leader to respond to this.  I now ask him if the Minister will come to this House or if the Leader will make any statement on this serious matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the short time left in this session, it may not be possible to ask for the Taoiseach to come to the House.  Could the Leader persuade him to meet the British Prime Minister, John Major, as a matter of urgency?  I travelled through the North to come here and over the past few months the atmosphere has been relaxed.  However that situation does not prevail today because there is tension in the North.  We must return to normality and the Taoiseach must continue to meet Mr. John Major until we recover the ground lost.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to explain my reasons for asking this question.  The people in the North are concerned about the present situation.  This is the only platform I have to raise this issue. I believe the Leader will support my request to emphasise the urgency of the situation to the Taoiseach.  I represent a Border area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that you must keep order in the House but I ask the Leader to emphasise our concern about this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I also want to raise the issue of French nuclear testing.  Is the Leader aware that last night Dublin City Council adopted a resolution that none of its members would go to the Bastille Day reception in the French Embassy? Would he agree that no Member of this House should attend that reception or any other French reception in the short term until the French Government's decision is reversed?  There is a responsibility on the Tánaiste to persuade his French counterpart at European Council level to reverse this decision.  If there is time for a debate on foreign affairs next Wednesday, would it be appropriate for the Tánaiste to come into this House to tell us about the efforts he is making to get the French Government to reverse its decision? This is a matter of major concern to an overwhelming number of Irish people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Miss Ormonde Miss Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Some time ago Senator Daly mentioned the shortage of places for higher diploma students.  In the past couple of weeks I have been approached by students who have completed their degrees and are anxious to enrol in the course, but who have experienced great difficulties.  The Leader indicated he would talk to the Minister for Education.  I would like to know the up-to-date position on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what has been said about the attack on the <i>Rainbow Warrior II</i> and, in particular, what Senator Mulcahy said.  I had intended to request the Leader to ask Members not to attend the Bastille Day celebrations. Perhaps he might clarify this in his reply.  I was asked by the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs <Col N="699" /> not to go to these celebrations and I said I would be happy not to do so.  Nobody should be surprised by this development. Some people may have been surprised by my intemperate remarks about Mr. Juppé and his views on human rights issues in East Timor.  The French have a long tradition in this area.</P>
      <P>Could the Leader ascertain, for the information of the House, the precise legal situation because it is not clear to me whether the <i>Rainbow Warrior II</i> was in French territorial waters?  It is a matter of further concern that the French should continue this buccaneering practice on the anniversary of the day when they succeeded in murdering a distinguished French psychologist, Pascale Joseph Doucé, on the instructions of the French secret service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise there are pressures at present, but perhaps it would be possible to allocate an hour for statements on item 24, motion 16: &ldquo;That Seanad Éireann takes note of the final statement issued from the Conference of European parliamentarians concerning HIV-AIDS, held under the auspices of the European Public Health foundation in Barcelona on 19-20 May 1995&rdquo;.  Senator Henry and I attended that conference in Barcelona and we were asked to bring back this report to see if it could be noted by Seanad Éireann.  I ask this particularly because I will be going to London at the weekend for a meeting of a subcommittee, of which I am a member, chaired by Lord Kilmarnock and I would like to tell <Col N="700" /> them that we are taking this matter seriously.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In directing a question to the Leader, I endorse the comments of my colleague, Senator McGowan.  As a Member from a Border county I wish to convey to this House and to the Leader the growing concern among those living in the Border counties at the threat to the peace process.</P>
      <P>The window of opportunity, which was opened by the ceasefire, should not be threatened either by a lack of will on the part of the British Government or incidents like those we witnessed near Portadown.  I commend the Nationalist people of the Garvaghy Road for their Christian and tolerant response in the face of extreme provocation and the RUC, who have handled the matter in a manner which may have pleasantly surprised people on the southern side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not discussing that matter now.  A question please Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader please convey to the Taoiseach and the Government the urgency of putting the peace process back on the rails?  I cannot overestimate the serious threat that has been perceived to be looming in the Border counties as expressed by my friend and colleague, Senator McGowan.  I know it will be shared by all my colleagues in the Border counties. I am sorry, a Leas-Chathaoirligh.  I know you are anxious to move on but this matter is of such importance&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not attempting to discuss it but I want to convey, with all of the strength at my command, how vital it is that there is some political fallout from the peace process, some movement on the prisoners' issue and something given to the Nationalist people of <Col N="701" /> Northern Ireland, who have put their faith in this ceasefire, which is under threat.  Will the Leader please convey these comments to the Taoiseach?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrancisOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is much the same.  I support Senator McGowan and I want to express my personal concern. I ask the Leader to convey our concern to the Taoiseach and ask him to convey to Mr. Major the urgency of the peace process and the difficulty that has arisen over the last ten days.  It is important that this be dealt with immediately.  The Leader should convey to the Taoiseach this sense of urgency and our concern because it may be too late in another week or fortnight.  If we undo all the good work of the last Government and the present Government to date out of neglect, for the sake of a better word, it would be a sad day for this country.</P>
      <P>I also ask the Leader to convey to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry our concern about the withdrawal of grants for farm pollution which is causing a serious problem in Monaghan and Cavan.  This matter has been raised by Senator Finneran already and I support him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted that Minister Higgins has decided that the headquarters of the National Heritage Council will be in Kilkenny.</P>
      <P>In view of the statements that there will be cuts of £77 million in current budget expenditure between now and the end of the year, which of the programmes announced earlier in the year will be affected?  This is important. Ministers are going around the country announcing schemes here, there and everywhere.  Where will the cuts take place?  All we have heard is that Ministers have agreed to these cuts but no one knows where they will be made and it is essential that we know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="702" /> I agree with other speakers that it is important to continue to make our protests to the French.  Kilkenny Corporation and Kilkenny County Council both unanimously passed motions of condemnation last night.  However, I do not agree with the request that the Leader should ask Members of this House not to attend a Bastille Day celebration. If Members are not able to make up their own minds as to where they should go, that is a disgrace.  It should be left to every Member to decide for himself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his co-operation on today's business.  He and other colleagues mentioned the <i>Irish Press</i> workers; this crisis is a cause of shame. Every effort has been made by the Minister to resolve the matter within existing legislation.  I will convey to him the concern Senator Wright expressed, which is felt by so many Members.</P>
      <P>The issue of French nuclear testing and Greenpeace was mentioned by a number of Members.  Senator Lanigan is right; it is not my job to tell people whether to go to a ceremony.  I will not be going but that is partly because I have not been invited.  I am prepared, subject to agreement with the Whips, to make half an hour of Seanad time available &mdash; perhaps during lunch break &mdash; on Bastille Day, <i>le quatorze juillet</i>, if Members wish to make statements on the issues concerned.  One Member from each group could be permitted to speak; we can discuss the details later. We had a short debate on this subject when it was announced that nuclear testing would recommence and I conveyed those statements to the French Ambassador.  As the only House sitting on Friday, it would be appropriate to have short statements on the matter.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis asked about amendments to the Casual Trading Bill; they will be accepted up to the end of Second Stage.  He also asked if I understood item 10 on today's Order Paper; I do not but I will have myself briefed and will then brief other Members in understandable language as to what has to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Finneran rightly raised the debate on health and I regret that it has not been possible to hold that debate. Circumstances of the last two weeks have resulted in a great curtailment of available time.  I guarantee to do my best to see if that debate can be held. Senator O'Toole made a helpful suggestion <Col N="704" /> on which I would like to act, which was that we could set aside one or two days at the beginning of next session to deal with any outstanding matters from this session.  We are coming to the end of an arduous session and I cannot promise to make further time available; I am not sure that all Members want that time made available.</P>
    <P>A number of Members raised the question of Northern Ireland and I can assure Senators that they do not have a monopoly of concern about what is happening there.  All of us are concerned and determined to ensure, as far as we can, that the peace process is maintained. The Government is in constant contact with the British Government and with the authorities in Northern Ireland.  My own view is that at this stage, when we are calling for restraint on both sides in Northern Ireland, we would not help the process by saying anything which would cause offence or otherwise damage the present situation. While noting the concern we all feel, I call on colleagues to exercise restraint in this matter.  Words can be very dangerous in the present tinder-box situation in Northern Ireland, especially over the coming days.  I have noted, however, the concern of Senators.</P>

      <P>This Social Welfare Bill is the latest in a series of legislative changes promoted by this Government which are designed to provide clarity and security for families and individuals in the event of marriage breakdown. The focus of the Bill is, of course, the proposed holding of a referendum later this year to remove the constitutional ban on divorce.</P>
      <P>The programme for <i>A Government of Renewal</i> commits us to the preparation of a detailed paper dealing with all the relevant issues relating to divorce and the putting in place of all necessary legislation.  That is what this Social Welfare Bill is seeking to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The central purpose of this Bill before the House is to provide for the necessary changes in the social welfare code to ensure that no person, either spouse or child, will be disadvantaged in terms of his or her social welfare entitlements <Col N="706" /> as a result of the spouse's legal status being changed from married, separated or deserted to that of divorced.  In making these changes we are not conferring new or additional rights on individuals. Rather we are guaranteeing no loss of rights under the social welfare system arising from a change in a person's legal status to divorced.</P>
    <P>The opportunity is also being taken in this Bill to introduce an important change in the way the earnings of seasonal workers are assessed for the purpose of qualifying for unemployment assistance.  The existing arrangements have caused serious difficulties in certain industries and I am glad of the opportunity to improve their position by removing a major disincentive to taking up seasonal work.  I will come back to this particular measure later.  I want to deal with an issue which is in a way related to unemployment assistance and qualifying for it.</P>
    <P>On the Order of Business in this House today the question of the <i>Irish Press</i> workers was raised.  There was mention of the fact that a number of them have not qualified for unemployment benefit or assistance.  Many of the queries raised in this regard arise from a letter from Mr. Ronan Quinlan of the National Union of Journalists.  Some of the information which he provided to Members is inaccurate and I have issued a detailed response to that letter which I propose, with your permission, Sir, to read into the record of the House.</P>
    <P>Dear Ronan,</P>
    <P>I have received your letter on 5th July 1995 regarding the difficulties your members are experiencing in qualifying for Unemployment Benefit or Assistance.  This difficulty arises because your members are involved in a trade dispute with the Irish Press Newspapers.  People involved in trade disputes are in general precluded from Unemployment Benefit or Assistance under Sections 47 &amp; 125, respectively, of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993 (relevant extracts attached).  However, where a <Col N="707" /> Deciding Officer, and subsequently an Appeals Officer, refuse payments an appeal can be made to the Social Welfare Tribunal that was first established in 1982 and whose terms of reference are now contained in sections 274-276 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993.</P>
    <P>This Tribunal, which I reconstituted several weeks ago in anticipation of an appeal by Irish Press journalists, is available to consider your submission as soon as they receive it.  As you know, the Appeals Officer's decision issued on 21st June 1995, more than two weeks ago [this letter is dated 7 July]... When it [the application] is received, there will be a 2-week period in which the employer must be given an opportunity to see and respond to your submission. The Tribunal will then meet to consider the submissions and come to its decision.  Normally, its decision issues within a few days.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, dependants of your members may be entitled to Supplementary Welfare Allowance from their local Eastern Health Board clinic, pending the outcome of any appeal or a resolution of the dispute with Irish Press Newspapers.</P>
    <P>The procedure which applied in your case was also applied in the case of Dunnes Stores workers.  The decision in that case was precisely the same in relation to full-time workers as in the case of the Press journalists. The difference is that the part-time Dunnes workers could qualify for those days for which they normally received Unemployment Benefit or Assistance while working.</P>
    <P>I must stress that this entire procedure is laid down by law and operates independently of the Minister. Nevertheless, I have ensured that in your case each stage was dealt with expeditiously.  Indeed, as you can see from the attached Information Note, the time which elapsed between the date of the first NUJ claim and the date of the Appeals Officer's decision <Col N="708" /> (3 weeks and 2 days) was far shorter than the norm (about 9 weeks).  You are also aware that the Department of Social Welfare has set up a dedicated 'phone line, reserved exclusively for use by <i>Irish Press</i> journalists, in order to answer queries and explain procedures, etc.; I understand that this 'phone line has been extensively used by your members.</P>
    <P>It is clear, therefore, that the way in which the <i>Irish Press</i> journalists' case has been processed involves no anomalies or &lsquo;injustices&rsquo; as alleged in your letter.  Nor was there any unfavourable treatment by comparison with the Dunnes workers.  The different outcomes in each case resulted from the different circumstances of each.</P>
    <P>There is a case, I believe, for examining how in future the Social Welfare Tribunal could be brought into play at an earlier stage of the process. However, this would require legislation as well as careful consideration of all the ramifications.  We would of course consult with the ICTU and IBEC before any such changes would be contemplated.</P>
    <P>Yours sincerely,</P>
    <P>Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>It was important to read that letter into the record and I have arranged for a copy to be sent to every Member of the Seanad and the Dáil.  It is important that it is made clear that whatever difficulties the <i>Irish Press</i> journalists have, do not arise as a result of any reluctance on my part or the Department's part to treat the <i>Irish Press</i> journalists fairly.  I stress that there are 600 workers in the Irish Press and 400 of them are on social welfare while this dispute proceeds.</P>
    <P>It is also wrong to claim that the fact that the journalists of the <i>Irish Press</i>, who number about 200, chose to bring in an examiner has ruled them out from receiving social welfare.  They have already been ruled out from receiving social welfare and have been told why. They have been told they may appeal to the social welfare tribunal but up to 7 <Col N="709" /> July last, two weeks after they had received the results of the appeal officer's decision, they had not done so; it is important to make that clear.  They are not entitled to social welfare simply because a deciding officer and an appeals officer in accordance with the law have decided that they are in dispute with their employer.  If they want to dispute that decision, they must take it to the social welfare tribunal to resolve it.  They can, of course, qualify for social welfare if that tribunal finds they are not in dispute with their employer or if the journalists decided that, because of the circumstances and by introducing an examiner, they are ending their dispute with the employer. Then they would qualify for social welfare for as long as the company refuses to allow them to work or for as long as there is no work available for them at the <i>Irish Press.</i>  It is important to put those facts on the record and those details, with an explanatory memorandum, are being circulated to all Members.</P>
    <P>The main elements of the social welfare code affected by the provisions of this Bill are widows' and widowers' pensions, occupational injuries benefits, lone parents and deserted wives schemes, family income supplement and prisoner's wife's allowance.  The widow's and widower's contributory pension is being extended to enable a divorced person who has not remarried to qualify for pension on the death of their former spouse.  This means that on the death of a divorced person, his or her former spouse will be able to qualify for a contributory pension either on their own insurance record or that of the deceased even if the deceased had remarried.  Where the deceased had remarried, their second spouse may also qualify for a widow's or widower's pension.</P>
    <P>As regards occupational, injuries benefit, the pension or gratuity payable to a married person whose spouse dies as a result of an occupational accident or disease is being extended to the former spouse of a divorced person who <Col N="710" /> has not remarried as well as to the existing spouse if the deceased had remarried.</P>
    <P>A woman in receipt of deserted wife's benefit or allowance who becomes divorced may continue to be regarded as deserted for the purposes of the deserted wife's benefit and allowance schemes.  Similarly, a divorced parent caring for children will be recognised as a lone parent and may qualify for a lone parent's allowance.</P>
    <P>A divorced person in employment who is supporting his or her former spouse and children may qualify for family income supplement if their pay is below the relevant income thresholds. A woman receiving prisoner's wife's allowance who becomes divorced will continue to qualify for this allowance provided that she continues to satisfy the other conditions of entitlement.  A divorced woman whose former husband is imprisoned may also qualify for the allowance.  In addition, the Bill also provides that a divorced person supporting his or her former spouse may receive an adult dependant allowance in respect of them.  They may also receive an additional adult dependant allowance if remarried or cohabiting.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to refute criticisms that the Bill is seeking to perpetuate and extend the concept of dependency and the practice of treating women as dependants in the social welfare code.  Rather than extending dependency, this Bill ensures, as I have already said, that no one on social welfare loses entitlements as a result of divorce.  It implicitly recognises that many women do not currently have social welfare entitlements in their own right by, for example, allowing their former spouses to retain their pension rights even after divorce.  The argument that women should only have entitlements following divorce based on their own contributions or solely on means would be tantamount to depriving many thousands of women of rights which they have acquired &mdash; albeit as dependants &mdash; by virtue of their husband's social insurance contributions.  Those <Col N="711" /> rights may have been built up over many years of marriage during which the women in question may have contributed substantially to the accumulation of those entitlements through their work in the home.  This Bill in no way prevents women from having or acquiring social welfare entitlements in their own right.  Many women already do, but thousands do not.</P>
    <P>Other provisions, such as the improvements in &ldquo;pensions for homemakers&rdquo; which I announced earlier this year, will help more women to build up their individual entitlements in future.  I would very much like to see the process of &ldquo;individualisation&rdquo; accelerated.  In practice, however, it will involve a major restructuring of the social welfare code which will take time.  In the meantime, it is essential to protect those women who have not had the opportunity to build up contributory pensions and other social welfare entitlements as individuals, in their own right, up to now.</P>
    <P>Another issue on which I would like to set the record straight is my commitment to abolish the concept of desertion in social welfare legislation and to extend to men the right to claim a lone parent's allowance.  My Department has already worked on a third Social Welfare Bill for later this year which will, among other things, abolish the necessity for people to prove desertion in order to receive State support, a requirement which is often criticised as being degrading and difficult to comply with.  My intention is to ensure that, in future, anyone who is bringing up children, or a child, on their own, whatever the reason and whatever their gender, will receive adequate support from my Department based on their need.</P>
    <P>The costs of the provision contained in the Bill, as estimated by my Department, are £1 million by year five, following the introduction of divorce, and about £2 million by year ten.  I want to emphasise that these figures do not represent the cost of marital breakdown.  Rather they represent the additional costs of ensuring that there will be no loss of entitlements <Col N="712" /> in the event of the introduction of divorce. The social welfare costs of marital breakdown are already being met by the State and the social insurance fund under the existing provisions of the social welfare code.  These supports are provided primarily through the lone parent's allowance and deserted wife's benefit and allowance schemes.</P>
    <P>It is important to realise that, under the existing provisions, a man or woman who is separated from their spouse can qualify for survivor's pension on the death of their spouse, even though they may have been separated for many years.  What this Bill does is to ensure that a divorced person whose former spouse dies will not lose entitlement to survivor's pension.  This does not give rise to any additional costs as the person would have qualified for pension in any event if they had not become divorced. Some additional costs will arise, however, on the death of a divorced person who remarried and where his or her spouse and former spouse qualify for pension.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that a deserted wife may continue to be regarded as deserted for the purposes of the deserted wife's benefit and allowance schemes.  These provisions will not give rise to any additional costs as, under the present arrangements divorce, in itself, does not affect entitlement to these payments. It was considered necessary, however, to include explicit provision for this in the Bill.  Similarly, a divorced person can qualify for lone parent's allowance under the present arrangements. They can do so on the basis of being an &ldquo;unmarried parent&rdquo; but under the provisions of the Bill, they will be recognised under the social welfare code as a divorced person.  The Bill will also enable a divorced person on low pay who is supporting his or her former spouse to qualify for family income supplement. In practice, however, it is extremely unlikely that a person on low pay would be in a financial position to maintain two households.</P>
    <P>It will be evident to Senators, therefore, that, for the reasons I have just put <Col N="713" /> forward, the additional costs arising from this Bill will be relatively low. Hence, the estimated costs of only £1 million by year five, following the introduction of divorce, and about £2 million by year ten.  While £1 million, in itself, is a substantial amount of money, it must be put into some perspective. Total social welfare expenditure this year will be in the region of £4.2 billion and the figure of £1 million represents just 0.02 per cent of that expenditure.</P>
    <P>I would now like to discuss the provisions of the Bill on a section by section basis.  Section 1 deals with the definitions used for the purposes of the Bill. Section 2 deals with death benefit which is a payment, under the occupational injuries benefit scheme in the form of a widow's pension or a dependent widower's pension or gratuity, to the dependants of a person who dies as a result of an accident at work or an occupational disease.  The purpose of this section is to allow a divorced person qualify for death benefit where their former spouse dies as a result of an occupational accident or disease.  Under existing provisions, a widow who remarries or who cohabits with someone as husband and wife is not entitled to death benefit.  This section extends those provisions to widowers.</P>
    <P>Section 3 is central to the thrust of this Bill.  Its purpose is to ensure that a divorced person may qualify for survivor's pension on the death of their former spouse provided they have not remarried or are not cohabiting with someone as husband and wife.  In addition, this section extends to divorced persons a number of provisions relating to widows and deserted wives. For example, it is not necessary for a widow or widower to satisfy the contribution conditions for entitlement to survivor's pension if the deceased spouse was entitled to an old age contributory pension or retirement pension which included an increase in respect of an adult dependant.  Similarly, a woman in receipt of deserted wife's benefit is not required to satisfy the contribution conditions for survivor's pension on the <Col N="714" /> death of her husband.  Both of those provisions are extended to divorced persons under section 3.</P>
    <P>I should mention that on Committee Stage in the other House I agreed to have the definition of &ldquo;spouse&rdquo; contained in this section reviewed by the Attorney General to ensure that it will enable survivor's pension to be paid to the legal spouse of the deceased and any former spouse, subject to their satisfying the conditions for entitlement.  The Attorney General has confirmed that the definition of &ldquo;spouse&rdquo; contained in the Bill is correct as it stands.  However, in order to clarify the intention of the definition, he considers that the words &ldquo;that last&rdquo; be inserted in the definition. This amendment was accordingly made in this section and in five other provisions in the Bill during its passage in the other House.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides that a deserted wife who becomes divorced may continue to be regarded as a deserted wife for the purpose of the deserted wife's benefit scheme.  A similar provision in relation to the deserted wife's allowance is included in section 6.  The text of subsection (4) of this section was amended on Committee Stage in the other House to ensure consistency with the text of the provision in relation to deserted wife's benefit contained in section 4. This amendment does not alter in any way the substance of the Bill and continues to provide that deserted wife's allowance will cease as and from the woman's remarriage.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides that a divorced woman who fails to qualify for survivor's pension on the death of her former husband may qualify for widow's non-contributory pension provided that she has not remarried or is not cohabiting with someone as husband and wife and, of course, that she satisfies the other conditions such as means. In addition, this section also provides that a divorced woman in receipt of deserted wife's allowance shall, on the death of her former husband, be entitled to receive a widow's non-contributory <Col N="715" /> pension at the same rate as her deserted wife's allowance.</P>
    <P>A similar provision is included in section 7 in relation to prisoners' wives. A woman in receipt of prisoner's wife's allowance who becomes divorced may continue to be regarded as a prisoner's wife for the purpose of this scheme.  In addition, this section also enables a divorced woman whose former husband is imprisoned to qualify for a prisoner's wife's allowance.  The text of subsection (4) of this section was amended on Committee Stage in the other House in order to ensure consistency with the text of the provision in relation to deserted wife's benefit as set out in section 4.  The substance of the Bill is in no way altered by this amendment as it continues to provide that the prisoner's wife's allowance will cease as and from the woman's remarriage.</P>
    <P>Section 8 extends the definition of a lone parent for the purposes of the lone parent's allowance to include a divorced parent.  This will give proper recognition in social welfare legislation to divorced parents.  Section 9 extends the definition of a family for the purposes of the family income supplement scheme by including a former spouse where he or she is being wholly or mainly maintained by the claimant.  The effect of this change is to enable a divorced person who is maintaining his or her former spouse and children to qualify for family income supplement.</P>
    <P>Section 10 contains a number of changes to existing practices in relation to adult dependants.  The definition of an adult dependant is being extended to include a divorced person and a similar extension is being made to the definition of a spouse in the old age pension scheme, which is being used to determine entitlement to an increase for a spouse.  In addition, provision is being made for regulatory powers under which a person may receive more than one increase in respect of an adult dependant and for determining the circumstances in which a person is or is not to be regarded as wholly or mainly <Col N="716" /> maintaining another person.  Subsection (3) of this section was amended on Committee Stage in the other House by substituting the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for &ldquo;may&rdquo;. The effect of this amendment is to impose an obligation on the Minister to make the regulations in question.</P>
    <P>Section 11 is a new section which was inserted in the Bill by way of an amendment which I introduced on Committee Stage in the other House.  The purpose of the amendment is to change the method of assessment for entitlement to unemployment assistance for seasonal workers, such as those in Bord na Móna and the meat processing and tourism industries.  Under the provisions of this section, seasonal workers who claim unemployment assistance outside their normal seasonal employment will not then be assessed with the value of their earnings from seasonal employment.</P>
    <P>The assessment of means for unemployment assistance was changed in July 1992 when earnings from insurable employment were taken into account for means purposes.  This change gave rise to specific difficulties for seasonal workers because their earnings in part of the year often disqualified them from unemployment assistance during the rest of the year.  The existing legislation requires that means be assessed on an annual basis and that account is taken of all earnings which the person may reasonably expect to receive during the year.  In doing this, earnings which they received in the preceding year are assessed.</P>
    <P>The practical effect of the existing provisions for seasonal workers is that when they cease their seasonal employment and claim unemployment assistance they are assessed with their earnings from that employment which they no longer have.  Consequently, they qualify for a reduced rate of unemployment assistance for the remainder of the year and, in many instances, seek a &ldquo;top-up&rdquo; payment under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
    <P>This new section in the Bill is designed to ensure that seasonal earnings will not be assessed against the <Col N="717" /> worker in respect of claims made outside the period of seasonal employment. This approach will enable seasonal workers to qualify for the maximum rate of unemployment assistance on the cessation of employment until they resume their seasonal employment in the following year.  It will also enhance the attractiveness of taking up seasonal work by eliminating this major disincentive.</P>
    <P>This new section has nothing to do with divorce.  I introduced the section as I believed it was urgent to do so.  Its provisions could only be introduced by legislative change and it is necessary to do this before the summer recess because many of the seasonal workers referred to undertake summer work and we wish to ensure they qualify for the benefits provided by the section.  It is also a reversal of one of the famous &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; cuts.  The new section is designed to ensure that seasonal workers are not hit by having previous earnings taken into account.</P>
    <P>Section 12 contains the usual provisions relating to the short title and the construction of the Bill and provides that the Bill, or portions of the Bill, may be brought into force by way of a commencement order or orders.  This section was amended on Committee Stage in the other House to enable section 11, dealing with seasonal workers, to be brought into force separately.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the thrust of the proposals contained in the Bill is to ensure that divorced persons will not be disadvantaged in terms of their social welfare entitlements.  In meeting that requirement, we have looked critically at the level of additional protection that is necessary to meet the new situation arising from the introduction of divorce.  I am satisfied that we have approached this situation in a straightforward and comprehensive manner and I commend the Bill to the Seanad.  It is not a Bill which seeks to create a total reform of the social welfare system.  It is a Bill which intends to guarantee that the social welfare rights of people who find <Col N="718" /> themselves divorced, assuming we have a successful referendum on divorce, will be protected and that they will be at no financial loss as a result.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the broad thrust of the Bill.  It is important that clarity and security be provided to everybody prior to the divorce referendum. This can only come about through legislation.  One of the main reasons the last divorce referendum failed was the fear people had of the unknown &mdash; the fear that their entitlements, not only social welfare but property entitlements and so on, would be taken away.  In view of this, it is important that we have a full legislative base prepared prior to a referendum. This will be a very divisive debate and such debates, which tear our society apart, should not occur on a regular basis.  I, therefore, appeal to the Minister to accept one or two of the amendments we have tabled to ensure that entitlements are safeguarded and guaranteed.</P>
      <P>In recent years there has been a broadly constructive debate in these Houses on the need for a referendum on divorce.  There may be disagreement among the political parties about this but we must examine the statistics and the misery caused by marital breakdown. There are 75,000 people in a situation of marital breakdown and 55,000 of them believe their situation to be irretrievable; they have stated that their marriages cannot be saved.  That alone is reason enough to put a divorce referendum to the people.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill because it tries to set out in legislative form a guarantee of entitlements under the social welfare code.  I agree with the Minister that it does not facilitate an overhaul of the social welfare code.  However, it is slightly opaque.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said &ldquo;clarity and security&rdquo; were very important.  The Bill is far from clear.  The average person would be confused reading the explanatory memorandum, although the Bill is very short.  We recognise the social welfare <Col N="719" /> code is intricate and complicated.  This is the Minister's opportunity to ensure this Bill is clear and concise so that those relying on social welfare, who will be voting in a divorce referendum, will know for what they are voting. However, this Bill has failed in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said the implementation of the entitlements in this Bill will only cost a couple of million pounds extra over the coming years.  I challenge him on that point; a lot more money will have to be provided to ensure the Bill's implementation and the Minister is aware that it is hard to come by extra money at Cabinet.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  That is a myth.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to score political points as this Bill is above that, but if there is no financial backing for this legislation people will be very concerned. That is what happened in 1986. I appeal to the Minister to give a legislative guarantee of funding so that the entitlements in the Bill which will become law when we have passed it &mdash; with my humble amendments &mdash; will be safeguarded.</P>
      <P>The people who will adjudicate on this Bill prior to voting in the divorce referendum will be those receiving social welfare payments at present.  That is a point not to be missed.  Those receiving social welfare payments and who are in a situation of marital breakdown will sift through this legislation to see where they will stand in the event of divorce being introduced.  Those who are not receiving social welfare payments will not be overly concerned, although they may find themselves dependent on social welfare payments in the future.  It is a failing in the Bill, the Minister and his Department not to have pointed that out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary purpose of the Articles in the Constitution which deal with the protection of the family is just that, the protection of the family.  If the divorce <Col N="720" /> referendum is carried and a change is made to the Constitution, this legislation will ensure that a new family that might be created after a divorce has equal entitlements.  I will be raising this point again on Committee Stage.  The Bill does not seem to take that further step.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not have the broad consensus we thought it might, especially under the present Minister who had been an enlightened voice on many of these issues over a number of years in Opposition.  This Bill is confined in its thrust.  I am concerned this will create difficulty among those who find themselves in a situation of marital breakdown and are receiving social welfare payments; as I said, this Bill will not concern everybody who is in a situation of marital breakdown.</P>
    <P>The Bill lacks financial backing for what it is trying to achieve.  I scored political points on the debate on the Social Welfare Act, 1995, with regard to the 2.5 per cent increase in social welfare payments.  Does the Minister's paltry 2.5 per cent increase allay the fears of those receiving social welfare payments who will depend on this Bill to safeguard their entitlements?  If we are to support the referendum and encourage people to vote, we have to put our money where our mouths are.  The Minister fails to do that even though he says the Bill will provide &ldquo;clarity and security&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Certain elements of the Bill are not clear; that point was made in the Dáil by many Deputies.  Certain sections of the Bill deal with adult dependants.  We had hoped such designations would be removed in this Bill to ensure everybody would be aware of their entitlements. Any person over 18 years of age should not be called an &ldquo;adult dependant&rdquo;. I made this point on the last Social Welfare Bill and when my party colleague, Deputy Woods, was Minister for Social Welfare.  Such wording should be removed from legislation.  One is either an adult or a dependant, but it is hard to see how one can be a dependant as an adult.  Changing such small elements would make the Bill more attractive and <Col N="721" /> would ensure that those with whom it deals would support it.</P>
    <P>I welcome some elements of the Bill but they have not gone far enough.  Will the Minister clarify the provision for unemployment assistance for seasonal workers?  He said the provision related to tourism and Bord na Móna.  Will it be at the Minister's discretion to point out which areas will be covered under this section?  The dairy industry would have a large number of seasonal workers. The Social Welfare Act, 1995, contains provisions for share fishermen.  Would it not be possible to include any form of seasonal work?  Will it be up to the Minister to decide who is covered by this section?</P>
    <P>The Bill largely succeeds in meeting its objectives in terms of the existing social welfare code.  It confirms the approach adopted by the previous two Fianna Fáil led Governments.  The Minister, Deputy de Rossa, does not like to acknowledge that fact but it has been acknowledged by many others. The White Paper on marital breakdown was attacked by the parties now in Government when they were in Opposition but it contained, in essence, the thrust of this debate.</P>

      <P>I requested an answer from the Minister in this sitting, not on this Stage.  I unreservedly apologise but it is good to receive clarification to ensure that I am on the right path.  I am correct in the sense that the Bill when implemented will place a larger burden on the Exchequer than the Minister anticipates.  The experience of other European countries with similar societies in terms of the emergence of new family structures, such as an increasing number of lone parent families, shows an extra burden will be placed on the Exchequer.  However, the Minister seems unaware of this point when he says it will cost £200,000 a year and up to £1 million in the fifth year.</P>
      <P>Many people put on a brave face for society but they would apply for a divorce if the referendum was passed. These people have not been taken into account.  In his reply perhaps the Minister could clarify the Government's predictions of the number of people in this situation, given that the Minister said it will cost £1 million in the fifth year to implement this legislation.</P>
      <P>The Bill largely succeeds in meeting the objectives and terms of the existing social welfare code.  However, if this legislation is to be implemented by the end of the year in an effort to pave the way for a divorce referendum, will the Minister indicate his Department's predictions regarding the overall burden which will placed on his Department by this legislation and the referendum if it is passed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare will inevitably bear the brunt of the changes brought about if the referendum is accepted.  Has the Minister taken this into account?  Will I be arguing next year that social welfare <Col N="723" /> increases of 1.5 per cent or 2.5 per cent are paltry?  I fear insufficient resources have been allocated to this matter and that money will be taken from other areas to implement the legislation.</P>
    <P>This legislation is fine if the intention is to give old age pensioners an extra 20p a day.  By bringing forward the date of payment, the Minister said it would be worth an extra £9 a year.  This works out at approximately 22p a day.  I am concerned about these aspects.  Has the Minister discussed with his officials the burden which will be placed on his Department by the passage of this Bill?</P>
    <P>I am sure an extra burden will be placed on it, given the experience of other European countries, the fact that the family structure is changing and that people are, unfortunately, becoming more dependent on social welfare.  It is inevitable that those in marital breakdowns will start drawing social security following the passage of this legislation. This could affect hard pressed old age pensioners and those already in receipt of social welfare support and mean that they again only receive an increase of 2.5 per cent.  In my contribution on the Social Welfare Bill I attacked the Minister and pointed out that this was a miserly amount.  The Minister agreed 20p a day was an insufficient amount to give to anybody.  Many Senators agreed with me.</P>

We support the broad thrust of the Bill, although its explanatory memorandum lacks clarity.  Unfortunately, there is also a lack commitment on the Minister's part to provide sound economic support to those who may find themselves in the circumstances covered by the Bill, such as a person in receipt of social welfare.  I want those fears allayed by the Minister prior to a divorce referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1986 people were afraid of the unknown; they were unsure about their entitlements and property rights.  I have <Col N="726" /> a fear in relation to this Bill, which is held in the community.

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the Bill and I welcome his statement with regard to the <i>Irish Press</i> workers.  It is a sad reflection that some people in the <i>Irish Press</i> are not entitled to the same benefits as others.  There are approximately 600 employees involved but a different structure seems to apply-to the 180 journalists.  The Minister's statement is welcome and he should be congratulated.  Even if they are not entitled to unemployment benefit are they not entitled to supplementary benefit?  They should have been told that they are entitled to these benefits immediately if they are not in receipt of other benefits.  They are entitled to supplementary benefit and it is unfair that they were not told that.  Everybody seemed to give the impression that everybody was right and nobody was wrong.  It is a sad reflection on us as a society that we have so many structures in labour relations yet we do not have a structure whereby people can get benefits when in need.</P>

      <P>This Bill does not put the cart before the horse.  The reports from the other House show that the Opposition is giving the impression that this Bill puts the cart before the horse.  The <Col N="727" /> Bill consolidates exactly what benefits people are entitled to if they are divorced or deserted.  They will retain the benefits they already have if they are deserted.  It is the most simple social welfare Bill I have ever seen before the House.  It simplifies matters.  For many years I have sought such a Bill.  The former Minister, Deputy Woods, was prepared to simplify the legislation. However, the present Minister said he wants to simplify the legislation even more.  He wants each person's benefits to be recognised.  The quicker the Oireachtas comes around to that way of thinking the sooner all the people will know to which benefits they are entitled.</P>
      <P>The Minister admits that it will take time.  He referred to pensions for homemakers and said he would like to see the process of &ldquo;individualisation&rdquo; accelerated. That is an important development. Many sections in this Bill help people to define their exact entitlements.  Let us not give the impression that enough is not being done; indeed, enough is never done for the less well-off in our society. However, £4.2 billion will be spent this year.  A total of £4 billion was spent last year and about £3.8 billion the year before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>That is because more people are unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>Irrespective of who is in Government, we as a society will spend about £4.5 billion a year on welfare within two years.  That is more than we spend on education.  It is a sad reflection on us but it is a fact of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most important aspect of this Bill is that, for once, it is not putting the cart before the horse.  I welcome that and I congratulate the Department on how it drafted the Bill.  It ensures that the benefits available to deserted people will also be available to divorced people.  A deserted person is not a divorced person.  It is not easy for me to say there is a need for divorce.  However, it is a sad reflection on our society that <Col N="728" /> there is such a need.  There is no doubt that the third biggest problem in society is marital breakdown.  I, like every Member of the House, am aware of that.  I see a great deal of the problem in my constituency.  It is a sad fact but we must accept it.</P>
    <P>Whether we are doing enough to protect the family structure is another question. Are we doing enough?  Are we trying to create a better atmosphere to ensure that the family and both spouses are well protected?  For a long time there has been the strong impression &mdash; which still prevails &mdash; that there is not enough protection provided for the woman.  That is true.  In last year's and this year's Social Welfare Bills extra benefits were given to mothers for the children.  That is an important development. While only 2.5 per cent is given to everybody else, enormous extra benefits were given to people with children. Nobody has recognised the fact that the person minding the children in the home has received the extra benefits.</P>
    <P>The Opposition is arguing that the 2.5 per cent is not enough.  Of course, it is not enough.  Everybody, including the Minister, has said it is not enough.  If I were on the Opposition benches I would say the same.  However, the annual amounts paid over the years were decreased by being postponed to the middle of July; initially they were paid at the end of April but they were postponed to the end of July by other Governments.  They have now been brought forward by six weeks and I hope they can be brought forward another month next year.  That is where we see the benefits to these recipients. As we speak these people have received their increases.  They probably would not have received them by now if another Government were in power. However, I still admit that 2.5 per cent is not enough.</P>
    <P>We should be seen to be doing more to hold the family unit together.  The question of how we do that is important. Unemployment is our largest problem; crime is our second largest problem and our third is marital breakdown.  Why? <Col N="729" /> Why has marital breakdown become so prevalent over the last 20 years?</P>
    <P>It has become a political issue and some people have gained enormously, from a political point of view, from this issue.  Unfortunately people are looking for opportunities to say they want nothing more to do with marriage.  That is very sad.  Is it because they do not want to be involved?  Is it because there is no longer recognition of the family?  Is it because they are not receiving proper recognition for having children?  The family unit is the backbone of society and it must be protected.  Part of the Department's £4.2 billion must be used for this purpose.  I would expect everybody in this House to agree with me because, irrespective of where we sit in this House, we must protect the family unit.</P>
    <P>This Bill, unfortunately, is selling divorce &mdash; I wish we did not have to do that &mdash; to protect people who cannot protect themselves.  Therefore, I welcome the Bill.  I do not welcome the content but I must admit it is a fact of life.  I am reluctant to say it but we appear to be doing everything possible to undermine the main unit &mdash; the family, mother, father and children.  That is very sad.</P>
    <P>However, that issue is not relevant to the Department of Social Welfare.  Its job is to look after people who cannot look after themselves.  It does that quite well, and particularly so in the case of our elders.  Nobody can deny that our elders are well protected in comparison with their counterparts in other nations but they are not protected from loneliness or being left alone.  The Department of Social Welfare can help by sending people to look after the elderly and so forth but it cannot prevent people being left alone.  However, we can honestly say that our old age pensioners and our elders on social welfare are well looked after.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Department of Social Welfare is helping people in a way we had never envisaged &mdash; by way of supplementary benefit at a cost of £43 million last year, through extra <Col N="730" /> housing and through the Department of Health.  The Bill protects the people who have been given the impression that they will not get benefits.  Senator Kelleher said that such an impression might be created and, in many ways, he is probably right.  Let us not do that anymore. Let us not be false or political about an issue where a family is being divided.  It is not an easy decision so let nobody give the impression that these people are not going to get benefits.  The Bill says they are.  The Minister spoke of a cost of £1 million over five years.  I have, in my own small way, looked at where the £1 million could be spent and I can only see one extra way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>What does that cost &mdash; about £660,000 a year?  The £1 million over a five year period is roughly £300,000 over two years.  For instance, if a divorced person died and left two spouses &mdash; under the Bill one would be a survivor and the other would be a former spouse &mdash; the former spouse has to be paid the same benefits as the survivor. Let us presume there is a rush to leave the family home or to divorce &mdash; I hope there is not.  We could have a situation where, over a year, a thousand of those would die and the benefit for the second spouse would have to be paid. That is all, no more than would have to be paid to any other person.  That is the point.  I cannot see any need for a hangup about where the extra money would come from.  I read the Dáil debate on this issue and I would like the Opposition to explain to me and to the Minister &mdash; it is important that it be explained &mdash; where they see so much money is needed.  No figure was put on it, so let us not give the impression that there is going to be a big worry about the provision of money.  If we can provide £4.2 billion a year for social welfare, we can surely come up with an extra £2 million a year, if it goes to that. We will make sure &mdash; and the Bill will <Col N="731" /> make sure and says so &mdash; that the person who survives is looked after.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill states it, so it will not be by the Minister.  When the Bill goes through this House, it will soon become law.  That is a fact, so when we are discussing the question of divorce in October or November, we can show that provision.  Everybody has the right to that information, in particular people on welfare.  Let us not knock people in the lower category of society; we have been doing it for too long.  We are giving an impression &mdash; and we did it during the last referendum &mdash; that deserted wives would lose their benefits.  A deserted wife remains a deserted wife; she does not become a divorced person. She can claim all the benefits to which a deserted wife is entitled.</P>
      <P>I would like to emphasise &mdash; and the Bill does not do this &mdash; that the Minister or his successors must, in the future, make sure that everybody has the same entitlements.  When the legislation is simplified, everybody will be entitled to the same benefits, whether separated, deserted or a lone parent.  Everybody should get the same benefit.  How can we say that a person over 80 years of age is entitled to more money than a person of 79?  That happens and I do not understand why.  I would like to simplify things, and this is being done slowly but surely.  About five years ago, there were 32 ways of paying child benefit, now there are eight or ten.  All children should get the same benefit; that is what I would like to see happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly happy with section 9 of the Bill.  The Attorney General has made clear &mdash; and long arguments were made about this in the other House &mdash; the definitions of spouse, the next spouse and the other partner.  Section 3 makes that equally clear.  We must protect everybody.  I welcome the Bill which recognises in every way every type of benefit.  I congratulate the Minister for that.  I also congratulate the <Col N="732" /> Department for ensuring that, at long last, we are getting to a stage of simplifying things.  I say that because I am a simple person and I want to see the social welfare code simplified.  I have always said that.  I do not know why Senator O'Toole is laughing.</P>

      <P>This is an area we need to simplify; this is an area where we should be telling people who are busy, particularly women in the home, who want to stay in the home and who are looking after the children, what their benefits are, and that this Bill shows them.  This Bill states that and I welcome it.</P>
      <P>Senator Kelleher asked when we are going to come to the real argument on divorce.  The real argument on divorce for people outside of the social welfare system will be a long and strenuous one &mdash; property rights, money rights, equal rights &mdash; and is not going to be easy to resolve.  In all honesty, this Bill is much easier to discuss, debate and argue.  In looking at this legislation, we can say that we, the people and the taxpayers, will be paying.  The Department will be paying these benefits on behalf of the taxpayer as the Bill states.  We will define that every year.  The person who is unfortunately on social welfare or any sort of benefit, man or woman, lone or deserted parent, deserted spouse or unmarried person, widow or widower, is now better protected legally because of this Bill.  It creates a situation where we say they are entitled to certain things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the opportunity to say again that this Bill is consolidating the system. We may not be going far enough and consolidating everything, but this Bill is consolidating by telling the person in the less well off categories of society not to have any worries about marital breakdown.  This Bill tells them we will protect them.  I welcome the Bill and I know that, on Committee Stage, the Minister will expand on points made.  I have no strong argument against other <Col N="733" /> benefits and increased benefits should be given; I have pushed for these for many years.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister and I hope the extra benefits will go, most importantly, to the less well off.</P>

This societal change requires that we prepare for it and that the social welfare system reflects that change.</P>
      <P>I am particularly delighted that the Minister has highlighted the needs of spouses and children in this Bill.  I have become increasingly concerned that, in the quasi-debate that is taking place in certain quarters about divorce, it seems to be that the conservative reactionary right wingers in society have taken unto themselves &mdash; or given the impression abroad &mdash; that they are the only ones who care about the children.  The Government in its public utterances on societal change and divorce should be seen to put that issue to the fore.  I know from speaking to individual Ministers that they hold that opinion.  It is perfectly correct, responsible and in line with the policies of all political parties for children to be seen as the paramount consideration and responsibility of all of us in legislating for changes in family units, patterns and lifestyles.  As an Independent I may differ with the Government over the final details of legislation, but I would hate to see the Government presented as not caring about the needs of children, in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As an educationalist, I welcome the consideration given to support for the rights of children and unwaged spouses. It effectively anticipates the forthcoming legislation and deals with one part of the debate.  People might continue to have differences of opinion over it but at least it has been addressed and legislated for and the position is <Col N="734" /> clearly understood.  That has to be welcomed and I compliment the Minister and his advisers.  Sometimes Ministers are not quite so trustworthy on issues such as PRSI but they are particularly good on this issue.</P>
    <P>On the question of dependants and cohabitants, it has been put to me quite strongly by a number of sources that the Bill should include a specific reference to and definition of the term &ldquo;cohabitant&rdquo;. Considering the linguistic difficulties with defining &ldquo;husband&rdquo;, &ldquo;wife&rdquo;, &ldquo;spouse&rdquo;, &ldquo;dependant&rdquo; and so on, I would hate to see what the Minister might do with a definition of &ldquo;cohabitee&rdquo;. I suspect it would take another ten pages in the Bill.  I know I am a husband because I got married, but the convoluted language of the definition in the Bill would make me unsure that I am.  I presume in good faith that the definitions of &ldquo;husband&rdquo;, &ldquo;widow&rdquo;, &ldquo;wife&rdquo; and so on describe what they purport to describe.</P>
    <P>To try to deal with the question of cohabitees would have weakened the Bill.  The Minister's explanation that dependency is not a question of a put down or of being demeaning but one of practicalities was clearly articulated.  I am delighted the Minister has grasped the nettle because too often I have seen Ministers being too responsive to political correctness which, in effect, reduces entitlements in practical terms.  I am happy with the term &ldquo;dependant&rdquo; because I know what is meant by it and that any change in that would have implications for other areas and could leave people worse off.</P>
    <P>I know it is not appropriate for a spouse's right to a contributory superannuated scheme to be included in the Bill, but it will be a very difficult issue for the Minister's colleagues to deal with, particularly the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, with whom I have raised it on a number of occasions.  It is interesting to note the approach the Minister has taken in this legislation which applies to all those covered by the definition.  The same question will apply with regard to <Col N="735" /> the cohabitees, spouses or dependants of contributors to a contributory superannuation fund.  The event of two surviving spouses or partners would present great difficulties.</P>
    <P>I am a trustee of a pension fund &mdash; and I have another interest in pensions &mdash; which puts me in a very difficult position where it may not be possible to meet the stated, written and signed desires of a contributor who says he would like, in the event of his death, for the payment to be made to person A. However, person B, whom the trustees of the fund might not have known existed, might have a rightful claim to that payment.  I do not know how to deal with that and I am glad I have not been faced with having to make that decision.  The sooner that matter is addressed the better.  Perhaps it will have to be determined on the basis of the ratio of years of partnership.</P>
    <P>However, this legislation at least lays the ground and establishes that both spouses or partners have an entitlement. That is a very important principle for dealing with the next, more difficult issue of property which was raised by the previous speaker.  I do not purport to know the answers.  If I was asked to judge I would do so simply on the ratio of the years people spent together as partners.  However, that may not be fair either.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation because it begins to address these tortuous subjects. It is important for the Government to be seen to start tidying this matter up and to take one step at a time so that people can be reassured.  Reassurance is the most critical issue we face in the forthcoming debate on divorce.  The legislation should be seen as a response which will address and resolve problems in society.</P>
    <P>For practical, political and PR reasons, the Government should reflect its deeply held views that the needs of children should be to the front in any divorce legislation.  I am increasingly concerned that those who are anti-divorce present divorce as the idea of those who are anti-children. <Col N="736" /> Those of us dealing with children on a daily basis know that the children of a bad marriage will be as damaged as the children of a &ldquo;bad&rdquo; divorce. The introduction of divorce will not create that problem.  We, as legislators, must be seen to put children first in this issue &mdash; I know that it is like teaching my grandmother to suck eggs but it needs to be said.  I congratulate the Minister and his Department on making a reassuring start on that issue.  There are issues in the Bill with which I disagree but I welcome its general thrust.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I support the Bill which provides the necessary changes in our social welfare code to ensure that no spouse will be disadvantaged as a result of changes in marital or legal status.  The electorate voted in favour of joining the EC &mdash; now the European Union &mdash; participation in the Single Market and the Maastricht Treaty.  This means that our laws must be aligned with European laws.  Our officials and representatives in Brussels look after our country's interests and it is logical to conclude that if we do not voluntarily bring our legislation into line with Europe, we will be obliged to do so.</P>
      <P>This Bill is a necessary legislative measure in advance of the forthcoming referendum on divorce.  It provides the necessary code to ensure that no spouse will be disadvantaged in terms of social welfare entitlements resulting from a change in legal or marital status, from married to separated, divorced or deserted.</P>
      <P>The main benefit provided for in the Bill is a survivor's pension, which grants entitlements to divorced persons on the death of their former spouses provided they are not cohabiting or remarried.  A divorced woman, who does not qualify for a survivor's pension on the death of her former husband, now qualifies for a widow's non-contributory pension. Death benefit will now be extended to include divorced survivors of the deceased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="737" /> Prior to the divorce referendum in 1986, the main question concerned payments to deserted wives.  While the level of desertion in 1986 was lower than it is now, it was on the increase.  Under the terms of the Bill a deserted wife who is divorced may continue to be regarded as deserted for the purposes of deserted wife's benefit.  This is welcome and will discourage propaganda on the issue, which was a feature of the 1986 referendum. Since 1986 that category of social welfare recipient has increased substantially.</P>
    <P>The number of women receiving prisoner's wife's allowances has increased substantially because of the increase in crime.  The Bill provides for continued entitlement to prisoner's wife's allowance when a recipient becomes divorced. It entitles a divorced woman, whose former husband is in prison, to receive this allowance which will be welcomed by women in those disastrous circumstances.</P>
    <P>The lone parent's allowance is adequately covered in the Bill, which extends the definition of lone parents for the purpose of this allowance to include a divorced parent.  This is a clever move because it will cover a number of circumstances in that category. The Bill extends the definition of an adult dependant to include a divorced person and provides for the powers under which a person may receive more than one increase in respect of an adult dependant.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, and the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa on a good team effort on this Bill.  It will be the rock on which the referendum will be won and its measures will help the unfortunate men and women facing divorce.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 11 which deals with seasonal workers.  Having met the Minister, with colleagues from the midlands, on the question of Bord na Móna seasonal workers, I congratulate him on the action taken.</P>

      <P>This is relevant to the Bill because old age pensions are paid by the Department of Social Welfare.  Elderly people believe that in a few years pensions will not be paid and that they will die as paupers as old people did in the 1800s.  This is how alarming the Minister's statement is.  I ask him to use the House to correct it because many pensioners were greatly worried when they read that article.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="739" /> I always find myself agreeing with my friend, Senator Cregan.  Are we doing enough to keep families together?  The family is an important part of society and we are not doing enough to keep it together; I said this when other Ministers were in office, including Ministers from my party, and I am saying it again.</P>
    <P>This is a divorce Bill.  I do not quibble with this but we should not expect to win the referendum hands down because I do not think we will.  I am glad the issue of divorce is being put to the people but I hope it is put to them in simple language which will require a simple &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; and not in language which will subsequently require clarification from the High Court and the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>From reading newspapers every day we can see who is in trouble with the law, children from broken homes and families and from bad marriages.  We are doing nothing to help people in bad marriages.  Alcohol and drug abuse and unemployment are the reasons marriages break down.</P>
    <P>For many years I have said that women should be able to work if they wish but that no woman should have to work because of necessity.  A large proportion of women who work do so from sheer necessity.  Our tax system is bad. We should give money to the woman in the home to help her stay at home and rear her family.</P>
    <P>Houses cost a large amount of money but we give a paltry £2,000 grant.  When I built a house in 1954 I was given 50 per cent of its cost, that was the practice then.  At that time people were given £500 and they could build houses for £1,000.  If people were given grants of £1,500 to build houses, there would be far less pressure on local authorities to build houses and on families.  Because of the amounts deducted from their pay-packets, husbands and wives are not able to survive.  They cannot pay their bills and have to deal with sheriffs.  We should do surveys on why marriages break down.  I have mentioned the three main causes for this and we should do <Col N="740" /> research to try to solve and eliminate these problems.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to hear the Minister say that social welfare will become more work friendly.  Why could he not have done this first?  We used to have a good welfare system whereby if somebody acquired 26 stamps during the summer they received double the amount of dole payments during the winter.  This encouraged them to work and it is amazing how many of them found jobs. Today we are giving people no encouragement to work.</P>
    <P>There would be no point in me employing someone for a week because I would have to become registered for PRSI.  There could be between ten and 20 other people who would also want to employ people for a week but, because they would have to become registered for PRSI, would not do so and leave the work undone.  There used to be a simple form on which people put Xs for the days they worked and Os for the days they did not.  We introduced systems and computerisation which have destroyed society.  We should go back to simple procedures.  When people completed these forms they were paid from employment exchanges for the days they did not work and paid for the days they worked by those who employed them.  Such people went to the post office to buy stamps and did not mind if they cost £30 or £40.  People do not want to become entangled with the Revenue Commissioners and PRSI when they want to employ people for a week or a fortnight.  The amount of red tape which registration involves is far too great.</P>
    <P>The FÁS schemes do a great job, but why do we not increase their number and take more people off social welfare? There was much unemployment when I was a rate collector in the early 1950s and 1960s.  The rates charged in my area was only £3 but people did not want to pay.  However, their morale changed once they began working.</P>
    <P>A person who has not drunk alcohol for six years told me there is no such thing as an alcoholic but there is a pub culture and that is the problem.  People <Col N="741" /> meet their friends in the pubs and it soon ends up as being the only place where one can get a sympathetic ear. That person found it far harder to get out of the pub culture than to stop drinking.  We should get people out of the dole culture and dole mentality and put more money towards schemes.  If young people got the opportunity to work in a job, even if only involved sweeping floors from 8 a.m to 6 p.m., they would go home and get a good night's sleep.  They would not be standing at the street corners, congregating in a wrong atmosphere and culture and would not get hooked up so easily with drugs and drink.  Why are we doing nothing in that regard?  Why is it that we can find millions of pounds to hand out for nothing and cannot find money to pay people to work?  It is well known that if young people who went to England got work as soon as they arrived, they were a success, but if they spent a fortnight or a month going around the pubs looking for a job, they went down the slide and never got off it.</P>
    <P>We are breaking up the family.  A young person living at home gets around £12 a week.  If that same person rents a flat in a town, they will get £70 a week and an extra £25 from the local health board.  We are encouraging them to leave their families.  Why are all our laws designed to break up the family? Why can we not encourage the Government to spend money on research into keeping families together?  These problems would occur to a far lesser degree if we did that.  Why do we not help the people with shared loans?  These loans are a great help and are enabling families to buy houses at much cheaper prices.  Why do we not encourage that to a greater extent?</P>
    <P>Padraig Flynn brought out a housing scheme when he was Minister for the Environment and was criticised for giving houses away for next to nothing. However, those houses have their own individuality.  They are all beautifully painted and their gardens are well tended.  The people who own these <Col N="742" /> houses have great pride in them.  One can see this huge change in both sides of Dublin.  Why can we not give this sort of encouragement to more people?</P>
    <P>We should be getting to the root cause of why we want divorce and why marriages break down.  I was married for 33 years and remarried after the death of my first wife.  I have been married for two years and have been happy in both cases.  I have seen couples who were happy when they were courting, but their marriage was put under strain by pressure.  A husband comes home to get his dinner but has to cook it himself and children come home to an empty house.  Thank God we grew up in poorer days.  When I came home, at least I knew there was a pot of spuds boiling over a burning fire, if nothing else.  We have lost that, which is one reason why our society is breaking down.  We are not coming to grips with that situation.</P>
    <P>We should not be quick to push this type of legislation through.  Every Bill that comes into this House costs millions of pounds.  The late Luke Corridan once told me, &ldquo;Your crowd and our crowd are borrowing, but the bubble will burst some day&rdquo;.  He was right and some day there will be a revolution in this country.</P>
    <P>Some 80 per cent of everything a person earns goes on taxes.  That figure is only 60 per cent in England.  We must give people some freedom to have and to spend money.  We must also give assistance to marriages to help them to survive and ensure that families are kept together.  We are not doing it in either housing or social welfare at present, but do not seem to mind what lengths we go to in giving people money after their marriage breaks up.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to think about what I have said and put more money into job creation.  There is no local authority that could not take on a few hundred people to do useful work.  I appeal to the Minister to think of the family and not to go overboard on divorce legislation.  It is not yet a reality.  If we put the same amount of work into keeping families together as we are doing in trying to <Col N="743" /> break them up, we would have a good country.  I also appeal to the Minister to respond to the headline I saw recently in a newspaper saying that old age pensioners may not be able to get their pensions in a few years time.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  This is the first opportunity I have had to congratulate him on his appointment.  I wish the Minister well in his difficult portfolio.  The Department of Social Welfare is a huge Department involving large public expenditure with constant demands from all of us for more money.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, which provides for changes in the social welfare code to ensure that no spouse will be disadvantaged in terms of his or her social welfare entitlements as a result of changes in their legal status from married, separated or deserted to divorced.  It also extends entitlement to widow's and widower's contributory pension, occupational injury benefit, lone parent's allowance, family income supplements and prisoner's wife's allowances to people who might be divorced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept this is one step in addressing these issues which have to be dealt with before we have the referendum on divorce and as such I welcome it.  Many people, especially women, had fears at the time of the last divorce referendum about money and their entitlements <Col N="744" /> should divorce become legal in this country and this caused great concern. Many women are financially dependent. This is not acceptable but it is a reality which has to be addressed.  This was a major concern to women and I hope the changes that will be introduced in this Bill, together with further changes through reform of the social welfare system and the other legislation that is being brought before us, will address some of these concerns.</P>
    <P>Marriages break down in this country and, even without the legal formality of divorce, that number is increasing.  I do not accept the scaremongering tactics being used by some people that divorce will impoverish many people, particularly women.  Marital breakdown creates that situation and we already have that.  The cost of marital breakdown is already borne by the Exchequer for those on social welfare or receiving lone parent's allowance or deserted wife's benefit.  I do not accept, therefore, the scaremongering tactics used by many people who say we cannot afford it.  I accept the Minister's statement that the costs will not be great.</P>
    <P>It is essential that women whose marriages break down but who are not entitled to social welfare benefits because they have a family income, and children in particular, get their fair share of entitlements.  Children who are victims of marital breakdown must be protected and given care and counselling. We must reassure people that this will happen.  Otherwise, people will be scared when the time comes to vote in the divorce referendum.  The Progressive Democrats support the Government in its wish to hold a referendum, although we may not agree with everything the Government is doing. We also support the introduction of divorce.</P>
    <P>This Bill extends social welfare benefits to certain people who may find themselves in a different legal situation as a result of being divorced.  It also gives us an opportunity to discuss the social welfare system with the Minister, who does not often come into this <Col N="745" /> House.  The Minister said he refuted criticism that the Bill was seeking to perpetrate and extend the concept of dependency and the practice of treating women as dependants of the social welfare code.  Senator O'Toole agreed with the Minister.  I support the Minister's view that he would like the practice of individualisation accelerated, but that it would involve major restructuring of the social welfare code which would take time.  I hope this will happen during the Minister's term in the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>I have a problem with dependency status because it is mainly women who are considered adult dependants.  Perhaps that is why Senator O'Toole does not share my problem.  Until now, many men did not find themselves in this situation. I am a member of the Second Commission on the Status of Women and one of its recommendations was that the term &ldquo;qualified partner&rdquo; should be substituted for the term &ldquo;dependant&rdquo; and that social welfare payments should be divided between the recipient and the qualified partner.  It also recommended that the qualified partner should receive their own allowance book and that the Government should work towards establishing a system of individual rights and payments in social welfare and social insurance by 1997.  I ask the Minister to consider this in his review of the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>I have a problem with calling women adult dependants.  The State pays a man a certain amount of money because he has a wife or partner.  He would not get such a payment if he did not have a wife or partner.  I cannot understand why the State should reinforce this dependency status and why it cannot move towards a system of individual payments.</P>
    <P>The same question arises as regards pension entitlements.  In this Bill the Minister is extending pension entitlements to former spouses and ensuring that they retain their pension rights. This is acceptable because many men were able to work and build up contributions which gave them entitlements to <Col N="746" /> a pension because their wives stayed at home and looked after the children.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell mentioned that in the past women stayed at home and looked after the children and that everything was rosy in our society.  Many changes took place because women became dependent and they realised that society, while giving them a lot of lip service and telling them in the Constitution and elsewhere that it valued their contributions, did not value them in monetary terms.  Women then decided to become independent and to move into the workforce.  Unfortunately, women are now blamed for many ills in society because they took this step.  I do not accept that.  We did not and do not value the contribution of women who stay at home.  We do not give them entitlements.  I am sure the Minister would like to move towards a system of individual payments and to remove the dependency status of many women who stay at home.  I would like to see this system in operation as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Second Commission on the Status of Women proposed that women in the home should be able to make voluntary contributions which would enable them to build up entitlements in their own right.  It also suggested that a pro rata pension should be paid on the basis of the number of contributions made, as opposed to an average number, which is how it is calculated at present.  Many women who leave the workforce while they rear their children do not have the average number of contributions needed over a number of years to qualify for pensions.  I am moving away from the thrust of the Bill, but we do not have many opportunities to discuss these issues.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill which ensures that spouses and children will not be impoverished or in a worse position than they are at present if divorce is accepted.  The Minister must address the need to prevent people whose marriages have broken down from falling into the poverty trap or becoming part of the social welfare system.  A large proportion <Col N="747" /> of people on social welfare are lone parents, particularly women.  The Minister has introduced changes which allow women on lone parent's allowance to work.  He has also increased the threshold of money they may earn before they lose their entitlements.  I welcome these changes.</P>
    <P>We must try to create a society where fewer people depend on social welfare and where work is available.  Many of the measures we have introduced here and the high taxation rate discourage people from working.  However, the additional benefits which those on social welfare would receive if they had a job would make them reconsider this.  I accept there are not jobs for everyone, but we should try to make it more attractive for people to work.  I am not saying they are better off on the dole, but the differences in some cases are not enough to encourage them to work.</P>
    <P>Maintenance is important.  An effective and efficient means of maintenance must be enforced if divorced families are to be kept out of the poverty trap and are not to become dependent on social welfare.  The Family Law Bill, 1994, and the Civil Legal Aid Bill, 1995, were introduced in this House by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor.  Many women who depend on maintenance from their husbands will be disadvantaged if they divorce. It is extremely difficult for them to force their ex-husbands or separated husbands to declare their incomes.  It is not acceptable that the taxpayer must pick up the tab for all these people. People must face up to their responsibilities. If people get married and have children they should realise that they are responsible for their maintenance. The State will step in when they fail, but it should not be readily accepted that the State will look after everybody as the State cannot afford to do that.  We have a high dependency rate and the thought of that increasing further could scare many people.  While the social welfare system should be there for the people who need it, we must ensure that <Col N="748" /> spouses who can afford to maintain their separated or divorced spouses and children should be made to do so.</P>
    <P>We dealt with private pensions, private property and so on in the Family Law Bill, 1994.  The Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill deals with social welfare pensions and social welfare payments so it is quite narrow.  I accept the necessity to reform the social welfare system and I support the Bill.  It will help reassure people who are concerned about divorce. Will the Minister consider the removal of the &ldquo;adult dependant&rdquo; term and move toward a system where women, who remain in the home for certain periods to look after their families, would be able to accumulate an entitlement to pension rights and benefits in their own right?  Perhaps, a <i>pro rata</i> pension payment can be introduced for them.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister. Opposition Members from both Houses spoke of the cost of these measures.  The explanatory memorandum states that &ldquo;The Bill provides for the necessary changes in the Social Welfare Code so as to ensure that no spouse will be disadvantaged in terms of his or her social welfare entitlements as a result of his or her legal status being changed from married, separated or deserted to divorced&rdquo;. This is commendable.  It is a short and comprehensive Bill and it is easily understood.</P>
      <P>The greatest injustice perpetrated against women was when the previous Government denied them their right to equality payments.  Every other day women were forced to go to legal representatives and sign a confidentiality clause so that they could not tell their mothers, sisters or whoever how much they had received.  The injustice continues to this day because some people feel constrained by these confidentiality clauses forced upon them by the previous Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 5 entitles a divorced woman to a widow's non-contributory pension. If her former spouse dies and they have been divorced, she now qualifies for a <Col N="749" /> non-contributory pension.  Why is it a non-contributory pension if she is recognised as a widow on the death of the spouse who had divorced her?  Is there some need to look at that area?</P>
    <P>Section 11 relieves us of the most archaic law under which people who were employed, or even self-employed, for a period and looked for unemployment assistance, found their previous year's earnings were used against them. The only way out was to apply for supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
    <P>On the subject of the supplementary welfare, will the Minister look at the supplementary welfare code and consider whether we should have a better appeals system to make it easier for people to make their cases directly to an appeals officer?  Advising people that they have the right to an appeal, and giving a name, address and number, is not good enough.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan referred to dependency and spouses and it occurred to me that legislation was enacted to empower the Department of Social Welfare to have an attachment of earnings made against an offending spouse.  The person would get the benefit quickly from the Department and an order would be made, in some instances by the court, for maintenance.  The fact that the spouse could be working is taken into account.  I do not see any evidence of the implementation of this power and I deal with cases often enough to know there is need to examine this area.</P>
    <P>It is a good, well thought out Bill, which will be of great benefit to the people involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa) Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators Kelleher, Cregan, O'Toole, Wall, Farrell, Honan and Sherlock for their contributions to this important debate.  The purpose of this Bill is that in a straightforward way it guarantees and protects the rights of people on social welfare, who find themselves divorced, and their children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am astonished that any Senator cannot see the simplicity and clarity of the explanatory memorandum.  Four paragraphs <Col N="750" /> on page 1 explain clearly and precisely what the Bill proposes to do and the way in which it proposes to do it.  It deals with each section and with what each section proposes to do in respect of changing the law.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to assume that any law can be changed in a simplistic way but we can explain simply, as we have done, what our intention is.  Unfortunately, because the law must ultimately be interpreted by the courts, it must be complex in order to cover all the angles.</P>
    <P>We have a social welfare code that is complex for a variety of reasons.  When it started it was fairly simple and straightforward but because we wanted to protect more people we had to add more sections to it.  I give credit to the Department and the former Minister, Deputy Woods for introducing the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, which intended to bring all the legislation together in one publication for people to read if they needed. However, this is still a legal document which must be carefully put together to ensure that it stands up legally and does the job it is intended to do, which is to protect the interests of people who must come to the Department of Social Welfare to have their needs met.  It will also ensure those who are not entitled to payments do not receive them.</P>
    <P>The remarks about the Bill being opaque and unclear are patent nonsense, as a two minute reading of the explanatory memorandum will demonstrate.  I started this debate with the view that all Members wanted to have a successful referendum and wanted legislation to protect the interests of people on social welfare.  However, having listened to the contributions of some, although not all, the Fianna Fáil spokespersons, their intention is to muddy the waters and create confusion, fear and concern.  That is not helpful.  Everyone wants a calm. rational debate on divorce and muddying the waters will not facilitate that.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to defend specific charges about the Bill and to argue the case, as I have done in relation to <Col N="751" /> dependency, etc.  In the Lower House I took on board amendments from the Opposition parties to clarify our intentions. Although the Attorney General advised me the Bill as it stood was correct, to reassure people even further we accepted those amendments.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelleher spent much time seeking to muddy the waters on the question of costs.  I dealt with this at some length in the Dáil and I will attempt to do so again as briefly as I can.  The two matters being confused are the cost of marital breakdown versus the costs arising to the Department of Social Welfare from divorce.  The Department is already carrying some of the costs of marital breakdown; that is, where a couple whose marriage has ended decide to separate, or a husband deserts the household.  Not every couple who break up receive social welfare but uniquely, we provide a deserted wife's allowance &mdash; no other European country provides that.  Nor does any other country provide a deserted wife's benefit, whereby a spouse can insure against being deserted.  Those costs are already carried by the Department and the Bill guarantees that existing rights and security are protected.</P>
    <P>Remarriage gives rise to an increase in costs.  Specifically, in excess of 90 per cent of the cost arises in widows' and widowers' pensions; where one spouse remarries and subsequently dies, both spouses qualify for a pension.  To take Senator Sherlock's point, that might be a contributory pension if the spouse who died had made sufficient contributions to sustain a contributory pension. In that case, if there is a surviving spouse and a former spouse, both would qualify for the contributory pension.  If they do not qualify for it on the basis of contributions they will qualify for the non-contributory widow's or widower's pension.</P>
    <P>The 1990 CSO statistics showed we have 55,000 separated people in the State; the only figure we have.  We worked on the basis that 75 per cent of those would remarry, although I think <Col N="752" /> that is a high estimate.  As I said in the Dáil, it is a mistake to compare us to England or the United States.  Some Opposition speakers wished to compare rates of divorce and marital breakdown in Ireland and California.  That is unreal. If we are to make comparisons they should be with societies which are broadly similar in religious or family ethos.  Spain is a largely Roman Catholic country where there was no divorce until Franco died and a parliament was elected.  There was a rush to divorce when the law was introduced, because there was a backlog of people whose marriages had already broken down or who were in second relationships and wanted to regularise their position.  The only way they could do so was to get a divorce and remarry.  Since the first five years, there has been a decline in the number of divorces in Spain.  I think, therefore, it is important to look at reality and not to raise unnecessary fears.</P>
    <P>There is also an assumption that as soon as divorce is introduced, anyone who has a marital problem will dash to court to look for a divorce.  People who live in the real world or in a marriage know that is not how it works.  To argue that divorce <i>per se</i> will increase the number of people who will divorce or whose marriages will break down is not to know the real position.  In the vast majority of cases people marry because they love each other and a marriage breaks down because they cease to do so.  Sometimes they stay together even in those circumstances for the children's sake, or for many other reasons.  Some people cannot afford a second home, so they continue to live in the same household as separate, independent people.</P>
    <P>There is already marital breakdown here; the 1990 CSO statistics show that at least 55,000 people are formally separated, as distinct from those whose marriages are, to all intents and purposes, dead but who are still living together for their own legitimate reasons.  I have no doubt that if the CSO statistics were available today they would show that there are probably <Col N="753" /> more than that.  It has been estimated that there are probably around 70,000 separated people &mdash; I am talking about individuals, not couples.  Even taking that figure as the accurate one, one is talking, at most, about a 50 per cent difference between the cost figures I am giving and what they might be if 70,000 is the real figure.</P>
    <P>We are assuming that all these might be involved in claiming social welfare which, of course, they are not.  It depends on how many remarry as well as how many women or men survive their spouse in remarriage and many other factors like that.  Even if we are 50 per cent out, we are talking about £1.5 million in year five and roughly £3 million in year ten.  When one compares that to the actual expenditure on social welfare of £4,200 million this year alone, it is wrong, misleading and creates unnecessary fears to argue that this is an unsustainable burden.  I would appeal to those taking that line to back off because they are not doing any good for the thousands of people crying out for the opportunity to remarry.  They want the opportunity to get divorced so that they can remarry and legitimise their second relationship and the children of that relationship.</P>
    <P>Under our law people can legally separate, obtain annulments, settle their property and do all kinds of things which were not possible in 1986.  Divorce is about giving those people who want it the right to remarry.  This Bill guarantees that in those circumstances people's social welfare rights &mdash; widow's pension, old age pension, occupational injury pension, benefits and death gratuity &mdash; are protected.  That is what this Bill is about.  It is not about reforming the social welfare code, although that is what I want to do.  If we are re-elected at the next general election I will have enough time to do it but that is another day's work.</P>

      <P>If there is not a divorce.</P>
      <P>That is my plea on this question of cost.  It is a mistake to link that with the question of social welfare benefits and their rate of increase.  In any one year the Government of the day, whoever they may be, will decide what social welfare increases they can afford to give. That will depend on how good the economy is, what the buoyancy in tax is like and what it is projected to be in the next three, four or five years.  It is a mistake to link the principle of guaranteeing rights and entitlements with the question of rates of payment.  Let us not confuse the issue by pretending that in some way the State will not be able to sustain widows' pensions or old age pensions simply for a cheap political jibe.</P>
      <P>On the question of old age pensions, Senator Farrell mentioned an article on pensions in yesterday's <i>Irish Independent</i> which arose from an interview I gave to RTE.  Although I did the interview about two weeks ago, it was prerecorded and broadcast on Sunday.</P>
      <P>It is at least the fourth or fifth time that I have addressed the need to plan now for pensions in 20 to 30 years time. I do not know what Senator Farrell is upset about.  The headline on the article runs: &ldquo;Massive pressure on State pensions scheme&rdquo;.  There is a photograph of myself with the caption: &ldquo;Proinsias De Rossa...must plan now&rdquo;.  The article begins as follows:</P>
      <P>The country's ageing population will make the current State pension scheme unsustainable in the long term, Social Welfare Minister, Proinsias de Rossa, warned yesterday. Demand on Exchequer funding for pensions would increase by 200 per cent in the next 40 years as the number of people over 65 was set to rise dramatically, he said.  Problems would arise if changes to cope with the ageing population were not planned now, Mr. de Rossa said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That cannot be taken either as a scare headline or as saying that we cannot sustain old age pensions today.  In any of <Col N="755" /> the interviews I have given to newspapers, radio or television, I have been extremely careful to stress that we have to be careful how we express this view. It is easy to worry old age pensioners&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that their social welfare pension may be cut in some way.  I have been careful to stress that this problem will arise in 20 to 30 years time, but that we must start planning for it now.  It is my intention to start that planning now.  Whether I happen to be here in ten or 20 years time is another matter, but at least it will be said of me that I started the planning process.</P>
      <P>I have already dealt with the seasonal workers issue and I do not want to spend too much time on it.  I gave Bord na Móna and tourism workers as an example of seasonal workers but there are other categories who will be thus classified also.  There is a range of classifications in the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>It is a sign of the times that we no longer have the stereotypical male employee working a 40-hour week, 50 weeks a year.  We have instead a whole range of part-time workers, systematic short-time workers, seasonal workers and others.  All of them have to be accommodated within the social welfare system to ensure that they can move readily from unemployment into employment or education because that is the way the future requires us to go.</P>
      <P>One of my priorities is to create a situation where receipt of social welfare payments is not seen as a shame but something that assists people at various points in their lives to go into education, work or stay in the home to rear children, whether the recipients are men or women.  We may not be able to do these things overnight but they need to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="756" /> Senator Honan raised the question of pensions for women in the home.  My predecessor introduced a system, recommended by the Commission on the Status of Women, whereby women working full time in the home could make their own contributions to build up personal entitlements to pensions. Under the arrangements introduced originally, periods spent working in the home caring for children up to age six or for an incapacitated person are disregarded in determining entitlement to old age contributory pensions.  Up to 20 years spent working in the home may be disregarded under those provisions.  I propose to introduce a number of improvements in these provisions including extending the scope of these arrangements to include those caring for children up to the age of 12.  These measures will be included in the third Social Welfare Bill which I will be introducing later this year.</P>
    <P>The concept of adult dependency is just as unacceptable to me as it is to Senator Honan and other Members.  It would have been relatively easy for me to substitute the phrase &ldquo;qualified partners&rdquo; but it would not change the status of the dependant.  People would still be dependent in the sense that they would be required &mdash; in many cases, though not in all &mdash; to depend on their partners' social welfare PRSI contributions.  I want to reach a position where people can qualify in their own right, so that when the term &ldquo;qualified partner&rdquo; is applied it actually does imply partnership and equality in terms of the amount of money each would receive.</P>
    <P>There would be serious political problems involved in combining the main and adult rates and splitting them down the middle, and that is the only non-cost basis on which it could be done.  If I introduced the concept of qualified partner in this Bill and raised the adult dependant's allowance to the main rate, it would cost £200 million a year, for which I would get little thanks from certain quarters in the House.  Nevertheless, it is an objective towards which we should aim.  At the moment we work on <Col N="757" /> the basis of the adult dependant's rate being 60 per cent of the main rate.  It is my intention to close that gap, but I cannot give an undertaking as to how quickly that can be done as it depends on many other factors, including negotiating skills.</P>
    <P>I made the point time and time again that the 2.5 per cent should not be confused with this Bill.  There was an important point in the recent social welfare budget which has a bearing on divorce, particularly given the concerns people have expressed about care for children.  I increased child benefit by 35 per cent which will be retained by the parent caring for the children, in the vast majority of cases that is women.  It is a real increase and will be not be clawed back through tax or differential rates.</P>

      <P>It is not clawed back.  It is an attempt to tackle the issue of poverty in families with children and has a real bearing on the issue of separated spouses.  Most of the separated people I know depend to a significant extent on child benefit to make ends meet.</P>
      <P>I dealt with the <i>Irish Press</i> but there is one other small point.  People who were refused unemployment benefit or assistance, because they had initiated a dispute with their employer, were informed immediately of their entitlements under supplementary welfare allowance.  People involved in the dispute are not entitled to supplementary welfare allowance but any dependants, spouses or children may be depending on their means and so on.  I have no doubt that a number of the <i>Irish Press</i> journalists may be in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a perception that unemployment accounts for most of our social welfare expenditure; of course, that is not the truth.  Some 28 per cent of what we spend on social welfare goes to people on old age pensions; 28 per cent is spent on family income support; and <Col N="758" /> 10 per cent on support for people with illnesses.  Only about 28 per cent goes to those who are unemployed.  More than 70 per cent of social welfare payments go to people who are not unemployed in the strict sense.  These people are in receipt of social welfare because they are old, sick or have families to support. Unemployment accounts for less than 30 per cent of social welfare expenditure. It is also interesting to note &mdash; this is a point in the Department's favour &mdash; that the administrative cost of the Department of Social Welfare is less than 5 per cent, especially when one considers its major job.</P>
    <P>Senator Sherlock mentioned the liable relatives legislation.  Where the Department is paying deserted wife's benefit or lone parent's allowance, it can pursue the father or spouse &mdash; in current circumstances, usually men &mdash; to help defray the cost of the payments to the Department.  That legislation was introduced in 1991 and currently brings in about £1 million.  About £0.5 million of this is made up of payments while, interestingly, the other £0.5 million constitutes savings where claims are dropped because inquiries are made.</P>
    <P>This area must be handled delicately and sensitively.  One does not want to create a situation where a husband, who for whatever reason has left the home, will disappear leaving the spouse and children.  I do not want to be the cause of even greater discord between a husband and wife or in contact between parents and children.  More than half the people we trace do not have sufficient income to make a contribution because they are on social welfare or low pay. Major efforts are being made in this area.</P>
    <P>We have not yet moved into the area of requesting the fathers of children of unmarried mothers to make a contribution because we want to get the system working right.  In Britain they went pell-mell and head first into this area and created untold damage.  One result is that many fathers refuse to allow their names go on birth certificates because they are fearful of being pursued by the <Col N="759" /> Department of Social Services for a contribution towards rearing the child.  We must be careful how we deal with these matters.  The interests of the child are far more important than the few shillings we might pull in as a result of pursuing these matters without the necessary sensitivity.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell asked why we spend so much money on breaking up the family. We do not, I have already indicated that close to 30 per cent of what we spend on social welfare goes on family income support.  Another 28 per cent goes to support for old age and 10 per cent to support for illness while less than 30 per cent goes to support the unemployed.  There is a preponderance of support for the family and keeping people together.</P>
    <P>A matter in the recent budget which was largely ignored was that I increased the minimum unemployment assistance for a single person living at home with parents or brothers and sisters to £25 per week because I am aware of the risk of means testing a younger person.  They may find they are only entitled to £1 or £5 and leave the home to get a flat.  This entails a cost to the social welfare and supplementary welfare allowance systems, and to the family.  That is why I have ensured that where a person qualifies for unemployment assistance when living at home with parents, he will get a minimum of £25 per week.</P>
    <P>I knew of a man in his forties some years ago who lived with old age pensioner parents and was in receipt of £12 per week.  I also knew of a man who lived with a brother who worked and he was in receipt of a very small amount of money.  This change ensures that the very minimum is £25 per week.  These are small reforms but they are useful in terms of tackling the perceptions there are of the Department keeping families together.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with most of the questions raised.  Senator Kelleher raised the question of cost and I have dealt with that.  I agree with Senator Cregan about the need to continue simplifying the <Col N="760" /> code in so far as we can.  There is always a tension between simplification and coverage.  In order to cover as many categories as possible and ensure that nobody falls through the net it is necessary to provide as much detail as possible. Even with all that detail, the system does not always work.  The simplest system would be to pay everyone, whether unemployed or sick, a flat rate of, say, £50 for the claimant and £10 for each child.  That is simple but it would cost about £20 billion per year instead of £4 billion because there would be simply no controls on it.  There is always a dilemma between the need for simplicity and the need for coverage.  Having said that, I am not closed to the view that the rates of pay and qualification criteria and means testing for some schemes need to be looked at.  There is a possibility of some standardisation which would result in some savings, perhaps in administration.  The Department's investment in computerisation and the extent to which we continue to invest in computerisation assists that.  I thank the Senators for their contributions.</P>
    <P>If we are, as I hope we will be, successful in the divorce referendum, this legislation will provide security to many thousands of people who in 1986 felt they would be insecure in a situation where divorce existed.  For that reason I am enthusiastic about this legislation.  It is straightforward and clear and it is worth having in advance of the divorce referendum campaign.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary purpose of this Bill is to update existing legislation relating to the control and regulation of casual trading as contained in the Casual Trading Act, 1980.  That Act applies to selling goods by retail on a street, road, market square, footpath, roadside and any other place that the public have access as of right and any place that a local authority sets aside as a casual trading area.  The 1980 Act came into operation following a report from the then Restrictive Practices Commission that had concluded that outdoor trading was fair trading, provided that it was subject to reasonable and, especially, effective control and made a more realistic contribution to public funds.</P>
      <P>The primary considerations leading subsequently to the enactment of the 1980 Act related to ensuring that roadside and street traders do not have an unfair advantage over established traders, in so far as they do not have the usual overheads which have to be met by established traders.  Additionally, there had been widespread concern about the traffic and other environmental problems created by some outdoor traders.  These were some of the arguments in support of better regulation of outdoor trading that led to the enactment of the 1980 Act.  The same general considerations could be said to arise today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of the 1980 Act therefore, was to deal with these types of concerns by providing for licensing of casual trading, based on a designated casual area system, that is a place where casual trading can be legally carried out, with penalties as the deterrent against offences. The 1980 Act provides for a dual licensing system, involving a national licence issued by the Department of Enterprise <Col N="762" /> and Employment and a permit issued by any local authority that has a designated casual trading area or areas, on payment of the appropriate fees.</P>
    <P>The Act gives powers of enforcement to the Garda Síochána and empowers the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and the local authorities to appoint authorised officers for the purpose of enforcement.  In practice, however, it is enforced by the local authorities and the Garda Síochána who have wide powers of enforcement. Additionally, local authorities have powers to acquire market rights, some of which are in private ownership as a result of royal charters and letters patent granted centuries ago, and to extinguish market rights on condition that they provide alternative facilities in the same vicinity as the market or fair to which the right relates and that reasonably correspond in all respects to that market or fair.</P>
    <P>The 1980 Act also provides that certain classes of trading are exempted from regulation under the Act.  These exemptions relate to the following types of selling: selling by a licensed auctioneer; a farmer or market gardener selling his own produce &mdash; livestock, vegetables, flowers, fruit or other crops; door to door selling; a person selling sweets, chocolate, confectionery, cooked foods &mdash; other than those cooked at the place of sale &mdash; fruit, nonalcoholic drinks or favours from a tray, basket, trolley or other similar device at or immediately beside a place where a football match, race meeting or any other event is taking place whether the public have to pay to attend; selling of ice cream, newspapers, periodicals, magazines or other printed matter or pious or religious objects; fishermen or members of the crew of a fishing boat selling their catch; selling in aid of a charity or for some purpose from which no private profit is made, for example, famine relief organisations, hospitals, organisations that help the poor, churches, mission societies, schools, sports clubs, etc. and selling at a market <Col N="763" /> or fair held with the authority of statute or a franchise.</P>
    <P>The thrust of the 1980 Act was that it conferred wide powers on the local authorities to designate the places in their functional area to be set aside for outdoor trading, where this type of trading could be carried on in a disciplined way in the best interest of consumers, established traders and casual traders. During the period in which the Act has been in operation, certain aspects of the Act, in particular exemptions and enforcement, have been the subject of criticism by traders, local authorities, public representatives and the courts.</P>
    <P>In response to these criticisms a major review of the Act was undertaken by the Department of Enterprise and Employment in consultation with the local authorities.  In addition submissions were received from other Departments and interested bodies, including the established and casual trading communities.  The review highlighted a number of difficulties with the operation of the 1980 Act including, among other things, the exemption relating to the sale of agricultural or horticultural produce by the producer as posing particular problems for local authorities in relation to enforcement because the burden of proof of the origin of the produce is placed on the local authorities.  This is very difficult in the case of most items with the exception of fruits such as oranges, grapefruit, etc.  In addition, efforts by local authorities to use their powers to acquire market rights can be defeated when people selling their own agricultural or horticultural produce, such as potatoes, shrubs, fish, etc., are not subject to any form of regulation.</P>
    <P>The absence of power of appeal by a local authority against a decision of the Circuit Court in relation to the designation of a casual trading area has also presented problems for some authorities. This is an area that is crucial to the effective operation of the Act.  Difficulties have also been experienced by local authorities in connection with so-called <Col N="764" />&ldquo;prescriptive rights&rdquo; claimed by traders, in the context of the local authorities' attempts to avail of their powers to acquire market rights, and the current exemption from casual trading regulation relating to selling at a market or fair held with the authority of statute or a franchise.  The difficulty arising here from the local authorities' point of view is that, where they have been successful in acquiring a market right, a continuing right appears to live on through the &ldquo;prescriptive rights&rdquo; route and the local authorities have no means of establishing the validity of such rights.  This has been invoked successfully by some traders and as a result the local authorities and the gardaí, in some instances, have declared prosecutions under the Act on fair days to be a lost cause.</P>
    <P>It also became clear that the casual trading community was experiencing difficulties with the operation of the Act; for example, the procedure relating to the extinguishment of markets by the local authorities and the provision of alternative facilities in the same vicinity; the operation of the provisions relating to offences; appeals to the courts and the requirement under the Act on traders to display casual trading licences and permits.</P>
    <P>These are the principal areas of difficulties that led to the decision to amend the Casual Trading Act, 1980, and to introduce measures that would lead to greater flexibility, efficiency and fairness in the enforcement of casual trading regulation.  The principal measures contained in the Casual Trading Bill, 1994, as initiated to achieve these objects were as follows.  The current casual trading regulation system, as I already mentioned, involves a dual licensing system operated by the Department of Enterprise and Employment and the local authorities.  The Bill recognises that there is no justification for the continued involvement of central Government in this function.  It is a function that can readily, and should properly be, carried out only by the local authorities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="765" /> Section 4 of the Bill as initiated provides for this by devolving the licensing system to the local authorities who will have a choice of routes to casual trading regulation, that is, either general licences without territorial limitation or a casual trading area system as is currently in operation.  If the local authority chooses the latter route then no other casual trading will be permissible in its functional area unless covered by an exempted category or by special events licensing which is also a new provision under the Bill.  This is fully consistent with Government policy on local government reform as regards ensuring that local issues are settled at local level.</P>
    <P>The 1980 Act contains a number of trading activities that are exempted from the scope of the Act.  This means that they are not subject to any specific regulation.  This has given rise to particular difficulties, especially in the case of home-grown produce.  It is appropriate that the exemptions from the scope of regulation should be as limited as possible and the Bill as initiated accordingly provides for this in section 2 by limiting the existing list of exemptions to just three activities &mdash; selling by a licensed auctioneer, door-to-door selling and charity sales.</P>
    <P>The deletion of the other existing exemptions has the effect only of making the relevant selling activities subject to regulation by the local authorities.  I would like to emphasise that the local authorities are being empowered simultaneously to add back any existing exemption, for example, newspapers vendors or strawberries sellers, or to add any new ones that they may decide are appropriate for their own areas.</P>
    <P>In addition the Minister for Enterprise and Employment will be empowered to add to or to delete classes of trading to be exempted at the national level.  The removal of the exemption relating to market rights, and a complementary provision which provides that any market right remaining unexercised for a period of not less than ten years will stand extinguished, will <Col N="766" /> help resolve the problem posed by &ldquo;prescriptive rights&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill as initiated also provided among other things, that a local authority shall, subject to certain specified circumstances, grant a casual trading licence to an applicant who pays the fee fixed by the local authority under that section and who fulfils certain conditions, including tax clearance and a provision relating to social welfare. As I will indicate later, I decided to delete the tax clearance provision and to replace it by an RSI administrative system relating to applications for casual trading licences.</P>
    <P>A major change that the Bill as initiated involves, at the request of the Department of the Environment, is to provide broad ranging powers to the local authorities under section 7 of the Bill as initiated for the use of by-laws relating to the control, regulation, supervision and administration of casual trading in their functional areas.  It is worth noting that these powers are more extensive than the present powers of local authorities under the 1980 Act, to make by-laws that are limited to designated casual trading areas.  This is, in effect, the most significant reform contained in the Bill, and is aimed at giving the local authorities the necessary flexibility that they require to regulate casual trading more efficiently.</P>
    <P>In regard to enforcement, as the Minister for Enterprise and Employment will no longer have the function of issuing casual trading licences, the Bill, as initiated, provides that the Minister will have no role in enforcement.  This will be the responsibility of local authorities and the Garda Síochána who, in practice, already enforce the Act.</P>
    <P>The Bill as initiated provided that the powers of the Garda Síochána to dispose of seized goods will be available to superintendents where this function is currently reserved to the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána; for the doubling of penalties for summary convictions and convictions on indictment to £1,000 and £10,000, respectively, to bring them in line with current levels in other legislation; <Col N="767" /> for the streamlining of the courts' jurisdiction in relation to summary offences; and for amendments to the Occasional Trading Act, 1979, regarding the power of the Minister to amend classes of occasional trading, social welfare and penalties for consistency with the Casual Trading Act.  &ldquo;Occasional trading&rdquo; as defined under that Act generally applies to occasional selling, for example, at weekends, from hotels or warehouses.  Persons who engage in occasional trading are required to have an occasional trading permit from the Department of Enterprise and Employment on payment of the appropriate fee.  The Act is enforced by authorised officers appointed by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.</P>
    <P>On assuming responsibility for the Casual Trading Bill, 1994, as initiated, I have given careful consideration to the contents of the Bill and engaged in widespread consultations with interest groups reflecting a wide variety of views.  Having taken due account of the concerns made to me during these consultations and by Deputies during the Bill's subsequent debate in Dáil Éireann, I have taken the opportunity of introducing a number of important changes that I have felt necessary to achieve acceptance in the Oireachtas.  In this regard, the principal changes that I have introduced to the Bill as initiated, and which are contained in the Bill that is before this House are as follows.</P>
    <P>In section 3, which relates to restrictions on casual trading, a presumption is included under subsection (5) that will simplify the courts' procedures for dealing with prosecutions under this section. In section 4 I have deleted the tax clearance provision and replaced it by an administrative system that will ask applicants for licences to quote their RSI numbers on the application forms. This follows Government approval and acknowledgement that the original tax clearance requirements would present an unjustifiable and disproportionate burden on the casual trading community. I am satisfied that the alternative <Col N="768" /> administrative system that has been accepted by the Casual Trading Association will provide a more equitable approach towards creating a licensing system that sits comfortably with the real world of the casual trading communities.</P>
    <P>They do not have high powered financial advisers, detailed contact and familiarity with the State bureaucracy, or professional, qualified accountants to administer their records and file their returns.  The big accountancy firms do not have a thriving business in Moore Street nor is the world of the casual trader, one of detailed recording in ledgers and running accounts of trading performances and activities.  It is a world of making a small living in increasingly adverse conditions.  Yet it is also part of the social and business fabric of the city of Dublin in particular, and it would be inappropriate to impose on such a community, demands and requirements that are disproportionate to the scale and nature of its activities.</P>
    <P>Additionally in section 4 I have introduced an amendment to reduce the five year periods in both subsections (6) and (7) to three years in each case as it appeared to me that the original penalties were unnecessarily harsh bearing in mind the general nature of casual trading offences and to provide for an amnesty for offences by traders under the 1980 Act.  This will enable traders to start with a clean sheet under the new regime when it commences operation. The latter measure is essential to resolve the specific and self perpetuating problems of a large number of traditional Dublin traders who do not qualify for trading pitches because they are debarred under the five year ban relating to two or more offences.</P>
    <P>In section 5, relating to the display of casual trading licences, I have introduced an amendment to require that a person's licence number only shall be displayed at the place of trading to meet casual traders' concerns about their safety and security, which arose from the original provision regarding displaying <Col N="769" /> the person's licence and his name and home address.</P>
    <P>In section 6, I have introduced amendments to ensure that the special interests of disabled persons applying for casual trading licences are taken into consideration by local authorities; to link any facilities and services provided by local authorities to people engaged in casual trading with the setting of fees; and to oblige local authorities to consider submissions received from any interested person to strengthen the procedure for making by-laws under the Act.</P>
    <P>In section 10, I have introduced an amendment that will enable local authorities to appoint persons other than officers of the local authorities which will give local authorities greater flexibility in the management of markets, while in section 14, on reconsidering the original provisions relating to summary offences, I have proposed that there should be a scale of penalties instead of one maximum penalty of £1,000, that will provide both guidance and flexibility for the courts in deciding appropriate fines for offences under section 3. In addition, I have made a small number of amendments to the Bill that are mainly of a drafting nature.</P>
    <P>I am happy to say that all of the amendments I have proposed have been accepted by Dáil Éireann, and I am confident that the Bill as it now stands will, if accepted by the House, provide for a fair and effective regime for the regulation of casual trading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House to debate this important Bill. We largely agree with its provisions.  It is legislation that is long overdue.  All of us have had numerous examples over the years of major difficulties being caused in cities, county towns and rural areas by unregulated, uncontrolled casual trading.  It has caused significant hardship to people in legitimate retailing who have been unable to compete with casual traders because of the advantages stacked in their favour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="770" /> The Bill is welcome in that it transfers powers to enforce the legislation from central Government, from the Department of Enterprise and Employment, to the local authorities and the Garda Síochána.  This is a good development in that it decentralises the decision making process on what is a local issue throughout the country.</P>
    <P>On many occasions I complained at local authority and Government level about the lack of any form of control over casual traders.  They move in to the streets or the market squares of towns and take over, causing traffic confusion, litter and debris to be strewn around the area, and much grief to small business people who are trying to make a living in small shops where it is perhaps difficult to make a living in any event.  Small traders are burdened with all of the costs involved in doing business, from rates, to rent and taxation, yet casual traders can set up outside shops with no overheads, controls or expenses.  It is a most unfair form of trade, and it has been allowed to go on for far too long. This legislation is welcome in bringing an end to unfair competition which has bedevilled many small businesses.</P>
    <P>I welcome many of the improvements to the Bill.  It was important to tighten up some areas, as the Minister has outlined. The reduction of the exemption areas from ten to three is especially welcome. In this respect the provisions, as originally drafted, were perhaps too wide and would have been open to abuse by casual traders.</P>
    <P>It is important that we differentiate between two types of casual traders. The traditional casual traders are found in Moore Street in Dublin and in Eyre Square in Galway.  They have been there as long as the shops against whom they compete.  They have made their contribution in a special way.  The other type of casual traders are the get rich quick merchants, who have left the business as quickly as they entered it, and who have been known to leave people with grave difficulties as a result of the kind of products &mdash; their quality and so on &mdash; they sell.  It is time that we <Col N="771" /> cracked down on these casual traders who have abused the system in every respect.  Section 2 limits the existing list of exemptions to three activities, in regard to a licensed auctioneer, door to door selling and charity sales, which I welcome.</P>
    <P>The deletion of the other exemptions has the effect of only making the relevant selling activities subject to regulation by the local authorities.  This flexibility is welcome.  The Minister's emphasis on the fact that local authorities are being empowered to allow any existing exemption, for example, in relation to newspapers or strawberries, or to add new ones which they may deem appropriate is a worthwhile initiative.  The removal of the exemption relating to market rights is also to be welcomed.  This will resolve the problem of prescriptive rights and I support the initiative.</P>
    <P>However, I have a major concern with section 4.  While the Minster has made a cogent case that casual traders in traditional areas such as Moore Street are not in the business of employing large firms of accountants, the same could be said for many small businesses who are crippled by the stringent tax regulations which have now been put in place.  These require them to have tax clearance certificates even though they are only running a very small business and making a very small profit.  It is unfair that the Minister would change this regulation with regard to casual traders if he will not change the same regulation for small business people who have grave difficulty in trying to keep pace with the bureaucracy that is now part of our tax system.</P>
    <P>The Minister must reconsider this change.  If he is to introduce an RSI system of administration for casual traders, with which I do not have a problem, it is incumbent on him that he indicate to the House that he is prepared to introduce a similar measure for the people in small shops.  This is the most important aspect of the Bill and I ask the Minister, therefore, to give this matter consideration, <Col N="772" /> to level the playing pitch for the small traders who are competing with the casual traders.</P>
    <P>The Minister has painted a nice picture of casual traders; we all love the people in Moore Street and want to see them make progress.  I am concerned this opens up the sector to many unscrupulous casual traders.  I refer to people who may trade in different products from day to day, who go from place to place and leave a trail of destruction behind them.  They are in a different category to the normal casual trader who most of us know, who does a good job and makes a living in a legitimate way.</P>
    <P>This change must be re-examined. The Minister must level the playing pitch for everybody in competition in this sphere.  I have had representations from people in a number of sectors who feel the change proposed in this legislation will create unfair competition. Florists have a major concern about this change which makes business difficult for them.  Their businesses cannot compete with casual traders, many of whom are fly-by-nights.</P>
    <P>With regard to the enforcement of casual trading licences, it is a good development that the local authorities and the Garda will be fully responsible for the implementation of the legislation. I welcome the Minister's initiative with regard to occasional trading but there is no reason this could not also be regulated by local authorities.  Why are those who engage in occasional trading required to have a trading permit from the Department of Enterprise and Employment?</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with the display of casual trading licences and an amendment was made requiring that a licence number only shall be displayed at the place of trading to meet casual traders' concerns about their own safety and security.  While this provision is appropriate to places such as Moore Street where everybody knows the casual traders who are there day after day, a full description should be required of casual traders, especially in small towns, who <Col N="773" /> may arrive on a Friday or Saturday and take a pitch.</P>
    <P>They are supposed to have designated areas and the legislation provides for a tightening of the way in which they operate.  However, the practicality is that by the time the Garda is in a position to take action against some of the traders, they have been in place for the couple of hours they want to do their business and are gone.  Such traders should have to display their names, addresses and other details so there can be proper and immediate control of their activities.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 6 as the Minister made a good amendment in allowing special consideration for disabled people.  I also welcome section 10 which gives flexibility to the local authority to employ people to take control of the markets rather than leave it to employees of the local authority who are hard pressed in their everyday work.</P>
    <P>This Bill is welcome as it is past time we had proper control over casual trading and, with minor reservations, I commend it to the House.  I hope it will bring about improvements for people in the retail industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  I come from Navan which has a large weekly market.  I have never been involved in dealing with any of the casual traders in Navan on a Friday but for many years I held a clinic close to the main trading area.  I got to know a number of the casual traders and I found them decent and honourable.  They had been coming to Navan every week for many years.</P>
      <P>I welcome the changes being made to the Casual Trading Act, 1980, and the amendments to this Bill in the Dáil.  In the discussions in the Dáil in March 1994, many questions were raised as to matters not covered by the Bill.  Those of us familiar with the 1980 Act and the way in which it worked were worried the Bill would not protect casual traders and those trading in premises in towns where the casual traders compete.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Members agree with Senator <Col N="774" /> Fahey's point about the production of tax clearance certificates.  When the Bill was introduced last year I wondered how it would work for the small trader as I could not see it being implemented successfully because of the nature of the business concerned.  I welcome the change the Minister has made in this regard.  There was room for change to assist the small casual trader and the Minister's proposal should be supported.</P>
    <P>I accept the concerns mentioned in this regard but it is not for the Minister of State to approach the Minister for Finance.  It is a matter for finance legislation to change the position for small shopkeepers who have a small turnover and who should not have to pay substantial amounts to accountants.  I do not think that is the case; matters have changed dramatically for those shopkeepers. The Revenue Commissioners deal with the small shopkeepers on a sympathetic, one to one basis.</P>
    <P>With regard to the role of the local authorities and the Garda in implemention, Senator Fahey pointed out that before anybody might have time to make a complaint about a casual trader the trader would have gone and may not return.  I am aware of a number of problems with casual traders.</P>
    <P>The Garda, in conjunction with the local authority, which may or may not have granted a licence at that time, was able to ensure that those people did not have an opportunity to set up shop the following week.  At the time I welcomed the fact that action was taken.  I was not contacted about it, but the licensing authority, in the form of the urban council, took action quickly.  I welcome the change that local authorities will now deal with granting licences.  This will bring all aspects of casual trading licensing into one area.  I am a member of the urban council and the vigilant staff are dealing with a number of these matters very satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>There are fly by night operators and this has been the case over the years. How will the legislation affect casual traders who do not go to sites which are <Col N="775" /> available weekly?  Such a trader spends quite an amount of money advertising on the local radio for a few days that he intends to sell his products in a hotel or hall.  He arrives with a substantial number of different items and sells them very cheaply in comparison to prices in shops.  There is no redress available to people who buy such items and later find that they do not come up to standard.</P>
    <P>Approximately 18 months ago much time was taken up on some national programmes, such as &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo;, in connection with such traders who arrived from England with a substantial amount of products.  Many people discovered, when they got home, that the items they bought were inferior and no redress was available to them.  How will such traders be dealt with under the Bill?</P>
    <P>The majority of people dealing on Moore Street, Eyre Square in Galway and the market square in Navan are genuine.  They arrive on a daily or weekly basis and their presence adds to the areas during the time they are there. A huge number of people attend market day in Navan and this benefits not only the casual traders but also quite a number of the shops in the town.  People go to the market and then walk up the main streets to different shops for various items which they wish to purchase.</P>
    <P>Casual trading is an old occupation and I am delighted legislation is not being introduced which will put such traders out of business because they are part of Ireland's character.  Most Members have visited other countries at various times and they have visited the markets there.  Such activity is part of our culture and the aim of the Bill is to make it a little easier for those involved. It also provides identification for the people concerned, which is important.</P>
    <P>Small shopkeepers are also being considered. People should not be allowed to arrive and set up in a particular part of a town, remain there for perhaps a couple of weeks and then leave.  The Bill will ensure that local authorities have control in this regard in towns and villages <Col N="776" /> across the country.  People say traders may come and go without the local authority being informed. However, if a trader arrives in a particular area and the local shops object to his activities, they will soon inform the authority that the trader is there.  A telephone call does not cost much and it does not take long to get through to the people concerned.  My experience is that action will be taken.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes made by the Minister and the Bill is better as a result of the debate in the other House in March 1994.  The changes made since then, as outlined by the Minister, have improved the Bill and I welcome this.  In his reply I ask the Minister to outline how the Bill will affect fly by night operators who give casual traders a bad name.  People who visit markets on a weekly basis and buy from regular traders have no problem returning the following week if there is a problem with items they purchased.</P>
    <P>Market day in Navan is when the elderly people go into town.  In addition to collecting their pensions, they take the opportunity to meet people and chat to them.  It is an enjoyable day out for many people who, for much of the week, do not have many people to talk to or visit.  I welcome the Bill and I hope it will receive unanimous support in the House.  It is a major improvement on the 1980 Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join other Members in welcoming the Bill.  I realise it is important legislation which is long overdue. However, it does not deal with a black and white situation.  For example, there are many different types of travellers; some deserve our support and consideration, while others are wealthier than traders.  Many people are involved in casual trading and one does not have to drive any distance on a national primary route before one sees different categories of traders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some successful traders are travellers. How will the Garda apprehend and the local authorities prosecute traders who are travellers?  They are in every line of <Col N="777" /> business, including selling farm gates and paint, paint spraying and tarmacadaming yards and avenues.  They are involved in a wide range of areas and this matter is not well covered in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I come from a Border town and we have experienced a particular problem over the last 25 years, which reached reasonably serious proportions. People tell a story, which is almost true, that a man arrived and offered a trader a lorry load of fridges and other goods.  He said it was very good value and that the items came from a place which had been bombed. The trader said he had not heard of any place being bombed recently.  He replied that it was going to be bombed that night.  We have had to live with that situation.  &ldquo;Casual trader&rdquo; is a very wide description.  He can be selling anything from pocket handkerchiefs to farmyard gates.</P>
    <P>We should be realistic in our expectations. The weakness in this Bill is that it is being left to the local authorities and the gardaí to implement it.  They must control the trading, impose penalties and apprehend and seize goods. Everybody in rural Ireland knows that the local authorities do not have the resources or the manpower to catch people who dump their litter on the roadside.  Under the law an on-the-spot penalty can be imposed on such people but how many people have been caught and prosecuted?</P>
    <P>The implementation and policing of this legislation will be the criteria of its success.  In theory the Bill is welcome.  It attempts to regulate an area that was in need of regulation.  In practice, neither the local authorities nor the Garda Síochána has the manpower or resources to implement this legislation. A trader can set up a stall one day during the weekend.  If the gardaí notice they can approach the trader and ask to see his licence.  The trader can say he has left the licence with his grandmother who is trading in another town.  By the time the gardaí have checked on his <Col N="778" /> name, address and licence, the trader will be in a different town the next day to avoid the town or village where he has been noticed.  The Minister is not giving the gardaí and the local authorities an easy task.  I have not come here to criticise the Bill.  I accept and support it but I have a duty to point out how it might not work.  It falls down in its policing and implementation.</P>
    <P>Selling or collecting for charitable organisations is open to abuse.  If a person collecting at the door of a supermarket is approached for his licence, he can show it but he does not have to say what percentage of the money is going to the organisation.  This is a major concern. The country is littered with such collectors. They generally collect outside their home county.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister in a position to put resources into the implementation of the Bill?  If not, it will not achieve its objective.  I have a great interest in this Bill although my expectations were, perhaps, too high.  I recall seeing a lady set up trade selling teas from a caravan in Barnas Gap one summer.  The local authority brought her to court and the sensible judge fined her one shilling. Nevertheless, she was moved away. Within one hundred yards of her site a gentleman with another caravan was selling paintings.  He was painting them on the spot and they were very nice. However, the local authority did not touch him.  He was acceptable.  It is hard to see the difference.</P>
    <P>We would dearly love to see this Bill being successful and being implemented as the Minister has outlined.  We are enthusiastic about it.  I appreciate the flavour of the market town in rural Ireland.  A hotelier in Ballybofey has a notice in his hotel which states: &ldquo;Ballybofey is the best little market town in Ireland&rdquo;.  He was right to acclaim that. However, the situation has got out of hand to the point where it must be controlled. The wording and presentation of the Bill is perfect.  My concern is that it will not achieve its objectives largely because we do not have the resources to support it.  We are passing the buck to <Col N="779" /> the local authorities and the gardaí who do not have the resources to meet the duties they already have.</P>
    <P>I await the Minister's observations on my comments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and the changes the Minister has made both to the 1980 Act and to the Bill proposed by the previous Government.  I welcome a number of the provisions.  The decision to devolve the licensing system to local authorities is welcome.  It is a forward looking approach and will make it easier to deal with problems on the ground.</P>
      <P>I seek a number of clarifications from the Minister.  He said that section 7 of the Bill gives general powers and flexibility to a local authority to make bylaws relating to the control, regulation, supervision and administration of casual trading in its functional area.  I am aware of a problem that has arisen locally in this regard.  A local authority provided a casual trading area in a town but it was not a proper facility because its location would not allow a flow of traffic.  It was causing a number of problems and the local authority which wished to have the area changed had to go to court to appeal the decision.  I am not sure if, under section 3 of the Bill, the local authority will still have to go to court or if it can make the decision to change the casual trading area.</P>
      <P>Less bureaucracy should be a consideration in this Bill.  Everybody will agree that once one becomes involved in court proceedings one is faced with expense and loss of time before a decision is made.  I would be grateful if the Minister would clarify if, under this Bill, the local authority will still have to go to court to seek to change a casual trading area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Moore Street casual traders.  However, casual trading has developed to a great extent throughout rural Ireland in the last number of years.  The Moore Street casual traders have long played a role in <Col N="780" /> the cultural history of this country and they still have a role to play.  A number of the amendments which the Minister may propose on Committee Stage will, if accepted, make it easier for everybody involved to know where they stand as far as the law is concerned.</P>
    <P>When speaking on this Bill I admit to being biased, as I come from a long tradition of family business people.  I have seen &mdash; and I am not being dramatic about this &mdash; small family businesses run into serious financial difficulties due to the unfair competition of casual traders. There was no recourse in law to allow the family businesses compete fairly with these people.  They came into towns for one day in the week, they often did not have licences, they had no overheads, they did not have to pay rates and they got away with it.  That is the main reason I welcome the whole tenor of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I sometimes get worried if I think my political ideals are falling into line with those of the Progressive Democrats.  I refer to where a tax clearance certificate was looked for under section 4.  I concede that the situation where the administration system will ask applicants for licences and RSI numbers may solve the problem.  A lot of the fly by night casual traders could get around that and it is something I ask the Minister to look at in the short term.  If it is not working, he will have to seriously reconsider requiring the provision of a tax clearance certificate.</P>
    <P>According to Government policy many jobs will be created in the service industries over the next few years.  The potential is great in rural Ireland, but if businesses face unfair competition&mdash; even if it is only one day a week &mdash; the profit margins will be so small and the competition so strong that, unfortunately, a number of them will cease to exist.  That is my only gripe with the Bill. I am willing to wait and see if it will solve the problem, but we will have to keep a close watch on it and, if it is not having the desired effect, the Minister will have to reconsider the aspect of tax clearance certificates.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="781" /> The Bill will make life much easier for the Garda Síochána and the local authorities to police casual trading on the ground and that is to be welcomed. I hope it will be enacted soon because there are many outstanding local problems and many local authorities and gardaí are awaiting its enactment so that they can resolve the matter quickly.</P>

      <P>I wish to make a few comments on the Bill but, first, it is traditional to welcome the Minister.  It sometimes seems patronising for somebody from the backbenches to welcome the Minister to the House, but suffice it to say that I am glad to see him in the position of authority which he now occupies. I have some difficulties with the Bill, but I do understand the principle of it.  The Minister outlined this in his opening remarks where he said:</P>
      <P>The 1980 Act came into operation following a report from the then Restrictive Practices Commission that had concluded that outdoor trading was fair trading, provided that it was subject to reasonable and, especially, effective control and made a more realistic contribution to public funds.</P>
      <P>The Bill acknowledges the place of casual trading in our economic society but looks for the almost clichéd entity nowadays &mdash; the even playing field.  I am not sure that the playing field is evened entirely by this legislation.  The Minister stated that:</P>
      <P>The primary considerations leading subsequently to the enactment of the 1980 Act related to ensuring that roadside and street traders do not have an unfair advantage over established traders, in so far as they do not have the usual overheads which have to be met by established traders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to Senator Reynolds speaking from a tradition of family business and I am aware of the fact that, from time to time, casual traders have impinged upon the business of established traders.  This is unfortunate, particularly for people who committed themselves and have <Col N="782" /> expenses in terms of plant, shops, equipment, staff and so on.</P>
    <P>I received a briefing from the florists' association who are quite agitated about this, particularly in the Grafton Street area.  However, I have to say that ever since I was a child there have been florists on Grafton Street.  It is part of the colour of the city and adds greatly to the attraction.  As long as it is a fair playing field, I would hate to see the removal of that beautiful display of flowers and those rather engaging people &mdash; principally women &mdash; from whom I have had the pleasure of buying flowers ever since I was about six or seven years old going to my music teacher.  I would not like to think that they would be driven out in a mean-spirited way by the florists in that area.</P>
    <P>I also used to patronise florists in that area for Interflora purposes, because I believe in horses for courses.  The casual traders were fine for the odd bunch to give to somebody and say &ldquo;Thank You&rdquo; or &ldquo;Sorry&rdquo; but they do not provide the Interflora service, so there is no competition there.  I used to go to a decent man called Mr. Byrne.  He had to move because the rents skyrocketed in that area due to property speculation.  The real threat to the small florist in the Grafton Street area is not the ladies on their pitches; it is property speculation which has driven rents through the roof, and the ordinary merchant cannot afford them.</P>
    <P>I understand the principle of unfair trading and the fact that people have to spend money on their shops, overheads and so on.  That can also be said of the buses.  CIÉ is clearly placed at a disadvantage because of the operation of a casual trading system by private bus operators, who apparently do not have to pay for garages.  They use the public thoroughfares of Dublin, sometimes in most inappropriate places and at most inappropriate and inconvenient times, whereas CIÉ have to provide bus stops, shelters, garages, bus stations and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course they should, but the area of competition is not a level playing field.  While I am on my inner city hobby horse, I want to raise another matter that may be marginally considered by the Bill, and that is a traditional market &mdash; that is fine as far as I am concerned but it is also a blister &mdash; the Cumberland Street market. Although I support casual trading because it has a long and honourable tradition in Dublin &mdash; and also a dishonourable tradition on another hand &mdash; I find it offensive that people who are given pitches in the Cumberland Street market, which is now apparently acknowledged and registered by Dublin Corporation, appear to be under no compulsion or obligation and have no sense of obligation to clear the place after them on a Saturday morning.  Perhaps the Minister would look into that. It is an outrageous disrespect for the centre of a capital city that people can come in with old clothes, bits of old broken clocks, bedsteads and so on, sell them if they can find somebody to buy them &mdash; that is fine and I am told one does find interesting things down there &mdash; and then leave all the detritus and rubbish lying around all over the place for the unfortunate corporation to have to clean it up in the afternoon.  In the gap between the moment when the traders leave and the cleaning of the street by the corporation, it is an absolutely unspeakably filthy, disgusting and demoralising sight.  I have no qualms about drawing that to the attention of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to turn to an area of the city which I know quite well &mdash; the Henry Street-Moore Street area.  I know the Minister has been approached by representatives of the traders in this area.  I wish to act as a messenger &mdash; and I hope that I will not be shot for so doing &mdash; as I am in possession of a letter which may appear in <i>The Irish Times.</i>  However, editorial decisions may prevent it from reaching the pages of <i>The Irish Times</i> and the Minister may be interested in hearing it.  It is from an old friend of his and mine, Seánie Lambe, whose company <Col N="784" /> I have just left because he is launching a programme to raise money for the rehabilitation of drug stabilised women from the inner city.  The letter reads:</P>
    <P>Dear Sir,</P>
    <P>It pains me to criticise my old friend, Minister Pat Rabbitte, but in the case of the Casual Trading Bill one must wonder which tail is wagging what dog.  Having met the Minister and his officials, it would appear that we were unable to convince them of the outrageous impact of the proposed legislation on decent women trying to earn an honest living.</P>
    <P>Much emphasis is put in the modern Irish economy on entrepreneurial skills, but when such skills are used by people who, to quote the Minister in his former manifestation, are &ldquo;living on inadequate social welfare incomes&rdquo; then the power and influence of big business comes into play. A £10,000 fine for selling bananas off a pram in Henry Street is surely a penalty which bears no relationship to the gravity of the alleged crime.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his officials were unaware, as no doubt are the general public, that these women have to pay to be arrested.  Every time that they and their goods are brought to the Garda Station they are charged £7.50 for the dubious privilege.  They then have to pay again to get their goods back &mdash; goods for which they have paid legally with their own hard earned money.</P>
    <P>The unremitting war against casual street traders being waged by the Garda at the behest of the Dublin City Centre Business Association reaches the level of absurd farce when the Garda inform the Department of Social Welfare of every street trading conviction, while the Garda do not inform the Department of convictions for heroin dealing.</P>
    <P>As a taxpayer I fully agree that anyone earning enough income should pay tax on that income, but until Dublin Corporation regularises <Col N="785" /> street trading for those who have traditionally reared their families by this means then the problem will continue. It seems clear to me that the only way out of this impasse is to ensure that the provisions of the Bill are not implemented in the inner city area until after the local authority has made provision for the legalisation of the casual street traders on fixed sites in the area.</P>
    <P>Using sledgehammers to crack nuts has never been a good idea and so I urge the Minister to reconsider, even at this late stage, the propriety of this Bill.  There are only two sides in this issue: those for the rich and those for the poor.</P>
    <P>That letter is well worth considering.  He invokes, first, the idea of &ldquo;decent women trying to earn an honest living&rdquo;, of which there is a tradition.  The Minister has probably read &mdash; if he has not I will be very happy to send him a copy &mdash; a very interesting and remarkable book by Professor Kevin Corrigan Kearns called <i>Dublin Tenement Life: An Oral History.</i>  He tape-recorded and edited verbatim accounts of life from just before World War I up to the 1970s by those living in the city.  A number of those people living in the city centre &mdash; in the world of O'Casey and Behan &mdash; made their living in very difficult times, particularly during the depressions of the 1920s and 1930s, and maintained their families the only way they could, which was by this sort of trading.  The Minister will know, as I do because I know a number of them personally, that earning their living in this way has been a family tradition for many of them.  It seems an absolute irony that the city has taken the song &ldquo;Molly Malone&rdquo; as its unofficial anthem and that we should sing about an 18th century woman &ldquo;wheeling her wheelbarrow through streets broad and narrow&rdquo; at the same time as we are impinging upon the rights of her descendants.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is a caring person and that his intentions in this Bill are good and honourable.  However, Seánie <Col N="786" /> Lambe makes a very good point when he indicates the disparity involved in imposing a fine of £10,000 on somebody selling bananas from a pram.  That seems disproportionate and the punishment should fit the crime.  I know this may not be a mandatory sentence but the courts have had a tradition of imposing the maximum sentence in such circumstances.  The idea of charging somebody for the privilege of being arrested suggests the worst excesses of the French Revolution.</P>
    <P>I am not too concerned by the Garda informing the Department of Social Welfare &mdash; I have no problems with the culture of the informer &mdash; however, it should be even handed.  It is a very serious cause for concern when one of the most vulnerable elements in society, the street traders, are subject to this kind of informing to the Department of Social Welfare while, at the same time &mdash; and I know this is true &mdash; the Garda do not pass on parallel information about the activities of heroin dealers. That is outrageous and should not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>Mr. Lambe gave me a proposed amendment to the Bill but I do not think it would be worthwhile to table it because I do not think it could be brought into operation.  The amendment reads &ldquo;That this legislation will not be enacted in the inner city of Dublin until the local authority has provided new sites for the traditional unlicensed street traders&rdquo;.  I do not think that amendment is possible because it seems vague in terms of its delineation of the inner city and I am not sure if such a provision would be constitutional.  However, the idea behind it is valuable and reasonable. These people should not be penalised until some alternative form of employment is found for them.</P>
    <P>There are between 40 and 50 unlicensed traditional street traders operating in the Mary Street, Henry Street, Liffey Street and Earl Street area, the vast majority of whom are living on social welfare incomes supplemented by street trading.  Most of them have been jailed at some stage for <Col N="787" /> non-payment of fines, as have some Members of the Oireachtas &mdash; Deputy Gregory went to jail for expressing solidarity with these women.  The courts in the past have frequently applied the maximum penalty to this kind of offender, which is why the £10,000 fine is very dangerous.  They cannot get legal pitches because of previous convictions. The Minister's amnesty on previous convictions will make no difference if Dublin Corporation does not earmark new pitches as the women will soon accumulate new convictions.</P>
    <P>Staggering the fines merely postpones the inevitable because in order to pay fines they have to increase their street trading activities.  They are the only people in the country who have to pay for the privilege of being arrested.  If one takes into account fines, confiscations and bad weather, over a year few, if any, of them would earn a taxable income and when goods are confiscated they have to pay to get them back, although they bought them legally.</P>
    <P>The legislation appears to be designed to apprehend people operating on a much larger scale but has massive implications across the board, which I am sure is not the Minister's intention. The legislation should not come into effect in the inner city until Dublin Corporation has addressed the problem by providing new pitches in the area for traditional street traders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and congratulate him on bringing the Bill before the House.  It is important that roadside and street traders do not have an unfair advantage over established traders who operate retail outlets. Casual traders do not have to pay rates &mdash; which is a big issue with retail outlets &mdash; and they do not have ESB or water charges.  They do not have the normal overheads, which are of considerable significance in the cost of goods, incurred by retail traders.  The growth of casual roadside trading has put pressure on retail business and put jobs in jeopardy. <Col N="788" /> This Bill will level the playing field and will protect jobs in this area.</P>
      <P>Casual traders do not have the labour costs incurred by shopkeepers in that they do not observe the statutory and negotiated conditions of employment for their staff.  Casual trading is creating many problems and must be regulated. These traders create a traffic hazard in many areas and leave behind extensive litter problems, particularly after special events.</P>
      <P>The Casual Trading Act, 1980, did not adequately cover all the concerns in this area.  Many issues regarding casual trading have developed since the introduction of the 1980 Act, and the main concerns relate to exemptions and enforcements.  The review of the 1980 Act identifies difficulties experienced by local authorities, especially in the area of acquiring market rights.  This can be frustrated, especially by those selling agricultural and horticultural products which are not subject to control.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that under the Bill local authorities will have more power and authority in that there will be a dual system of licensing involving the Department of the Environment and local authorities.  This recognises the principle that where functions can be effectively carried out at local level, that should be done.  Members of local authorities have been asking for this for years because of their frustrating experiences when powers were being taken from them.  As a member of a local authority I am very conscious of this. The Bill provides for a reversal in that trend and allows for licensing to be done locally if this is possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is following the principle that what can be done locally should be done at that level and, in fairness, the previous Government also did so.  All legislators and Ministers should follow this principle when framing legislation. With regard to each issue they should ask whether functions can be delegated to lower levels and if people at local level can be more closely involved in the making of regulations <Col N="789" /> and the implementation of law.  This would improve the political process.</P>
    <P>People are alienated from politicians because of the centralisation of politics. Down the country we say power is centralised in Dublin but what is meant is that power is centralised in the Government. For politics to grow and survive &mdash; the latter word may be a little extreme &mdash; and for democracy to be more acceptable, power must be closer and more immediate to the people.  This part of the Bill in a small way recognises this, which is a welcome trend, and it should be a headline when considering legislation in other areas.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that local authorities will be able to operate the licensing system in two ways.  There may be a general licensing system for casual trading which will not have limitations or territorial limits or a casual trading areas system, which is similar to the system operating at present.  Difficulties have arisen under the 1980 Act and also because certain trading activities are not subject to regulation.  The limitations of the Bill will be confined to selling by licensed auctioneers, door to door selling and charity sales.  Local authorities will have the power to add to the list of items which are not subject to regulation. It is important to recognise this because there could be scaremongering about a great deal of traditional trading being eliminated because of the Bill. Members of local authorities are the best people to know what is traditional and what works in an area.</P>
    <P>I welcome the part of the Bill which provides that tax and social welfare clearance will be required in respect of legal casual traders.  This will bring them into the white economy and will make enforcement against illegal traders easier. It will also improve competitiveness and level the playing field between casual and retail traders.</P>
    <P>The Bill must be used to stop the blatant selling of stolen goods on the outskirts of towns and villages.  This activity must be stopped to ensure that the provisions in the Bill are rigorously enforced.  Control must also be enforced <Col N="790" /> where special events are held, where people move in with vans, trucks and lorries and cream off spending power over the period of the events, whether they are held for a day, a weekend or a week.  They then disappear leaving behind their rubbish.  We are not saying this trading should be ended completely but it should be subject to a system of control.</P>
    <P>We should recognise that casual trading is part of our culture and has a special appeal in different countries. When we go to European and other countries, one of the first things we do is look for local markets.  Such markets encourage people to visit other countries. This type of activity fits in with the landscape.  It is important not to kill off its potential.  Different types of trading are suitable for different areas because of their hinterland and agriculture; an example is the selling of strawberries in Wexford.  It is important that we keep this part of our culture and that the Bill is not seen to be killing off something which is good.  The Bill also provides for development in this area where young people with ideas can create new products and sell them in the tourist market.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on this Bill, which will serve the State well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister for his diligence in being in the House so often over the last few weeks and I hope it does not become a permanent part of his life; I am sure he would not wish it to be.  The Bill is necessary and regulation is needed.  Perhaps we should have gone to Jerusalem or Tashkent to find out how they regulate such trading because they seem to be able to manage their affairs well with respect to these types of traders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a feature of our life to have markets and casual trading in our towns and there is no doubt they can be sold as part of the overall tourist package. Those of us who grew up in the country can remember when there were tinkers; I am not using a politically incorrect term because the people about whom I am talking were tinkers who came to <Col N="791" /> the door to take away pots and pans to mend them.  When I was a child a person stayed in my house for a month and rebuilt our grandfather clock and bookcase. He did work of a quality which is now sadly gone.  This was a good feature of country life.  However, times have moved on and we have to regulate matters.</P>
    <P>The Bill was improved in the Dáil with one notable exception, that is, the tax clearance requirement.  The Minister said that casual traders do not have high powered financial advisers, detailed contact and familiarity with the State bureaucracy or professional, qualified accountants to administer their records and file their returns.  This is true of many people trading in our small towns and villages and it is true of farmers. This is not peculiar to this community.</P>
    <P>I can say with certainty that there are traders on the square in Kildare who pay rates and taxes and are less well off than some casual traders.  It also correct to say that other traders there are significantly better off than some casual traders.  This does not detract from the fact that there are people who are at a disadvantage because they pay rates and taxes.  I can understand the difficulties involved but it is legitimate for ordinary traders in a town or village to say that everybody should be treated equally. There are two sides to this coin.  One is that we abolish the RSI requirement for everybody.  The other way is to have the same tax clearance requirement for everybody.  I have tabled an amendment on this matter which we will consider on Committee Stage.  I await with interest what the Minister has to say.</P>
    <P>He pointed out that he has replaced section 4 with an administrative system. I want to know a great deal more about how this system will work before I will be satisfied because I do not see it mentioned in the Bill.  I refer to column 284 of the Dáil Official Report of 9 March 1984, when the then Minister for Employment and Enterprise, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, now the Minister for Finance and who has a function with regard <Col N="792" /> to the collection of taxes, said, when introducing the Bill:</P>
    <P>Section 4 also provides that a local authority shall, subject to certain specified circumstances, grant a casual trading licence to an applicant who pays the fee fixed by the local authority under that section and who fulfils certain conditions, including tax clearance.  The latter issue will no doubt be of some concern to some traders.  There was a specific requirement contained in the Government decision approving the general scheme of the Bill and is a reflection of the Government's determination that the tax burden should be as equitable as possible for all sections of the community.  In this regard I have been advised by the Department of Finance that suitable arrangements to ensure that no casual trader, except for exceptional circumstances, will be refused a tax clearance certificate. Therefore, this new requirement will not be an obstacle to new or existing casual trading applicants for licences.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has replaced section 4 with this administrative system. It was in the explanatory memorandum and the original Bill but is now gone.  Why?</P>
    <P>I grew and harvested strawberries and raspberries and paid 50 pickers to pick two acres of them.  If I went to Senator Quinn's outlet and was paid for my strawberries, claimed the expenses on my pickers and for growing my crop, made my returns on what I received from Senator Quinn and submitted that to the Revenue, I would be taxed on the profit, if there was one.  The person who grows strawberries, Christmas trees or nursery stock is meant to be different from those who sell strawberries &mdash; sometimes represented as Irish grown although they are not &mdash; at the side of a dual carriageway.  These people create a hazard to traffic with which the local authority has to deal.  We should be clear about what we are talking about. There must be equity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="793" /> I have the utmost admiration for the person who starts off as a casual trader in a market town and winds up owning that town's supermarket or retail outlet or for a person who betters themselves or just makes a living, but it should be done on an equal footing.  Could we end up with the door to door strawberry or Christmas tree salesman?  That is another implication that I could take from the Bill.  I want to know specifically how it is proposed to deal with this measure which the Minister describes as an administrative system.  Nothing in the Bill gives me confidence that there will be equity.</P>
    <P>To what extent are these people controlled or governed by the plethora of regulations, which come to us from the European Union, with which the ordinary retailer now has to comply?  I could bore the Minister for some time about, and be very eloquent on, the free range egg, which is endangered.  In County Cork there is, allegedly, a free range hen.  It came from the field and crossed concrete to get into its shed and as a result, was designated by the European Union not to be a free range hen. However, if the person who owned the hen brought its eggs to the local supermarket, they might take them for several weeks but could then inform him that they could not do so anymore because he did not have a licence.  I can produce free range eggs and I suspect I could sell them to my local market, but not to my local supermarket if I do not have a licence.  There is layer upon layer of bureaucracy with which the person trading in the town and producing the product has to cope.  It appears &mdash; I hope the Minister will correct me if I am wrong &mdash; that this type of regulation does not seem to apply in the case of casual trading.  The Minister referred to hygiene regulations &mdash; of course they apply &mdash; and to other matters, but there seems to be an inequity there.</P>
    <P>The other matters that arise deal with enforcement.  The local authority is given this power and I welcome the fact that it now has some discretion.  I can also see that putting extra categories of <Col N="794" /> people into the Bill is not required because either the Minister or the local authority can designate those who might be restricted within the relevant section of the Bill.  However, enforcement will come to the fore and there is expense to the local authority.  My local authority has to maintain our courthouses, the Department of Justice does not have responsibility in this regard Therefore, the cost of maintaining the courthouses devolves on the person trading in the town and paying the rates.</P>
    <P>We built a motorway through County Kildare &mdash; the Department of the Environment and the engineers in Kildare County Council are to be congratulated for this.  However, lighting for that motorway, amounting to £150,000 a year, is levied on the County Kildare ratepayers and the retailers in the town. Who will wind up paying here?  What sort of resources will the Government put in to ensure that casual trading can be regulated and is not paid for by those paying rates in their local towns?</P>
    <P>As Senator Norris said, there have been representations from the Irish Retail Florists' Association, the Irish Flowers' Council and the garden centres and I agree with them.  I tabled my amendment because they have a legitimate grouse in this area.  Why was this provision in the original Bill removed and how is it that the numbers of the Labour Party, who could be so enthusiastic about tax clearance certificates when Deputy Quinn was Minister for Enterprise and Employment, are now absent or are not enthusiastic when the same Bill is being debated now?</P>
    <P>Senator Farrelly mentioned that this matter could be dealt with under the Finance Act.  If it was in the original Bill, I do not see why it had to be taken out of it.  Give the people who are trying to run small businesses&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. This Bill needs to be updated and regulated in relation to casual trading as we have come a long way since the 1980 Act.  The kind of lifestyle we now have as far as casual trading is concerned has changed dramatically.  In 1980, this Bill might only have covered selling newspapers while now a wide range of goods come under the definition of casual trading.</P>
      <P>I have no difficulty with casual trading &mdash; I like markets.  Any time I go abroad, the first thing I do is go to them. It is lovely to wander around them, look at the goods on display and bargain with the traders.  That should be part of our tradition in this country, as it is in every other country.  The casual trader has had an unfair advantage over the regular trader over the years.  I welcome the fact that the Bill gives the local authority power to deal with casual trading.  It seems clumsy for the Department to issue a licence and the local authority to issue a permit.  This would not work and I am glad the Minister recognises this from his experience on a local authority. It is time we gave full control to the local authority.</P>
      <P>How can we implement the provisions of this Bill?  We need considerable resources to get this off the ground and to assess people who apply for a licence, the type of fees involved and the designated areas.  Previously, when a licence was granted, casual traders were able to set up shop on any side road, footpath or open space and the local authority had no control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the local authorities will have control in this area because they will know what is involved, <Col N="796" /> but I am worried that they will not have the manpower and resources to enforce the provisions of the Bill.  I visited my local authority this afternoon and I mentioned this point to the officials. They said I should take it up with the Minister.  However, in his speech the Minister did not suggest how this would be done.  There is no point in passing this Bill if we cannot implement it.  Perhaps the Minister could clarify if the local authorities will have the manpower and resources to implement this Bill.</P>
    <P>We are talking about the casual trader versus the regular trader.  We agree that the regular trader is experiencing problems at present.  If casual trading starts beside a regular trader's small shop, his prices will be undercut from the beginning.  People will buy goods from the casual trader because they are cheaper.  They are able to undercut the regular trader because they do not have overheads and they do not pay tax or rates.  That is not a fair system of trading.</P>
    <P>This Bill will introduce fairness into the system.  It will open up the market and it will keep the public informed about designated areas, environmental control and the problems of noise and traffic.  Procedures are now in place to bring those who commit an offence to court and it is possible to confiscate the property.  If the gardaí take a casual trader's property, how will they get it back and, if they do, will they be able to start trading again further down the road?  There are many loopholes in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis mentioned tax clearance certificates.  Administrative procedures are now in place to assess those who should or should not be granted licences.  I agree with Senator Dardis who said he did not know how this would work.  We are introducing bureaucracy which will be time consuming. Why should these people not produce tax clearance certificates when the ordinary trader must pay PRSI, VAT and overheads?  He also runs the <Col N="797" /> risk of being put out of business because his prices are undercut.</P>
    <P>Will the local authority decide on temporary designated areas for the sale of Christmas trees?  The Minister did not mention this in his speech.  Will it be left to the local authority to introduce a temporary designated area for seasonal goods?  This matter should be considered.</P>
    <P>Are on the spot fines, which are included in the Litter Act, 1982, included in this Bill?  Can the local authority introduce such fines?  This is the best way of dealing with offenders because if they are caught on the spot and charged a considerable fine, they will be slow to reoffend.  If the Garda superintendent takes their goods and moves them on, the trader can come back 24 hours later and repossess his goods and plead his case.  However, there is no way of measuring what is involved when he presents his case.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the local authority will not have the manpower or the resources to implement the provisions of the Bill.  Tax clearance certificates are also important when applying for a licence.  This is good legislation because it is 15 years since we did anything in this regard.  However, there are many loopholes in the Bill.  The Minister expressed concern in the other House about some of the issues I have raised and I am interested to know how he proposes to overcome those problems. Local authorities welcome this legislation and are pleased they now have control.  However, they have reservations about temporary designations, tax certificates and on the spot fines.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation must be welcomed as an attempt to regularise the area of casual trading.  No one can disagree with its purpose.  However, certain aspects must be taken into consideration. As Senator Ormonde said, markets and street trading are an essential part of the atmosphere and colour of a city.  People come to Dublin and they visit Moore Street because they have heard and read about it.  Molly <Col N="798" /> Malone is a symbol of street trading, which is a fact of history and tradition. However, that does not mean that changes should not be made to its operation and organisation.</P>
      <P>Although I have no difficulty with the issues as outlined in the Bill, I am concerned about their implementation.  I am concerned about traders in the Dublin area, many of whom have been imprisoned, fined, etc. over the years for street trading.  This makes many of us feel uncomfortable about the application of the law.  There are 50 or more unlicensed traditional street traders in the Henry Street, Mary Street and Moore Street areas.  They have in many ways been part of the Dublin scene for generations and we have a responsibility to ensure they are protected.  However, if we introduce this legislation, are we in danger of further criminalising them, if they do not have access to trading areas and spaces?  If I put forward an amendment &mdash; and I have not ruled out doing so &mdash; it will be to the Title of the Bill.  It currently reads:</P>
      <P>AN ACT TO PROVIDE FOR THE CONTROL AND REGULATION OF CASUAL TRADING AND TO PROVIDE FOR CONNECTED MATTERS</P>
      <P>I would add the words: &ldquo;outside the Dublin Metropolitan area&rdquo;.  Will the Minister assure us that people will find spaces so they can continue their traditional street trading activities and outline how pitches and sites will be found for them?  I am uncomfortable about passing legislation which, by virtue of the logistics of the lack of available space, would further criminalise these people. That is my overriding concern with the Bill.  These are decent people and as the Minister said they do not give much business to accountancy firms or similar companies.  They are doing their business as best they can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that the Minister reassures us that these people can be protected.  Does the Minister have the power to pressurise a local authority to ensure space is created, that pitches are <Col N="799" /> established and that trading areas are set out?  Apart from giving them the power to do that, does the Bill entitle the Minister to insist that local authorities take that responsibility seriously?</P>
    <P>In the inner city there is great support for the street traders as the Minister will be well aware.  They are considered a focal point of the city and are also considered to be honest and decent.  In communities that suffer from drug abuse, it is difficult to accept that street traders trying to earn a living will come under the full force and rigor of the law while other people appear to get off scot free.  It is important to take time to explain what we are about to those who have a difficulty with it.</P>
    <P>I am worried that the Bill would be seen as part of a continuing approach by the authorities towards what would be interpreted locally as the harassment of traders.  I am certain that is the furthest thing from the Minister's mind. However, there must be satisfaction amid the frustrations for a Minister to hear, on the one hand, Senator Dardis level the criticism that the Bill goes too far on the side of the street trader, and on the other to hear me ask whether the Minister is protecting these people adequately.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of street trading is that street traders provide a service.  I do not know where people buy their Christmas trees but the vast majority can only buy them where they see them for sale at the side of the road.  I do not know where Coillte has its selling points.  I know the Minister in another capacity arranged for the collection of spent Christmas trees in various parts of the city of Dublin but I do not recall him being involved in the supply of Christmas trees at an earlier stage.</P>
    <P>I would like to develop an issue raised by Senator Dardis.  My understanding is that it is not intended that the Bill should be a charter for tax evasion for people who happen to be street traders. Listening to Senator Dardis, I got the clear impression that we may let these people off the hook and that if they <Col N="800" /> were required to pay tax, they were not doing so.  However, if the Minister's intention is to use the RSI number to check on the street trader to give the authorities a clearer profile to recognise whether the person should pay tax and that the matter is followed up on that basis, then I welcome it.  That would be a much clearer arrangement.  I have spoken many times on the issue of taxation. I am close to the views of Senator Dardis on the collection of taxation and I know the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, has made similar assertions.</P>
    <P>My understanding is that this is simply a matter of methodology.  There is no point pretending street traders have the same level of accountancy procedures as the big stores in Henry Street.  On the other hand, they must be required to comply with the tax laws like everybody else.  I understand the Minister intends to use the RSI number and certificate as the method by which the authorities will decide how to approach the issue of taxation rather than the tax clearance certificate.  I would like the Minister to respond to that.</P>
    <P>Another issue here is that these people are not wealthy.  People associate street trading with Arthur Daly, driving around in a Jaguar making lots of money.  These people are barely making a living or are not making a living. They are topping up their income.  Many people in the centre city, including street traders, would say that it is better to see people employed &mdash; in the narrow sense of the word &mdash; in street trading than doing nothing or being involved in some socially unacceptable activity.  There are many aspects of this which must be considered.  I do not disagree with Senator Dardis' precept about the need for everybody to be treated equally in terms of taxation but that does not mean that everybody must go through the same procedure.  There are many features of taxation law.  I said on many occasions in this House that it is time we had consolidated legislation in which we could all see exactly how the State deals with all approaches to <Col N="801" /> taxation.  I do not have any difficulty with a different approach as long it reaches the same conclusion.</P>
    <P>Overall, I welcome the idea of regulation. I also support the approach to taxation through RSI numbers rather than tax clearance certificates as long as that is not a licence for tax evasion or avoidance but simply a way to identify the people and discover their level of income, allowing for follow up by the Revenue Commissioners if need be.  In the vast majority of cases there will be no need.  Teachers of the children of these families and those who have dealt with them through the generations know they are not well-off and do not make large amounts of money in untaxed income.  If there are any in that position they should be dealt with properly but it is not them I am talking about.</P>
    <P>The legislation may be designed to apprehend people operating on a larger scale, which relates to what Senator Dardis said.  If I were to find a fault with the Bill, it would be that it is more suited to people operating on a larger scale and has massive implications for people operating on a smaller basis.</P>
    <P>Is there an implementation date for this legislation?  Do all the provisions come into operation together or can each local authority decide when provisions will be implemented?  Can a local authority put the implementation of a provision on hold until it is ready to enforce it?  This is especially important in the Dublin area and I hope those local authorities ensure there is space for this activity before they begin implementing the detail of the Bill, because that could cause much hardship for these people, who work outside in all sorts of weather, day after day and year after year.  Theirs is not a pleasant set of circumstances.</P>
    <P>Apart from affirming the general principle of <i>caveat emptor</i>, let the buyer beware, I look at this as a trade union general secretary.  If employees were required to work as these traders do, <Col N="802" /> there would be an outcry.  I am sure the Minister has sympathy for that point. We cannot say they are the same as everyone else because they are not. They have to pack their materials out of the way every night; they have to hustle for business; they have to stay out in all weathers; and they have to be on duty from the time they start in the morning until they finish in the evening.  It is not a regular or ordinary situation.  It is important that it be regularised but it is also important that their operation as street traders be protected so they can be knit into the fabric of the community and society in which they live.  The Minister should also insist that the implementation of this Bill in local authority areas should only take place when the local authorities have ensured there are spaces and pitches available to carry out the activity in the regulated way he wishes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, and all the Members who contributed in a reasonable, considered and informed way and did not engage in the flights of hyperbole I had to put up with in the other House &mdash; from all sides of the Dáil, let it be said, in case any Deputies read these remarks.  That debate got out of hand because one Deputy wanted a headline and the disease spread.  I was accused of killing off the &ldquo;Echo boys&rdquo; in Cork. When a Deputy from Wexford heard that, I was accused of stopping the sale of strawberries.  Then a Deputy from Mayo said the banning of religious and pious objects from Knock was a disgrace and a Kerry Deputy mentioned Puck Fair in Killorglin.  On it went, none of it with any basis in reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were two key points in this evening's debate.  First, to devolve or not to devolve, that is the question.  If this House is in favour of devolution of powers to local authorities so they can handle what they know best &mdash; and Senator Ormonde, among others, argued that was a good and obvious thing to do &mdash; many of the arguments <Col N="803" /> made in this debate are appropriate to individual county councils, corporations and urban district councils.  Members should consider whether they think it efficient and correct that powers be devolved to local authorities to designate casual trading sites, licence casual traders, etc.  It seems to me that decisions on whether Puck Fair should be held or whether &ldquo;Echo boys&rdquo; should continue to be a feature of the streets of Cork are for Kerry County Council and Cork Corporation respectively and not matters for the Department of or the Minister for Enterprise and Employment. This problem has been at the heart of the debate here and more so in the other House.  There was an ambivalence on the part of some Members, who thought it was good that local authorities should have more power, and this power in particular, but on other issues they would rather it was a matter for the Government or the Minister.</P>
    <P>The second problem which characterised the debates in both Houses was the confusion of casual traders and occasional traders.  Some of the questions put to me are redundant in the narrow context of this Bill although I do not mind them being asked because they may have to be addressed in the context of a revamp of the Occasional Trading Act, 1979.</P>
    <P>Senator Fahey made a reasoned contribution, but he followed Members of the other House in discussing &ldquo;fly by night&rdquo; traders who disappear when the Garda pursue them, changing their pitches, etc. Those are, by definition, not casual traders and are not encompassed in the Bill. They are occasional traders governed by the 1979 Act, the task of enforcing which rests with the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and is carried out for him by the Director of Consumer Affairs. Senator Fahey and others raised an important matter but it is to be addressed in the revision and updating of the Occasional Trading Act.  It is not a matter for this Bill.</P>
    <P>I underline those two points.  Senator O'Toole said there was some confusion <Col N="804" /> in the debate, with people thinking casual traders are &ldquo;Arthur Daly&rdquo; types. There was such a perception but there were also worries about the &ldquo;Del Boy&rdquo; phenomenon.  Senator McGowan and others have raised the question of those who appear overnight and book the Neptune Centre in Cork or some large ballroom in Donegal.  They come and go and are supposedly liable to get a permit from the Department but in some cases I suspect that may not even be done.  Although it is done in other cases it is probably not an adequate supervision. However, they are matters which are appropriate to the Occasional Trading Act and its enforcement.  Senator McGowan dwelt on matters that are a bit particular to that part of the country. I find it difficult to envisage how I or any Minister can cope with a situation where you are offered a load of white goods for sale on the basis that they are the product of a bombed out establishment, but the establishment will not be bombed until later in the night.  It is difficult for me to respond to that, but I understand what the Senator is talking about, the phenomenon of people coming from another jurisdiction to do business in this jurisdiction.  I am well disposed to giving the House a commitment that we will start work on revamping the Occasional Trading Act, which is probably in serious need of it, judging from the contributions.</P>
    <P>The other conflict that I thought was posing an unequal challenge was the question of Moore Street <i>versus</i> big business.  As Senator O'Toole has said, it is quite extraordinary that I am being pummelled on the one hand by Senator Dardis &mdash; in far more temperate language, admittedly, than I was in the Lower House &mdash; for giving unfair breaks to the casual traders, and being accused on the other hand of being on the side of big business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>In the other House, Deputy Gregory went out of his way to <Col N="805" /> talk about how it was in favour of big business.  It is very difficult to get it right.  At the heart of Senator Dardis's argument about tax clearance certificates is the positing of these two equals &mdash; Moore Street versus the rest of the regular trading community.  It is a major problem.</P>
      <P>I welcomed the intrusion of Senator Norris, not merely for all the normal reasons that one would welcome his intrusion, but for the fact that he raised the particular problems posed in this city, as compared to the preceding contributions which concerned the real problems in provincial Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely my point.  Senator Dardis did not mention Moore Street and that is why I do not think he fully appreciates the scope of the problems in trying to frame casual trading legislation that does not address Moore Street.  With all due respect to the market square in Kildare, the retention of casual trading in Dublin is an essential feature of what we are.  It is part of the colour and character of the city of Dublin.</P>

      <P>I have been asked to explain the reason for the removal of the requirement for a tax clearance certificate.  I am afraid that my assiduous and hardworking civil servants couched it in such sophisticated and elegant language that the point was missed.  I do not want to give offence to anybody in describing why I took that decision, but the truth of the matter is that the people of Moore Street do not know what a tax clearance certificate is.</P>

      <P>I do not know about Senator Fahey, but I know that the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, Deputy Bertie Ahern, certainly agrees with me that Moore Street ought to be preserved. If we agree that Moore Street ought to be preserved then we simply have to look at the practical questions posed by requiring the traders of Moore Street to produce a tax clearance certificate. They do not know what a tax clearance certificate is.  I have met them and have gone through it.  They have never been in the system and they ask for no more than to ply their trade in Moore Street for a very menial income.  They are out in all kinds of weather.  A separate problem is that, in some cases, they do not even have designated pitches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="807" /> It is not simply that they do not have expert tax advice available to them. They have never been in the system. They are not unique.  There are citizens of this State &mdash; for example, from my own part of the country, Senator Fahey's area, and down in Kerry and other places &mdash; who are in receipt of considerable grant assistance from the European Union, through this State, who do not produce tax clearance certificates either. I do not hear anybody making an argument that before they get headage payments they should produce a tax clearance certificate.  They produce, or ought to produce, an RSI number.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Miss Ormonde Miss Ormonde">

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of these people will not even be able to supply an RSI number because they do not have one. If they do, I am assured by the tax collection authorities that there will be no difficulty in policing the system.  Furthermore, as Senator Norris pointed out, the local authority is required to advise the Minister for Social Welfare where a licence is granted.  If vigilance and supervision is the issue, I am 100 per cent in agreement with Senator Dardis about stamping out tax evasion. However, if I were to be asked in the witness box to indicate where I would start stamping out tax evasion I would not choose Moore Street.  A number of other streets would occur to me first.  I had to deal with the practical situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dardis put some serious questions to me and he is entitled to answers.  Why does he think the Bill was abandoned 17 months ago when it first raised it head?  It was abandoned on this issue because it was simply not capable of being implemented.  Nor, I suggest, is Senator O'Toole's half-intended amendment which he waved in front of me to induce me to tell all.  If we were to excise the Dublin metropolitan area <Col N="808" /> that would not work either, because there are parts of that area, other than Moore Street, where, as Senator Ormonde will know, it is urgent that this legislation should be implemented.  That is the thinking behind it.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris read with great flourish a letter written to <i>The Irish Times</i> for publication by an author describing himself as an old friend of mine.  Having regard to the contents of the letter as I heard it, with friends like that I certainly do not need enemies.  However, it is true that the author is an old friend of mine, Seánie Lambe, and I am disappointed that he chose not to make any reference to all the changes I made in the Bill at his and his organisation's behest.  This brings me to Senator O'Toole's question about the lot of the trading women &mdash; and they are predominantly women &mdash; in Moore Street: will they be in a worse state as a result of the enactment of this legislation?  Certainly not.</P>
    <P>There are a number of important changes.  The first and most important is the amendment which gives these women an amnesty.  At the moment if a person has committed more than two offences, she cannot get a licence.  Street traders are regularly dragged off and landed in Mountjoy when others should be put there.  Even if there is a new system of licensing, they cannot get access to those licences because they have two or more convictions.  In answer to Senator O'Toole, they are operating illegally at the moment so they cannot be worse off.  They now have an amnesty and can start with a clean sheet.</P>
    <P>It is not true that a woman with a barrow full of bananas, as Senator Norris put it, will be fined £10,000.  If he looked at the Bill he would see that she will be fined £50, or more correctly up to £50.  I appreciate that if I was lodged in the cooler in Mountjoy for a period, I might be liable to engage in exaggeration as Deputy Gregory did in the other House. I know he will not mind me giving him honourable mention here; he would want me to do it as frequently as I can. He claimed they were all being fined <Col N="809" /> £1,000 and £500.  I checked and found that 92 per cent of persons convicted between August 1992 and May 1995 were fined £50 or less.  If Seánie Lambe is listening in, I will respond to the letter in <i>The Irish Times</i> when and if it emerges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>There are other changes which improve the lot of the people about whom Senator O'Toole is concerned.  These include the requirement to display only the number of their licence.  I understand Senator Fahey's point but the change was made following representations to the effect that requiring people to publish their home addresses and names on the licences could lead to their homes being vulnerable to break-ins while they were doing business in Moore Street.  These are some of the realities of life in parts of urban Ireland.  I am not saying it would apply in Gort, Dingle or Mallow but it is a real consideration for these people. That is why they need only display the number of the certificate.  This is adequate and it will also be the situation in Donegal that one will have to produce the number of the certificate and the Garda can then chase the real owner of the licence.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go back over the discussion we had about the difference between occasional traders and casual traders.  Casual traders implies that they are a permanent feature of the landscape at a designated site on a regular basis.  In their case this is more than adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a desperate plea to win Senator O'Toole's vote, I have made representations to City Hall about new pitches. <Col N="810" /> This is a matter for Dublin Corporation, not for me.  As both Senator Norris and Senator O'Toole said, about 40 people with no licences are trading illegally or are called unofficial traders.  They are hounded day in and day out despite the fact that their grandmothers traded at Moore Street.  They are in a catch 22 situation. They cannot win as the law stands.  I have made vigorous representations to the county manager from whom I have correspondence.  My officials have been in touch with officials in Dublin Corporation about designating new pitches for traders. They say it is easier to talk about it than it is to do it.  The women say if they got approximately ten new pitches they could live with the situation.  The provision of ten additional pitches is under consideration by Dublin City Hall and that is all I can say about it.  The honest answer to Senator O'Toole is that there is nothing in the Bill that gives me power to require Dublin Corporation to do this.  The more one thinks about that of course, the more correct it is.  If this was not the case the Minister could require any local authority to do his bidding. The purpose of the Bill is to devolve powers to local authorities and allow them to make these decisions.</P>
    <P>It is not just important culturally, as someone argued, that the colour, atmosphere and character of Moore Street be protected; it is also politically desirable. The leader of Fianna Fáil agrees that Moore Street should be protected as did former leaders of Fianna Fáil.  If it ever got out of this House that anybody here wanted to adversely affect Moore Street, it would go down very badly in the wider political community.  I am glad we are all agreed on that.</P>

Flower selling in Grafton Street has gone on since Senator Norris was a boy, which is not that long ago, and it went on in his <Col N="811" /> father's time as well.  Somehow or other the florist association and that feature will have to coexist.  Under the new Bill it is for Dublin Corporation to decide what happens in Grafton Street.  It can make by-laws as suits it.  It can even make by-laws in South Dublin County Council to provide for selling Christmas trees at Glenasmole.</P>

      <P>Before I reply to a point raised by Senator Reynolds I want to make it clear that all designations will only last until the existing casual trading licences and permits expire.  After that local authorities will be required to make new designations under the by-law procedures in the legislation.  If any new designations proposed are considered unacceptable, it will be open to the traders to appeal against the by-law proposal via the District Court.  That meets Senator Reynold's fear that the existing designations only last for the duration of the existing permits.  After that new ones are designated in accordance with local knowledge of local features.  If somebody wants to appeal against that on behalf of, for example, the casual trading community, the facility is there.</P>

    <P>Senator McGowan spoke about implementation.  The 1980 Act provides that the Minister can appoint authorised officers.  This is in addition to the powers of local authorities to appoint authorised officers for enforcement purposes. In practice, however, the Act is enforced by the local authorities and the Garda.  The Bill does not provide for a continuing enforcement function by the Minister as this would be contrary to the decentralisation concept.  In addition, the Bill does not impose new duties of any significance on local authorities beyond those imposed in the 1980 Act. <Col N="812" /> This legislation gives them new powers and tidies up the situation.</P>
    <P>The prosecutorial system will be more efficient, for example, as a result of a presumption in the Bill in section 3 (5). Members can see there is a presumption that a person was engaging in casual trading, unless the contrary is shown to be true.  The local authorities in particular made recommendations about this. Significant additional powers have been given to the Garda under section 11 of the Bill which should meet the situation, as there are no additional impositions of any significance.  Senator Farrelly's query relates to occasional rather than casual trading.</P>
    <P>I have at least attempted to deal with the questions raised.  This is not a controversial Bill; it is a sensible measure, devolving to local authorities powers of designation, licensing and supervision of the phenomenon of casual trading with which we all want to coexist.  The regular trading community have rights in terms of their taxes and rates, but I do not think anybody would want to terminate casual trading.  The Bill simply seeks to strike an acceptable <i>via media</i> between the two.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. l:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), after &ldquo;area&rdquo; to add &ldquo;and includes traders who visit the State on occasions to sell their goods on stalls or in the market place.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not satisfied; far from it and that is why I proposed this amendment.  The <Col N="813" /> distinction the Minister made between casual and occasional trading has further confused me.  He pulled this new distinction out of the hat and will further confuse those who will implement the legislation.</P>
    <P>Those implementing this legislation have additional powers but the Minister did not mention extra funding.  A man came to my house and offered to paint my barn for £600.  I had previously received a quote for £1,200.  He had a £38,000 Landrover and a telephone in the cab and I asked him for his address, his tax number and a sample of his paint.  He pulled out a leaflet from an English company &mdash; this leaflet could be picked up in any shop.  The name of a very reputable company and the tax number were printed on the bottom of the leaflet.  This Bill will not legislate for those people and the Minister is signalling a further way out for the many people who do business this way.  These people are driving a horse and cart through the legislation.</P>
    <P>There is a grave need to legislate for people who come to this State with lorry loads of carpets, televisions and other goods.  No restrictions are placed on them, they trade on the side of the road with their televisions piled high and they advertise new sets at half price.  Those televisions are guaranteed by people who do not have an address in the State. The Minister should explain that to business people in Letterkenny, Ballybofey and other towns in Donegal who are struggling to pay their tax, rates and bills.</P>
    <P>The Minister says the casual trading legislation covers occasional traders over whom the Garda have no authority. I am asking the Minister to amend the Bill.  There is no point in telling me that it already covers these traders because I know it does not.  I am looking for legislation and for a positive response.  We are in agreement on the necessity for this Bill; and I am looking for the Minister's co-operation to bring major traders within it.  We are not talking about the person who sells a few daffodils, bananas or strawberries; we <Col N="814" /> are talking about a much bigger type of client.  The Moore Street traders and others covered in the legislation are small fry in comparison to the traders I am talking about.</P>
    <P>If the Minister dismisses me and says that this is a fringe trading element that comes across the Border occasionally, he is not living in the real world.  I suggest the Minister drives back tomorrow through Carrickmacross to see what &ldquo;occasional&rdquo; or &ldquo;casual&rdquo; trading means. I am shocked at the fact that the Minister dismissed my proposal so lightly and I ask him sincerely to include provision to control those who come to this State with lorry loads of merchandise and trade freely.  The Minister should not let them off the hook by saying they are occasional traders, because he is giving them an out and confusing the Garda and the local authority.  This Bill will not have served its purpose if he ignores what I am asking him to do.</P>

      <P>I raised this matter earlier and I was satisfied with the Minister's response.  He distinguished casual trading from occasional trading.  The type of person Senator McGowan was speaking about has to be classified as an occasional trader because he has no pitch or licence, but if he decides to go to Navan or Kells he must look for a licence and then he would become a casual trader under the Bill.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that the Occasional Trading Act, 1979, needs to be updated on the basis of what has been said during the debate.  I do not believe anyone is objecting to the type of situation to which Senator McGowan referred.  It is dealt with under different legislation.  I would like the Minister to clarify this issue.  I thought he had already done so.</P>

      <P>I take the distinction between &ldquo;occasional trader&rdquo; and &ldquo;casual trader&rdquo;.  The Minister explained it quite comprehensively in his Second Stage reply.  However, there are traders who fall into the category to which Senator McGowan referred.  I have seen <Col N="815" /> people in Drogheda who own a Mitsubishi Pajero with English registration plates, selling carpets in the market.  I do not know if these people are English or Irish or what is the origin of the vehicle they are driving.  However, there are people who are trading casually who fall into the category referred to by Senator McGowan.</P>

      <P>What is the difference between casual trading and occasional trading?  There is a tradition in the south-east of selling strawberries by the side of the road.  They are only sold during a six weeks to two months period.  I presume that such trading comes under the description of occasional trading and that the strawberry growers can continue with it.  Is that interpretation correct?</P>

      <P>I assure Senator McGowan that the last thing I want to do is dismiss his argument and it is unfair of him to say that I did so.  I am merely trying to point out that this Bill is about casual trading not occasional trading.  I have stated that I will begin the process of revamping the Occasional Trading Act, 1979.  There would be no point in my sending the Senator back to Letterkenny to tell the local Garda superintendent that, under the Casual Trading Act, he may proceed against some of the characters mentioned earlier, if when the superintendent arrived at the District Court he discovered that his actions were futile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not easy to provide Senator Townsend with a definition which will apply in all cases.  As Senator Dardis stated, some of Senator McGowan's points are included and are, therefore, addressable under this legislation.  The strawberries example the Senator gave falls into the area of casual trading and is covered by the Bill.  That will be a matter for his local authority to deal with and regulate as it sees fit.  The Bill <Col N="816" /> devolves the authority on the local authority.</P>
    <P>To return to Senator McGowan's argument, if a person offered to paint the Senator's shed or hay barn for a sum of £600 &mdash; when, perhaps, it should be £1,200 &mdash; that person is not selling a product within the meaning of this Bill, he is selling a service.  From a legal standpoint a contract for services is involved, which raises different issues.  I acknowledge the point made by the Senator but I also acknowledge that some fairly unique circumstances are involved.  I will see if it can be addressed under the revision of the Occasional Trading Act.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No 2:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (1), after line 51 to add the following proviso:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Provided that, a casual trading licence shall not be granted by a local authority unless a tax clearance certificate in relation to that licence has been issued in accordance with section 242 (as amended by section 6) of the Finance Act, 1992.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This matter was fully debated on Second Stage and the Minister has replied comprehensively.  The amendment seeks to restore the original provision in the Bill in respect of the tax clearance certificate.  The same wording has been used as appeared in the Bill as initiated.  I apologise that I have allowed the &ldquo;in relation to&rdquo; disease to creep into the amendment but I took the wording from the original Bill which states &ldquo;a tax clearance certificate in relation to that licence&rdquo;, when it should state &ldquo;a tax clearance certificate for that licence&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="817" /> This comes back to a question of equity. It involves, not the big trader, but the small trader &mdash; the garden centre, the market gardener, the florist and the person selling Christmas trees &mdash; attempting to compete with the casual trader.  There should be equal treatment for both.  There are two ways of dealing with this issue, one of which would be to relax the restrictions on people who are involved in &ldquo;legitimate&rdquo; activity.  I do not suggest that casual trading is not legitimate activity.</P>
    <P>I wish to correct something the Minister stated with regard to the RSI number and other sections of our community. I had the fortune &mdash; or misfortune, depending on how one looked upon it &mdash; to attend a large public meeting in Castlebar where a person in the audience asked why sheep farmers should be required to submit an RSI number.  I told them that if a small builder in Castlebar tendered for a public works project he would be required to furnish a tax clearance certificate.  I also advised them that this would be the case if they were in receipt of funds from the State.  That statement went down like a lead balloon.  My record on that particular issue will stand up to examination.</P>
    <P>To return to the matter I raised regarding Deputy Quinn who, in his capacity as Minister for Enterprise and Employment, said on 9 March 1994:</P>
    <P>This was a specific requirement contained in the Government decision approving the general scheme of the Bill and is a reflection of the Government's determination that the tax burden should be as equitable as possible for all sections of the community.</P>
    <P>I do not expect Deputy Rabbitte to be bound by that constraint because he was not in Government at the time. However, it is curious that the person who is now Minister for Finance finds it necessary to support legislation of which he had a clear cut view when he introduced it.  If this matter is put to a division, it will be interesting to see how <Col N="818" /> the Labour Party Members vote as we go through the lobbies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Dardis stated, we have adequately debated this issue.  I do not believe there are two different points of view on it.  I accept the Senator's reply on Castlebar and acknowledge it as the reason why his party and mine are unlikely to return a Member for Mayo West for some time. However, I must continue to try to make this Bill fit the reality.</P>
      <P>With regard to any conflict between what my colleague, Deputy Quinn, may have stated previously and his current position, it was only after the publication of the Bill that the difficulties to which the legislation may give rise, particularly in places such as Moore Street, became evident.  I have been very frank in admitting that this is, and always has been, the problem.  We simply have had to cater for that situation. As the debate continues, the impression is being given that the requirement not to produce a tax clearance certificate is equivalent to tax exemption.  It is not. No one is exempt.  That is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance.  Perhaps the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, as Minister for Enterprise and Employment, was seeking to do something he can only now do as Minister for Finance. That is the best I can do to explain it.</P>

      <P>I would like to raise an outstanding matter which the Minister did not deal with comprehensively in his reply to Second Stage.  I asked about the administrative system he had in mind and I said I would need to be confident that it was adequate to deal with the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I dealt with that.  An RSI number is effectively a tax number.  Any vigilant authorities who want to supervise the correct implementation of the tax system have all the information they require to do so.  I am assured by the Department of Finance <Col N="819" /> and the Revenue Commissioners that this is a perfectly efficacious way of achieving the same objective.  If, for example, one looks at the measures in the Finance Bill concerning tenants in private rented accommodation and the strategy which has been introduced to enable landlords to be tracked down, it too is a similar arrangement.  It is essentially an administrative one and I hope it will produce results.  I will be frank with the Senator and say that this stems from the Moore Street phenomenon.  I am afraid it will not produce a tax yield of any significance anyway.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>We have come to a sorry pass if we legislate for Moore Street.  I accept everything said about it in terms of its inestimable value to the nation and its connection with Molly Malone whose statue was erected in Dublin, but we are getting into dangerous and muddy water if we go down to that level because, with respect, it is not the function of Government, which must think more of the generality than the particular. I accept what the Minister said about the RSI number and taxation but many of these people do not have a taxable income so the difficulty will not arise.  Where there is taxable income, it should be the same for all citizens. Senator O'Toole dealt with this matter on Second Stage.  There should be a unified tax system which would overcome many of these difficulties.  It is unfair on people with small businesses.  I do not want to go over this again and I accept the distinction but there should be equity in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I do not believe illiteracy is the issue.  If I had a couple of hundred acres as distinct from a pram in Moore Street, I would probably manage even if I was illiterate.  In reply to Senator Townsend, a tax clearance certificate would be required.  As regards Senator Dardis's serious point about equity and that it is not the Government's job to base law on a minority or a sectional interest like Moore Street &mdash; perhaps it is not a desirable way to do so &mdash; equally it is not equitable to frame law which would trample on the pram ladies in Moore Street.  They also have rights as they have plied their wares in the city for hundreds of years and we should seek to protect them.  They do not ask for anything from the State.  The records show that they are not in the system and, believe it or not, they do not draw social welfare in most cases.</P>
      <P>If I was to introduce a programme for tax evasion, I would not start with the pram ladies in Moore Street.  It is not as if Senator Dardis could argue &mdash; I know he is not doing so &mdash; that they are the only exception in the country; there are others.  I instanced the case of headage payments to farmers getting substantial transfers from Brussels.  Yet there was such a brouhaha when the notion of a tax clearance certificate was mooted that it was killed off.  There may or may not be practical reasons for that, but I will not open that debate tonight.  I do not believe the Senator should press an amendment which has been motivated by trying to protect part of what is considered to be the character of the city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Currie, for coming to the House.</P>
      <P>I am concerned at the likely effects of changes in health insurance regulations being proposed by the Minister for Health, Deputy Michael Noonan, including the effect they will have on the future availability and quality of psychiatric care in Ireland.  At present, people in need of psychiatric treatment who are members of the VHI are entitled to 180 days in-patient treatment each year and people who are suffering from alcohol dependence or other forms of substance abuse are entitled to 90 days in-patient treatment every five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The draft regulations pursuant to the Health Insurance Act, 1994, have been published and the Minister is proposing that companies wishing to offer health insurance in Ireland need only provide a minimum of 40 days in-patient treatment per year, and for sufferers of substance abuse, only 40 days in-patient treatment in a subscriber's lifetime.  I am concerned, as are providers of the service and families of patients, that these minimum periods will become the norm.  This is not acceptable.  Many people who suffer from psychiatric illness recover very quickly, but many more need long term care and support in order to recover fully.  Mental disorders which are treated by modern psychiatry do not involve highly expensive, hi-tech appliances.  However, they rely <Col N="822" /> on some effective treatment methods and these can take place over a long time.</P>
    <P>It appears that it is only psychiatry and the psychiatrically ill that are being singled out for discrimination in terms of the time allowed for in-patient treatment under this new proposal.  There is no other area within the health services in which the Minister is proposing to set minimum cover periods.  By doing so in the area of psychiatric illnesses he is discriminating against sufferers in a way that would not be acceptable in any other form of illness, and is not acceptable with regard to psychiatric illnesses.</P>
    <P>The alteration in cover for people suffering from psychiatric illnesses will reduce the role of private psychiatric services from that of providing professional in-patient treatment and after care to short term care because many patients will not be able to afford to stay in these institutions for longer than the period that is going to be covered by the insurance costs.  They will, therefore, have to use public psychiatric hospitals which are already strained, or else become a burden to their families. Indeed, the introduction of this severe restriction will have a very damaging impact on the sufferers of psychiatric illnesses, especially their families, who will then bear the burden of caring for them when their health insurance cover expires.</P>
    <P>There is no need for such a draconian minimum period and the VHI, which is the only health insurance company currently operating in this country, has not sought a reduction in the number of days allowable, either for psychiatric illnesses or for those suffering from alcohol or drug dependency.  The competition in the health insurance market will not, therefore, be affected by this new legislation which demands a minimum that is less than is covered at present.</P>
    <P>Why did the Minister for Health find it necessary to introduce this minimum requirement and why has he refused to meet representatives of the two major providers of psychiatric care in Ireland, <Col N="823" /> St.  Patrick's Hospital and St. John of God Hospital?  I understand that they treat more than 90 per cent of all private psychiatric patients in this country. There is a misconception that these private psychiatric hospitals tend to have people suffering from alcohol abuse for long periods.  However, it has been shown that the average length of stay in these hospitals is no longer than the average length of stay in general public hospitals, so this argument cannot be levied against them.</P>
    <P>I have had representations from a number of people, including parents of psychiatrically ill patients and from the hospitals, who believe that this minimum level, which is likely to become the basic level, will result in approximately 30 per cent of patients currently being treated in the private psychiatric sector having to seek care from the public sector. Patients most seriously affected would be those who suffer from serious psychiatric illnesses, who tend to spend longer than usual in psychiatric hospitals.  They are people who are single, separated, female and young, people who have, in the main, been committed to psychiatric hospitals because they are psychotic and disturbed. Many of them are part of the most vulnerable groups who do not have much social support, resources or family support.  These changes could, therefore, seriously affect this group of people in a way that would not be acceptable.</P>
    <P>The alterations in cover for people suffering from alcohol dependence and other forms of substance abuse, from the current provision of 90 in-patient days every five years to 40 days in a lifetime, will reduce the role of private psychiatric services to that of providing scarce and valuable professional in-patient treatment.  In addition, the restrictions on in-patient psychiatric care, together with the miserly recommended but minimum rate for day care psychiatric services, which is £15 per patient per day, will effectively mean that the role currently played by private psychiatric <Col N="824" /> services will be substantially eroded.  There is a policy to attempt to move people out from large psychiatric institutions and to attempt to have people treated, where possible, in the community or by attending day care hospitals.  In this respect, a rate of £15 per patient per day is a small amount to pay these hospitals.  There is no incentive for them to develop these day care facilities.</P>
    <P>The proposed changes will be borne by patients who are most seriously affected by psychiatric illnesses, and by their families.  Would it be possible for the Minister for Health to meet with representatives of these patients and the hospitals who are currently looking after them?  Would the Minister also consider ensuring that the level of cover currently being provided by the VHI would be the recommended minimum levels under the new regulations and that the psychiatrically ill would be treated no differently from patients suffering from any other physical illness?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Honan for raising this issue and for giving me the opportunity to elaborate on it.  As part of the Single Market developments in the EU, all health insurance companies who wish to enter the Irish health insurance market must meet certain criteria set out in the Health Insurance Act, 1994.  This Act came into effect on 1 July 1994.  These criteria are that premia must be community rated and that insurers guarantee open enrolment to their schemes and lifetime cover.  A further requirement is that insurers must provide a minimum level of benefit so that their members have a guaranteed level of cover against costs. The draft health insurance regulations which have been issued to interested parties have been written pursuant to the 1994 Act.  Departmental officials have consulted with a wide range of interest groups, including public and private sector service providers, since the publication of the draft regulations. The consultation phase on the regulations, <Col N="825" /> which began last March, is now being finalised.</P>
      <P>For psychiatric services the draft health insurance regulations require insurers to provide a minimum of 40 day in-patient cover in any one benefit year. They also set out minimum payments in relation to in-patient and day patient services in private psychiatric hospitals. The minimum cover of 40 days for in-patient treatment is, I would emphasise, only a minimum period designed to set a basic level of cover for in-patient psychiatric treatment.  Insurance companies are free to offer any higher level of cover they wish.  I stress this is the first time that psychiatric cover will be required on a statutory basis and the minimum requirement of 40 days will, therefore, give a guarantee to subscribers that some level of such cover will be available to them.  It will also prevent a situation developing whereby, as in many health insurance schemes abroad, insurers refuse to offer benefit for psychiatric care or offer it at less than 30 days.</P>
      <P>The benefits payable to private psychiatric hospitals for in-patient and day patient services have been set at a level so as not to be inherently inflationary. If they were set any higher a situation could arise whereby a hospital which charges rates lower than the minimum benefit would be paid at the higher rate.</P>
      <P>With regard to the specific issue of day care cover, the Department of Health is currently examining the components of day care in psychiatric hospitals.  The area is, however, ill-defined and the Department is examining the possibility of dropping the requirement for day care cover in the regulations and examining it in a review of the minimum benefit regulations by an assessor later this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is essential the minimum benefit entitlement does not adversely constrain the development of a competitive market in private health insurance.  In arriving at the minimum benefit levels set out in the draft health insurance regulations, we have tried to strike a <Col N="826" /> balance between the commercial needs of the insurer and protecting consumers by requiring companies to provide a minimum level of cover across a broad range of services.</P>
    <P>The EU Commission would not accept a regulatory framework which would require insurers to offer benefit which simply repeated the 180 days hospital cover available from the dominant insurer.  It would see this as presenting a barrier to trade to insurers, which goes against the thrust of the Single Market.</P>
    <P>These regulations are not set in stone. The Minister will appoint a minimum benefits assessor in the autumn whose role will be to review the minimum benefit regulations.  The assessor will review the regulations to take account of developments in the market, new technology and procedures and inflation.  The regulations can be changed to incorporate the recommendations made to the Minister for Health by the assessor.  In the autumn the Department will consult with all interested parties, including the private psychiatric sector, in regard to the appointment of the assessor.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister, Deputy Taylor, for attending this evening.  Ireland is a leading country in the human genome project, that is, the identification of all human genes.  Some of the most important recent developments in medicine have been in the field of genetics.  These advances have been exciting but they have also been a cause of anxiety for some people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The diagnosis of diseases due to faulty genes is far ahead of the possible cure or amelioration of many of these conditions.  Some people now know of their genetic predisposition to a disease but not whether this disease will become manifest.  There are many diseases where lifestyle and environmental factors can be as important as genetic predisposition.  However, there are <Col N="827" /> social and psychological factors which are influenced by the knowledge of the faulty genes.</P>
    <P>It is enough for a healthy person to find the presence of an abnormal gene without the additional worry that this could be held against him in employment or any other area.  The Department of Equality and Law Reform is bringing forward additional legislation regarding equality in employment on foot of a European directive and I hope this legislation will go further than the directive.  I recently pointed out during the discussion of another Bill that the Minister has often gone further than EU directives in the legislation he presents. I hope this legislation will outlaw discrimination on the basis that an apparently healthy person had an abnormal gene.</P>
    <P>This type of legislation is under consideration or has been enacted in other European countries.  The US Equal Employment Opportunities Commission has barred gene discrimination under the Americans with Disability Act earlier this year.  This is the first federal document to declare it illegal for an employer to discriminate against a worker on his or her genetic make-up.</P>
    <P>Such legislation is needed here.  While it is important from a civil rights aspect it is also important from a medical perspective. In the past none of us knew our genetic make-up.  It is now known that certain conditions &mdash; some serious, some less so &mdash; run in certain families. In some circumstances the disease may develop inevitably but in others this is not the case.  It may be possible for a person with a genetic tendency to a certain disease to so modify their behaviour that the disease will not develop.</P>
    <P>If a person has a genetic predisposition towards hypercholesteralaemia, that is having high fat levels which can cause heart disease, it could be valuable for them to know this early in their lives so that they might find a suitable diet, exercise more and refrain from smoking. Indeed, they could do all the things we should all do.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="828" /> Many patients would be reluctant to undergo such tests if they felt the results could be used against them later.  Medical and lifestyle changes could prevent or delay the onset of cardiac diseases in the cases I have mentioned.  There are other conditions where a change in lifestyle or a modification of environment could be important.</P>
    <P>The US Equal Employment Opportunities Commission acted because some employers in the US were insisting on employees taking genetic tests if it came to their notice that a member of the family had an hereditary condition. I read of one serious case where an employer found out the mother of a girl he employed had Huntingdon's chorea. This is a serious neurological condition with mental and physical problems, which, however, do not usually develop until a person reaches the fourth decade of life.</P>
    <P>The girl was forced by her employer on threat of dismissal to have a gene test to see if she carried the gene.  Given this is an inevitable condition this was extremely serious.  About 50 per cent of the children of sufferers of Huntingdon's chorea will develop it.  Tragically, when this girl took the test she found she had the gene and would develop the condition.  This knowledge destroyed her life totally.  She might not have known her fate for another 20 years but she was forced into this knowledge due to having to take the test.</P>
    <P>Fortunately, with most conditions a genetic defect need only predispose a person to having a disease.  These conditions apply to almost everyone: almost all of us could say we have an abnormal gene, but it may never affect us in later life.  We could all be classified as &ldquo;genetically disabled&rdquo; but we should not be classified as &ldquo;disabled&rdquo; until a particular condition develops.</P>
    <P>There are serious social and ethical issues involved in mapping genes and using information so acquired.  Genetic records should be kept private and should not be used for employment, insurance or any other discrimination, but should only be used in a manner <Col N="829" /> helpful to the individual involved or their family.</P>
    <P>We must go forward on this topic to avoid people feeling genetically stigmatised. The science of eugenics has a dubious and unpleasant background. The real science of genetics should have a bright and hopeful future for mankind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Henry for her informative contribution on this topic.  The question of equality, as regards equal status and employment equality, is central to my brief as Minister for Equality and Law Reform and discrimination on the grounds of disability is a significant part of that brief.</P>
      <P>Since taking office, I have established the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.  The commission, which was set up in 1993, is expected to report back to me at the end of this year.  The task of the commission is to advise the Government on the practical measures necessary to ensure that people with a disability can exercise their rights to participate to the fullest extent of their potential in economic, social and cultural life.</P>
      <P>In addition, I am committed also to the preparation of legislation which will prohibit discrimination on a wide range of grounds, including age, disability, gender, family and marital status, race, religion and membership of the travelling community.  I hope to bring this legislation before the Oireachtas in the autumn session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In its deliberations, the commission has been engaged in the most extensive consultation exercise since the foundation of the State with people with disabilities, their parents and carers and other interested parties.  It has also established a number of working groups to examine specific areas affecting the lives of people with disabilities, including the issues of health and of training and employment.  On receipt of the report, I will examine its recommendations with a view to considering what measures may be required by me and <Col N="830" /> my colleagues in Government to improve the employment prospects and general welfare of people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>I listened carefully to the Senator's concern that employers may be discriminating or could discriminate unfairly against people who are healthy but whose genetic background may dispose them to particular illnesses.  I understand genetic testing is a relatively new field of study and there are practical questions as to the relevance, accuracy and reliability of these tests.  There are also ethical questions with regard to personal privacy and medical practice that fall to be resolved as the field of knowledge develops and expands. These issues have fuelled medical debate in recent times and will undoubtedly continue to do so for some time to come.</P>
    <P>In some countries where employment practices are well developed, such as the United States, Australia and New Zealand, there is protection not alone for people whose disability is manifest but also for those whose disability is not manifest.  For example, there is protection for healthy people whose prospect of future illness can be identified in advance and for people to whom a disability may be imputed either on rational grounds or for reasons of prejudice. Listening to the Senator's contribution and other evidence, there may be a deal of sense in considering the adoption of a fairly broad ranging approach to discrimination on grounds of disability.</P>
    <P>In employment, there are legitimate and unfair grounds on which an employer may discriminate as between employees and prospective employees. Obviously, an employer must be free to recruit and retain in his or her organisation people who are fully competent, available and capable of doing the work for which they are paid.  I expect most employers take health into account in assessing the availability and capability of employees and prospective employees.  For example, an employee with a serious recurring illness that <Col N="831" /> necessitates frequent sick absence is clearly not fully available for work.</P>
    <P>At the same time, it is essential that whatever the testing methods, they are reasonable and proportionate for an employer to apply in the particular case. What is reasonable and proportionate will depend largely on the job in question. Medical considerations that might legitimately rule out a person for employment as an airline pilot might be totally inappropriate if applied in another context.</P>
    <P>The legislation for employment equality, which I will bring forward in the autumn, will deal with some of the issues raised in the debate.  Discrimination is a complex area and I intend <Col N="832" /> that the legislation will be even-handed in its approach.  It will give much needed means of redress to people who have suffered unfair discrimination in relation to employment.  At the same time, the legislation will also have to take into account circumstances where there are good work related reasons for distinguishing on health grounds between prospective applicants for employment, training or promotion. Achieving the right balance between the protection of the rights of the individual and the legitimate concerns of the community is the challenge faced by the Oireachtas in this sphere.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 9.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 12 July 1995.</P>
