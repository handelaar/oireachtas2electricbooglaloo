      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Before announcing the Order of Business, I wish to say that the past two weeks have been among the most traumatic in the history of this House.  On behalf of the House, I wish to thank the staff of the House for the extraordinary amount of extra hard work they did and the understanding they have shown over the past two weeks.  We are all in their debt.  I also wish to thank Senator Cassidy for the very professional and highly competent way in which he helped to organise the funeral of the late Cathaoirleach.  It was done with total professionalism and good taste and it helped us to pay the tribute we wanted to our late Cathaoirleach.</P>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is items 1, 2, 3 and 4.  Item 1 will be taken straight away.  Item 2 is to conclude and will be followed by the Second Stage of item 3 which will continue until 1 o'clock. There will be a sos at 1 o'clock.  At 2 o'clock we will take item 4 after which we will come back to complete item 3 if that is agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I deal with the Order of Business, I wish to be associated with the Leader's remarks in relation to last week's arrangements, <Col N="614" /> and in particular those of the last two days, for our late friend and colleague Seán Fallon.  I also wish to be associated with his remarks about all the staff, past and present, who put so much time into the organisation of the removal of the remains and the Mass yesterday.  As the Leader has rightly done, I would single out my colleague Senator Cassidy and I wish to put on record our thanks for his efforts in ensuring the smooth running of the service.</P>
      <P>On item 3, is it intended to clear that Bill today?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Independent Senators I support what Senator Manning and Senator Wright have said about the work, kindness, thought and care that the staff of the House put into the organisation of the last few weeks when we were all in such distress, even though they too were in great distress. Had I been in the situation of Senator Fallon over the last few weeks I would hope to have had a friend like Senator Donie Cassidy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I also wish to be associated with the remarks that have been made.  The staff have had two very difficult weeks, particularly last week when they had a Bill with an enormous number of amendments in the middle of all the other things they had to cope with. I echo what has been said about Senator Cassidy.  It was obviously very difficult for him because he had to deal with a bereavement on a personal basis as well as organising matters which he did extremely well.  Yesterday's funeral service was conducted in a very dignified way, for which Senator Cassidy can take a great deal of credit.</P>
      <P>In respect of item 3, the Transfer of Sentenced Prisoners Bill, has the Leader a time limit in mind for Second Stage speeches?</P>

      <P>In respect of the earlier all-party motion on East Timor endorsing the Lisbon declaration, we should note that the person designated to be the Indonesian Ambassador to Australia was not appointed because he was associated with some of the things that have happened in East Timor.  That is to be welcomed and I hope we can keep up the pressure in this area.  I would like the Leader to report to us, if not today then at a later stage, on what action has been taken on foot of the motion that was passed here.  What has the Government done as regards that motion? Have they brought any pressure to bear on behalf of the Irish people?</P>

      <P>I wish to be associated with the words of thanks to the staff and to Senator Cassidy in relation to the funeral arrangements.  A great deal of work had to be done behind the scenes and it was done with skill and care.  That vote of thanks is deserved, particularly as the staff had worked so closely with the Cathaoirleach; their sense of grief was very strong yet they were able to carry out their duties.</P>

      <P>I would like to avail of this opportunity to express the gratitude of Seán's wife, Anne, and his family. The Members of this House and the staff, in particular, were a great comfort to them in the past two to three weeks. I want to pay tribute to the staff of the House who, kindly and generously, travelled to County Westmeath during the past three days and worked so effectively and efficiently to ensure the smooth passage of Seán's funeral.  I thank the leaders of the various groups and the Leas-Chathaoirleach for all their help in carrying out those functions <Col N="616" /> during the past number of days.  If Seán were here he would be the first to do the same for any one of us, had the situation arisen.  I am grateful for the remarks made by the leaders of the various groups and the Leader of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past three weeks I have criticised the fact that the Minister for Finance came to this House and suggested that the Government would not produce the report of the OECD, at a cost of approximately £3,000, to give Members the opportunity to debate that report in a proper manner.  Newspaper reports this morning say that the Taoiseach has appointed a new adviser with a salary of £46,752.  If he can pay that amount of money for another adviser, the Taoiseach and Minister for Finance should at least give Members the opportunity to properly debate matters in both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly.  I would like to know if it was suggested by the Minister for Finance that it was illegal to photocopy the OECD report.  From where did that legal advice come?  I cannot find the illegality in photocopying an OECD report.  Perhaps permission might have to be sought, but I think that would be forthcoming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator George Mitchell addressed the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs earlier this week.  During his submission it was suggested that the International Fund for Ireland is under severe threat. There are two threats.  First, the Republicans, who are seeking cuts in the United States' budget, are asking that the $20 million allocated to the International Fund for Ireland each year should be completely eliminated.  I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach to ensure that all pressure is brought to bear on the newly elected Republican majority in the United States to ensure there is no <Col N="617" /> interference with the International Fund for Ireland.  This is another case where leaders, presidents or kings can make public statements of intent to give but when the chips are down they do not follow through on that commitment. I apologise for taking so much time on this issue.  The second threat comes from a caucus of Republicans and Democrats who want to attach strings to the allocation of $20 million.  They are suggesting that the McBride principles should be introduced before any allocations are made.  I ask the Government, and any Members in both Houses who have contacts with American Congressmen or Senators, to get in touch with them immediately.  If the IFI fund is not brought up to date, we will have terrible problems.</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to investigate the comments made by the President of the European Union in Dublin this week, who when questioned about job employment in the EU blamed individual Governments and said it was not the job of the European Union to protect employment.  At the Congress of Irish Trade Unions yesterday, the President of the European Trade Union Congress suggested that the European Union would supply an extra 15 million jobs between now and the year 2000.  The President of the European Union said it will not.</P>

      <P>I join with you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, and other Members of the House in the sincere thanks to the staff for the dignified manner in which the funeral of the late Seán Fallon took place yesterday.  The last few days were a busy time for everybody concerned.  I also thank Senator Cassidy.</P>
      <P>I was unavoidably absent when the House paid due tribute to Seán Fallon. I will not delay the House but I want to say a brief word.  I join with all the wishes and statements made about Seán Fallon last Tuesday.  I knew him for 20 years and, since I came to this House, I got to know him very well.  He was a very humble and kind man who never thought about his own aches, pains and bad health.  He was always concerned about other people, ensuring they got a fair crack of the whip, and that the business of the House was run properly and fairly.  This House has lost a great friend and a great Cathaoirleach.  His wife, Anne, and family have lost a wonderful family man who was an example to us all.  He had great patience.  The country has lost a great man.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I pay tribute to the Garda Síochána for the wonderful work they do in cracking down on drugs and particularly the crackdown on the manufacture of drugs in Dublin.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Justice if she would put undercover surveillance officers into discos and similar places? While it is good to get at the boys at the top, drugs are still distributed and are available in discos and wherever youth groups gather.  It is important that there should be undercover people in these places.  If we could put young people off selling drugs and put the suppliers to the discos out of business, we would really be getting on top of the problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I know all the Senators are pleased to have me back.  I missed the occasion when people paid tribute to Seán Fallon.  At a time when politicians come in for a lot of stick, he was a shining example of all that is best in the public service and in political life on all sides of this House and in party politics in this country.  It is a pity that critics of politicians do not look at people like Seán Fallon because he is an inspiration to us all.</P>
      <P>I want to ask the Leader for time to discuss three items.  The first is the relationship which will be established between the Environmental Protection Agency and the local authorities.  There is a need to ensure a seamless transfer of responsibility, particularly for environmental emissions, between the Environmental Protection Agency and the local authorities.  I have a case in my own constituency of a horrific foul smell in the town of Dunlavin.  I am not happy that there is a seamless transfer of power.  It would be a good idea if the Leader could put some time aside to discuss the Environmental Protection Agency, how it will operate and how public representatives can assist in feeding material to it.  The Environmental Protection Agency is now fully operational and we need to relate it better to the work we do at local authority level.</P>
      <P>I hoped this week to raise the issue of Clonmannon in another House.  I ask the Leader of the House for some time to discuss it next week.  He shares my personal concern, as do the Members on the benches opposite.  The Minister has taken additional legal advice in the last five weeks and that advice is now to hand and he is contemplating court action in addition to any action the DPP might consider.  I am loth to look for a further Adjournment debate but I ask the Leader to assist in some way next week before we go into the summer recess.  People on all sides of the House would agree with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe there is a lacuna in the local authority housing legislation in the matter of drug dealers and pushers and the abuse of local authority tenancies for <Col N="620" /> drug dealing.  I have come across this problem in two housing estates in the town in which I live and every other local authority in every urban area has the same problem.  The balance is wrong at the moment.  The local authority tenants who are abusing their tenancies are not answerable and there should be a much easier way for local authorities to take effective action.</P>
    <P>Could we schedule some discussion on the housing legislation to show political willingness on all sides of the House and to assist the Minister and the Minister of State responsible in the Department of the Environment and the local authorities in bringing this extraordinary scourge to an end?  If we could have some time to discuss that I think the Leader will receive assistance from all sides of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I was unable to be present when tribute was paid to Senator Fallon. He was a man of elephantine fortitude in the way he bore his illness.  I wish to express my sincere sympathy.</P>
      <P>I believe the office of the Chief Herald has been vacant for some time now and I hear a rumour that it may not be filled.  I would like to hear the Minister's comment on this.  It would be a tragic loss to this country if the office were not to be filled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Dardis spoke about East Timor.  I am not aware of what he said but I will discuss the matter with him afterwards and convey his concern to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of a lengthy question Senator Lanigan raised three issues.  I take note of what he said about the photocopying and provision of documentation and I will try to establish the legal position as well as the financial one on that.  We all agree with his concerns about the International Fund for <Col N="621" /> Ireland and his points were well made on that.  I did not quite get the gist of his question on the European Union but I will not ask him to repeat the question. I will discuss it with him afterwards.</P>
    <P>I take Senator Farrell's points about underground surveillance and will convey them to the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>Senator Roche is very welcome back. He fought the good fight and certainly it is no personal fault of his that the result went the way it did.  I doubt if I will be able to make time available next week for any of the issues he has raised. We are, however, sitting the week after that and there may be time there.  I will talk to him about that afterwards.</P>
    <P>I will try to get the information Senator Honan requested.  I do not know what the position is in regard to the office of the Chief Herald but I will make inquiries; it would be a great shame if that office was not filled.</P>
    <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

      <P>Section 3 comprises three parts which build on the amendment of section 8 of the 1940 Act, which is provided for in section 2.  There are three subsections.  The first provides validation of renewals of minerals prospecting licences effected at any time before this Bill becomes law as if the licences had contained valid renewal clauses.  The second provides validation of renewal clauses contained in minerals prospecting licences granted before this Bill becomes law.  The third is a standard technical provision which ensures the validations effected in the first and second subsections will have full effect in all cases except to the extent that they must be limited in order not to infringe any constitutional rights yet to be demonstrated in any particular case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second Stage a great deal of reference was made to the report on minerals development, which indicated a number of changes in the legislation on minerals development which are necessary.  The point has been made that this is a technical Bill and that much broader legislation is required.  In the event of further comprehensive legislation on minerals development being introduced, will the sections of the Bill have to be changed? If this is the case, we will be duplicating work which will already have been done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the application of fees for mining, there is a view that we should encourage further mining in Ireland.  A considerable amount of work must be done in relation to the mining and exploration business.  It is essential that the Industrial Development Authority, which for some reason is excluded from this type of activity, be involved in grant aiding, supporting and taking initiatives to open up the prospects for further exploration.  Will the Minister satisfy us that the application of fees will not be seen as a disincentive to the exploration business?</P>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that some exploration work was carried out in my constituency in the 1960s.  I would like to put on record my appreciation to the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Stagg, for information he sent me arising from comments I made on Second Stage.  He indicated that there was further interest in the west Clare basin, which is the extension of an area of west Clare where some exploration was carried out in the early 1960s.  I would like the Minister's assurance that this will be progressed as far as possible.  In a climate where we are endeavouring to attract people to explore possibilities for further development and employment in terms of natural resources, the application of fees will be a disincentive rather than an incentive to such activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the only section of the Bill on which there has been considerable debate in the Dáil and here. As was said at the time, the practice has been to charge handling fees as part of a comprehensive fee in connection with the grant of a relevant State mining <Col N="624" /> lease or licence.  To date, there is no clear statutory provision and without this there would be no guarantee of securing an appropriate handling fee in the event that an application for a State mining lease or licence is unsuccessful or is withdrawn after considerable expense was incurred by the Minister in processing it.</P>
      <P>This is especially true where major complex projects are involved which require the engagement of external advisers fully <i>au fait</i> with specialist mining issues of long term importance and with best practice.  Often independent advice is required in a specialist area and generally this is only available from abroad.  We want to tie down in statute the right of the Minister to recoup expenses incurred by the State or his Department in properly assessing and analysing any application, particularly complex major applications for mining leases or licences which come before it.</P>
      <P>Senator Daly may not be aware that amendments were made to this section in the Dáil and I hope they will allay any fears he may have.  Subsections (3), (4) and (5) were added on Report Stage in the Dáil and are consequential to subsection (2) as so amended.  I hope the Senator is satisfied.</P>
      <P>Subsection (3) is a standard technical provision which makes it clear that regulations under this section to specify application fees may differentiate between classes of cases and different circumstances.  Subsection (4) is modelled on section 94 (2) of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992.  Its purpose is to require payment of the application fee or the requisite part thereof where payment by instalments is allowed before the Minister can consider or, as the case may be, decide on an application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (5) is a standard provision which requires presentation to the Dáil and Seanad of all regulations made under this section and giving each House 21 sitting days in which to annul those regulations if it should so decide. I hope the tightening up of this section <Col N="625" /> dealing with the charging of fees satisfies any concerns the Senator may have.</P>

      <P>It is not good policy if the IDA cannot invite in or use its expertise to assist those making applications for these mineral licences.  Why is the IDA excluded from the mineral development programme and funding? The IDA has a wealth of expertise all over the world built up over many years. There is an opportunity here for successes, similar to those in my own area of Ballinalack outside Mullingar, where Barrymine was located in the 1970s, and also of Tara Mines, which has been a great employer in my area and in the midlands generally.</P>
      <P>Most of those who emigrated in the 1960s were able to return in the 1970s and give the benefit of their expertise. At least 300 people from north County Westmeath and north County Meath returned from Canada and have since been working at Tara Mines.  We had high hopes in Mullingar that a similar development would take place.  It would be a disincentive if, given its expertise in this area, the IDA were to be excluded from this activity.  What plans has the Minister to ensure that the Government will address this problem?</P>

      <P>The Minister must be careful to achieve a proper balance with regard to the granting of licences.  It is important, largely for environmental purposes, that they be investigated thoroughly.  The payment of fees is acceptable provided they are reasonable and the State is not at a loss.  It is essential that a further examination takes place at Government level, not only on the issue of fees but also on the taxation of profits, which is more of a disincentive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the 1950s the late Seán Lemass granted mining rights off the coast at a fee of £500 for each of the different boxes, as they were divided at the time, because he was anxious that exploration work should proceed.  We in this House and the Government should try to ensure that in whatever works are carried <Col N="626" /> out, care is taken to ensure that the environment &mdash; water supplies, air and so on &mdash; is not damaged or destroyed and that areas worked upon are left in a proper manner.  However, at the same time we must make far greater efforts in this area.  According to the Stock Exchange, only a small number of people are prepared to invest in exploration in Ireland.  It is important, therefore, that we provide incentives.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senators for their contributions.  With regard to the question of the involvement of the IDA, my sympathy is on the side of the Senator.  I am advised that this is one of the many items that are being considered in the context of the review group's report.  If I can presume to read from the Senator's question, I hope, like him, that we will see greater involvement of our development and marketing agencies in mineral resources in this country.</P>
      <P>There will always be a tension between development and the environment. This is healthy.  It can be used to ensure that any development, especially in mineral prospecting, is done sensitively and with concern, not only for its environmental but its social impact.  This is as it should be.  However, because there is tension with regard to the environment and mineral development, this does not mean we should have a &ldquo;softly softly&rdquo; attitude to it from the Government.  It does not mean that it should be a no go area or that we are almost afraid to get up front and sell our wares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am stepping a little beyond my brief as Minister of State when I say that I detect that several Governments have been afraid of this area in that they have not vigorously marketed an enormous potential in this country because they were not comfortable in handling any environmental backlash.  We must face the problems up front and deal with them.  When it is not environmentally acceptable to develop, you do not develop.  In most cases, any of the concerns of the local people &mdash; many of <Col N="627" /> them real, more perceived &mdash; can be dealt with and their fears can be assuaged.  I would like to see a more up front, transparent &mdash; if I dare use that word &mdash; attitude towards handling this area from now on.  I would like to see the feel good factor put back into mineral development in this country, and I have said this before; if you do not grow it, you must mine it.  Everything we use today in modern society is either grown or mined so when we have valuable natural resources, we must have a positive Government policy on how we develop them for the benefit of our people and for generations to come.</P>
    <P>I am confident we can get right the balance between environment and development.  We have an Environmental Protection Agency in place, we have excellent local authorities who know what they are about now and we have a Minister for the Environment who can co-ordinate the efforts of his Department and the Departments of Transport, Energy and Communications and Enterprise and Employment.  Let us move forward positively.  Let us get our regulatory and tax climates right.  Let us be up front and let us move on this area. It has been a hush, hush, hands off, no go area for too long.  People have been afraid of it, basically; that is my honest opinion.</P>
    <P>I accept the points being made by Senators and I hope I have covered them sufficiently.  With the changes that were made in the Dáil in relation to fees, this section has been strengthened.  Anybody with a major mining project applying to the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications will understand that the Department must scrutinise it fully and it must have the expertise and experience to do so.  It would not pay the Department or the taxpayer to have these experts sit in the Department day in and day out for two or three major projects per year, if we are lucky.  There must be balance.  We buy in expertise and consultants' advice as we need it.  Any developer will only be charged the actual cost of fully assessing and scrutinising the application. <Col N="628" /> That is what this section is all about.</P>
    <P>If we are quite clear and up front about our regulatory environment generally and if developers know where the Irish Government stands in relation to the regulation of mineral development, a fair and just fee for assessing any application will not put anybody off.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister puts a lot of emphasis on the environment and we all share her concerns.  Apart from land exploration, there is enormous potential in offshore exploration.  There is an opportunity for the Government to create sustainable jobs from the expertise gained in various projects here over the last 25 years.  I concur with the Minister that most Governments may not have addressed this problem in the past as seriously as we are calling for today.</P>
      <P>While it is very reassuring to hear some of the Minister's views, we want an assurance that this problem will be addressed in the immediate future by her Department and the IDA.  It is fine to talk of three or four experts in a Department in Dublin but, as far as my limited knowledge of the world of exploration is concerned, it is a small industry that controls an enormous potential for jobs.  The people involved in the industry all over the world have specialised in these areas and if something happens in Australia, the Yukon or anywhere else, all these experts know each other; there may be only 5,000 people involved at that level of exploration because of its high risk nature. With that in mind, the opportunity and potential for jobs here is enormous.</P>
      <P>There has been a lot of research here and many wells have been bored over the last 25 years.  We heard Senator Daly speak of County Clare, which has a high priority in relation to drilling. The Ballinalack site in the midlands had enormous potential.  It featured on the Irish Stock Exchange for a number of years.  Now it is ready to be put into operation if incentives are given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the environment, it need not involve above-ground exploration. <Col N="629" /> As far as I know, the Ballinalack site can be an underground exploration. Maybe at the end of the year we can come back and review the situation and the Minister can have another look at the problem, discuss it with Government colleagues and see what prospects can then be discussed later in the year.</P>

      <P>This is my first opportunity since the <Col N="631" /> death of the Cathaoirleach to pay my respects in this House to the late Seán Fallon.  As was said in all the tributes, he was a superb representative and a splendid Cathaoirleach.  I am happy to join with the other tributes paid in this House.</P>
      <P>Since its publication in April this Bill has received a positive welcome both outside and inside the Oireachtas.  A number of amendments were made in the other House and I think it is fair to say that the Bill in the form now before this House represents a comprehensive and effective measure which I am sure we are all anxious to see passed into law as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to enable Ireland to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons.  It will also enable us to ratify an EU agreement which supplements the convention in terms of its operation among member states.</P>
      <P>Much of the attention given to this measure since its publication has arisen in the context of the role it will play as part of the consolidation of the peace process.  Certainly it has that positive and worthwhile role and I know that will be much welcomed by the House. However, I believe Senators will equally welcome that the convention makes no distinction based on categories of prisoners; in other words applications can be made under the convention irrespective of whether there is a paramilitary background to the offences for which people are serving sentences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basic aim of the convention is to provide for a simple and expeditious procedure under which persons sentenced in a foreign country can serve their sentence or balance of their sentence in their country of origin.  It might be helpful to highlight two key aspects. First, the transfer procedure is entirely voluntary.  The sentenced person, the state to which he or she is seeking a transfer and the state where he or she is serving a sentence all must consent to the transfer.  Second, although it is a Council of Europe Convention it is not <Col N="632" /> confined to Council of Europe countries. Accession by non-member states is possible and so, for example, the convention applies to the United States and Canada.  Thus far 26 of the 34 Council of Europe member states, as well as five non-member states, have ratified the convention.  Also, four EU states have given effect to the EU agreement on the operation of the convention among member states.</P>
    <P>A key consideration in bringing forward this measure is its likely implications for prison accommodation. While concerns clearly arise in this regard I believe they are not insurmountable and what will be at issue in practice is drawing the right balance between facilitating transfers on humanitarian grounds as much as possible and at the same time ensuring that undue pressure is not placed on our prison system.</P>
    <P>The convention does not place an obligation on any contracting party to effect a transfer.  Instead, emphasis is placed on the three way consent I mentioned. Special emphasis is placed on the consent of the sentenced person. Nothing would be gained by transferring someone against his or her will and without the person appreciating fully what the legal consequences of the transfer might be.  In addition to that three way consent, the convention lays down other criteria which must be satisfied before a transfer can take place.  I will deal with these in some detail in my comments on individual sections of the Bill.</P>
    <P>As regards transfers of prisoners into this country, the Bill proposes to use the procedure of continued enforcement set out in the convention.  This is considered the more straightforward of the two procedures provided for in the convention and should operate with greater certainty and thus generally in the best interests of the sentenced person.  Legal authority for the continued enforcement in the State of a sentence imposed by a foreign state will be provided by way of warrant issued by the High Court on <Col N="633" /> application by me as Minister once I have consented to the transfer.</P>
    <P>The facilitation of transfers abroad is treated under the Bill as an entirely administrative function as distinct from involving a judicial process.  The Bill provides a legislative basis for the exercise of that administrative function.  In keeping with the aim of the convention to provide a speedy and simple mechanism for transfers, the Bill provides that the legal authority for transfers out will be simply by way of warrant issued by me as Minister and there is no need for application to court.</P>
    <P>Section 1 of the Bill deals with interpretation and follows closely the definitions in the convention.  Section 2 is a new section inserted during the passage of the Bill through the other House.  The effect of this section is to make it possible for a transfer to take place between this country and a state which is not party to the convention.</P>
    <P>There may be states which, for one reason of another, choose not to commit themselves to entering into a multilateral arrangement, but which would nevertheless, be willing to deal with Ireland on a bilateral basis.  Section 2 gives such bilateral arrangements binding legal effect.</P>
    <P>Section 3 is another new section added to the Bill in the other House.  It provides that foreign nationals serving sentences here must be informed of the substance of the Bill in order that they may make an informed choice as to whether to seek to avail of it.  Sections 4 and 5 deal with applications and legal authority for transfers of persons out of the State.  Under section 4 applications for transfers must be made in writing to me as Minister by or, in certain circumstances, on behalf of the sentenced person concerned.</P>
    <P>Before an application can be granted the conditions for transfer as laid down by the convention must be met.  The first condition is that the applicant is a national of the receiving or administering state.  Where, however, the person is a national of another EU member state that has ratified the 1987 agreement, <Col N="634" /> that person may be deemed to fulfil this condition.  The second condition is that the sentence must be final and enforceable.  Essentially, all available remedies must be exhausted.  This does not, however, preclude the possibility of a later judicial review of the sentence or a petition for pardon in light of fresh evidence under the Criminal Procedure Act, 1993.</P>
    <P>The third condition concerns the length of sentence still to be served. Normally this must be of at least six months duration or be indeterminate.  In exceptional cases, however, this requirement need not be rigidly complied with and a transfer can be effected where there is less than six months left to serve.  The fourth condition is that the transfer must be voluntary.  The sentenced person must consent freely and with full knowledge of what the legal effect of his or her transfer will be.</P>
    <P>The fifth condition is that the offence concerned would constitute a criminal offence if committed in the administering state.  This is intended to ensure compliance with the principle of dual criminal liability.  It is not necessary that the criminal offence be precisely the same in all respects under the law of this jurisdiction and that of the sentencing state.  However, some element of comparability or compatibility is necessary. The sixth and final condition is that the administering state must also agree to the transfer.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill provides that the legal authority for the transfer of a person out of the State will be by way of warrant issued by the Minister for Justice. The warrant provides authority for the taking of the sentenced person to the point of departure from the State &mdash; which will normally be an airport &mdash; and for handing him or her over to the escorting officer authorised by the administering state.  After a person has been transferred, the sentence imposed by this jurisdiction will continue to be enforceable so that if, for instance, the person should escape from lawful custody he or she would be liable to be <Col N="635" /> taken into custody on foot of the original court order.</P>
    <P>The sentence will cease to be enforceable, however, once the receiving or administering state considers enforcement to have been completed.  Accordingly, section 5 (7) provides that the Minister may direct that the sentence be varied or cease altogether in order to give effect to the convention.</P>
    <P>The procedure for transfers into the State is set out in sections 6 and 7.  The grounds for a transfer are, to all intents and purposes, the same as those for outgoing transfers which I have just outlined. The one significant difference is the role the High Court has to play in providing the legal authority for the transfer once it has been consented to.</P>
    <P>Applications for inward transfer must be made either by the sentencing state or directly to me by the sentenced person. The Bill, as initiated, had provision only for the former method of application, that is, by the sentencing state, but I thought it prudent to bring forward an amendment in the other House to allow for applications to come direct to me from the prisoner as well as from the state where the prisoner is held.  The ability of a person in another state to apply directly to me should help with any difficulty there may be of other countries delaying the transmissions of applications.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been amended to make it clear that the term &ldquo;national&rdquo; for the purposes of application for transfer into the State should be interpreted in its widest possible sense.  It includes persons who, although not strictly speaking nationals have close ties with this country. Once I, as Minister, have satisfied myself that these transfer requirements under the convention have been met and I agree to the transfer, it would be a matter for me to apply to the High Court for the issue of a warrant providing legal authority for the bringing of the person into the State and the continued enforcement of the sentence here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="636" /> The role of the High Court is set out in section 7.  In sum, the court must issue a warrant if satisfied that the necessary conditions for transfer have been fulfilled. In issuing a warrant for continued enforcement, the court will be bound by the type of penalty and duration of sentence as determined by the sentencing state.  There may occasionally be cases, however, where the legal nature or duration of the sentence imposed in the foreign jurisdiction will be incompatible with the law of this State.  In such cases the High Court may, under section 7 (5), adapt the sentence to one prescribed by the law of this State for a similar offence.  The adaptation procedure must take place within the very limited boundaries specified in subsection (6).  Essentially, the High Court may adapt the sentence to the nearest equivalent available provided this does not result in a longer sentence so that the sentenced person is no less well off from the point of view of the length of time still to be served.</P>
    <P>An addition to section 7 (4), which was made in the other House, seeks to make explicit in the Bill that the High Court, in issuing a warrant for continued enforcement, must take into account any remission accrued in the sentencing state.  The issue of the warrant will mean, in practice, that the balance of the sentence to be served in this jurisdiction will have the same effect as if it were a sentence imposed here.  It will not be subject to appeal since that remains the prerogative of the sentencing state but in all other respects, it will be served in precisely the same way as a sentence imposed here and subject to all the normal rules governing administration of sentence generally, including remission and temporary release.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for the legal custody of the person being transferred into the state in accordance with a High Court warrant and the designation and powers of persons authorised to take the person to and from any place under the warrant.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Bill contains a general power for the Minister or the High <Col N="637" /> Court, as the case may be, to revoke or vary the warrant under which the person has been transferred either out of or into the State in order to give effect to the convention where necessary.</P>
    <P>Section 10 of the Bill is yet another new provision agreed in the other House.  It deals with two things.  First, it inserts what might be called an &ldquo;anti-discrimination&rdquo; clause into the Bill, which provides that in considering applications for transfer there can be no discrimination between applicants without good reason.  Second, subsection (2) deals with an obligation on me to furnish a statement specifying the grounds for any refusal of an application for transfer under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 11 is an addition to the Bill which I instigated in the other House. Its effect will be that each year I will put before the Oireachtas an annual report in relation to the operation of all aspects of the Bill.  Section 12 of the Bill proposes the standard form of expenses provision and section 13 is the short title.</P>
    <P>These are the Bills's main provisions. I am sure the House will accept that this Bill will have a positive benefit for Irish nationals who are serving sentences in foreign prisons, particularly for their families.  Equally, it will provide an avenue of hope for those non-nationals who happen to have been sentenced in this jurisdiction but who would prefer to be in their home country.</P>
    <P>Given the humanitarian nature of what is being proposed and the part which this measure will play in the consolidation of the peace process, I am confident, in commending this Bill, that it will be welcomed in this House.  The measure before the House is one to which the Government and myself have given priority.  It is in that context that I would like to thank the Seanad for its co-operation in rescheduling the debate on the Bill and ensuring its enactment as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Miss Ormonde Miss Ormonde">

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the Seanad.  I also welcome this Bill, which empowers the State to ratify <Col N="638" /> the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons.</P>
      <P>This process has been in motion since 1983.  The fact that we are only now discussing it clearly indicates that it is overdue in the light of the ceasefire in Northern Ireland over the last ten months.  It is important we acknowledge the ceasefire in this way and facilitate the transfer of our people imprisoned in the United Kingdom and United Kingdom people imprisoned in this country to the country of their birth.</P>
      <P>Apart from the convention ratification, this legislation is also important from a humanitarian point of view.  I recently read Deputy Ó Cuív's report on his visit to English prisons.  I was astounded to read the conditions applying there in terms of the restrictions put on prisoners' families and the costs incurred in visiting their loved ones in England.</P>
      <P>Nothing has changed.  One only has to look at the release of Private Clegg, who was transferred to England soon after his conviction.  Prisoners convicted for attempted murder in maximum security prisons in England are not allowed access to their families.  It costs around £300 for one parent to visit their son in an English prison.  If they were to bring any more than one person, the cost would immediately increase to around £1,000.  Therefore, this legislation is necessary from a humanitarian point of view.  It is also necessary to speed up the process to give these prisoners the chance to move back near their loved ones.  I welcome the fact that we are now able to do something in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister talked about the implementation of this legislation when it comes to issuing and revoking warrants. However, when we look at the number of prisoners already in our prisons, we must ask ourselves how will we be able to find room for more.  Will prisoners be let out on bail to make room for those who may wish to come back?  We have a serious problem with the high number of prisoners in our prisons.  The Minister did not say how many Irish prisoners in British prisons wish to come back.  It is <Col N="639" /> important to have this information before we move any further on this matter. We should know the number of prisoners who wish to avail of this facility and how many places would be available for them.  One month ago, work was stopped on the building of a prison at Castlerea.  That prison would have been welcome in light of this legislation.</P>
    <P>Many prisoners who may want to come back might wish to further their education.  What facilities will be provided in our prisons?  I did not hear the Minister refer to that in her contribution and I would like her to give us more information on how they would be integrated into our prison system.  I am very concerned about education for rehabilitation of prisoners.</P>
    <P>I am also worried about the increased power this legislation gives to the Minister. This is framework legislation designed to facilitate the transfer of prisoners from the country of their incarceration to the country of their birth.  While I accept that, the mechanism to implement it gives the Minister the power to decide whether a particular prisoner will be allowed to be transferred. If an application is turned down, will the families have recourse to the Minister to find out why that happened? We do not have enough information in this regard.</P>
    <P>The public welcomes this legislation because it allows people to move from one country to another to serve their prison sentences.  The Bill deals with different types of prison sentences but the information is vague.  I am worried about how the Minister will implement the decision to transfer a prisoner from the United Kingdom to this country and if there will be remission for the prisoner moving here.</P>
    <P>I welcome the thrust of the Bill.  Perhaps the Minister could clarify what recourse a family or prisoner has if their application is turned down.  Is it possible to review the decision?  The Minister did not give us such information in her speech.  This Bill is long overdue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="640" /> The ceasefire has been in operation for ten months.  We should now show goodwill towards our prisoners in the United Kingdom and open up our borders between Ireland, Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom.  Goodwill will exist between the two countries if we remove barriers and obstacles. Nationals and non-nationals in this country welcome this legislation which will allow the transfer of prisoners from this country to the UK and from the UK to here.</P>
    <P>We must provide prison spaces for these prisoners.  I am worried about this because we do not have enough space for the considerable number of prisoners we have in this country.  Such aspects must be considered before this Bill is implemented because we do not want the process delayed by lack of prison spaces.  I would like to discuss this area because the legislation is no good unless it is properly implemented.</P>

      <P>I join with the Leader in welcoming the Minister to the House to discuss this important Bill which ratifies the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons.  This is the only country in the European Union which has not done so.  Since the convention will not be ratified until the Bill passes the House, it is important to ratify it as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>This legislation will further enhance and strengthen the peace process.  The exchange of prisoners will be of benefit to Ireland, to the peace process and to people in the United Kingdom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concern has been expressed about the number of people in prisons in Ireland.  I understand there are approximately 180 foreign prisoners here and approximately 600 Irish people in prisons overseas.  The Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas issued a report which stated that approximately 40 prisoners <Col N="641" /> would seek a transfer immediately and that this would level off over a period of time.  It is difficult to give definite figures.  A number of Irish people in prison in the United Kingdom are married and their families live there.  Although they will now be able to serve their prison sentences here, they may decide to stay in Britain because of their families. This matter will probably resolve itself over a period of time.</P>
    <P>The Council of Europe took the initiative in this matter and it deserves a special word of praise and thanks for its work.  Other countries, such as the United States, favour this approach.</P>
    <P>We all understand the problems of foreigners in prison in Ireland because they have different cultures and languages and there are difficulties as regards relatives visiting them.  There are approximately 600 Irish people in prison overseas.  Irish prisoners in Britain are deprived of their liberty and this has a dramatic effect on them and they suffer further emotional and psychiatric problems if their relatives and friends cannot visit them in prison.  I welcome the fact that the Bill addresses this problem.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the transfer procedures will be on a voluntary basis because difficulties could arise if foreign Governments applied to have people transferred back who did not want to go.  This is a fair procedure.</P>
    <P>Where the Minister consents to a request for a transfer, application shall be made to the High Court rather than the Circuit Court or the District Court. I presume she is doing this for constitutional reasons.  As regards the costs involved, I am not sure funding will be provided for advice or applications to the court.  Perhaps the Minister could clarify this.  The procedures, as envisaged in this Bill, are reasonably straightforward and should not cause too many difficulties.</P>
    <P>I accept the necessity for a final court decision.  It would be useless to transfer people backwards and forwards before a final court decision is made.  The judicial review is welcome because circumstances <Col N="642" /> or laws may change and a person could then be granted liberty for a judicial review.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a provision in relation to prisoners who have six months of their sentence still to serve.  While people might say that is not a particularly long time, it could be a long time for some people for a variety of reasons.  For example, the wife of a man in prison in another jurisdiction may be ill, or the prisoner's health might be poor or their children may be growing up.  They will be able to apply for a transfer and there will be discretion in that regard.  This is a welcome move.</P>
    <P>The Bill is welcome.  Most Irish prisons could do with improvement and modernisation but this applies to most prisons around the world.  This is a humanitarian Bill, the purpose of which is to help people who are in prison and to ensure they have access to visitors.  I congratulate the Minister and I wish the Bill a speedy passage through the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I compliment the Minister for bringing it forward so rapidly.  I am sure she would be glad if I extended my thanks to the former Minister for Justice who also put much work into this area.</P>
      <P>The Minister was wise to accept some of the amendments put forward in the other House, particularly the one regarding sentenced persons from abroad being told of their rights.  This is often a serious problem when such people have difficulty with language. Another amendment dealt with the extension of the definition of a national, while a further amendment made transparency and openness as positive as possible so that people know why their request for a transfer is not granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret the Minister did not adopt more elements of the Dutch system rather than the British system in implementing the convention.  In the Dutch system, I understand the sentences are considered more in line with those which would be imposed within <Col N="643" /> the Netherlands rather than the country in which the crime was committed.  I hope this will not lead to trouble in our prisons when people are transferred from other countries with perhaps grossly different sentences from those who were sentenced by Irish courts.  I am sure the Minister had good reasons for doing this and perhaps she could explain them in her reply.</P>
    <P>The Bill is welcome on humanitarian grounds because in addition to the suffering of prisoners, the families of prisoners suffer for crimes which they did not commit.  If one only looks at prison in terms of incarceration, it does not matter where people are imprisoned. However, if one hopes for rehabilitation, virtually all prison reports on recidivism state it is essential that prisoners be as close to their families as possible while they are serving their sentences. Contact with their families and <i>vice versa</i> is essential to try to rehabilitate prisoners back into society.  Given the high rate of recidivism in Ireland, this area should be urgently addressed.</P>
    <P>The debate on this Bill to date has focused on prisons.  However, the Bill deals with sentenced persons and I am sure the Minister intends it to deal also with persons in other countries who have not been sentenced to prison.  I am thinking in particular of mentally disordered offenders.  The Green Paper on Mental Health, which was published in June 1992, contained an entire chapter on mentally disordered offenders.  It pointed out that the removal from prison of people who were mentally ill was a major goal in the last century.  We have not yet managed to achieve this goal.  I wish to point out that, in most European countries, those found to be mentally ill are not sentenced to prison but dealt with in hospitals.</P>
    <P>A judge in Ireland cannot transfer a psychiatrically ill person directly to a psychiatric hospital.  As the Minister is aware, they must be committed to prison first.  There is a serious discrepancy between the treatment they might receive in this country and in other <Col N="644" /> countries and this should be pointed out not only to the prisoner but also to those who are applying on their behalf for their return home.  They should be made aware that their treatment in this country may be grossly inferior to the treatment, if they are psychiatrically ill, they received abroad.</P>
    <P>My distinguished colleague Dr. Smith from Dundrum has pointed out that approximately 5 per cent of people in our prisons have serious psychiatric illness, such as schizophrenia and psychoses.  If we include the number of people in our prisons who are suffering from depression, the instance of psychiatric illness could perhaps be as high as 30 per cent.  It is impossible to find out the number of prisoners who are receiving psychotropic drugs.</P>
    <P>The previous Minister for Justice was asked this question but she refused to give the figures on the basis that it would infringe the medical confidentiality of prisoners.  I do not think that is the situation.  If we asked what percentage of the population of Ireland was taking sleeping tablets or other psychotrophic drugs it would not be considered an infringement of medical confidentiality. The public should know more about this type of situation and their right to information on these matters.  I hope the Minister will address this entire area.  We have no notion of the number of Irish people in psychiatric institutions abroad.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister for Health to tell me what has happened to the people who were discharged from long term psychiatric care into community care on 1 July 1993.  We all look forward to the treatment of an increasing number of people in the community but resources have not been put into treating people with severe psychiatric illnesses. I wish to know how many people are back in a psychiatric hospital, in prison, in England or in prison in England. These are very interesting questions. We might find that without proper supervision a substantial number of people have ended up in prisons here or abroad.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="645" /> I hope the Minister will address this issue; these people may be among the most important in terms of those repatriated to Ireland.  They and their friends and relations who want them returned to Ireland, should be informed that the incidence of suicide within our prisons is double the level in British prisons and that there is virtually no training for prison staff on how to recognise and deal with depressed prisoners.  The concentration in prisons has been on preventing prisoners hanging themselves. I appreciate this is the main method used by prisoners who take their own lives, but concentrating on its prevention is not the solution.</P>
    <P>The juvenile group has not been addressed to date.  This is a serious matter and we should try to repatriate this group as early as possible.  We know that approximately one third of those in detention are under 19 years of age and that a substantial number of juveniles are in prison when they should not be there at all because they are too young. The Minister has not been long in her job and I hope she does not think I am taking her on personally.  However, today's newspaper mentions yet another change regarding the detention of juveniles in Oberstown House; one wonders if there is a serious plan regarding the detention of juveniles in this country.</P>
    <P>I constantly read in the newspapers about judges stating they have nowhere to send juveniles.  This is an extremely serious problem and recidivism within this group is very high.  Parents appear before the Children's Court begging for their children to be taken into custody, but there is no secure or semi-secure custody for many of them and poor educational facilities are available to them. I could bore the Minister with details but she is aware of all the problems in this area.  However, it is a most important matter and we should try to have as many juveniles as possible returned to Ireland.  It will be disastrous if this cannot be done and we should try to ensure that they serve as much of their sentence as possible in Ireland <Col N="646" /> where they have ties.  Even if they are from broken families in Great Britain, they may have grandparents here who would take up their cause.  I hope that can be looked into as urgently as possible.</P>
    <P>This is a great opportunity to look seriously at what we can do within our own prisons to facilitate a better regime. The Minister will be glad to hear that I am not one of those urging her to increase the number of prison places, which seems to be a waste of time.  We have twice as many prisoners now as we had in 1980 and no one can say that the level of crime has halved &mdash; it has, in fact, more than doubled.</P>
    <P>The Minister must look at the serious problem of drug related crime, about which we are doing very little.  However, as the Minister probably knows, the Cherry Orchard facility, Cuan Dara, opened this week, although it was promised for the spring.  I am extremely glad because people telephone me and ask if I can get them admitted to somewhere safe so that they can try to get off drugs. It is quite ridiculous to have people telephoning local representatives asking to be taken into care.  The extension of these facilities is urgent.  There is very little treatment in prisons for alcohol abuse, apart from Alcoholics Anonymous. Narcotics Anonymous only appears to be able to give a limited amount of help in prisons.  The Minister knows the difficulties of trying to contain the drugs situation in Mountjoy, in particular.</P>
    <P>There are many complaints about the number of prisoners who are let out on temporary release.  However, I think that we could tackle this and the drugs problem together.  For example, while we do not have segregated units within our prisons for those who want to come off drugs, there could be a scheme of urine analysis during the week, whereby those whose urine was clear every day of the week would be given preferential treatment for weekend temporary release.  If there was a good match on that weekend many of them would be keen to stay off drugs for the week so <Col N="647" /> that they could go to the match.  It is quite an easy way to monitor who is&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is used in Dutch prisons. Testing blood levels would be beyond the beyonds and I would not ask that of the medical staff, who are already under a great deal of criticism in Mountjoy. However, I must point out that it is only in Mountjoy that the medical service seems to be in such disarray.  Doctors in other prisons seem to be providing as good a medical service as is possible.  It is important to remember that while people are in prison to lose their liberty, we are not entitled to give them inferior medical treatment.  This area must be looked at very carefully.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to implement as many parts of the Whitaker report as she can, which will reduce the numbers in prison.  For example, there is the possibility of increasing remission to a third of the sentence from a quarter for good behaviour.  I am not asking for murderers and major sex offenders to be let out.  I know that the Minister is addressing the question of non-payment of fines.  The problem is not the number of people in prison for non payment of fines but the terrible disruption to prisons by imprisoning people for a day or two.  I know that the Minister is aware that many of these people have worked out that it is much better to go to prison for a day or two than to pay a fine of £500.  I urge her to increase the use of the probation service and non custodial sentencing.  All of this was put forward ten years ago in the Whitaker report and this may be the time to address that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is an important part of the peace process.  I regret the lack of imagination shown in releasing Lee Clegg at this time.  It would have been much wiser to make that part of a package involving prisoners from the loyalist and republican sides.  However, it has <Col N="648" /> happened and it is fortunate that we are bringing forward this Bill so that we will be in a position to reciprocate as rapidly as possible.  It is essential in all elements of the peace process for this Government to make whatever initiatives it can.  We should in no way be seen to be lacking in making any efforts which can help the peace process, which was shown to have a fragile shell over the last few nights.  Mercifully, it seems to have settled down again.  I compliment the Minister on her speed in bringing this Bill before the House and, naturally, I will support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to unduly delay the passage of this legislation which has been anticipated for some time.  I compliment the Minister on expediting this Bill and getting it to this stage.  It is legislation to give effect to a convention which has been the subject of some discussion since 1978.</P>
      <P>I wish to put on record our appreciation of organisations such as the Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas which have done tremendous work in this regard.  There has been a campaign in my constituency for quite a while to secure the release of Joe O'Connell and Harry Duggan, two Clare people who have been held in custody in the United Kingdom.  An organisation called Saoirse has been actively campaigning in Clare for their release and I hope that the passage of this legislation will make it possible to examine these cases at an early date to see if the Minister for Justice can make the necessary arrangements to secure their transfer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The part which bothers me is in relation to the provision in the convention which gives absolute discretion to the member state to refuse to grant the release or transfer of a prisoner.  If there is a blank refusal on the part of a party to this convention to agree to a transfer, there is no mechanism in this legislation to seek judicial review by the European Court of Justice or some other authority. Both the convention and the legislation are deficient in that respect.  It may transpire that the member state will <Col N="649" /> have its way at the end of the day. However, where there is a difference of opinion and the member state is quite adamant in refusing to grant the application, there should be an appeals procedure.</P>
    <P>Article 23 of the convention indicates a provision for friendly settlement.  I presume that this will be a type of appeal mechanism.  In the event of a member state saying that there is no way that it is going to transfer Mr. Daly from whatever prison he is in, there should be some mechanism whereby that decision can be appealed.  I presume that the committee which exists under article 23 &mdash; the European Committee on Crime Problems of the Council of Europe &mdash; sits and adjudicates on issues.  Under article 23 of the convention it has a provision for friendly settlement, and I presume that where there is a disagreement between two member states in relation to the transfer of a prisoner, the committee can undertake some sort of negotiation.  However, it is not very clear how that would work in practice.  There is certainly no evidence in the legislation that this can be put into operation.</P>
    <P>Section 6 has a very clear subsection which says that the transfer cannot go ahead unless the sentencing state agrees.  To my mind that would prevent one from raising cases under the article 23 provisions.  Perhaps the Minister could clarify this in her Second Stage reply.  If there is no mechanism under this convention whereby a dispute can be resolved by a third party, be it the European Court of Justice or some other element of the convention, then the convention and the legislation will be deficient and this needs to be remedied now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all right.  A question arose from what Senator Enright said as to what the situation was, but in my opinion that is not the situation.  Many member states have signed the convention but have not given it statutory recognition in their legislative procedures. I am not sure whether that has changed recently or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the case, further work needs to be done to ensure that the other member states who have not given statutory legal effect to these provisions will do so in order that this can operate successfully.</P>
      <P>To a large extent this legislation is in the shadow of the prisoners situation in Northern Ireland and the whole peace process here.  While the Minister indicated that this convention was not particular to any category of prisoner, and the convention distinguishes that, nevertheless it is difficult to look at this legislation today and not be keenly aware of the prisoners issue in relation to the peace process and how it is currently slowing the peace process down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision of the British authorities to release Lee Clegg did untold damage to the peace process and to the negotiations on the prisoners' release issue generally.  If the British authorities deal with cases on an individual basis, as they did in the Lee Clegg case, rather than in a global manner, as the Taoiseach recently pointed out to the British Prime Minister should be done, then the prospect of finding a settlement of the Northern question and maintaining the <Col N="651" /> peace process will be seriously undermined and jeopardised.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of concern that people are out on the streets of Northern Ireland again, back into the violence we have seen and deplored for 25 years.  To some extent the responsibility for that situation rests fairly and squarely on the shoulders of Sir Patrick Mayhew and the British authorities.  At a sensitive time in the peace process they released Lee Clegg, knowing that would cause untold anxiety and would lead to a return of violence, including petrol bombings and other disruption, on the streets of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I hope that the British authorities can now adopt a sane approach and get down to dealing with the fundamental issues affecting the long term solution to the problems in Northern Ireland. Instead of dealing with these issues on a piecemeal, case by case basis, the British authorities should deal effectively with the prisoners' release issue so that we can move the peace process forward. There is an indication, at official level at any rate, that some new acceleration is being given to that effort.</P>
    <P>Overall, this legislation will help to reduce the tensions caused by the detention of prisoners, especially in prisons in the United Kingdom.  I welcome the legislation and fully support it.  I hope the Minister can respond to the point I raised about the appeals procedure mechanism.  Something should be written into our legislation to give effect to article 23 of the convention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I compliment her on bringing this Bill before us so quickly. I also compliment her for the welcome changes she made to the Bill during its passage through the Lower House.  The fact that she is willing to amend the original Bill displays a sense of maturity on the Minister's part.  We have seen examples of that already in this House, Minister, and I compliment you on making this a better Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="652" /> There is broad agreement among parties that this Bill is a necessary humanitarian measure which facilitates the transfer of sentenced persons from foreign states to Ireland, and vice versa, to serve the balance of their sentences in their home countries.  It is welcome on humanitarian grounds as well as being an essential part of the peace process.</P>
    <P>People who are imprisoned in a foreign state may suffer unduly and out of proportion to the crime they have committed. They are usually isolated in a foreign country and may suffer by reason of cultural or religious differences. They may sometimes be held in very bad prison conditions.  The fact that they are cut off from contact with their families and friends is a huge consideration.</P>
    <P>While the Bill has received broad agreement, we need to address one issue of concern to all of us.  We will now be bringing prisoners back from abroad, but we already have difficulty in containing persons sentenced to prison by our own courts.  Senator Henry said she was not asking the Minister for more prison spaces, but the fact that the Minister has postponed the building of Castlerea prison as well as the new women's prison must give cause for concern.</P>
    <P>The present prison system is failing in its duty to rehabilitate prisoners.  The cost of containing persons in prison is quite sizeable &mdash; just under £40,000 per annum, which is a huge and frightening cost.  Does the Minister accept that neither society nor the prisoners are getting value for that huge cost?  Many prisoners tend to reoffend and thus return to prison again and again.  There is no rehabilitation, education or training, no psychological or psychiatric services, no detoxification for drug addicts and very little benefit to the prisoners themselves or to society in general from the huge cost involved.</P>
    <P>People are concerned that the present prison system is not managing to contain people who have been committed to custody by the courts.  The device of temporary release is being used to disguise <Col N="653" /> the fact that many prisoners serve only between 25 and 50 per cent of their sentences.  Many prisoners spend only a few days or hours in prison.</P>
    <P>The fact that criminals are being released onto our streets in order to make room for others who have offended is not acceptable.  Criminals are no longer serving their full prison sentences and, therefore, prison does not act as a deterrent.  These criminals know how to take advantage of the system very well and they know that if they are caught they will have to serve very little time behind bars.  Even if they do spend time in prison, the fact that there is little rehabilitative work, counselling or training, particularly for drug addicts, provides very bad value both to the State and to prisoners.</P>
    <P>We have a revolving door system in our prisons.  If an accused person is remanded in custody, a sentenced criminal will have to be released to make room for them.  This is a crazy system. We need a separate remand centre so that people who are presumed innocent do not come into contact with hardened criminals.  It is also crazy to have young offenders mixing with hardened criminals and drug addicts.  Many of these people have no chance once they are imprisoned.  They will emerge in a worse state than that in which they entered prison.  They will probably embark on a life of crime and continue to be readmitted to prison.  This is very regrettable.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated in her speech to the Lower House that there were approximately 650 Irish nationals in foreign prisons and the majority of these, 75 per cent, are detained in Britain.  The Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas has estimated that something like 40 prisoners will be returning to Ireland immediately, with ten per year returning thereafter.  We must consider the effect that this will have on our prison system. What will the Minister do to address this issue, in view of the fact that she has postponed the building of Castlerea prison and the women's prison?  I accept the fact that not all prisoners held abroad would want to return to prison <Col N="654" /> in Ireland, because many would feel that greater emphasis is placed on training and rehabilitation in foreign prisons. We must be concerned about the numbers involved and the impact they will have on prison space in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister what her intentions are in relation to reforming the bail laws?  While we would advocate that they should be reviewed, this would also have an impact on the number of prison spaces. It is crucial that reform should be carried out in a considered and co-ordinated manner.  There is no point in reforming the bail laws if the only result is that convicted criminals are released to make room for persons remanded in custody.  Most crime is drug related, particularly in urban areas, and a secure medical unit should be established for the detention of drug users, both convicted and on remand.  There is need for a national detoxification unit for criminals who are drug addicts.  What are the Minister's intentions in relation to this particular area?</P>
    <P>I believe it is a very practical and sensible proposal and would make a real contribution to the fight against drugs. The State could use the time offenders spend in custody to assist them in coming off drugs permanently.  I am aware that it would cost a considerable amount of money to establish a unit of this kind. However, the cost of drug abuse to society is incalculable.  Our crime problem might be reduced by enabling people in prison to come off drugs. Many crimes, particularly in urban areas, result from people trying to feed their drug habit.  If we spent our money wisely we could get better value for detained persons themselves and society in general.  I urge the Minister to consider these proposals.  Perhaps she could outline her thinking on these matters.</P>
    <P>This Bill must prompt a complete review of our prison system.  We have seen that there are many inadequacies in it.  I know that the Minister is aware of these inadequacies.  I realise the huge cost implications involved with implementing many of the changes she <Col N="655" /> would like to introduce.  However, the cost of the prison system is quite sizeable at present and I do not believe we are getting very good value for that money.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes made in section 2 which allow a transfer to take place between this country and a state which is not party to the convention.  I also welcome the change in section 3 that foreign nationals must be informed of the substance of this Bill in order that they may make an informed choice as to whether or not they would like to avail of it.  Both changes were essential. The new section 10, where the Minister is obliged to furnish a statement specifying the grounds for any refusal of an application, is very welcome.  Laying the report before the Houses of the Oireachtas on an annual basis is also to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, on humanitarian grounds, with regard to the peace process. I support what other Senators have said in relation to the lack of imagination of the British in releasing Lee Clegg, which had a huge impact in the North.  They should have thought again about that release, with the peace process at such a delicate stage.  My only reservation about the Bill is in relation to the need to bring about changes to the present prison system in Ireland. Many changes are needed to reduce the number of people returning continuously to our prison system.  We have a very small number of women prisoners, but many of those in the women's prison in Mountjoy are feeding a drug habit and are involved in petty crime, bag snatching, etc.  They are returning to prison time after time.  In discussing this issue with the governor and assistant governor of the prison, it was frightening to hear that the daughters of women prisoners are now being imprisoned themselves because the only life they have seen is one of crime.  While in prison they are not given any great help to move away from a life of crime and drugs, which is regrettable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="656" /> I know that the Minister's heart is in the right place and she is considering these issues.  I am aware that she is probably experiencing difficulty in obtaining the funds she requires from the Department of Finance.  However, we should consider how we could spend the available money in a better way to reduce the number of people we need to send back to prison.</P>

      <P>I will not detain the House by reiterating what other speakers have stated.  I support the Bill.  I congratulate the Minister for introducing it with a degree of expedition which was challenged, most unfairly, in the Lower House.  I wish to express my own concern about the way in which the Lee Clegg affair has been handled.  I would also like to express bewilderment at the manner in which the British Government, having bitten the bullet in the Framework Document, have shown a certain lack of imagination in the way they have sought to implement the principles underlying that document.  Their performance in the application of the detail of the Framework Document has, so far, been distinctly inferior to that of our own Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill for all of the reasons hitherto advanced.  I hope it will make a contribution to the peace process and deal with the human problems of other types of prisoners in a humanitarian manner.  I hope it will be interpreted generously and magnanimously by all parties involved.  I have one question for the Minister.  The answer is probably before me, had I done my homework better.  Section 3 provides that foreign nationals serving sentences here must be informed of the substance of the Bill in order that they may make an informed choice as to whether or not to seek to avail of it.  That is very sensible. I note also that applications for inward transfer must be made either by the sentencing state or directly to the Minister by the sentenced person.  Who informs Irish prisoners abroad of their rights under this legislation?  Do we do that?  Do we have the information <Col N="657" /> needed to identify these prisoners?  Do we inform them now of the possibilities, or is that left to the sentencing state? This is simply a query to the Minister and is not meant to be adversarial in any way.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators for recognising that this Bill was speedily introduced.  Following the ceasfires last year it was indicated by the previous Government that they too were anxious to introduce this legislation.  We are ratifying a convention which was signed in 1987, so it has been a long time coming. However, there were probably all sorts of reasons why that was the case and we should not allow it take from the Bill.</P>
      <P>I want to address some of the issues raised because it is important to put the facts before the House.  Senator Enright helped me by putting forward some figures. It is difficult to say how many people will apply under this legislation because we have no experience of how it will operate.  It is not a fair assessment to just tally the number of Irish prisoners serving sentences abroad and automatically state that they will all seek to come back.  There will be many reasons why people will or will not use this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At any one time there are about 600 Irish prisoners serving sentences in jails abroad.  They are not all in countries <Col N="658" /> that have ratified the convention or countries which even want to avail of the bilateral mechanism we included in the legislation.  A country may not want to be involved in either a multilateral or bilateral arrangement, and unfortunately an Irish prisoner in such a country will not be able to avail of this legislation. Figures are changeable because of the nature of prison sentences.  The most recent figures indicate that there are 402 Irish prisoners in the United Kingdom, four in Belgium, 14 in France, four in Germany, two in Greece, seven in the Netherlands, eight in the USA and one each in Italy, Portugal, Spain and Canada.</P>
    <P>Approximately 35 of the 402 Irish prisoners in the United Kingdom are serving sentences for what would be termed paramilitary offences.  The Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas have intimated on several occasions that there will probably be about 35 to 40 applications initially.  I imagine they are, in a general way, referring to this body of prisoners in the United Kingdom.  It is fair to say that this group of prisoners would be better informed about this legislation because of the people dealing with them.  A single Irish prisoner in a prison outside of those where these paramilitary prisoners are serving sentences may not even be aware of this debate.  These prisoners are aware of it because their families are aware of it and organisations such as the Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas have been in constant touch with them.  Social workers and other people working for them in the UK are also keeping them informed.  As soon as this legislation becomes law they will be well aware of what is happening.</P>
    <P>As Senator Enright said, there are approximately 180 non-national prisoners in our prisons.  This convention and legislation represent a two-way process. There has been much comment about spaces and so on.  We hope there are prisoners here who will seek to return to their own countries.  On 15 March 1995 there were 184 non-national prisoners in our prisons.  Some 2.7 per <Col N="659" /> cent of the total prison population is from Northern Ireland, 5.7 per cent is from other EU countries and 0.2 per cent is from non-EU countries. Obviously, by far the biggest number would be those from the UK.</P>
    <P>On 15 March there were 103 English prisoners in our prisons and these may well seek to be transferred back to England; equally they may not.  The next biggest number was 57 prisoners from Northern Ireland.  There are ten Scottish prisoners, two from Germany, three Dutch prisoners and one each from America, Australia, Austria and Belgium, India, Italy, Malawi, Wales and Hong Kong.  They will all be informed, in a language and way which they can understand, of the terms of this legislation and perhaps some of them will seek to return to their own countries.</P>
    <P>We are the only EU member state which has not ratified the convention while 26 of the 34 Council of Europe member states have ratified it.  Other countries which have ratified the convention include Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Iceland, Malta, Norway, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland and Turkey.  The nonmember states are the Bahamas, Canada, Croatia, Trinidad and Tobago and the United States.  We have amended the Bill to allow for bilateral arrangements with countries because, sadly, Irish people occasionally get into trouble in countries which are not party to the convention but which may agree to such a bilateral arrangement.  These countries may include Thailand, Taiwan and other places where Irish people are now getting into trouble.</P>
    <P>A family member can apply under the legislation.  Section 4 of the Bill allows a legal representative or some suitable person to make the application on behalf of the prisoner.  This would apply where somebody is ill or suffering from a psychiatric ailment in a prison abroad. If a prisoner is refused &mdash; and obviously I will give them the grounds for refusal &mdash; there is nothing to stop that person <Col N="660" /> or their legal representative from applying again.</P>
    <P>I will always have to be sure that we can accept a prisoner back into our system and provide them with suitable accommodation.  If I get an application from a woman prisoner abroad and I have no place other than in a male prison, I will have to put the application on hold until I have a place for a female prisoner.  If I get an application from somebody suffering from AIDS or other illness and I believe that the most appropriate place for them is the health care unit of a prison, I will have to be sure there is a place for them.  Those are the relevant considerations and any Minister must have the freedom of choice and discretion to make the decisions.</P>
    <P>It is not unusual for a Minister or local authority to have such a discretion. If a person applies to a county council for housing, the council must have the discretion to be able to say that it has accepted the application but cannot accommodate the person because it does not have a house for them.  There was much comment about this during the debate in the other House and there was an attitude that I should automatically grant applications and say I have places for these prisoners.  I must have discretion.</P>
    <P>I want to stress that the kernels of this convention are agreement and voluntariness. There is no onus on a prisoner to take a transfer if a sentencing or administering state says they want them to do so.  It must be agreed by the prisoner, the sentencing state and the administering state.  That is a safeguard.  People tend to think it is only a safeguard for the countries, but it is also a safeguard for prisoners.  A situation could arise where a sentencing state might decide forcibly to get rid of a prisoner they did not want to keep in their country.  This might not be in the prisoner's best interests, or he or she might not want it. There must be a three-way agreement. The High Court is used for constitutional reasons.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry raised the issue of continued enforcement and mentioned that <Col N="661" /> the Netherlands is using a different mechanism.  The convention allows countries to operate either continued enforcement or conversion procedures. We are using continued enforcement because it is simple and allows transfers to take place more quickly.  It will not involve us in lengthy court procedures and arguments, it is more straightforward and it would operate with greater certainty.  It is in the best interests of the sentenced person because they will have received their sentence in the country where they were put in prison and they will know what their sentence is.</P>
    <P>If we decided to use the conversion system an uncertainty would be brought into the system.  Perhaps the country the prisoner is seeking to have his or her application considered for has a much longer sentence for their particular crime; to use the conversion system would lead to uncertainty.  Now and again there might be a shorter sentence in the country to which the prisoner is applying, but this legislation will ensure that a prisoner will not be worse off by coming back.  The sentence will not be made longer when they come back. Now and again there will be an element of the conversion process if we do not have a similar kind of sentence here.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry also spoke about juveniles. This legislation allows for the transfer of juveniles.  It does not say it explicitly but it is implied.  The word &ldquo;sentence&rdquo; means that the Bill applies only to persons whose punishment for an offence involves deprivation of liberty. It is important to recognise that.  It is not involved where a sentence such as weekend work is imposed.  There has to be a deprivation of liberty before this legislation comes into effect.  The Bill applies regardless of whether the person concerned is already serving the sentence imposed or not and regardless of what type of institution the person is detained in.</P>
    <P>The sentence could have been imposed on a person who has not started to serve his or her sentence. They can immediately apply, if they wish, for a transfer once the sentence is <Col N="662" /> final and no court of appeal is open to them.  For example, a person could be found to be mentally disordered and detained in a hospital abroad or could be detained in our Central Mental Hospital, found to be insane during the proceedings, under section 17 of the Lunacy (Ireland) Act, 1821, or to have been insane when the offence was committed, under section 2 (2) of the Trial of Lunatics Act, 1883.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of the Bill provides that reference to offences in relation to acts done outside the State includes reference to any act which would be criminal but for the age or incapacity of the person concerned, so children and mentally disordered offenders are included in the Bill.  I will not discuss this issue further now.</P>
    <P>I will talk again to Senator Henry about the whole issue of urinalysis.  I am following this issue up with the forensic science laboratory.  There is some disagreement as to how effective urinalysis is in establishing whether someone is on a disallowed drug.  It may also show up drugs which the person is allowed to be on.</P>
    <P>I wish to stress to Members that this State is using a wide range of non-custodial sentences.  At any one time 3,500 people are on community service and diversion schemes, so it would be wrong to give the impression that all we do with criminals is lock them up.  There are a number of schemes that we are operating very effectively to prevent the kind of recidivism that Members have talked about.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan made very strong statements to the effect that no education or training is available within the prison system.  I wish to correct that. The system is not perfect, but there are very extensive education facilities in our prisons.  I would welcome any requests for visits to those prisons so that Members can see for themselves what is on offer.  There are in excess of 20 full time teachers on the staff of Wheatfield prison.  I have visited the teaching and educational facilities there.  Ironically, some of the temporary release forms I <Col N="663" /> sign for prisoners are to allow them to receive their graduation certificates in colleges throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Many of our prisoners have used their prison sentences to avail themselves of education and to get university degrees and other qualifications.  When they come out they are able to use those qualifications.  In fairness to the many people providing educational, psychological and other services in our prisons, it would be wrong to give the impression that our prisons are nothing but a bunch of cells with prison wardens standing outside them.</P>
    <P>Many rehabilitative schemes are taking place in our prisons.  I would like to see more of these and I am working on providing them.  Issues such as the detoxification unit and the drug free unit have been talked about for years. They were talked about before I became Minister, but I hope I will be the Minister who will at least begin to implement some of the suggestions and proposals from the Whitaker report.  We are already on the way to introducing methadone treatment for those prisoners who are already on it when they come in and we are already planning a detoxification centre in Mountjoy prison. The drugs free unit will be very costly and we are working on that too. I cannot give any indication when that might come about.</P>
    <P>Senator Ormonde asked me about the reintegration of prisoners here. When prisoners come back to this country they will come back to serve a sentence. They will be allowed to avail of whatever facilities are available in the prison they are serving their sentence in and when they come to the end of their sentence they will be treated the same as if they had been sentenced in this jurisdiction.  They will get what assistance they can from the probation services and so on.</P>
    <P>Senator Lee raised the issue of foreigners. We amended the Bill to allow me to make sure that prisoners here who are non-nationals are told about the full implications of this convention and we <Col N="664" /> will be preparing fact sheets to be given to them.  The convention will also be explained to them in case they have difficulty in understanding it.  Article 4 of the convention obliges each country to make information available.  I cannot oblige another country &mdash; for instance, the UK &mdash; to tell Irish prisoners there about this convention.  It is up to each country to make that information available. However, I believe the information will get to prisoners overseas because their families will make sure they know about it, so I am not unduly concerned in this regard.</P>
    <P>Some Irish prisoners abroad have not told their families they are in prison and that is a difficulty.  Clearly, in our discussions with other states we will be stressing that it is important they would be as lenient in making information available to Irish prisoners there as we have been here.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators referred to spaces in our prisons.  This is precisely why I have to keep the discretion this convention is giving to all countries.  It is a voluntary convention; any moving away from the voluntary nature of this convention would not be in keeping with the convention itself.  I will have to take into account the space available for prisoners when I am looking at an application, but if space is the only ground for refusal I will indicate that and let the prisoner know that he or she has the right to come back at a later date and look for a transfer again.  When I begin to operate this convention it may be possible to institute a waiting list, a mechanism that is not unheard of in our system.  People cannot always get what they want from the local authorities, etc. when they first apply for it and they go on to a waiting list.  I will have to examine such working mechanisms when the system is in operation.  Senator Daly made the point about an appeal but an amendment has been proposed in this regard so I will respond to it at that point.</P>
    <P>I wish to put on the record of the House my thanks and appreciation to the Irish Commission for Prisoners <Col N="665" /> Overseas.  They have been extremely helpful in the preparation of this legislation. I know from looking at the amendments tabled in both Houses, although it is not so obvious in the Seanad, that they circulated their proposals and amendments to all Members of this House.  I recognised some of the amendments which were put down from the paper I received from them.  I wish to put on the record of the House my appreciation of their work and the way in which they have kept this issue to the forefront of political debate in this country.</P>
    <P>There is a very strong humanitarian element to this legislation to which all Members have referred.  I thank Senators for their positive contributions to the debate and for their co-operation in dealing with it.</P>

      <P>In page 7, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="666" />&ldquo;(3) The Minister shall not consent to a request under subsection (1) of this section unless he or she has first obtained a certificate from the governor of the prison in which the sentenced person concerned will be detained certifying that the reception of that person into the prison will not necessitate the release of any prisoner detained within the prison prior to the expiry of his or her sentence.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I tabled this amendment because of my concern about prisoners transferred from abroad taking up prison spaces here.  However, the Minister indicated she will have complete discretion on accepting the transfer of prisoners to Ireland, they will not have automatic rights to transfers, she can refuse requests for transfers if spaces are not available and a waiting list system can be put in place.  I will withdraw the amendment on the basis that I am satisfied the Minister will use her discretion to ensure prisoners will not be released to facilitate the return of prisoners from abroad.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) Where the sentencing state does not agree to the transfer the Minister may appeal the refusal to the European Committee on Crime Problems of the Council of Europe under the provision of Article 23 of the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Prisoners.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is necessary because in my view there is a deficiency in the Bill, and, perhaps, in the convention.  with regard to matters of appeal when there are disagreements or disputes.  If a state in which a person is imprisoned refuses point blank to agree to a transfer, in <Col N="667" /> spite of the good intentions of the Bill, nothing can be done about it.</P>
    <P>The convention appears to be contradictory in some regards.  It states that, if a sentencing state refuses an application, it is not obliged to give information why it refused it.  It can inform the Minister for Justice it is not releasing a particular prisoner and it is not obliged to give any reasons whatsoever for that refusal.  This is apparent from the explanatory memorandum, although I know this does not give the statutory legal position.  It appears that a state has the sole right to refuse to transfer prisoners and cannot be challenged in any way.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, Article 23 refers to a friendly settlement.  This appears to be a formula to deal with disputes and disagreements.  This states that the European Committee on Crime Problems of the Council of Europe shall be kept informed and shall facilitate friendly settlements.  I presume that, if we have a disagreement with another state about the transfer of a prisoner, this committee will have some adjudication in this regard.  I am not sure if this is the intention but if not, it should be.  If the committee cannot deal with this, maybe the European Court of Justice will adjudicate.  There may well be vehement disagreements between member states on some prisoners, who will be left in limbo and will not have the right to have their cases adjudicated on by the committee, the European Court of Justice or any other authority.</P>

      <P>States which have signed the convention are committed to it.  If they were to refuse to transfer prisoners, this would have to be for specific reasons.  However, I envisage difficulties with regard to Britain, where there are 402 Irish prisoners, 35 of whom belong to paramilitary organisations.  Questions about the latter may arise as far as the British Government is concerned.  There is an avenue open to us, given the negotiations taking place between the Irish and British Governments on the peace process.  I ask the Minster to raise this issue with her counterpart in Britain, given that both countries are signatories to the convention.  This problem can be overcome.  We hope that a number of political prisoners in England will be released.  Some prisoners may seek transfers to this country and we would like them to be transferred at the earliest opportunity.  There is a way around this difficulty and I have every confidence this will be taken by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the position from which Senator Daly and Senator Ormonde are coming.  They are seeking a mechanism to put manners on other countries. Article 23 of the convention states that the European Committee on Crime Problems of the Council of Europe shall be kept informed regarding the application of the convention and shall do <Col N="669" /> whatever is necessary to facilitate the friendly settlement of any difficulty which may arise from its application.  In our domestic law we cannot change the convention or the application of the committee.  However, I will put the points made by the Senators to the committee in which we play a full part.</P>
      <P>If a country wants to accept an application for a transfer and the sentencing country refuses, the matter could be referred to the committee but this would not be in the form of a formal appeal.  Attempts would be made to achieve agreement by means of a friendly settlement.  We cannot in our domestic law force any country to implement the convention in a way which is not in keeping with the convention. I cannot accept the proposition that the committee should act as an appeal board.  It would have to act in an informal way under a friendly settlement.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 25 of the explanatory memorandum states that it is the basic principle of the convention that a transfer requires the agreement of the two states concerned as well as the prisoner. The question of an appeals procedure in circumstances where a state is complying with one of the basic principles of the convention would hardly arise.  We have to accept the convention as it is framed in its entirety.  The amendment essentially purports to confer a role on the crime committee and we cannot do this in domestic legislation.  What would be at issue would be an amendment to the convention itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the point raised by the Senators and this will be usefully pursued at European level.  Senator Taylor-Quinn's suggestion is good and later this month I will meet the British Secretary of State for Home Affairs, Mr. Howard, who retained his position in the recent British Cabinet reshuffle and I will raise this matter with him.  I cannot accept this amendment because I cannot put it into domestic law.  However, I will take <Col N="670" /> up the spirit behind the amendment and raise it at the committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>This may appear an academic observation, and it probably is at present, but it may not be entirely useless in the long run.  The Minister agreed that the principle behind the amendment is constructive.  Accepting what she said about the impossibility of incorporating this provision in domestic law, I would like to raise a scenario.  The amendment states: &ldquo;Where the sentencing state does not agree to the transfer the Minister may appeal&rdquo;.  We are a sentencing state also in this context.  If the issue was to be further processed at the European Committee on Crime Problems in the Council of Europe, would it be in order for us to think of giving a lead in trying to facilitate due process in this matter &mdash; in other words, orderly agreement about the renunciation of our full rights in the matter if we thought it would facilitate activity under this legislation?</P>
      <P>Where issues arise concerning prisoners in this State and where appeals are made to us, we could offer, if a difference arose, to submit them for arbitration or settlement to the European committee.  We could nudge forward conceptualising the role of the European committee and expanding its role and giving good example to other members if we thought it was in the interest of facilitating the principle behind this legislation internationally. Would there be anything to prevent us doing that?  I know it is marginal at present, but it is something we should keep in mind and activate in due course. The principle of humanitarianism underlying these provisions is one we should try to reinforce in practice as far as possible, although the issues which might arise may be rare in practice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that the Minister will take up this matter with the European committee.  There would <Col N="671" /> be a problem if a government had a certain view on an individual and opposed a transfer on grounds which we regarded as invalid.  I understand what the amendment is trying to achieve, but I go along with what the Minister said in that she wants to try to see if this matter can be resolved.  There are problems which we must not try to disguise.</P>
      <P>The peace process has been successful and has been supported by all parties on this island and in Britain.  However, the recent release of Private Lee Clegg has caused problems, particularly in the North.  It has upset people in Ireland and, I am sure, in Britain.  It is essential that the level of goodwill that we have seen as regards the release of prisoners and the efforts made by this Government is maintained.  If somebody has been convicted of paramilitary activities and wants to be transferred back here, difficulties will arise if a firm attitude is taken by the British Government.</P>
      <P>I understand what the Minister is trying to do as regards the spirit of the Bill and the goodwill expressed in the friendly settlement referred to in article 23.  I do not believe this problem can be resolved today and I am happy with the Minister's assurance.  She should communicate with the House to let us know what progress has been made when she makes representations on this matter. This is a friendly settlement, which means that the two sides must work together.</P>

      <P>Senator Lee made an interesting intervention.  However, my hands are tied.  This convention has been passed by 34 countries.  Although I can make some noises, an amendment to the convention would be required, as would agreement by all countries.  We are the only country which is including in its legislation the need for an annual report.  When we contacted the Council of Europe offices to get some background on the implementation of the <Col N="672" /> convention in other countries, we found that there was little gathered wisdom available.  We said that we were thinking of including this provision as regards an annual report and we asked how it worked in any other country.  We were told that no other country had done that.  I would like to suggest this to other countries.</P>
      <P>An annual report will allow us to identify where there are considerable disagreements.  If I want to give a transfer but am unable to do so, I will be able to list in the annual report the number of applications to which the sentencing country would not agree.  We will be able to establish a pattern as to how this is working.  We do not know how this will work until it begins.  I do not have that power as regards article 23.  Anything I suggest would reduce the discretion at the heart of this convention.  I do not believe that we could renegotiate it without removing this discretion.  I, therefore, cannot accept the amendment.</P>

He said clearly that the spirit, thrust and purpose of this legislation can be negatived if, for example, there is a difficult Justice Minister in the United Kingdom who may say that they will not <Col N="673" /> transfer Joe O'Connell from County Clare back to Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or Harry Duggan.  As far as this legislation is concerned, that is the end of it.  They do not have to give an explanation as to why they will not transfer prisoners back.  We may find that this may work out very amicably in practice.  However, I see problems arising fairly soon, especially in relation to special category prisoners to which Senator Taylor-Quinn referred.  These are sensitive cases and these people have been in prison for many years for committing serious offences.  Nevertheless, the humanitarian element must be taken into account.  There is no way to appeal decisions made by a difficult Justice Minister in the United Kingdom. Some Ministers may not be as hospitable as the Minister.  Problems may arise very soon and this legislation may prove to be deficient.</P>
      <P>My amendment is carefully worded from article 23 of the convention.  I propose that it be included in this legislation to give notice of the intention to utilise it in the event of somebody being difficult about transferring prisoners.  I presume the convention has been ratified by many member states and has been in operation.  Does the Minister have any indication or knowledge at her disposal as to how many cases have been dealt with by other member states and whether this kind of difficulty has arisen between, for example, the UK and France or between Spain and Portugal or whoever?</P>

      <P>It fundamentally undermines the convention.  The convention says that each of the three parties &mdash; the sentencing state, the administering state and the prisoner &mdash; must agree.  If an appeal system is instituted it takes away the right of one of the parties to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;, as the case may be.  In the other House, Deputy O'Donoghue put down another amendment to the same effect, addressing the same fundamental point.</P>
      <P>If the Senator's amendment were to be included in this legislation it would not mean anything.  The European Committee on Crime Problems of the Council of Europe deals with problems on crime and has no power to take an appeal and override a country's decision on implementing the convention.  The insertion of an appeal system fundamentally changes the convention.  I cannot change the convention.  The Senator is suggesting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I will deal with the country about which the Senator is especially worried with diligence and I will also deal with article 23.  We are obliged under the convention to do so, even if it was not included in legislation.  The proposed legislation is merely giving effect to the convention.  Every article in the convention must be implemented.  The Senator is trying to put article 23 into the legislation; it is already included in that I will implement the article.  I have no choice on this matter, nor does any other country to the convention.  They must implement article 23.  It means that I can ask the committee to attempt to settle an issue on a friendly agreement basis. Those with whom I seek agreement must also attend the committee as they are obliged to do so by the convention.</P>

      <P>Senator Daly is being deliberately obtuse on this section.  To include the amendment in the Bill would have no affect on the broader international fora.  The convention is an international agreement. Acceptance of an amendment such as this does not in any way compel the other signatories to the convention to comply with the section of an Act of a national Parliament.  It would, therefore, be useless to incorporate the amendment. It would not improve the situation with regard to prisoners.  The Bill agrees to the terms of the convention and article 23 of the convention is, following enactment of the Bill, agreed to by the Government and the country as a signatory to the convention.  Senator Daly understands this, but he has chosen to make a political issue of this matter.</P>

On Second Stage the Minister of State indicated that he did not envisage a delay of more than three months between the passing of the Bill and the date on which it will be brought into operation.

I could give the smart answer and say that &ldquo;occasional&rdquo; means &ldquo;other than regular&rdquo; but the question would arise as to what &ldquo;regular&rdquo; might mean.  The intention is clear.  We have had discussions with various youth organisations and others who were fearful they would be covered by the Bill when organising a scout outing or a pilgrimage to Knock.

      <P>Section 6 deals with offences under the legislation.  Section 6 (2) outlines the penalties for such offences and imprisonment is included in the penalties.  The people of County Roscommon are very conscious of overcrowding <Col N="682" /> in prisons and the lack of prison places.  We are also aware the Government is considering alternatives to detention.  Given that our prisons are so overcrowded at present, might it not be more appropriate to have alternatives to detention included as penalties?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 9, subsection (1) (e), lines 11 and 12, to delete &ldquo;formalities&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;recommendations by the Department of Health&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I will not go back over the points I made on Second Stage as to the provisions of paragraph (e) concerning health not being nearly strong enough.  Since the debate on Second Stage a friend of mine contacted a number of embassies, travel agencies and airlines from or dealing with popular tourist destinations, many of which have diseases not common in this country.  Not one advised that any particular vaccinations or care should be taken by any person going to any of these destinations.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to cause an international incident by naming the countries, but I can give the Minister the information later.  However, I thought it incredible.  Some of the countries have conditions which are not the same as those here and there is a great risk that visitors from Ireland could contract diseases there to which they would have no resistance or immunisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Second Stage I referred to our poor record with regard to immunisations. It would at least be worthwhile for the brochures to advise that children should be immunised against diseases such as polio and diphtheria.  Since around 30 per cent of our young people are no longer immune to hepatitis A, <Col N="684" /> due to the fact that we have a good water supply, it might be worthwhile to suggest to those going to areas where such diseases are prevalent that they consider getting some form of immunisation.</P>
    <P>It would at least have been worthwhile to have the Department of Health involved in giving us recommendations for these brochures.  One could make emotive statements, like saying that the Ebola virus is only eight hours flying time away, but I do not think people will go to Zaire for their holidays.  However, people go to other parts of the world where diseases exist to which we do not have exposure in this country and to which, therefore, we do not have a resistance.  I do not see how only having these formalities will be of any help to anybody.</P>
    <P>I previously raised the matter of not implementing the European Union Directives regarding information as to how people acquire HIV infection on foreign holidays.  People's behaviour is generally modified by the sun and sometimes they may put themselves at more risk of contracting diseases abroad than they would at home.  Even publications like the <i>Bulletin of Medical Ethics</i> suggests it is important for doctors to bring these matters to the attention of people when travelling abroad.  The least we could do is try to get the Department of Health to give us some advice on this matter.</P>
    <P>This is considered such a serious problem that an association of travel doctors was formed recently.  I know there have been deaths from diseases contracted abroad, particularly from Falciparal malaria.  People do not understand the various precautions one can take.  Sometimes these are just ordinary precautions, like being careful with water in areas that have mosquitoes carrying malaria, wearing sleeves to one's wrists and wearing long trousers at night.  These facts are not sufficiently <Col N="685" /> known and this Bill is severely deficient with regard to travel brochures.</P>
    <P>I do not want to force travel companies or agents to give detailed health regulations or to tell travellers to get certain vaccinations, but we could have gone further than this.  Apart from the morality involved with sex tours abroad, many people think they will be at less risk of getting infected with HIV by acquiring younger partners.  Of course, these children are often sold into sexual slavery.  Their mothers may be drug addicts and, therefore, they may already be infected.  Blood transmits HIV infection and one can imagine that with young children this is more likely to occur in these activities.</P>
    <P>There is a lack of concern regarding health in this provision.  I have met people who had problems that were often contracted in five star hotels where the hygiene was less than it should have been.  Some sort of recommendation from the Department of Health would definitely be in order.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Henry's amendment.  While the price and accuracy of brochures are important, the risk posed to people's health, particularly young people, by the infections they could contract while abroad are important and should be highlighted.  It would be appropriate if the Bill spelled out in detail obligations on tour operators to provide people going on holidays abroad with fuller information about health risks.  The Bill should include recommendations by the Department of Health.  Health risks in host countries should form part of the essential terms of the holiday contract and should be spelt out in greater detail. I fully support both of Senator Henry's amendments.</P>

      <P>What Senator Henry said deserves much merit and support and perhaps further examination.  There are certain do's and don'ts when one <Col N="686" /> goes to certain places on holiday.  Some of these are obvious, but hopefully they will not cost a person their life or cause them serious ill health.  While we are made aware of vaccination procedures in some countries, there are other precautions about which one should be specifically forearmed and forewarned.</P>
      <P>I was disturbed to hear Senator Henry say that certain embassies either did not want to know or refused to give her general advice &mdash; maybe they did not want to run down their own countries. One may be advised not to go out at certain times in some places for fear of being mugged or robbed.  While that may make up a percentage of the potential dangers involved in some areas, there may be less chance of a mugging or robbery occurring in others than the chance of contracting a dangerous disease. Perhaps it should be suggested to the Department of Foreign Affairs that these embassies should furnish better information.  People may take out travel insurance, but other matters could be included in travel brochures.  Perhaps the Minister could look at this matter further with a view to changing this in the future.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senators for tabling the amendment and I see it as a valuable addition to the debate.  In this section we are trying to implement the directive as it is intended, which is ensuring that the person travelling abroad complies with the formalities required by the countries to which and across which they are travelling.  What Senator Henry is saying is an expansion of that &mdash; that they should be informed before leaving of the dangers they may meet both travelling across or staying in a country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would not be fair to ask tour operators and travel agents to take on the whole gambit of the medical or health education that would be involved. However, it would be fair to ask my colleague, the Minister for Health, to get <Col N="687" /> involved and to do that for people travelling abroad.  We are asking the Minster for Health to ensure that people travelling abroad will have this information made available in the same way as it is done in the United Kingdom at the moment.  All travel agents have leaflets available about the various health dangers in different countries and these are included in their packs.  It is now an administrative matter between the two Departments and I will pursue that vigorously. On the basis of that, I ask Senator Henry to withdraw the amendment as tabled.</P>

      <P>What the Minister has said is a great help.  However, while I am no expert on European Union Directives, they are not one of the Ten Commandments.  I have seen this happen with many other Bills.  The Minister for Equality and Law Reform expanded equality legislation recently, some of it going far further than the directives from the European Union.  The Copyright Bill, for example, goes far further than any European Union Directive. Therefore, these directives, while important, should not be considered the be all and end all.</P>
      <P>I am glad to hear that the Minister will try to bring forward some sort of recommendations.  As Senator Cosgrave said, we are warned about pickpockets but not that we might get a fatal disease. People who visit many countries and take prophylactic tablets against malaria may still get it.  Some Irish people told me they took the tablets, but they still got malaria.  Contracting malaria is more serious than getting one's pocket picked.  The Minister for Health should ensure that brochures are given to people going abroad because going on an exotic holiday should not mean one gets an exotic disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will withdraw the amendment because the Minister said he will do the best he can.  However, EU directives are not an excuse to do something.  We should introduce legislation as we desire <Col N="688" /> and not only because the EU says we should.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Henry for her reasonable, helpful and useful approach to this matter.  We must at least implement the directive, which is already late.  It provides protection for travellers.  Approximately 350,000 people go abroad every year and they need the additional protection in this Bill.  I will take on board the points made by the Senator and I will be in contact again with my colleague about producing brochures and ensuring they are available.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Government is considering introducing legislation in this area.  A further Bill is needed to provide for the concerns I have expressed.  How long will it take to introduce such a Bill?  I could bring in a Private Members' Bill, but its fate would not be as good as a Government Bill.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Henry's amendments which were ruled out of order.  This Bill gave us an opportunity to legislate against the use of children in prostitution and other unlawful sexual activities by people on holidays from this country.  I was horrified to read an <Col N="689" /> article in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> three weeks ago on Fr. Shay Cullen in the Philippines, who is actively lobbying for legislation in this regard.  I understand that Australia, Germany, France and the United States have amended their Criminal Justice Acts, thereby making it illegal to buy or sell sex holidays abroad. However, Ireland or the UK have still not made it illegal to do so.  I have already discussed this matter with the Minister, who said there was a Private Members' Bill before the Dáil which would deal with this issue.  We should act quickly in this regard.  If this matter is outside the scope of the Bill, when will another one be introduced to deal with it effectively?</P>

      <P>I thank the Senators for their contributions and for tabling these amendments, which I was not able to accept on foot of strong advice from the law officer.  At the request of the Taoiseach, the Government is examining this area and the need for legislation. However, I do not know when such legislation will be implemented.  It is highly unlikely that my office will be implementing it; it will either be the Department of Justice or the Department of Health.  The advice I have is so strong that it would be appropriate to examine this matter fully before the legislation is implemented.  Legislation in other countries, to which the Senators referred, will also be examined to see how it operates.  That is part of the examination currently taking place.  In fairness to the Government and the Attorney General, this examination began before these amendments were tabled.  There is a Private Members' Bill before the other House which will come here in due course.  That will give this House an opportunity to discuss the matter in more detail.  I do not know when the Government will introduce its own legislation.</P>

      <P>There is some misunderstanding about what I want.  The Bill before the other House deals with sexual offences committed abroad being <Col N="690" /> triable in this State.  Although that matter should also be considered, I am looking for something more simple. Advertising such holidays in <i>Exchange and Mart</i> is astonishing.  It is unbelievable that we cannot put a stop to this at once.  The excuse given to me by one person who must have been involved was that the child had been brought in by his mother.  That would not be considered an excuse anywhere for allowing such activities to take place.  I hope the Government will consider this as a matter of urgency.  The Bill proposed by Deputy O'Donoghue and Deputy E. Ryan does not deal with this issue.  It deals with sexual offences being triable in this State and it has nothing to do with advertising in brochures.</P>
