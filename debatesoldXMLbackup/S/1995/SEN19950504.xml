      <P>I have received notice from Senator D. Kiely that on the Adjournment of the House today he wishes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to outline the present position of the cost and competitiveness review of the ESB which involves his Department, the ESB management and trade unions.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to appoint a remedial teacher to Ballingarry, Granagh, Kilmeedy and Banogue schools, Co. Limerick.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>The debate on the White Paper on Education will be taken next Wednesday.  I will have discussions with the other Whips and Leaders afterwards to see if we can have an extended <Col N="338" /> debate next Wednesday to allow as many people as possible to take part. Today's Order of Business is item 1 and if, as is probable, the Second Stage completes this morning before lunchtime, we will begin Committee Stage at 1.30 p.m. with the agreement of the other groups.</P>

      <P>My party is pleased to be accommodating in regard to the Order of Business.  This legislation is important and we would like to see it passed into law as soon as possible.  The Leader has mentioned the White Paper on Education. He might arrange for a discussion between the Whips in regard to various issues that have been mentioned on the Order of Business so as to settle a strategy for dealing with them between now and the summer recess. These issues include discussion on the White Paper on Education, the one I mentioned yesterday, the Green Paper on Broadcasting, a debate on Northern Ireland, the social housing programme announced during the week, the cross-Border funding that has been mentioned on many occasions, the banks, the construction of a debate in relation to banks and many issues in relation to health.  I ask the Leader to arrange a discussion to formulate the timetable so that all those who have an interest in these issues will be able to prepare in advance of the debates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not happy with the Order of Business because the Arterial Drainage Bill has not yet been published. I brought this up yesterday out of a sense of concern.  I am outraged at what has happened in regard to the Arterial Drainage Bill.  I will repeat some of what I said yesterday.  On 1 March we had a promise from the Minister that the Arterial Drainage Bill would be published before 30 April and introduced in the Seanad before 31 May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agreed to vote down Senator Daly's Bill on the grounds that the Minister had given us a commitment to which he would adhere.  I and other Senators <Col N="339" /> voted down the Arterial Drainage Bill proposed by Senator Daly and accepted the word of the Minister.  We heard nothing about this until I asked the Leader of the House on 27 April what was happening in regard to the publication of the Arterial Drainage Bill.  The Leader of the House explained that it would be published this week.  We did not hear any more until yesterday when I again asked about the Bill.  I am told it is to be published next week.</P>
    <P>We are setting an unacceptable standard here.  When I came into this House I was told that one cannot always accept promises that are given and I said that I did not believe this.  I have seen promises in regard to the Suicide Bill not kept.  I have seen promises in relation to another Bill about landlords and tenants not kept.  This is the first time I have been involved in a promise that has not been kept.  We are setting an example to the nation.  We as a country depend on exports.  It would be unacceptable to say when we make a contract that we will deliver by 30 April and then tell our customer nothing until early May when we say that we hope to have it next week and when we are asked a second time say again that we hope to have it the following week.</P>
    <P>We are setting a standard that is not liveable with.  It used to be said in <i>Dublin Opinion</i> many years ago &ldquo;Ah sure it'll do&rdquo;.  We should not sit here and accept this lack of respect for this House.  A promise made to us on 1 March is not being kept.  I do not blame the Leader of the House, but the Leader has to do what he has been told.  He has been asked to say that this promise will not be kept.  We were not told ahead of time that it is not being kept.  When we asked again yesterday we were told that hopefully it will be published next week. I know the Leader of the House has given us a promise that it will be introduced in this House.  The second part of his promise is still on line, but we are getting closer to the date when he said it would be introduced.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="340" /> I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That item 9, motion 16, be taken before item 1.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I readily accept that only 15 minutes should be allocated to motion 16.  This will mean a 15 minute delay before item 1 is taken.  This protest must be made in the House if we are to set an example, not just to exporters but to the nation, and that if one makes a promise, it is kept, or one does one's best to explain why one cannot keep it.  One does not let down those to whom one has made the promise.  I ask the Leader to accept the amendment to take item 9, motion 16, with a time limit of 15 minutes in total if necessary, before moving to item 1.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I second Senator Quinn's proposal to amend the Order of Business. If a commitment is made in the House, irrespective of the Government in office, a serious obligation is imposed on the Government to fulfil it.  An even more serious obligation is imposed when it has a direct bearing on the outcome of a vote.  Senator Quinn and others voted in a particular way on the basis of a clear understanding they had in relation to a commitment which was given to them.  I exclude the Leader from criticism, but I ask him to bring the view to Government that it makes a solemn commitment when it gives a promise of this serious nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without prejudging the outcome of a vote which might take place on the amendment, Members were circulated with the business of the House for the week, which indicated that Second Stage of the Road Traffic Bill would be taken yesterday and today.  I am prepared to accept that Second Stage is likely to conclude early and it would be logical to proceed to Committee Stage. However, I envisaged putting down a large number of amendments to this piece of legislation and this situation puts one on a wrong footing.  I am sure there will not be many amendments as the legislation has widespread support. On that basis I prepared to accept that <Col N="341" /> the House proceeds to Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The House should express its disquiet regarding the events in Derry yesterday and the hope that they will not stop the talks taking place next week or have any destabilising effect on the peace process. I ask the Leader to bring this view to Government.  It underlines once again the call made yesterday for an early debate on Northern Ireland.  It is now timely to hold that discussion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I and my party intend to support Senator Quinn's amendment.  It is regrettable that the Senator has to resort to this mechanism in an effort to get the urgently required Bill before the House.  I remind the Leader that Fianna Fáil will continue to press him on the commitment he gave yesterday.  We are not satisfied that the Government views this legislation with the same urgency as Members on all sides.</P>
      <P>My Arterial Drainage Bill received widespread support, but some Members voted it down on the basis of commitments which were given during the debate.  It is a poor show on the part of the Minister and the Government to treat the House in this manner, but particularly to treat in this way those whose homes have been flooded since Christmas.  Many of these people have not yet been able to go back to their houses and no action has been taken to deal with their problems, as Senator Fahey said yesterday.  It is an appalling state of affairs and we intend to support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader of the House is blameless in this matter and I have a certain amount of sympathy for the Minister, Deputy Jim Higgins. However, during the debate on Senator Daly's Bill, I appealed for a pragmatic approach to this piece of legislation.  My point has been proved correct because it appears, once again, that civil servants have taken it over and that it will be a most disappointing Bill when it comes before the House.  It is unfortunate that a problem which could have been solved <Col N="342" /> through a practical commonsense approach will probably not be solved at all.</P>
      <P>An unprecedented event took place in recent weeks.  An effective piece of drainage work was carried out in Galway, which was initiated by a Fine Gael TD and which proved most successful. However, this work was treated by civil servants in a manner that I had never before encountered.  The Secretary of the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht took it upon himself to write a public letter to a local newspaper in which he indicated that the Department had not given approval to the project and would not have anything to do with it.  In this case a pragmatic approach was taken to a problem and a solution was found.  The reason for the delay with this legislation is that once again miles of red tape are being rolled out.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Quinn's amendment and I urge the House to accept that it is important to put down a marker.  We cannot continue to destroy progress in this country where the Government, in the context of the public service, decides to stop it by rolling out the red tape.  I appeal to Members to show that we will not accept this type of bureaucracy and delay.  As Senator Quinn said, if the private sector&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Finance should not be confused with the public service.  The Department spends much of its time undermining the best proposals which come from the public service, whether these are in the context of education, health or the Civil Service in general.  Nevertheless, I accept the Senator's point.</P>
      <P>We indicated yesterday that we would be prepared to take Committee Stage of the Road Traffic Bill today.  We are still prepared to do so and that is why Senator Quinn has put a time limit on his proposal.  This will allow both matters to be taken.  In terms of the dignity and good reputation of the House, it has no option but to support the amendment. I look forward to doing so, because that promise was the basis for changing the course of legislation.  The original Bill would otherwise have been passed.</P>
      <P>Regarding the White Paper on Education, the Leader said there will be a major debate on this issue next Wednesday.  Is it intended to resume the debate on Thursday or in another week?</P>

      <P>We have been waiting a long time for the Arterial Drainage Bill.  In the meantime Carlow has been flooded on a number of occasions.

      <P>I support Senator Quinn and my colleagues regarding the lack of action on the Arterial Drainage Bill.  The problem is enormous and a time limit was given.  Can the Leader indicate a possible date for the introduction of the Bill?  I have a serious problem in Kerry where one family has been cut off from the mainland by flooding and people cannot get to their places of work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of issues were raised on the Order of Business and I will deal with the non-contentious ones first.  I thank Senator Wright for his observations on making some arrangement with the Whips for the many issues which have been arranged.  One of my reasons for wanting a very lengthy session next week, if possible, on the White Paper and to conclude it soon afterwards, is that I do not want to leave too many issues hanging around.  We should try to tackle them in a fairly orderly way.  I will speak to the Opposition afterwards about an extended debate on education next week.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis raised the question of the incidents in Derry yesterday, which were obviously regrettable.  It is the first real mistake which has been made since the process began.  Perhaps we should have anticipated that incidents such as his will happen.  However, the resolve is such on all sides that the process will continue, which I am sure is the wish of all Members of the House.</P>
      <P>On the question of the Arterial Drainage Bill, the factual position is that, yes, the House was told that the Bill would be here by the end of April. That was the intention and there is no question of bad faith on anyone's part or of any delay being deliberate.  Certain hitches arose which have been sorted out and the Bill is now completed.  It has been to the Attorney General's Office and has had observations from other Departments.  It is ready for clearance at next Tuesday's Cabinet meeting and will be published straightaway.  That is the factual position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="345" /> We may talk about exports and businesses and so on, but with a large bureaucracy one person can hold matters up, which I presume is inadvertent. However, the speed has been quite remarkable and the Bill will be published next week.  I have guaranteed to this House that on the substantial question, time will be made available immediately and that this Bill will be out of this House well before the end of May.  That is the net issue.  We can play games here this morning and I am quite prepared to accept the Opposition's reprimand that this Bill was not in on time.  However, on the substantial issue the Bill will be here on time and cleared on time.</P>
    <P>Of course, if Senator Quinn wishes to press his motion this morning I will accept it.  I am not going to waste the time of the House this morning on two votes when we have urgent business to conduct.  If it was a question of the Bill being held up, of bad faith or of the Government having changed its mind, then I would certainly see a reason for what he is doing.  However, there has been a hitch and a mistake, for which we admit responsibility.  The Bill will be published next week and we will keep our commitments to have the Bill through the House by the end of May. On that basis.  I ask the House to accept my good faith on this matter.  However, I am not going to oppose the change to the Order of Business if that is pressed by Senator Quinn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann deplores the fact that the promised Arterial Drainage Bill has not been published, and considers it to be a breach of trust on <Col N="347" /> the part of the Government that the commitments given to the House on 1 March, 1995, on this matter have not been discharged.</P>
    <P>I wish to express my appreciation to the Leader of the House for his recognition of my concern.  I do not intend to speak for anything like three minutes.  I have already said what I intended to say.  I wished to put on record that we should not accept the standards which have perhaps occurred in the past.  I have made the point and I do not wish to repeat myself.  In saying that, I understand that others may also not wish to speak for longer than one or two minutes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I seconded the amendment to the Order of Business and I wish to repeat and reinforce a point.  In the Leader's response to the Order of Business, he suggested that there is some mischief or something wrong about the way in which this matter is being dealt with.  I suggest otherwise, because this was a commitment given to the House by the Government.  Not only was that commitment given to a House of the Oireachtas, but it had the effect of possibly changing the result of a vote which ensued.  That is the gravity of the matter before the House and why it must be regarded as serious.</P>
      <P>There can be all sorts of technical hitches and administrative and other excuses for saying that a Bill cannot come in, but there was time.  We have repeatedly seen in the past that where the Government needs to introduce legislation on an emergency basis or to dispose of a matter quickly, it can be done.  I do not accept that there was not enough time to ensure that this Bill came before the House on time in line with the commitment which we received.  The real point has been made that people have been suffering seriously for months.  That imposes a serious obligation on the House and the Government to sort out the existing problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to protest that the Minister of State with responsibility for this matter is not here.  It is imperative for him to be here.  It is ludicrous for us to discuss this between ourselves; we might as well meet in the public bar. There was ample time to deal with this. There is no question but that the Minister of State could have dealt with it under my Bill.  I pointed out on that occasion that I was prepared to withdraw the Bill if I was satisfied that the Minister was going to act, but I knew that he would not.  The Minister of State's difficulty is not a technical one but the financing of this, which will not be sorted out by next week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that the Leader will understand that when we in this House get commitments from Ministers, we in turn go on to tell others about those commitments.  This is not the only situation with which I have had problems. For example, in February the Minister of State at the Department of Health gave us a commitment that the second drug treatment detoxification programme would start in Cherry Orchard in the spring.  The snowdrops were out then and it now looks like we will have a very good summer, yet there is absolutely no sign of that centre in Cherry Orchard starting until midsummer. I told people not to worry, because I raised this matter in the Seanad where I was told that the second treatment centre would be provided.  This is a very serious matter.  Every second week some Member of this House talks about the drugs situation in this city.  Quite rightly, the State Solicitor in the south has made a very big public issue of the major problems in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that the Leader understands that we are not doing this to be difficult, but that we tell people, as he well knows because he does it himself, about the commitments which we have been given here regarding legislation, the implementation of programmes and so on, and we have to answer for that.  I had to apologise to people yesterday as I had <Col N="349" /> told them in February that the programme in Cherry Orchard Hospital would be introduced, but I see no sign of it now until goodness knows when. In this regard Senator Quinn's motion is important.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of principle, aside from the urgency of the legislation, this is a benchmark motion.  I feel sorry for the Leader of the House because the situation would not be any different if we were in his place.  This is a significant motion in that it exemplifies the approach of civil servants to the Houses of the Oireachtas and important legislation.  During the debate on the Bill I urged the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Higgins, whose commitment to take action I do not doubt, that if he was to put the matter in the hands of the Civil Service we would never see any drainage done in south Galway or other parts of the country.</P>
      <P>There are a number of progressive politicians on the Government side of the House who want to see reform and progress.  This is a good example of where simple legislation is being given the runaround in the public service.  I predict we will end up with legislation that will take us nowhere.  In urging the Minister of State to have action taken rather than listen to the advice from his officials, I had intended that we would see practical action.  What we have seen from the Office of Public Works is a series of investigations and committees.  To ensure that one does not solve a problem one can employ a firm of consultants and impose time limits so that the problem is forgotten about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time limits imposed by the Office of Public Works with regard to the survey being done in south Galway is that tenders would not have to be submitted until the end of April and that it would take probably two to three months before a company would be appointed to do the investigation.  Therefore, it would be August or September before the critical investigation of the problem in south Galway would commence.  At that stage the public servants' hope <Col N="350" /> would be that it would largely be forgotten about.  A practical and sensible investigation will not take place because the water has now gone down and, consequently, the important information that would be required as it went down has not been collected.</P>
    <P>I feel strongly about this commitment being broken as it is typical of the approach of civil servants &mdash; send in the Bill whenever it has to be taken or can be concluded.  When the Bill comes to this House I predict it will be toothless; it will be tied up in so many legal and other matters that it will be impossible to do anything.</P>
    <P>The perfect example of that is a letter from the Secretary of the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  In my 14 years in the Oireachtas I have never seen an occasion when a public servant took the opportunity to write a public letter to a newspaper in Galway condemning the action of a colleague.  I do not wish to be political about this as it was the Secretary of the Department who wrote the letter.  That is the reason this legislation was delayed, why the commitment given here could not be carried out and why when this legislation comes to the House it will be useless.</P>

      <P>I was also disappointed this legislation was not brought before the House by the end of April.  Commitments were given to us and we gave commitments to our constituents and to local authorities.  We informed them legislation would be brought forward. We told people whose property was damaged that legislation would be brought forward shortly and they could make claims for the damage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some serious problems in my area.  One family made the national headlines yesterday.  There are two elderly brothers and a sister in the family and a private bridge they use has been washed away.  The local authority is not claiming any responsibility for it.  A special meeting of Kerry County Council has been called for tomorrow to see what can be done.  I had informed these <Col N="351" /> people legislation would be brought forward and that, more than likely, necessary funds would be made available by the Government to replace this bridge. They are using a plank of wood as a bridge at present.  If they fall and injure themselves, who will be responsible?  It makes fools of all of us as public representatives. When I go to Kerry County Council tomorrow as a public representative what can I say?  Do I say the legislation is held up by bureaucracy? I fully support Senator Quinn's motion.</P>

It is salutary from time to time that a reminder should come from this House that when legislation is promised it should arrive on time.  This case is perhaps not the best example to choose.  There is no question of bad faith in what has happened, no question of any deliberate subversion of the Bill by anybody.  There was a hitch.</P>
      <P>As I have said, the substantial part of the commitment given was that the Bill would be in this House early in May and would be dealt with by the end of May, and that commitment will be honoured. The Opposition has made its point and I appeal to the Opposition to let us now get on with our business as ordered.</P>

      <P>Having occupied the Leader's position, I understand Senator Manning's feelings.  It is important to distinguish between his commitments and the commitment given by the Minister. The embarrassment to Government may help strengthen the case of the Members opposite in dealing with Ministers.  It is the Minister of State's commitment we are discussing.  I am confident the Leader of the House will achieve the commitment he has given and we await that, but the real issue is the commitment given by the Minister of State.</P>

      <P>The point is made, as the Leader of the House has said, and it is <Col N="352" /> a benchmark, as Senator Fahey remarked.  This motion was intended to be constructive and was intended, as Senator Wright said, to remind everybody in the House that there are standards, and also to remind those who made promises to this House.  We all want to make sure respect is shown to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  When promises are made they must be kept.</P>
      <P>I have difficulty with the Leader of the House's explanation that the delay is understandable because there were hitches.  When any contract anywhere is broken somebody always claims that it was not their fault.  If a Minister makes a solemn commitment in this House which influenced my vote and that of others, we insist such a commitment is met.  We have made this point and I hope we will not have to make it again. I hope we have not unduly delayed the business of the day with this constructive motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the last number of years Irish people have developed a responsible attitude to drinking and driving.  Yesterday evening I gave examples of how this attitude manifests itself.  There are still some individuals who are exceptions to the rule.  I have no problem with legislation which provides for severe penalties for such persons and a mandatory disqualification period must be part of that penalty for serious drink driving offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also no problem with the provisions in the 1994 legislation which increase the penalties and disqualification periods where serious offences are involved.  However, that Act went further; it reduced the maximum permissible <Col N="353" /> level from 100 milligrams to 80 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood.  This is a significant change, but since this brought Ireland into line with most EU countries it was difficult to argue against it.</P>
    <P>The fundamental problem with the legislation arose not from the reduction in the blood alcohol level but because the Act did not differentiate in regard to the mandatory penalties in the case of a person who marginally exceeded the new limit <i>vis-a-vis</i> a driver who had consumed a substantial quantity of alcohol and was shown to have a high blood alcohol level.</P>
    <P>Many Members of both Houses were uneasy and apprehensive about that aspect of the legislation.  Both publicly and privately these fears were made known during the period in which the Bill was considered.  A strong case was made by Members on all sides for a graduated scale of penalties based on blood alcohol levels and greater discretion for the courts, particularly in cases of marginal infringements.  The arguments made in support of a graduated scale of penalties were stronger than those against.  However, it was not included in that Bill.</P>
    <P>We all accept that a wide range of factors other than alcohol can and do contribute to road accidents.  These include excessive speed; bad roads; substandard public lighting; wet, icy or greasy road surfaces; poor visibility; defective or poorly lit vehicles; dangerous overtaking; and drivers who show no consideration for other users or no regard for road signs.  Any one of these factors or a combination of two or more of them is possibly more likely to be the cause of a serious road accident than the intake of a small amount of alcohol.</P>
    <P>The problems with the 1994 Act arose because it was perceived to be purely anti-drink driving legislation and the penalties provided for in the case of low blood alcohol level offences were considered out of proportion to the gravity of the offence.  The drink driving aspect of the legislation was highlighted when <Col N="354" /> the Bill was published and it attracted the bulk of the publicity received when the legislation was going through the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>This aspect was also hyped when sections of the legislation were brought into force shortly before Christmas.  This coincided with the start of the annual pre-Christmas road safety campaign, which was another problem.  In addition to increasing the penalties and the mandatory disqualification period for all drink driving offences, the 1994 Act also introduced the mandatory requirement that anyone who had been disqualified for such an offence would have to pass a driving test and produce a letter of competency in order to gain a new driving licence.</P>
    <P>The publicity surrounding the Christmas road safety campaign put a continuing spotlight on the provisions of the 1994 Act.  To underpin the campaign the Garda traffic section adopted a high profile.  Photographs of Garda checkpoints appeared in all the newspapers.  On radio and television there were stories of drivers being breathalysed and failing the test after as few as two drinks. Everyone knew the penalties and became more convinced they were out of proportion, certainly in cases of marginal offences.</P>
    <P>The road safety campaign advertisements were insensitive to rural areas, which did not help matters.  Exhortations such as: &ldquo;Hop on a bus, Gus&rdquo;; &ldquo;Take a taxi, Maxi&rdquo;; or &ldquo;Grab the DART, Bart&rdquo; went down like a lead balloon in rural Ireland and put people's backs up.  The PR people who devised these slogans showed no awareness of the existence of an Ireland outside the Pale or of the realities of life in that Ireland.</P>
    <P>Law abiding people, who a week earlier could lawfully drive to a local pub and have a couple of drinks, felt trapped and criminalised.  Advice to catch a DART had little relevance or use to these people.  Telling those in sparsely populated or remote rural areas to make alternative transport arrangements <Col N="355" /> when this was not possible was of little consolation.</P>
    <P>An elderly farmer living alone at the end of an otherwise uninhabited rural road, who drove to his local pub on a Saturday or Sunday night for a drink and a chat with his neighbours, became a victim and a prisoner of the new laws. For him, losing his driving licence would be the end of the line because he would need his car or tractor to get around his fragmented holding or go to the mart, the shop or the church.  He would feel he had little option but to dispense with his weekly visit to the pub.</P>
    <P>Some people said this would not happen. There were those who said people would make alternative arrangements and that there would be little disruption, if any, of business or social life in rural communities.  These people were proved wrong.  It was not possible for the majority of people in rural areas to make alternative transport arrangements. Public transport in these areas is non-existent and taxis and hackney cars are few and far between.  Publicans who tried to make transport arrangements for their customers ran into insurance and other difficulties.  The consequences were that over the Christmas period, rural towns and villages all over the country were like ghost towns.  Pubs were deserted and turnover in many cases was down by as much as 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>There was a groundswell of deep resentment and anger against the new drink driving legislation.  This was fanned by many reports of early morning checkpoints where people on their way to work were breathalysed.  According to the reports many of these people had made alternative transport arrangements when going out for a few drinks or to a Christmas party the night before. I do not know whether these reports were true or false but they were widespread during that period.  I believe that even the staunchest supporters of the new limit and penalty saw that the legislation would have to be amended.  The impact of the legislation on rural communities, <Col N="356" /> people living in remote areas and on public house business in rural areas was far greater than anybody had envisaged.  The disqualification period, particularly for marginal offenders, was seen as an extremely severe penalty.</P>
    <P>Any disqualification period is a severe penalty and results in a loading being applied to that person's motor insurance premium by the insurance company.  A loading can be of the order of 200 per cent or more and normally lasts for five years.  It applies even though the insurance company does not suffer any loss or pay out arising from the offence in respect of which the disqualification is imposed.  Many people have reservations about the mandatory disqualification, except in the case of very serious offences, because it is used by motor insurance companies as a justification or excuse for imposing exorbitant increases and loading.  This is particularly unjust in cases where there was no loss to the insurance company.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we should have a system of penalty points for some of the less serious road traffic offences.  Under such a system there would be an automatic disqualification for any driver incurring an aggregate of a certain number of points.  Penalty points could automatically be erased at the end of two or three years from the date on which they were incurred.  Such penalty points could be applied in respect of a wide range of road traffic offences where the offence was deemed by the court as not sufficiently serious to warrant a disqualification. One such offence could be a marginal breach of the drink driving limit.  Such a system would be much more satisfactory than the black and white situation we have at present.  It would also be a fair and effective system.</P>
    <P>To use a modern cliché, such a system could be described as an integrated approach to road safety.  It would not place a particularly strong emphasis on one type of offence, thereby possibly reducing the emphasis there should on other road traffic offences.  It would be an incentive to drivers, particularly <Col N="357" /> those who had incurred some penalty points, to ensure they did not incur any more.  It would also be a much more equitable system for dealing with relatively marginal offences rather than imposing a penalty that included a mandatory disqualification, however short.  Mandatory disqualification has serious implications.  Such a system would be consistent with the principle of graduated penalties enshrined in this Bill and it would have the effect of attracting widespread public support for what the Minister, and indeed all of us, are endeavouring to do in the area of road safety.</P>
    <P>I welcome the amendments provided for in the Bill.  Perhaps the Minister will give some consideration to the suggestion I made about a penalty points system as a possible alternative to mandatory penalties in the case of less serious road traffic offences, particularly offences covered by the lowest blood alcohol band provided for in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimTownsend" hpid="Mr. Townsend Mr. Townsend">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Townsend</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I congratulate the Minister on his approach to this Bill.  He had extensive consultations with and listened to people on both sides and this can be seen in the provisions of the Bill.  When Ministers settle into office and embark on the dicky bow circuit, they often exclude the views of ordinary people and do not listen to them.  However, this Minister has set a good example.  He is prepared to listen to what people have to say and he is to be complimented for that.  He has set a headline.</P>
      <P>The 1994 Road Traffic Act had many fine provisions, but because its introduction coincided with the usual Christmas publicity campaign to reduce accidents it provoked huge hostility.  This hostility was not just among the publicans but among the general public as well.  This hostility was much greater in rural areas where there was no transport or taxis available.  I have never seen anything like the hostility in my area.  I was actually afraid to go to Mass on Sunday in case I would get a going over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="358" /> The current Minister came under much pressure to increase the blood alcohol levels from 80 milligrammes to its former limit of 100 milligrammes.  I believe he was right to refuse to do so, as the previous Minister was right to drop the level to 80 milligrammes.  They were right because in eight of the EU member states the limit is 80 milligrammes and it is lower in the other states.  It would have been totally wrong if our limit was higher and out of step with the rest of Europe.</P>
    <P>The provision in the 1994 Act, which reduced the permissible alcohol level from 100 to 80 milligrammes and at the same time disqualified anyone over 80 milligrammes from driving for two years and made it mandatory for such a person to pass a driving test before a licence was returned, went a few steps too far.  No one can justify dealing so severely with a person slightly over the 80 milligrammes limit who was convicted under the 1994 Act.  The crime, if it could be called that, certainly did not justify the sentence.</P>
    <P>There was much folklore and tales about what might happen and what would not happen.  We all heard of the possibility of a person going to his local pub for a social drink after a day's work who could expect, after consuming approximately two pints, to lose his licence for two years and to have to pass a driving test before his licence would be given back.  In practical terms, hundreds of thousands of people in rural Ireland have done that for many generations. It is a tradition in rural Ireland that people go to their local pub for a chat and to meet their neighbours and have a social drink.  Because of the new regulations, these people almost found themselves prisoners in their own homes and they were infuriated.</P>
    <P>The Minister's graded system of penalties and the requirement not to have to pass a driving test before one's licence is returned except in exceptional circumstances is a victory for commonsense. It is also worth noting that the courts have been given discretion in certain circumstances and I welcome that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="359" /> The Vintners Federation of Ireland have told Members of the Seanad about two matters.  It is still a little concerned about one of the provisions in the present legislation.  It feels that the mandatory loss of a licence for three months on first conviction with a blood alcohol level of 80 milligrammes per 100 millilitres is unnecessarily severe, bearing in mind that it is mandatory and applies even when there is no injured party or victim.  I would have preferred to have that left to the discretion of the courts.  It also pointed out that many insurance companies could take advantage of this situation and impose a far greater penalty in that they could load the insurance.  Maybe the Minister, even at this late stage, could look at that.</P>
    <P>I would like clarification from the Minister, when he is replying, on another section of the Bill.  It appears he has made a provision in the 1995 Bill to allow people convicted under the 1994 Act to apply to the courts to have their disqualification orders amended and brought into line with the 1995 Bill when passed.  If my interpretation is correct &mdash; and I hope the Minister can clarify that &mdash; it is more than welcome.</P>
    <P>This Bill represents a job well done. In conclusion, I ask the Minister to look at the two requests for alterations from the Vintners Federation of Ireland, because they make sense.  I also ask the Minister, if he is not already doing so, to monitor the situation insofar as insurance companies are concerned.  If they are seen to be taking advantage of this situation when no accident or third party is involved, the Minister should take whatever action is necessary to curtail this criminal practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The background to this Bill was the effort made by the previous Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith, to change the drink culture in this country, especially as it related to drunk driving.  Acting on advice at the time, and it has now been adequately aired, he has given his reasons why he proceeded at the time with the stringent <Col N="360" /> penalties which became part of the Road Traffic Act, 1994.  That Act was debated in both Houses of the Oireachtas and was passed by both the Dáil and Seanad.  It was not until the full implications of the penalty aspects of the Bill became widely publicised that the various lobby interests in this country, led by the Vintners Federation of Ireland, attempted to have the legislation changed by way of public protest. Indeed, this is their right.  In many cases, as has been pointed out by my colleague, Senator Mullooly, and Senator Townsend, the very livelihood of the owners of rural public houses was seen to be at stake if the sections of the Bill relating to penalties were to proceed through the courts.  It is true that during the Christmas period business for many rural and, indeed, urban public houses was well down on previous years.  The ex-Minister, in losing that battle, has not lost the war &mdash; and it is a war.  The real message of this legislation, in its original and amended form, is that if one drinks, one does not drive.  It is a simple message. It has nothing to do with pub or drink culture, public houses, the Vintners Federation of Ireland, lobby groups or anybody else.  It is simply stating that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reaction to the original proposals attracted a wide spectrum of comment. Some of those who got involved in the debate on penalties &mdash; articles I read by Kevin Myers of <i>The Irish Times</i> and Tom McGuirk of the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> on this issue spring to mind &mdash; warned of an impending social disaster that would end the social life that we know and love in Ireland.  The hysteria, and it was hysteria, that surrounded the introduction of this Bill created the impression that Ireland would literally close down overnight.  The annual anti-drink driving campaign, which, irrespective of the new legislation, has saved and continues to save lives, unfortunately coincided with the introduction of the provisions of the new Road Traffic Act.  The resultant campaign to amend the more controversial elements <Col N="361" /> of that Act has, inevitably, brought us back to this House.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Senator Mullooly, has teased out in great detail the impact of the original legislation on rural Ireland and of the various attempts that have been made to amend the legislation. bringing it to the point we are at today. I do not intend to repeat what he said. However, I wish to state a personal interest.  I do not drink, although contrary to some comments.  I did drink during my formative years when living in England; and, having had that experience, I am aware of what it can do to the faculties.  The fact that I do not drink is not based on any ideological hangup &mdash; I came to the conclusion that I did not like it and that it did not like me &mdash; so I have no problem with drinking or with anybody who drinks and I frequent public houses.  Indeed, my late father often used to say that he grew up in a public house.</P>
    <P>I grew up &mdash; perhaps this influences my thinking about contemporary Irish society and my attitude towards drink in general &mdash; in a culture and at a time when public houses were places for adults; they were not for young people. Celebrating an examination result or another social occasion usually centred around an ice cream soda in the local shop and the thought of going to a pub never entered our young minds.  In my teenage years the public house was still a no-go area.  If you won a football competition, you certainly did not fill the cup with anything stronger than orange or lemonade.  That was the way things were.  Those teenagers in our peer group who were known to frequent pubs during my time were usually socially shunned.  Sadly, as those Members who are in the licensed trade will readily testify, there are rotten apples in every profession and there are publicans, even in my home town, who will serve underage drinkers with impunity and get away with it.  They were not the sort of company one kept and they tended to operate in their own milieu.</P>
    <P>However, today's pub culture in Ireland is all pervasive.  Celebration <Col N="362" /> with drink has now become so entrenched in our society that when the ex-Minister for the Environment attempted to bring us into line with the rest of Europe and introduce legislation that was already accepted in Europe, he was almost socially ostracised.  His family suffered personal abuse.  Senator Townsend said he had difficulty going to Mass in Carlow.  He should talk to the former Minister, Deputy Michael Smith, about what happened to him and his family coming up to Christmas.  Such outrageous attacks should not be visited on a public representative from any party doing their legislative duty and discharging their legislative obligation. Lobby groups, especially the Vintners Federation of Ireland, and those attempting to change the legislation, which is their democratic right, publicly deplored what was going on.  It would be remiss of me as a friend and colleague of the former Minister and as a parliamentarian, irrespective of whether I know him, not to put on record how appalled we were by this attack on a public representative.</P>
    <P>If the controversy surrounding this legislation has done nothing else, it has awakened the majority of the people to the fact that the abuse of drink and the combination of driving while drunk is lethal.  It has made people aware of that lethal cocktail.  However, it would be churlish and stupid of me not to mention the anguish experienced by publicans, particularly those in rural areas, as a result of the original proposals in the Road Traffic Act, 1994, and their interpretation of its penalties in terms of the impact they would have on their businesses. Like many country towns, my home town has a preponderance of public houses.  Decent honourable people attempting to run their businesses efficiently and legally and to raise their families and pay their taxes found themselves in a situation where they believed that the implications of the penalties in the Road Traffic Act, 1994, would have a serious short to medium term and perhaps a fatal long term effect on their businesses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="363" /> The impact of the legislation was such that not only in my home town but throughout rural Ireland, publicans came together to organise minibuses and transport for their clientele in order to encourage them to come out and to ensure that if they drank more than perhaps the legislation allowed, they would not be subjected to breathalyser tests on the way home which would scare them and, as has been pointed out by many speakers, would create a situation where they would drink at home and not in a bar.  If the original legislation has been left as it was, we would have faced a situation where, similar to a number of other European countries, the tradition of drinking outside the home by gathering for a social drink in a public house would have been all but eliminated.</P>
    <P>The legislation would not have diminished the amount of alcohol consumed, but it would have effected a change in social and cultural habits which are endemic and unique to this country because of our rural population.  The change would have been so great that businesses would have had to close and families would have found themselves destitute.  I do not believe any Government or legislator would be able to defend that result.  In that context I supported representations made, particularly by the Vintners Federation of Ireland, as a representative of local publicans who are friends of mine.  I would not support any legislation which would make an already difficult employment situation in rural Ireland any worse.</P>
    <P>As regards the change in the Administration, I am inclined to believe, although it is only supposition, that if the last Fianna Fáil-Labour Government had remained in office over Christmas and into 1995, the former Minister or his representative would be in the House putting forward perhaps the same proposals which we are being asked to pass today.  I say that because representations from lobby groups gathered momentum over the Christmas period and into the New Year which <Col N="364" /> resulted in meetings between the new Minister and various groups at the end of January and February.  He acted quickly and introduced amending legislation which I have no doubt will be passed.</P>
    <P>It is important to say to those on the other side of the argument &mdash; for example, the association representing the victims of drink driving &mdash; that I do not believe this amending legislation constitutes a reversal of or a filtering down of the thinking or philosophy behind the 1994 Act.  It is a human response to that legislation in that it now allows a certain discretion where social drinking is concerned.  Those of us who have studied the various reports and tests carried out in the light of this controversy in the past few months will testify to the fact that the absorption of alcohol into the system varies from individual to individual.  I could drink three pints and the Leas-Chathaoirleach six pints, but they may have no effect. However, somebody else could be affected by drinking two pints.</P>

      <P>My intention was to emphasise that there are different strokes for different folks.  It has been proven that alcohol affects people differently.  People who over three or four hours consume alcohol above what would be considered the legal limit often insist they are capable of driving a car.  However, they are found to be wrong when tested.  Licensed vintners would not defend the idea that absorption of alcohol is uniform, and to some degree the amending legislation recognises that.  The Vintners Federation of Ireland has corresponded with Members in recent days seeking further <Col N="365" /> amendments to the legislation.  I am sure the Minister is aware of these representations and I am sure he will address those concerns in his reply on Second Stage.  While I am not an expert, the approach by the Vintners Federation of Ireland seems reasonable, but I will rely on how the Minister views it in relation to the amending legislation.</P>
      <P>I want to comment on a point made by Senator Mullooly.  The greatest insult to rural Ireland was made during this controversy by some &ldquo;genius&rdquo; in the National Road Safety Association &mdash; I would love to know and talk to that person &mdash; who devised a supercilious approach to encourage people to drink but not to drive by referring to the DART, the bus and the taxi.  It was so insulting to rural people, not because it mentioned public transport which is not available in many parts of rural Ireland but because the individual who created the campaign to encourage people not to drink and drive was so insular, closeted, parochial and secure in their east coast, Dublin 4 attitude that they believed this campaign would have a good effect.  However, that did not happen.</P>
      <P>We have learned our lesson, although none of us is perfect.  I hope the Minister, who will have some responsibility for ensuring that the effects of this legislation are brought home to the people, will ensure that a more imaginative campaign will have genuine appeal, not only in one part of Ireland but nationally and across the age groups.</P>
      <P>The biggest problem facing society in the next decade will be the growing number of young people abusing alcohol, which is a drug.  I have no solution to how one reverses the culture I have outlined which has developed over the last two decades in this country. However, I am sure the Minister agrees that we all have a responsibility to protect the innocent in this regard and to eliminate the scourge of underage drinking in society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Vintners Federation of Ireland, in particular, to be the vanguard of this new campaign.  I know that <Col N="366" /> responsible vintners in this country abhor underage drinking and that they do everything in their power to root it out.  This situation has reached crisis proportions.  Drink is now at the centre of all social activity.  You, a Leas-Chathaoirleach, or I never believed the day would come when the GAA would take drinks sponsorship.  This shows the dramatic change in attitudes in this country.  Abuse of drink is a lethal weapon and it causes chaos and death in irresponsible hands.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposals in this legislation, but I hope we as legislators try to address the abuse of alcohol, which will have a detrimental effect on our society.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Stagg, to the House.  The Minister and the Government have got the balance right as regards the proposed changes.  This happened as a result of the review which took place after the changes in the previous legislation were examined.  Strong lobby groups were represented, including those which Senator Howard and Senator Bohan were involved in, and also other well meaning associations such as the Mothers Against Drunk Driving, insurance companies, etc.  It was important that a review took place after a certain period so that hasty decisions were not made.  I deplore the attacks made on the previous Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is widespread support for what we are trying to achieve in this area. Differences arise over how difficulties are resolved in urban and rural areas. The message from this debate must be that if one is drinking, one should make alternative arrangements to get home. There are different ways of solving this problem in different areas.  Many publicans in the Dublin area took this matter seriously and provided minibuses and coaches at a nominal fee or free gratis in areas where major functions were held. They tried to ensure that people got home.  Lack of taxis and minibuses meant that people could not get home <Col N="367" /> when they wanted to.  This situation must also be considered.</P>
    <P>If one travels around the city during the day one will see that taxi ranks are full.  Unlike other major cities, where people would not think about bringing their cars to work, we do so every morning and create traffic jams.  It is important to look at ways of improving late night transport.  Great improvements have taken place in the Dublin area in relation to link buses which travel at certain times during the night. Changes have also taken place in relation to taxis.  This system is continuing in certain public houses in the Dublin area; it is not only a two or three week phenomenon in December.  We must encourage this to continue.</P>
    <P>The message from this debate must be that if one is drinking, one should not drive.  The Minister has looked at the system and made some changes.  Road carnage was reduced in December 1994, when there were 28 fatalities &mdash; 28 too many &mdash; and 729 injuries.  This compares with 1993 when there were 41 fatalities and 965 injuries.  We must reduce this even further.  These accidents are not all drink related.  One hears about tragic accidents at odd times which have been caused by speed, faulty brakes, bald tyres, etc.  Drink is not always the cause, although some will be drink related.</P>
    <P>The road safety campaign should continue throughout the year rather than being restricted to Christmas, when everyone has a good time at parties which they feel they cannot miss.  If people are going out for a night they should make it more enjoyable by not driving.</P>
    <P>Obviously the situation in rural Ireland poses difficulties, although I understand that in some areas publicans have responded positively.  I am sure that my colleagues who are actively involved as nominees of their respective associations will inform the Vintners Federation that some publicans could do a lot more than they have been doing.  While some responded positively <Col N="368" /> by recognising the need for change in our culture and trying to improve the situation, others did not want to put anything back in.  While no one wants to see anyone's livelihood being taken away, I would rather see people alive than people's livelihoods being threatened.</P>
    <P>It was unrealistic to expect that we would go back to the former limit of 100 milligrammes.  I support the fact that no change has been made to the new limit of 80 milligrammes which is now in place.  However, it must recognised, as with other aspects of the criminal code, that a balanced sliding scale is required for different, more serious offences.  The Minister has addressed that situation as far as possible and, while it is not foolproof, by and large he has got the balance reasonably right.</P>
    <P>The vintners have suggested that no driving disqualification should apply for a first offence.  But, unfortunately, if we are trying to get away from this culture and ensure that there is no drinking and driving, we must accept that some disqualification is necessary.  I do not know how hard the vintners are pushing their case, but given some of the progress they have made on this matter so far, they have not done too badly in relation to the changes that have been made.  I suppose that if they did not go for that they would not be doing their job.</P>
    <P>In common with most Members on the other side of the House, we support the legislation which deals with an area that cannot be decided in a political way.  Opposition Members, who were on this side a few months ago, are every bit as concerned as we are in trying to achieve a certain balance as well as publicising the message that drinking and driving are not on.  I am sure all Members of the House support that view.</P>
    <P>In his reply I trust that the Minister will address some of the points that I and others have made.  After the review we have, hopefully, got the balance right, although it is hard to be absolutely accurate in such matters.  It is important for the message to go out that drinking <Col N="369" /> and driving are just not on and those consuming alcohol must recognise the need to be stricter with themselves than previously.  Publicans can also help by not pushing drink on people who have already had one too many, by helping to get people home safely and by not serving drink to young people who are underage.  Young people have enough difficulties without having to come to terms with problems arising from excessive drinking.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill and hope that the proposed balance will achieve the desired results.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank all Senators who contributed to the debate on this short but important Bill.  I was pleased to note a broad level of agreement in the House and a general welcome for the proposals to grade disqualification periods by reference to alcohol levels.</P>
      <P>The Bill has a very narrow focus.  Its Long Title describes it as an Act to amend certain provisions of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, relating to consequential disqualification orders.  It was inevitable, however, given the background to the Bill, that some contributions would relate to issues outside its scope.</P>
      <P>In my response to the debate I intend to concentrate on the main points raised in relation to disqualifications, and penalties generally, for drink driving offences.  In the Minister's opening contribution he described the Bill as &ldquo;tough but fair&rdquo; and said it was &ldquo;striking a balance&rdquo;. I believe we have got that balance right.  While some Senators expressed reservations, particularly on points of detail, the thrust of our proposals has attracted all party support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the main issues raised during the course of the debate yesterday and today was the treatment of offenders with alcohol levels in the bottom band. Since this Bill was published, I have heard a number of different viewpoints on that issue, which shows the difficulty of reaching a consensus.  A number of <Col N="370" /> Senators argued that the imposition of a disqualification for drivers with blood alcohol levels of 80 to 100 milligrammes would be very severe.  As far as the policy issue is concerned, the Government is satisfied that some period of disqualification, however short, should apply to all drink driving offences.  This has been the case since 1961.  The Government carefully considered this issue, including the arguments raised by Senators in this debate, and is satisfied that a period of three months' disqualification for a first offence, with an alcohol level in the bottom band, is the correct period.</P>
    <P>The second major issue raised in the course of the debate was the cost of motor insurance and the practice of insurance companies in loading the premiums of motorists involved in accidents or prosecuted for road traffic offences and disqualified from driving. A number of Senators mentioned the implications for motor insurance premiums as a factor in influencing their views on disqualifications for motorists caught &ldquo;just over the limit&rdquo;.  The primary aim of road safety initiatives is to reduce the number of accidents, save lives and prevent injuries.</P>
    <P>Reducing the cost of motor insurance for all drivers is a further key aim.  The cost of motor insurance is directly linked to the level of compensation payments. As road deaths and injuries are reduced, we expect to see reductions in the cost of insurance for all motorists. The Minister has, in fact, discussed this particular issue with insurance interests. One company has already responded and hopefully more will follow that example.</P>
    <P>A conviction for any serious traffic offence, and not just one resulting in an endorsement or disqualification, will impact on a driver's motor insurance premium.  This is not a requirement of road traffic legislation; it is a practice developed by the insurance companies, who determine the cost of insurance for individuals on the basis of their assessment of risk.  In relation to motor insurance costs generally, I should add that my colleague, the Minister of State <Col N="371" /> at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, has decided to commission a study to analyse insurance costs and identify the key factors contributing to higher costs in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I would like to respond to two additional queries raised in the debate. Senator Kiely referred to drivers under the influence of drugs and suggested that this was probably a greater problem than alcohol.  This, of course, is also an offence.  &ldquo;Intoxicant&rdquo; includes both alcohol and drugs.  Under section 14 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994, a blood specimen can be sought from a person suspected of being under the influence of drugs.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis queried the position in relation to changes in the alcohol level.  Under the 1994 Act the Minister may vary the legal alcohol limit by way of regulation.  However, the normal procedures governing the making of such regulations do not apply.  Before such regulations can be made, a draft of the regulation must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and each House must pass a resolution approving the draft.  In other words, the draft regulations must be debated in each House and passed by each House.</P>
    <P>Senator Mullooly suggested the adoption of a penalty points system as an alternative to endorsement or disqualification. It was suggested that penalty points would apply to minor or first offences only rather than the more serious offences we are discussing here, which would not be envisaged as being included in a points system building up to a disqualification.  The concept is attractive but, as I say, only for minor offences and not for drink driving ones. At this stage the technology is not available to operate a penalty points system. It requires a sophisticated central driving licence register which is not yet in place but is being developed.</P>
    <P>Senator Townsend asked for clarification about people who committed offences under the 1994 Act.  There is a transitional clause dealing with these cases.  Under section 3 of the Bill, certain <Col N="372" /> people convicted of offences committed since 2 December 1994 can apply to the court to have disqualifications amended to bring the periods of disqualification into line with those in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their contributions. The overall thrust of the Bill has been welcomed and I look forward to the co-operation of the House in facilitating its early passage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise again with the Minister some points I made on Second Stage.  I do not propose to repeat my arguments in detail.  I asked the Minister to consider amending the Bill to permit the courts a measure of discretion in relation to the lower category of between 81 and 100 milligrammes. I made my argument under three headings. I said that as a matter of principle it is not helpful that the Oireachtas continuously makes laws providing for mandatory penalties and leaving the courts with no discretion.  No two cases are ever the same.  The purpose of the courts is to administer justice on the basis of the facts and evidence presented to them.  As a matter of principle, I believe it is wrong to provide for <Col N="373" /> mandatory penalties.  I do not expect to be successful in having my proposal apply to the full range of penalties but it could be applied to the lower levels. The Minister of State dealt with that to a certain degree this morning.  He said that mandatory sentences for drunk driving have been provided in legislation since about 1962.</P>
      <P>My second point related to insurance cover.  Experience has shown that when an endorsement or a driving ban has been imposed insurance companies have been applying insurance cost increases of between 100 and 150 per cent over a five year period.  The Minister for State's answer was under two headings.  He said that an increase in insurance costs was a recognised penalty and that a person must be conscious that he or she runs such a risk.  That is one argument.  However, that is no justification, particularly when there is no accident involved, for the insurance company imposing such penal increases. The Minister of State went on to say that another Minister of State is establishing a commission to look at the question of the cost of motor insurance in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State did not refer to my third point, which dealt with those engaged in an errand of mercy.  There must be discretion where such people are concerned.  I mentioned the various categories yesterday.  I offered my county as being a typical example of many rural counties.  In west Clare one is 70 miles from a general hospital.  Basically, one is 70 miles from an ambulance if there is an emergency and if a person must be brought to hospital.  Such emergencies can occur at Christmas as well as during other periods.  Let us assume that somebody who is obliging and who has no advance knowledge that this journey must be undertaken is called urgently after drinking one or two pints in the pub and is marginally over the limit when stopped at a checkpoint. Unless the garda at the checkpoint is prepared to apply discretion, it cannot be applied from that point on.  Once the breathalyser test is given everything else <Col N="374" /> falls into place.  Even if that errand of mercy has been responsible for saving a life or two lives, no mitigating circumstances can be accepted by a court.  That is an aspect of the issue that should be examined.</P>
    <P>I offered other examples, including one involving a doctor.  I might have misunderstood Senator Henry when she commented on the doctor who went out with &ldquo;a few jars&rdquo; on him to respond to a road accident because the nearest other doctor was ten miles away and was already tied up with another emergency. She said that the doctor could have been in difficulty with the Medical Council.  If I understood her correctly, that was another example of the misunderstanding people can have of life in rural Ireland.  That doctor was having a house party.  Perhaps he had had a few drinks.  He responded to a call and perhaps he saved lives by doing so.  If he was not prepared to do that and if the next available doctor was 20 miles away and if a life had been lost, the community would have run him out of the parish and out of the area.  Perhaps I misunderstood the Senator's point. However, if I did not, that is the type of misunderstanding that can be so hurtful.</P>
    <P>My final point is relevant to the section.  One of the factors that contributed to the mayhem was the morning-after checkpoint.  The authorities say that this has been exaggerated and that it did not happen.  It happened outside a factory in Shannon in my constituency. It also happened outside a factory in the industrial estate in Raheen in Limerick.  I am reliably informed that it happened outside the sugar factory in Carlow.  It has been said that only a small number of samples was sent for analysis.  However, the presence of the checkpoint caused consternation and upheaval in the rural community.  It was so serious that I was one of a number of publicans who put a minibus on the road.  I believed it was the proper thing to do in the circumstances.  However, people who were going to work the following morning would not come in to the pub on the minibus.  In fact, I ended <Col N="375" /> up carrying pioneers, although that was fair enough.  Terror was created about the morning-after checkpoint among people who were going to work the following morning.</P>
    <P>I wish to conclude, although I am probably exploiting my time limits on this matter.</P>

      <P>Thank you.  I will make my final point.  Senator Mooney spoke this morning about the effects of the previous Bill.  He said that if it had been allowed to continue in force it would have created a cultural sea change in rural society in Ireland in the sense that people would no longer drink in the pubs but at home.  Given the experience of the morning after drink party, they would not drink at home either.</P>
      <P>I spoke about mental stability yesterday and I do not wish to develop the point any further, but the Minister and yourself, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, being understanding people, know what I am referring to.  I make a last appeal to the Minister to consider an amendment between now and Report Stage to provide some measure of discretion with regard to the lower level of infringement, especially in respect of errands of mercy and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>As a former Minister for Health, perhaps the Minister has some form of morning after treatment for people who have been drinking, although I am not sure if any pill has been designed to deal with this situation. Coming from west County Clare, I appreciate the points made by Senator Howard.  Does the Minister have any statistics or information which indicates that there is a more serious problem in the built up urban areas and busy highways and motorways than in the isolated rural areas with regard to drink driving offences and breaches of the law?  In my experience over the years there is no area which is exempt from the difficulties <Col N="376" /> experienced with people drinking and driving.  I am not sure that the difficulties can be confined to certain areas and from that declare that special measures should be taken in these areas while allowing exemptions in other areas.  While I appreciate what Senator Howard is seeking to achieve, I am not sure therefore how the Minister can address the matter.</P>
      <P>To what extent will the provisions of section 2 allow for mitigations?  Has the Minister any indication that these will have a major impact?  Do the main cases brought by the authorities refer to new cases rather than to cases where people have had previous convictions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Howard is consistent and clear in the line he has taken on the Bill and from the time the Road Traffic Act, 1994 was first proposed by my predecessor, and I have given careful consideration to the points he has made to me.  We have approached this Bill in an open way and have asked all sections of the community for their views.  As I indicated on Second Stage, I have met with a cross section of the general public and with representative organisations on the measures that were part of the 1994 Act.</P>
      <P>What I have proposed in the Bill is as far as it is reasonable to go.  It strikes the necessary balance by giving a clear message from the Oireachtas that drinking and driving is not acceptable while at the same time addressing an issue which was perceived by the public to be unfair, that the penalty was the same regardless of the degree of guilt or of offence.  The proposals I have put to the House in the Bill go as far as is reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the request to allow further discretion to the courts at the lower level to decide cases, we must be careful of the signal we give from this House.  A disqualification has always been part of the enforcement of drunken driving since the original drunk driving legislation was enacted in the early 1960s.  If we now have a category <Col N="377" /> of drinking and driving that does not have a disqualification we are sending a strong negative message to the public that somehow this category is not a serious offence.  However, the statistics available to us show that, even at the level of 80 milligrammes, there is a very significant increase in the potential for an accident, and we must all work to minimise the risk of accidents.  Unfortunately, therefore, I am not in a position to accept Senator Howard's proposal that I should go further than I have suggested and give discretion with regard to the mandatory disqualification at the lower band.  The courts have discretion with regard to all of the other penalties &mdash; for example, in respect of the amount of the fine &mdash; and flexibility is also provided should they wish to impose a stiffer period of suspension.  We must get the balance right, and it is right in the proposals which I have put before the House.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard raised a number of issues, which my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, addressed this morning.  I spoke of the principle of mandatory penalties.  It is a statement by the Oireachtas that we regard this as a serious offence.  I want to have a serious, but graded penalty so that somebody who is slightly over the limit faces a less severe penalty than somebody who is blind drunk.  It is a reasonable provision.</P>
    <P>On the issue of insurance, insurance companies are commercial organisations and they will operate on the basis of related risk.  While the cost of insurance is a cause of concern, especially motor insurance, insurance companies will have regard to the added risk of somebody who has a conviction. When statistics show that drink is related to at least some road traffic accidents, somebody who has been found guilty of an offence will have added risk and will then face an added loading.  I am not sure that there is much we can do about this, but I am anxious, in conjunction with my Government colleagues, to ensure that insurance premia <Col N="378" /> generally are pushed down.  I have had discussions with representatives of the insurance industry on this matter and we have had a positive response from one company so far.  Hopefully, it will be followed by other companies when they see the improvements in risk as people are more careful in the way they drive on our roads.  I accept the case put by many Senators that it is not exclusively a matter of drinking and driving but that it is also a matter of proper care and attention, speed and the quality of our road systems.  All of these factors must be addressed in a comprehensive way and I assure the House that the issue will get my clear attention.</P>
    <P>The one issue which Senator Howard felt was not responded to on Second Stage was the mercy mission.  It is a human dilemma and one which anybody would empathise with in the particular, when a specific errand of mercy is carried out by a doctor or veterinarian on behalf of a neighbour in need.  We cannot make law for specific categories like that and we cannot give a blanket exemption to any category of people in society.  People must be equal before the law, however, with regard to enforcement. There are flexibilities in the way gardaí handle matters.  Nevertheless, in fairness, everybody &mdash; the Garda, ourselves &mdash; will have to say that if one is not fit to drive and if one is called out, one should not drive in those circumstances. Perhaps the options are not good in the circumstances of the case put forward by Senator Howard &mdash; for example, if there is no other doctor for a considerable distance &mdash; but a doctor would not be too happy to either drive a car while under the influence of alcohol, much less treat a patient.  While there is a human dimension to the case put, again it is not possible for me to respond to it in any more forthright a way than I have done in the proposition before the House.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard also referred to the details with regard to checkpoints and samples in the early morning.  After Christmas, when I was not very long in the Department of the Environment, it <Col N="379" /> became clear to me that perhaps because not much happens at Christmas, this legislation had become the talking point of the nation.  Like most talking points during a holiday period, the stories grew like Topsy. Most of them were related directly to me.  It became clear that there was not a milkman safe in the country because on a daily basis I heard of scores of them being stopped.  There was not an early morning worker or postman in the country who had not been checked. Many of those stories were not true.</P>
    <P>I asked the Garda authorities to give me the details and they told me that no additional checks other than the normal checks were added for the Christmas period.  There will be normal road checks and that is right and proper, but the only absolutely reliable data we have is the number of samples sent for analysis.  I can reaffirm for the House that during the period 2 December to 31 December 1994, a total of 308 blood or urine specimens were taken from arrested drivers.  Some 70 per cent were taken between midnight and 6 a.m.  The total number of samples taken between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m. was ten.  In three cases of those the blood/alcohol level was below the limit and in the other seven cases the blood/alcohol level ranged from 156 mg to 229 mg.  Most of those early morning cases were very much in excess of the permissible limit, in fact very much in excess of the level at which the maximum penalty in this amended Bill applies.</P>
    <P>I do not think that there was a campaign in the morning, but if there was an accident or a case where somebody was driving erratically, naturally the Garda authorities have a duty to see whether the person is fit to drive or, if they are under the influence of alcohol, to take a sample and prosecute them in the normal way.  We are not creating a law that requires people to be sober at night only and which allows them to be under the influence of alcohol in the early morning.  The whole thrust of the Bill and the intention of my predecessor <Col N="380" /> is to make the roads as safe as we can. The balance in the amendments I am proposing to the Bill today improves the fairness and public acceptability of the law and I hope it will add to rather than detract from the concerted effort of successive Ministers for the Environment to make the roads safer.</P>
    <P>In reply to Senator Daly's specific question, I am not familiar with any differences in the severity of the problem of drinking and driving between urban and rural areas.  It occurs across the country, in all strata of society, in urban and rural areas alike.  It is noticeable that younger people do not drink and drive.  They seem to have got the message and they make their own arrangements. Generally older people who have probably grown up in a different regime, in a different time, find it harder to adjust to the current prevailing view that if you drink, you do not drive. However, that cultural change is happening. As I say, the balances introduced in this Bill are about right.  They have been broadly welcomed by most people.  Not everybody is happy with the balance, but broadly speaking most people accept that it is firm but fair.</P>

      <P>As Senators have said, this section applies to disqualifications for offences committed between the date of enactment of the previous legislation, that is, 2 December 1994, and the date of coming into force of this measure.  We talked at length in Government about this and I took clear advice from the Attorney General. Although people who have committed an offence under the old Act are subject to the penalties of the Act, on balance we felt that it would be unfair to have a window of time between December and the enactment of this legislation where offences were dealt with more severely than either before or after.</P>
      <P>We looked for a mechanism to deal with this problem.  We could not deal with it retrospectively directly.  I am grateful for the advice of the Attorney General in this matter.  We have allowed a mechanism for somebody who was dealt with under the old Act to go back to the court and be dealt with under the new provisions incorporated in the Bill before us.  That is a reasonable way of dealing with it.  I am looking to see if I have the numbers of people who may be included in this.  From December 1994 to March 1995 there are 65 people in the 81 mg to 100 mg category.  There are 365 people in the 101 mg to 150 mg category.  They are the two groups who would be affected by the changes.  These are analyses.  We do not know whether these have actually gone to the courts yet, but they would be subject to the current law.  It is a significant group of people who in fairness should have the benefit of the new regime as every other citizen will.</P>

      <P>The Seanad has now passed this Bill and it goes on to the other House, which in its wisdom may accept or reject it as the case may be. The Minister may be confronted with further and additional arguments to the ones he was confronted with here, but nonetheless I thank the Minister.  I welcomed the Bill in general yesterday. I felt that one or two improvements could be made.  The Minister did not agree with me and that is fair enough.  I do not think too many other people in this House agree with me.  However, everybody on all sides of the House agrees that this was a welcome response to a situation that caused a lot of turmoil. It was a genuine attempt to rectify that situation.  It was a reasonably rapid response.  It often takes a long time to prepare legislation.  There was a row this morning about other legislation which was promised, but has not yet appeared. However, the Minister acted with haste and met 95 per cent of the problems created by the original Bill, for which I thank him.  I also thank Senator Daly, a fellow county man and my good friend, and Senator Bohan.  It has been a good debate and I thank the Minister for his response to the concerns.</P>

      <P>On behalf of my party, I thank the Minister for the changes he has made.  We would have liked further changes to benefit the people we represent, some of whom are not very happy.  However, as Senator Howard <Col N="383" /> said, the Minister has gone a long way towards meeting the needs of those in the licensed trade.  Perhaps there would not have been a need to introduce this Bill if others had listened to our representations. We were not being unreasonable when we asked for this type of legislation.  The people we represent were very anxious to ensure that the three month ban would be lifted. Perhaps this matter could be examined again in the future.  I thank the Minister for the Bill.</P>

      <P>I thank all the Senators who contributed to the debate.  The discussion was wide ranging and covered aspects of road traffic law other than drink driving.  It was most helpful to me as the Minister responsible for road traffic and safety in general.  I do not have time now to respond to all the different points made, but I will take careful note of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also thank the Seanad for the opportunity to expeditiously introduce this Bill.  The quicker this legislation is enacted, the shorter the interregnum <Col N="384" /> period will be, as it is important not to build up a backlog of cases which need to go back to the courts.  I hope for equal speed and assistance in the other House.  I thank all Senators for their contributions, their considered views and the expert way in which they approached the Bill.</P>

      <P>I also thank the Minister and wish him well with the Bill in the Lower House.  He has adequately addressed the defects in the original piece of legislation.  Without wishing to abuse the prerogative of the Chair, I ask the Minister to examine consolidating the various pieces of legislation, which go back to 1961.</P>
