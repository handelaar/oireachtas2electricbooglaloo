      <P>I have notice from Senator Byrne that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to review the operation of the European Communities (Fees for Health Inspection and Control of Fresh Meat) Regulations, 1995, in view of the impact and cost of the regulations on local authorities and abattoir inspectors.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Cosgrave of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to establish a task force to tackle the increasing wave of crime as outlined in the recent survey carried out by RGDATA.</P>

      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to establish a task force to tackle the increasing wave of crime as outlined in the recent survey carried out by RGDATA.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Rory Kiely of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to provide assistance to the Neodata plant in County Limerick in order to save the recently announced job losses.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator O'Kennedy of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1067" /> The need for the Minister for Health to establish statutory funding for driving assessment training and advice for people with physical disabilities.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Honan of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to allay the concerns of local people regarding the removal of asbestos waste from Portarlington power station, County Laois.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Byrne, Cosgrave, Kiely and O'Kennedy as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Byrne's and Senator Cosgrave's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  I regret that I had to rule the matter raised by Senator Honan as not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment on the grounds of lack of ministerial responsibility.  The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I thank you for so readily agreeing to act as temporary Chairman for our activities today.  The Cathaoirleach is well and we hope to have him back very shortly but he will not be in the Chair for the remainder of today.  We all send him our very best wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Order of Business today is item 1 and item 14, motion No. 16.  Item 1 is the Second Stage of the Stock Exchange Bill.  Speeches by agreement are not to be longer than 20 minutes.  I have been <Col N="1068" /> asked by the Leader of the Opposition and by other Members of the Opposition if time could be made available for statements on the Attorney General's Office.  There is no point in having statements today as the matter has been very fully and exhaustively dealt with in the other House, but I am prepared to discuss the matter afresh tomorrow morning with the Leader of the Opposition and the Opposition Whips and if they then think it appropriate that time be made available for statements tomorrow, I will agree.  I know this matter will be raised so I am anticipating it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Senator Lanigan, for taking the position of Acting Chairman so readily.  I am glad the Leader has pre-empted our concerns.  I know of his absolute commitment to making this House relevant and ensuring that we are kept informed.  In that context, there is a need for statements on the events relating to the Attorney General's Office.  We hope not just for a discussion between the Whips, but that statements on the Attorney General's Office would be ordered for tomorrow, as the Leader suggested.  We would have difficulty agreeing an Order of Business tomorrow without such statements being ordered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the issue which has been mentioned by Senator Wright, that is, the need to have a debate on the Attorney General's Office.  I am happy to wait until tomorrow for this debate; that makes a lot of sense.  This matter has been debated before in the House quite usefully.  We should be told exactly what has happened. This is not merely a question of people letting off steam or putting forward their point of view.  We need a statement giving us the Government position on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also wish to take the opportunity to put on the record my gratitude to Deputy Coveney for his dealings with Members of the House, particularly myself during his period as Minister for Defence.  I feel great sympathy towards <Col N="1069" /> him.  It is a very brave person who can stand up and cast the first stone.  I appreciate his commitment to public life and I have sympathy for him.  I would be pleased to have that sentiment communicated to him.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise an issue which has been raised with me by a number of organisations dealing with people with particular disabilities, that is, the proposal that a tax would be put on blank cassette tapes.  This would have extraordinary implications for those who are vision impaired and may rely on audio cassettes and also for people with other difficulties and disabilities.  This would also have very serious implications for education and for those who need to be able to record material.  Were that to happen, it would be a tax on legal as well as illegal activities.  I am worried about this.  I tried to establish that myself rather than waste the time of the House through the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, but I am not sure if that Department has responsibility for this area.  It did not appear on the Government's list of forthcoming legislation, but it has been brought to my attention that it is intended to introduce it.  I ask the Leader to deal with this matter.</P>
    <P>Will the Leader outline the current position regarding the debate on the White Paper on education?</P>
    <P>I wish the Acting Chairman well in his new role as poacher turned gamekeeper and I extend good wishes to the Cathaoirleach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Leader's announcement about a debate tomorrow on the Office of the Attorney General. It is a vital matter and I look forward to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Health to the House to outline when mandatory reporting, as recommended by the report on the Kilkenny incest case, and the outstanding sections of the Childcare Act will be introduced.  In <Col N="1070" /> light of the horrific evidence of official neglect which was revealed in the west of Ireland incest case yesterday, all Members are anxious that these measures should be taken immediately.</P>
    <P>The independent review body set up by the Minister is a waste of time because statutory childcare professionals will be investigating themselves. They do not have the co-operation of the family and we already know what needs to be done from the Kilkenny incest case.  In that case, nobody was held accountable and I fear the same thing will happen in this case. Children will have no faith in the system if they feel, as one of the girls in that case stated, that they must be armed with an honours degree before the professionals will believe them.</P>
    <P>This situation is an appalling indictment of all Members.  Somebody asked me this morning about the business of the House today and I almost felt ashamed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to raise certain matters in advance of the debate tomorrow but I join Senator Wright in thanking the Leader of the House for making time available for this urgent issue.  I am sure the Leader shares the <Col N="1071" /> concern and dismay of the public about the fact that this issue has resurfaced.  I thought this Government would have laid this matter to rest.  Many members of the public have already contacted me and expressed annoyance, confusion and alarm that this issue has reemerged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">

      <P>If a debate is held tomorrow, I hope it will cover the general policy of the Office of the Attorney General and the exercise of control, or lack of control, on the part of the Government in relation to it.  This is an important point.  I ask the Leader to confirm that the Taoiseach or the Minister for Justice will come to the House for the debate because there is no point holding a discussion in a vacuum. Fianna Fáil unjustifiably received a great deal of blame for this affair some months ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Honan's call for the introduction of mandatory reporting as soon as possible in cases of child sexual and physical abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to raise a matter which relates to the Finance Bill but, in view of the fact that we have so little control over it, I hope something can be done about it before next week.  During the debate on the Arterial Drainage Bill, the Irish Red Cross was continually praised for the flooding relief it provided.  Because <Col N="1072" /> of domestic commitments, the Irish Red Cross is in the invidious position; people will not be allowed claim tax relief on donations to this organisation and, therefore, overseas organisations will be in a more advantageous position.  Could the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Foreign Affairs see any way of rectifying this situation in the Finance Bill?  I gather there are mechanisms by which exemptions can be given.  If they are doing work for us on the ground, it seems most unfortunate that their overseas work would be penalised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the House to congratulate the people who made the drama series &ldquo;The Hanging Gale&rdquo; on the grounds that it has been acclaimed all over Europe as a very successful record of the Famine in Ireland. It focussed on my county and, particularly, on Lifford.  This is the first time in my career in the Seanad to send congratulations but I think it is worth the House's while to note that a very admirable drama series has been put together in way which has been accepted abroad. Lifford Jail has been replaced at a cost of £2 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Leader to tell every Member he is welcome to visit the restored building, which was seen in &ldquo;The Hanging Gale&rdquo;. This is a major work and I ask the House to compliment those involved in putting it together.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

      <P>I ask that the matter about disabled drivers which I requested to be raised on the Adjournment be considered tomorrow.  This may be the formal procedure in any event.</P>
      <P>I join with my colleagues in expressing our appreciation to the Leader for his response to the request for a special debate on the Attorney General's Office.  His response was very expeditious.  I raised this issue at our front bench meeting a half an hour before we broke for lunch.  I appreciate that the Leader has responded in the way he has.  I hope it will be possible to have a well informed and responsible debate.  I wanted to raise this matter because of the constitutional, not the personal, implications.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the publication of the harbours Bill.  Unfortunately, Deputy Coveney is no longer Minister for the Marine.  He is the man to whom I give most credit for publishing this Bill sooner than expected.  I regret very much what has happened and I thank him for his kindness to me during his term of office.  When this Bill will come before both Houses?  Will it be initiated in the Seanad?  Can it be taken before the summer recess?</P>
      <P>Last week we had statements on banking.  Does the Leader intend providing time for statements on building societies, the process of getting mortgages and the pressures on people looking for mortgages to take out exorbitant and excessive insurance policies?  We should have a discussion dealing exclusively with building societies and mortgages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>When will we have the debate on education and the difficulties relating to it which was promised last week?  The events of yesterday are now history.  Could we schedule this debate for an early date?  We discussed education and the industrial relations problems and related issues last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the crisis that has broken out yet again in the Attorney General's <Col N="1074" /> Office, is it likely we will see the administrative procedures Bill, which is promised in the Programme for Government, in the near future?  One of its critical parts is that all State agencies, including the Attorney General's Office, would be required to respond to any correspondence within a specified time.  At this stage, we would all accept that such a Bill, if it applied to the Attorney General's Office, would save us all a lot of trouble.  Will the Leader inquire of the relevant Minister whether it is possible to have that Bill taken here at an early stage?  This House would be the appropriate place to introduce and deal with it.  I probably will not be here at the time but I can make sure some friends are briefed.</P>

      <P>Senator Henry mentioned the extraordinary situation in which the Irish Red Cross Society finds itself because of the Finance Bill, 1995.  There will be some response from this side of the House when that Bill comes before the House next week.  It would be sensible if the Government looked at those provisions in advance because they put the Irish Red Cross Society in a most difficult situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, can the Leader clarify that the Taoiseach, or an appropriately senior Minister, a member of Cabinet, will be in attendance?  There was an extraordinary debate today in the Dáil; that seems to be the order of that House.  Can we ensure there is clarity about who knew what when?  It would <Col N="1075" /> help because there seems to be some confusion about that in the other House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Members in sending my good wishes for a speedy recovery to the Cathaoirleach.  On that point, the conditions in this House are quite unacceptable in a modern parliament. It is stifling here.  I am surprised there are not more people feeling unwell.  Perhaps the Leader could examine the possibility of having some minimal form of air conditioning installed over the summer recess.  It is mad to have this system pumping out heat at this time of the year.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that there will be statements tomorrow and I hope it is a definite promise.  I listened to the debate in the Dáil and I was interested in what I heard.  It seems we were getting from the Taoiseach redefinition of what being economical with the truth is. I was reminded of the medical phrase, one must not kill but need not strive officiously to keep alive.  It seems what was being said is that one must not lie but need not strive officiously to tell the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is can we have a clear undertaking that there will, in fact, be statements tomorrow?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I raise a couple of other issues? Item 14, motion No. 2, on the Order Paper is a motion on East Timor.  Is it possible to have a debate of this subject within the reasonably near future?  A senior Indonesian Minister visited this country yesterday and had discussions about trade agreements which were kept secret.  In the light of what we were talking about in terms of transparency, it seems odd because the Tánaiste last year spoke about urging the European Union to consider an economic boycott of the Indonesian dictatorship.  It would be useful to have a debate in the light of that fact and in the light of the fact <Col N="1076" /> that next week Members from all parties in this House will be going to a conference in Portugal on East Timor.</P>
    <P>I ask also that time be provided for the discussion of item 14, motion No. 17. My colleague, Senator Henry, and I attended the conference of European parliamentarians on HIV/AIDS in Barcelona last week and we were asked to table the report in all our domestic parliaments and to have it discussed as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>Motion No. 9 has been on the Order Paper since March.  The issues it intends to address are regularly reported in the national media and no more so than in recent days.  I join with Senator Honan and Senator Henry in calling for a debate on this matter.  Our motion requested the full implementation of the provisions of the Child Care Act, but in light of what has happened in recent days I do not think that would be sufficient.  I ask the Leader of the House to impress upon the Minister for Health the need for a full debate on this issue and for a full public inquiry into the child abuse case in the west.  It has been established that existing legislation does not allow for statutory reporting of abuse cases.  We seem to have a severe difficulty with this issue. The public are now expressing grave concern.  It would be very opportune for the Minister for Health to attend this House.  I ask the Leader to have him attend, as soon as possible, to debate this matter of grave public concern in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with Senator Henry and Senator Roche in relation to the Finance Bill, which comes before this House next week.  As Senator Henry pointed out, this will be a major problem for the Government with regard to the Red Cross and all other charitable organisations.  I received strong representations from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul about this issue. This is a matter of urgency.  I ask the Leader to take this into account when we are dealing with next week's legislation. <Col N="1077" /> When will the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht come to this House to discuss the Green Paper on communications and broadcasting?  It would be a good idea for him to hear the views of Senators.  I wish the Cathaoirleach a speedy recovery.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole expressed concern about the possible imposition of a tax on blank tapes and its effect on those who are visually impaired and people with other difficulties and disabilities. However, there is another side to the story.  A young person in Dundalk was manufacturing 120,000 blank tapes; this was decimating the live music business in Ireland and across the world.  I concur that the handicapped and the education aspect should be covered in such a way that they would be exempt from this tax. This has now become law in all EU member states; Ireland is one of the last states to implement it.  I would certainly concede to the wishes of Senator O'Toole with regard to the handicapped and education.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader take the opportunity to have a debate on the results of the Washington conference and the fruits of the labour of many people from Ireland who are there? Taking into account the statement made by Senator Roche regarding his anticipated absence from this House, perhaps the Leader would ask him about his holiday plans for 1995.</P>

      <P>Quite a number of issues have been raised.  With regard to Senator Wright's contribution, it is clearly the wish of the House to have statements tomorrow.  The only matter to be discussed is the timing.  I can assure Senator Mulcahy and Senator O'Kennedy that an appropriate member of Government will be present. Senator O'Toole raised the need for a debate on education.  That is open-ended. It is a question of finding an appropriate time-slot.  That debate is continuing, as indeed is a debate on banking which was raised by another Senator.</P>
      <P>When the debate on banking resumes, we might with the agreement of the House include areas like building societies and other credit institutions. The debate on the last day was unnecessarily restricted by ruling out these categories.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of the point raised by Senator O'Toole about tapes.  I will consider it but I agree with Senator Cassidy that it would be helpful to have a further debate on the music and entertainment industry.</P>
      <P>I feel a little guilty as regards Senator Honan because I have promised her a debate on health.  Both Senator Honan and Senator Finneran have consistently raised a number of issues in this regard. I will endeavour to have a full debate on the issues the Senator raised as soon as possible.  With so much legislation coming up in this House, it is a question of finding the time to do it, but I will do my best to arrange that.  I have already answered the question raised by Senator Mulcahy.  I accept the point raised by Senator Henry about the Irish Red Cross.  That, of course, will be eligible for discussion next week during the Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator McGowan about &ldquo;The Hanging Gale&rdquo;.  It is a useful piece of anti-revisionist history writing.  It is a first class production.  Of course, a welcome from County Donegal will always be accepted.  Senator O'Kennedy asked for a full debate on the Office of the Attorney General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1079" /> Senator Fitzgerald mentioned the Harbours Bill, 1995.  It was in part due to the Senator's urging in this House that greater urgency was given to the production of this Bill.  It was promised to him by the former Minister for Defence and the Marine, Deputy Coveney.  I join with Senator O'Toole and Senator Fitzgerald in saying that as Minister for Defence and the Marine, Deputy Coveney was an example of how a Minister should behave.  Deputy Coveney was courteous, sincere in everything he said and lived up to the promise he gave to Senator Fitzgerald to produce the Harbours Bill, 1995.  I will make every effort to see that it is processed before the summer recess.</P>
    <P>Senator Roche referred to education and that debate will continue.  The Senator also mentioned the likely outcome of the Wicklow by-election.  Of course, all of us in this House wish the Senator well, maybe for different reasons.  However, I remind the Senator of the old catechism; he is old enough to remember it.  There was a definition of the sin called presumption.  It was defined as a foolish expectation of salvation without taking the means necessary to attain it.  We wish the Senator well in the by-election, but remember the old catechism.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris referred to air conditioning and I agree with him.  The air was hot today even before we started talking, but I will see if anything can be done.  There is a foreign affairs debate in progress.  If we reschedule that, it would allow Senator Norris to raise the issues on East Timor.  I agree the conference the Senator will attend next week is important and both he and Senator Henry may be able to report on it back to the House.  On the point raised by Senator Magner it should be appropriate and possible within our structures to get a report back from the Washington conference from Members there.</P>
    <P>I told Senator Lydon a week or two ago that the Department of Health expects the White Paper on mental health to be published shortly.</P>

      <P>The Stock Exchange Bill is the first major legislation relating to the Stock Exchange in almost 200 years.  It establishes the Central Bank as the regulatory authority for the Irish Stock Exchange, for any stock exchanges that may be established here in the future and also for the member firms of exchanges regulated under this Bill.  The Bill also meets obligations under the European Union Investment Services and Capital Adequacy Directives in respect of stock exchange member firms.  It does not deal with futures and options exchanges such as IFOX and FINEX.  These are already regulated by the Central Bank under the Central Bank Act, 1989.  It does not deal either with what I might describe as the companies side of the Stock Exchange, by which I mean matters like listing of companies and insider dealing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The existing basic legislation for the Stock Exchange, the Stock Exchange (Dublin) Act, was enacted by the old Irish Parliament in 1799 and this is being repealed.  That Act set up the Dublin Stock Exchange and established a system of regulation based on the stockbroker's licence.  It also provided that the Exchange's gilt rules had to be approved by the Lords of His Majesty's Treasury, a role which was later taken over by the Lord Lieutenant and finally, and up to the present day, by the Minister for Finance.  The present Bill replaces this somewhat rudimentary system of supervision with one that is entirely new, modelled on the existing legislation for regulating financial institutions and meeting international requirements for the regulation and supervision of stock exchanges and their member firms.  The Central Bank as the <Col N="1081" /> supervisory authority would have substantial powers concerning both the initial authorisation of stock exchanges and member firms and their ongoing supervision.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that this Bill replaces the Stock Exchange (Dublin) Act, 1799. The Act was passed in the year between two landmark events in Irish history, the Rebellion of 1798 and the Act of Union of 1800.  The House may find it instructive to look back at the other legislation that was passed in 1799.  There were several Acts dealing with the aftermath of the 1798 Rebellion, for example, the &ldquo;Act for the suppression of the rebellion which still unhappily exists within this Kingdom, and for the protection of the persons and properties of His Majesty's faithful subjects within the same&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Act to better regulate the manufacture and sale of gunpowder within this Kingdom&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I note that there was an Act to impose &ldquo;certain rates and duties on dwelling houses inhabited, according to the number of Windows or Lights therein respectively&rdquo;.  Another piece of legislation from 1799 but which would be less likely to win favour with the Revenue Commissioners was the &ldquo;Act for the Relief of Persons who have omitted, or may omit inadvertently, to pay certain Stamp Duties&rdquo;.  Roads were also of concern in Ireland in 1799.  There was an &ldquo;Act for improving and repairing the road leading from Newcastle, in the County of Limerick, to the City of Limerick, and from thence to Charleville, in the County of Cork&rdquo;.  Senators should be aware, however, that this legislation also provided for &ldquo;erecting turnpikes thereon&rdquo; for the collection of tolls.</P>
    <P>The wars in Europe which followed the French Revolution and the threat of an invasion of this country from France obliged the Government to borrow heavily and one presumes that this put a lot of business in the way of stockbrokers at the time.  Indeed Governments down through the years have continued to keep the stockbrokers busy. The newly established Dublin Stock <Col N="1082" /> Exchange began to operate in September 1799 and moved to the Commercial Buildings in Dame Street in November 1799, a building which is now owned by the Central Bank.  Later of course the Stock Exchange moved to Angelsea Street where it has operated for over 100 years.</P>
    <P>The Stock Exchange has served an important economic role down through the years, generating capital for industry and helping to meet the funding requirements of Governments.  However, the passage of time and the enormous changes which have occurred since 1799, especially in the area of the financial markets, mean that an entirely new regulatory environment is now necessary for the Stock Exchange and its member firms.  The scale and complexity of events in 1799 bear absolutely no comparison to those of 1995.  For example, when the Act of Union came into effect in 1801, the funded public debt of Ireland stood at just less than £27 million; the national debt in Ireland is now moving towards £29 billion, an increase of over a thousand-fold.</P>
    <P>Things have changed in other ways. Deregulation, the removal of exchange controls and rapid technological advance have had a dramatic impact on the financial sector.  Financial supervision standards are being intensified. Within the European Union a new single market for financial services is being established.  In these circumstances the need for new legislation to replace an Act nearly 200 years old is abundantly clear.</P>
    <P>The new legislation also reflects the passage of two European Union directives. The Investment Services Directive, which must be provided for in national legislation by 1 July 1995 and will apply fully from 1 January 1996, requires member states to ensure a common standard of regulation for investment firms so as to allow such firms, once authorised by their home state, to trade freely in all the countries of the European Union.  The related Capital Adequacy Directive sets out the levels of capital which investment firms must <Col N="1083" /> have in relation to their business.  The Stock Exchange Bill will implement these two directives in respect of stock exchange member firms; further legislation, the Investment Intermediaries Bill, will be published shortly and this will implement the directives in respect of all intermediaries which are not member firms of an approved stock exchange.</P>
    <P>The Investment Services Directive is based on EU-wide recognition of authorisations granted by the home member state and on the principle of prudential surveillance by the competent authorities in the home member state in accordance with that member state's rules.  The directive incorporates parallel measures to those contained in the first and second banking directives, namely, conditions for granting authorisation to investment firms, vetting of main shareholders and provision for close collaboration among the supervisory authorities in the member states.</P>
    <P>Irish law needs to be updated in order to meet the requirements of the Investment Services Directive.  At present, the Irish Stock Exchange is supervised as part of the International Stock Exchange of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland Limited.  This supervision is carried out under the rules of that exchange and also under local rules which apply to the Irish unit only and are agreed by the Minister for Finance.  While the Minister for Finance approves rule changes proposed by the Irish Stock Exchange, he has no right himself to initiate rule changes which he might consider desirable.  Otherwise the main requirement of the Stock Exchange (Dublin) Act, 1799, is that individuals selling gilts on commission have a licence to do so.  It is clear that these legislative arrangements need substantial revision in order to conform with the EU Investment Services Directive. The Stock Exchange Bill provides that revision.  I should mention that the Bill has been the subject of consultation with the European Monetary Institute which has indicated no difficulties with <Col N="1084" /> its terms.  Copies of the institute's opinion are available.</P>
    <P>Let me now turn to some major points I want to make about the Bill. The first is that the Central Bank should be the new regulatory authority for the Irish Stock Exchange and for its member firms.  This decision is both logical and practical.  The bank already has considerable expertise in regulation.  It is the regulatory authority for all Irish licensed banking institutions and its remit has been extended to the building societies in recent years.  In addition, the Central Bank Act, 1989, gave the bank supervisory responsibility in relation to exchanges concerned with the selling of futures and options, such as the IFOX and now the FINEX exchanges.  The bank also plays an important role in the regulation of financial service activities conducted from the highly successful International Financial Services Centre.</P>
    <P>The present Bill, therefore, builds on a significant body of national law relating to the regulation of financial institutions and exchanges.  The bank has the expertise, the competence and the track record to supervise stock exchanges and their member firms.  The personnel of the bank have been actively preparing for their new role and have made a substantial contribution to the preparation of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The second point I want to highlight is that, because this area is of major interest to the public, the Bill provides a significant role for the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  Clearly, it is appropriate that, where necessary, the Ministers who have responsibility in this area should be able to set parameters within which the bank would operate.  The Minister for Finance has a very direct involvement in relation to the financial services sector; the Minister for Enterprise and Employment has responsibility for company law issues and has, of course, a particular interest in the access of Irish firms to capital. Accordingly, section 28 of the Bill provides that the Central Bank may be given guidelines by the Minister for Finance <Col N="1085" /> with the consent of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, to assist the bank in administering the system of regulation.  Such guidelines will, of course, only be issued where there is a perceived need to issue them in the public interest.  Other sections also provide a role for the two Ministers and I will refer to these when I am discussing the details of the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is important to stress, however, that apart from some relatively minor modifications, there will be no change in the existing responsibilities of my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, in relation to company law matters, corporate governance or in listing matters delegated to the Irish Stock Exchange.</P>
    <P>A fundamental objective of the Bill is to provide the necessary measures without being excessive.  It is designed to ensure that the Irish Stock Exchange will be regulated to the highest standards, but it must also be able to function efficiently in an increasingly complex environment.  Accordingly, the Bill does not supersede the highly developed supervision systems which the Exchange already operates to ensure market surveillance.  However, it gives the Central Bank all the necessary powers to monitor and supervise the Exchange's surveillance of the operations of its member firms and to lay down conditions and requirements which the Exchange and its member firms must meet.</P>
    <P>Connected with this is the requirement that stock exchanges must be more open to the concerns of users and the public than has been the case up to now.  Accordingly, the Bill provides that the board of directors of an exchange will have to be broadly based and that the composition of the board will have to strike a balance between the interests of the member firms and users of the exchange and the public interest.  Also, there will have to be enough independent members on the board to promote the protection of investors and the maintenance of proper standards.  In addition, the chairperson of the board <Col N="1086" /> of the Exchange will have to be independent of the Stock Exchange and of its member firms.  Finally, the board or a sub-committee of the board must be able to consider disciplinary matters and complaints against member firms and any such sub-committee must include at least one independent board member.</P>
    <P>The Bill sets out requirements about the composition of the board of an exchange for a number of reasons.  As I pointed out earlier, the role of the Irish Stock Exchange has changed dramatically since the original legislation setting it up was passed in 1799. The Exchange then was primarily a gathering of stockbrokers.  Nowadays, however, the Exchange is far more.  It acts as a regulatory authority for the companies for which it provides quotations and it is a competent authority for the purposes of the EU Insider Dealing and Listing Directives.  It is also a marketplace which brings together not only the broker and the investor, but also the companies which are quoted on the Exchange.  All of these different interests have a legitimate interest in the Exchange and it is proper that they should all be represented on the board of the Exchange, as the Bill provides.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that it will be a matter for the Exchange itself to nominate these independent members and the independent chairperson, subject to satisfying the Central Bank as to their competence and probity.  Given that the Exchange is a very small body, consisting of only ten member firms, and that it has a key role in the economy, it is also proper that its board should have a significant independent element and this is represented by the requirements that the board have independent members, that it be chaired by an independent chairperson and that there be an independent presence at board level hearings on disciplinary matters.  These requirements will help to enhance confidence in the Exchange among investors and potential investors and among the public at large and of course confidence will be a crucial factor when the Exchange effectively <Col N="1087" /> relaunches itself after its forthcoming separation from London.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to comment on each section, but rather to highlight for Members the main features of each Part of the Bill.  It is divided into seven Parts. The first deals with general matters, while Parts II and III deal respectively with the approval of stock exchanges and with the authorisation of member firms.  These two Parts naturally contain many similar provisions.  Part IV contains detailed regulatory provisions governing stock exchanges and member firms.  Part V concerns the duties of auditors, while Part VI deals mainly with large transactions in holdings of stock exchanges and member firms, with codes of conduct and with requirements relating to client moneys.  Part VII covers enforcement, offences and penalties.</P>
    <P>Part I contains standard general provisions about such matters as short title, commencement, repeals and expenses. In particular, section 2 empowers the Minister for Finance to appoint a day or days for the coming into effect of the Act or portions of it.  As the Members of the House will be aware, the Irish Stock Exchange will be separating from the International Stock Exchange of Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland Limited, of which it has been a part for just over twenty years, once the Bill comes into effect.  I expect that the Bill will be brought into effect on 1 July next.</P>
    <P>Section 3 sets out the definitions used in the Bill.  The terms used for stockbrokers is &ldquo;member firm&rdquo; and section 3(4) ensures the term can include a partnership. The definition of &ldquo;investment instruments&rdquo; goes well beyond the range of instruments normally traded on the Stock Exchange because the legislation is intended to cover all the investment activities of stockbrokers, who may well deal in unit trusts and other forms of investment.  The term &ldquo;investment instruments&rdquo; is therefore defined widely.  The definition of a stock exchange excludes futures and options <Col N="1088" /> exchanges which are regulated under the Central Bank Act, 1989.</P>
    <P>Part II deals with the approval and continuing supervision of stock exchanges.  Section 8 makes it an offence to establish or operate a stock exchange which has not been approved by the Central Bank.  Section 9 sets out the detailed requirements relating to approval.  These include satisfying the bank that the memorandum and articles of association and the rules of the proposed exchange are satisfactory and that the directors, managers and qualifying shareholders are suitable persons.</P>
    <P>There are a number of aspects of the approval of an exchange.  An exchange will be obliged to establish and maintain procedures to investigate complaints against both itself and its member firms. In addition the board of an exchange will have to be broadly based and be composed to secure a balance between the interests of the different member firms and users of the stock exchange and the public interest.  It will be a matter for the Central Bank to satisfy itself that the board of the exchange has the required balance between members and non-members.  The Bill also requires, for the reasons I set out earlier, that the chairperson of the exchange be independent of the exchange and its member firms.</P>
    <P>Also, the rules of a stock exchange must require a report to be drawn up on any disciplinary proceedings conducted by the exchange.  That report must be sent to the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment if the Minister for Finance, with the consent of his colleague, asks to see it.  The Minister for Finance will be entitled to lay such a report before both Houses of the Oireachtas if he and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment think it proper to do so having due regard to the exigencies of the common good and the rights of any person referred to in the report.</P>
    <P>I believe I will find the members of this House in agreement with me on the need for greater transparency in the way stock exchanges are run and in their disciplinary <Col N="1089" /> proceedings.  The provisions in the Bill will ensure that transparency, while allowing the exchange to continue to regulate its affairs on a day to day basis under the overall supervision of the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides that the Irish Stock Exchange will be deemed to be approved and will continue to operate, under the supervision of the Central Bank, during the interim period while it is seeking approval from the bank under this Bill.  Any changes to the memorandum and articles of association of an exchange or to its rules will have to be approved by the Central Bank and the bank will be able to require such changes.</P>
    <P>Where the bank refuses to approve a stock exchange or to approve changes to its rules or memorandum and articles of association, the exchange will be entitled to appeal that decision to the Minister for Finance who, with the consent of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, may grant the appeal. Where the Minister grants the appeal, notice of the fact must be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i></P>
    <P>The Central Bank may make its approval of exchanges subject to conditions either at the time of approval or afterwards.  Such conditions must not contravene guidelines which may be issued by the Minister for Finance with the agreement of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and which must be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  The exchange concerned will have the right to appeal a requirement or condition to the High Court.</P>
    <P>Section 14 sets out the circumstances in which the bank may revoke the approval of a stock exchange.  This will normally involve an application to the High Court for an order revoking approval.  Section 15 obliges an approved stock exchange to maintain such books and records for such length of time as the bank may specify. Failure to comply with this obligation will be an offence.</P>
    <P>Part III opens with section 16, which makes the Central Bank the competent <Col N="1090" /> authority in this State in respect of member firms for the purposes of the Investment Services and Capital Adequacy Directives.  The bank will thus be responsible for supervising all the investment activities of member firms, not just their stock exchange activities.</P>
    <P>The rest of Part III deals with the authorisation and regulation of member firms.  Section 17 makes it an offence to be a member firm of an approved stock exchange, unless authorised by the Central Bank or by a competent authority in another member state.  Firms wishing to become authorised must apply to the Bank.</P>
    <P>Any changes to the memorandum and articles of association of a member firm will have to be approved by the Central Bank and the bank itself will be able to require such changes.  Where the bank refuses to authorise a member firm, or to approve a change a member firm wishes to make to its memorandum or articles of association, the member firm can appeal the bank's decision to the High Court.</P>
    <P>Section 21 provides that the existing member firms of the Irish Stock Exchange will be able to continue to operate but they will, of course, have to apply for authorisation to the Central Bank; they will stand approved, and be subject to Central Bank regulation, while the authorisation process is going on.  Like stock exchange approval, this process will include satisfying the bank as to the probity and competence of each of the managers and directors and the suitability of the larger shareholders.</P>
    <P>In addition, in the light of the proposed introduction of market making in Irish Government gilts later this year by the National Treasury Management Agency, section 21 allows market making firms from abroad to do business here under the supervision of the Central Bank up to the end of the year, by which date they will be authorised by their home competent authority under the EU Investment Services Directive.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1091" /> Section 22 enables the bank to make its authorisation of a member firm subject to conditions, either at the time of approval or afterwards.  Such conditions must not contravene guidelines issued by the Minister for Finance, with the agreement of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, and published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  A member firm will have the right to appeal to the court against the imposition of any condition.</P>
    <P>Section 24 sets out the circumstances in which the authorisation of a member firm can be revoked; as with exchanges, this will normally involve an application to the court for an order revoking the authorisation.</P>
    <P>Other provisions of Part III empower the bank to set out requirements as to the composition of a member firm's assets and liabilities so as to ensure the firm can meet its liabilities and to require an authorised member firm wishing to establish a branch in another EU member state to give details of the proposed branch to the bank.  The bank may permit or prevent establishment of the branch; if the latter, the member firm concerned may appeal the bank's decision to the High Court.  Finally, in Part III, section 27 obliges a member firm to keep books and records; failure to do so will be an offence.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill deals with regulation and supervision.  Section 28 imposes a general obligation on the bank to administer the system of regulation of approved stock exchanges and authorised member firms in accordance with the Act in order to promote the proper and orderly regulation of such exchanges and member firms and the protection of investors.  As I mentioned earlier, the bank must carry out this function subject to any guidelines which may be issued to it by the Minister for Finance with the consent of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.</P>
    <P>Section 29 empowers the bank to give directions to stock exchanges and member firms, both generally in the interests of proper regulation or investor protection and more specifically where it <Col N="1092" /> becomes apparent that a member firm is getting into difficulties.  The bank will be entitled to apply to the High Court for an order confirming a direction where it believes that the direction is not being complied with.  Detailed provisions relating to directions are included in the First Schedule to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Sections 31 and 32 relate to advertising by stock exchanges and member firms and give the Central Bank power to impose conditions and requirements relating to advertisements.  An investment agreement will be unenforceable if it is made on foot of an advertisement which contravenes a direction from the bank, unless the advertisement did not have a bearing on the agreement.  Both the bank and the Minister for Finance may require a stock exchange or member firm to display specified information on their premises.</P>
    <P>Part V places significant obligations on the auditors of stock exchanges and member firms.  Auditors are well placed to assess what is going on in a firm and the Bill requires auditors to inform the bank of any material irregularity which emerges in the course of their auditing work, including anything which would give reason to believe that a member firm has breached stock exchange rules or that it has contravened any condition or requirement imposed by the bank. An auditor who intends to resign or not to seek re-election must report that fact to the Central Bank.  It will be an offence to mislead, deceive or refuse to co-operate with an auditor.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill opens with a provision which also deals with auditors. Section 36 enables the Central Bank to appoint a second auditor where it has a substantial concern about the audited accounts of an approved stock exchange or member firm.  This will allow the Central Bank to carry out further investigation of matters which arise in the course of the first audit.</P>
    <P>Section 37 contains provisions relating to disqualification from employment. Where, on application by the Central Bank, the High Court finds that <Col N="1093" /> a person is not suitable on grounds of probity to be an officer or employee of a stock exchange or member firm, it may direct the employer to dismiss that person. Where the court finds that a person is incompetent, it may direct that the person concerned be removed from a particular position, be suspended or dismissed. A person who is the subject of such a direction may not be employed by a stock exchange or member firm, or by any other entity supervised by the Central Bank, without the bank's consent. A person who accepts employment in contravention of such a direction will be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>Obviously, these are considerable powers but it is important to ensure that persons who are entrusted with the safekeeping and prudent management of the funds of others are above reproach. Senators will note that a direction in respect of any such person will be for the courts to decide and that the person concerned may apply to the courts at any time for the direction to be revoked and may appeal to the court against any refusal by the Central Bank to consent to their re-employment.</P>
    <P>Section 38 sets out the broad parameters for the codes of conduct which will govern how member firms do business with their clients.  This will normally be a matter for the rules of the exchange, but the Central Bank may draw up a code of conduct if an exchange does not draw up and maintain its own rules of conduct.  Stock exchange rules of conduct must meet the parameters laid down in the section as regards fair and honest dealing, acting with due care and diligence and making adequate disclosure of relevant information to clients.  The Central Bank will be responsible for supervising compliance with rules of conduct by member firms operating here which have been authorised in another member state.</P>
    <P>Sections 39 to 49 deal with acquiring transactions, that is to say, major changes in the ownership or control of exchanges and their member firms.  The purpose of these provisions is to enable <Col N="1094" /> the Central Bank to prevent undue or excessive influence being gained over a stock exchange or member firm unless the bank is satisfied that that influence will not be harmful.</P>
    <P>Section 51 provides that a member firm must inform a client of the details of any investor compensation scheme. The Irish Stock Exchange already operates a compensation scheme but I am not making specific provision in this Bill for compensation.  A draft Investor Compensation Directive is being finalised at present at EU level and legislation will be required to implement the requirements of that directive in due course.</P>
    <P>Section 52 deals with the treatment of client funds and investment instruments by member firms.  This is obviously a very important section of the Bill.  The section will allow the Central Bank to ensure that money and investment instruments belonging to clients which are held or controlled by a member firm are properly accounted for and that both the money and instruments and the records relating to them can be easily located and identified at all times while in the member firm's custody.  The section allows the Central Bank to set out requirements under which member firms may hold money or investment instruments belonging to clients.  For example, the Central Bank will be able to regulate how member firms operate client accounts, in particular whether the firm can lodge money other than client account money into such accounts.  This provision will allow the Central Bank to ensure that client money is segregated from that of the member firm.  In addition to enabling the bank to set out such requirements, the section specifically provides, on pain of an offence, that client accounts must be designated &ldquo;Section 52&rdquo; accounts in the member firm's records &mdash; this will allow the Central Bank's authorised officers to identify such accounts easily. It will also be an offence for a member firm not to keep client money with an institution which has been approved of by the Central Bank and not to keep <Col N="1095" /> books and records in respect of client money and investment instruments and to have them audited.  The section also includes a provision to ensure that, in the event that a member firm is liquidated or dissolved, money or investment instruments belonging to clients will not be available to pay the member firm's debts.</P>
    <P>Section 53 provides for exemptions from liability for the Central Bank and for the Stock Exchange.</P>
    <P>Section 54, the last section of Part VI, relates to failed stock exchanges and member firms which did not comply with the obligations in the Bill to maintain proper books and records and to safeguard clients' funds.  Where the High Court considers that such noncompliance contributed to the failure, it may declare an officer of the stock exchange or member firm personally liable for all or part of the failed entity's debts.  Similar provisions exist in company law and in the Building Societies Act, 1989.</P>
    <P>Part VII of the Bill sets out the powers of authorised officers of the Central Bank, of bank-appointed inspectors and of inspectors appointed by the High Court.  Authorised officers of the Central Bank will be empowered to enter premises to inspect documents and require explanations of such documents. If a person refuses to comply with a request from an authorised officer, the court can be asked to make an order as to the information to be provided.  Similar provisions are included in the Insurance Act, 1989, in relation to officers authorised by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment; an authorised officer under this Bill will in addition be entitled to request a report on aspects of the business of an exchange or of an exchange's member firm.</P>
    <P>Sections 57 to 63 provide for the High Court, on the application of the Central Bank, to appoint an inspector to investigate the affairs of a stock exchange or a member firm.  An inspector appointed by the court will have wideranging powers <Col N="1096" /> of investigation, including, for example, the power to examine people on oath.  The High Court may publish, with or without omissions, the report of an inspector appointed by it.  A court inspector's report will be sent in full to the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, who may decide to lay it before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 64 provides for the appointment of an inspector by the Central Bank to investigate particular matters relating to an exchange or member firm, including their compliance with any requirements of this or any other Act or with stock exchange rules or codes of conduct.  The Central Bank may publish, in whole or in part, the report of an inspector appointed by it and must forward any such report in full to the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, who again may decide to lay it before the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 65 enables the Central Bank to set up a committee to determine whether there has been a breach by a stock exchange or member firm of Central Bank conditions or requirements. Such a committee will have three members drawn from a panel of seven to be nominated by the Minister for Finance with the consent of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  If it finds that there has been a breach, the committee may issue a reprimand and/or require payment of up to £500,000 by the exchange or member firm concerned to the Central Bank.  It should be noted that this mechanism will only apply where the exchange or member firm agrees and an exchange or member firm may appeal the determination of a committee to the court.</P>
    <P>Where an exchange or member firm does not want the matter settled by a committee, the Central Bank may apply to the High Court to make a determination and the court may issue a reprimand and/or require payment of up to £500,000 to the Central Bank by the exchange or member firm concerned. Detailed provisions relating to the committees <Col N="1097" /> appointed under section 65 are contained in the Second Schedule.  Such committees offer a mechanism whereby breaches of Central Bank conditions and requirements can be speedily determined without the expense &mdash; on either side &mdash; of a High Court hearing.</P>
    <P>Sections 66 and 67 provide for an application for a search and seizure warrant by an authorised officer and for the admissibility of an inspector's report as evidence in civil proceedings, while sections 68 and 69 provide for legal professional privilege and for confidentiality of documents.  Section 70 sets out the penalties for offences committed under the Act.  The maximum penalty will be £1 million or ten years' imprisonment or both.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should mention that the Irish Stock Exchange has, of course, been extensively consulted in the preparation of this Bill.  I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the constructive contribution made by the Stock Exchange throughout this process.</P>
    <P>The Stock Exchange Bill marks a radical departure for the regulation of stock exchanges and their member firms in Ireland.  It replaces 200 years old legislation with a modern regulatory framework. It establishes the Central Bank as the regulatory authority, so bringing to bear the bank's wide experience of regulating banks, building societies and futures and options exchanges.</P>
    <P>It provides a significant role for the two Ministers closely involved with the Stock Exchange, so ensuring that the concerns of the Oireachtas can find expression in the regulatory process as the public interest requires.  It enables the Stock Exchange to continue to regulate its own affairs, but under the overall supervision of the Central Bank which will be equipped with all the necessary powers to carry out its functions.</P>
    <P>The Bill also meets obligations in respect of Stock Exchange member firms arising from the European Union Investment Services and Capital Adequacy Directives.  It also ensures that the Stock Exchange will be more <Col N="1098" /> open and transparent in the conduct of its business than has been the case up to now and that its board of directors will be representative of the users of the exchange and the public interest as well as of its members.  I commend the Bill to the House and I look forward to hearing the contributions of Members.</P>

      <P>I wish the Minister well in his new position.  The enactment of the Bill will mark the end of a system established by the Stock Exchange (Dublin) Act, 1799, under which the Irish Stock Exchange was set up and regulated by Grattan's Parliament.  One must question why it has taken politicians so long to change legislation which is almost 200 years old and is completely out of synch with modern technological developments in the Stock Exchange and elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, to the House and I wish him well in his new portfolio.  I felt extremely sorry for him when he had to resign as Minister for Defence and the Marine; he should not have had to do so.  If we put our hands on our hearts, we would acknowledge that we have often asked that companies be put on tender lists.  I do not think there is anything wrong with this and I regret very much that a man, who in a short period established himself among the fishermen of this country as one of the most <Col N="1099" /> effective Ministers for the Marine ever, had to resign for that reason.  It is a sad day for politics.  We all want accountability, but we also want common sense. I regret the resignation of Deputy Coveney.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has taken up a new and important role and we wish him well.</P>
      <P>Under the Bill, a modern system of regulation, more suitable to our needs will replace ancient legislation.  It is in line with modern international practice and the requirements of EU law.  Perhaps the most notable and significant change is the forthcoming separation of the Stock Exchange from the International Stock Exchange of Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland, of which it has been a part for just over 200 years.  There have been examples in recent years when we had to look to London for decisions on difficulties which arose and it is time that link was broken.  This separation will take place when the Bill is enacted, which is expected to be at the beginning of July.</P>
      <P>The Bill establishes the Central Bank as the regulator of stock exchanges and their member firms.  For this purpose it sets up a detailed regulatory apparatus which will be effective and flexible.  It will allow the Central Bank and the Stock Exchange to establish a good working relationship.  This in turn will allow the Stock Exchange to develop its full potential within an effective regulatory framework, which will strengthen its position with investors and companies which look to it for funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot over emphasise the importance of this new regulatory authority.  It is required to strengthen the Stock Exchange and make it more relevant to Irish business.  While it plays a key role, the Exchange has not been a major factor in the economy because it reflects international trends.  Having studied daily Stock Exchange movements, I <Col N="1100" /> often wondered why the movements of Irish companies do not reflect what is happening within those companies. There will be a need for the Central Bank and the Stock Exchange to become far more proactive in ensuring that Irish companies and the economy is more effectively reflected on the Exchange.</P>
    <P>The Stock Exchange only reflects international trends.  Major impacts, such as that in the food sector recently, are stridently reflected, but if one looks each week at the trends of Irish companies on the Exchange, one would conclude that many small investors cannot have much confidence in it as an accurate reflection of the performance of companies.  I cannot understand why there are banner headlines regarding the great results of companies, but these are not reflected in the movement of those companies' stock on the Exchange.</P>
    <P>The most recent example was Ryan hotels.  The company's results were announced and there were banner headlines about its best performance ever. There were great expectations regarding the projections for this year, given the peace process and the tourism potential.  All the indications were positive; the company's profits had increased and it was doing well.  Yet, when one looked at the Stock Exchange table, there was no increase in the value of Ryan hotel stock.  The Stock Exchange must address this type of practical situation.</P>
    <P>It has too often been the case that figures move a number of days before results are announced.  This is incorrect and does not give small shareholders, who are perhaps the most important people involved in the Stock Exchange, a fair chance.  The regulatory powers which will be conferred on the Central Bank must be effectively implemented. One of the drawbacks to the Stock Exchange is that it is a small organisation, made up of only ten firms.  It will relaunch itself, but it is a small club.  It is essential that it is viewed as a fair and accurate reflection of companies' performances <Col N="1101" /> throughout the economy. Although I am not suggesting this is not the case at present one must question why more companies are not going public and being quoted on the Stock Exchange.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the sections which will provide the Central Bank with strong regulatory powers, I question the bank's ability to effectively implement those powers.  Many of the sections are providing it with strong powers but in some of the more simple and practical areas, I wonder how the bank's powers can be implemented more effectively. Section 29 empowers it to give directions to stock exchanges and member firms, in the interests of proper regulation or investor protection, and, more specifically, where it becomes apparent that a member firm is getting into difficulty. I would like the Minister to spell out what are the practical methods by which the Central Bank will give those directions to stock exchanges and member firms.</P>
    <P>Section 52 is vitally important.  It deals with the effective care and control of clients' money.  It deals with the treatment of clients' funds and investment instruments by member firms.  This section is vital to ensure money and investment instruments belonging to clients, which are held or controlled by a member firm, are properly accounted for by that firm.</P>
    <P>I commend Part V because it establishes a practical way of policing many aspects of the Bill.  The appointment of inspectors by the Central Bank or the High Court is a very effective way of policing several aspects of the Bill which deal with the straightforward regulatory approach.</P>
    <P>Section 64 is good in that it provides for the appointment of inspectors to investigate matters relating to exchanges or member firms, including their compliance with any requirement with this or any other Act or with stock exchange rules or codes of conduct.</P>
    <P>The issue of transparency is dealt with in the Bill.  We all welcome the initiatives in the Bill to ensure greater transparency <Col N="1102" /> in the way stock exchanges are run and in their disciplinary proceedings. The Bill will ensure transparency while allowing the Stock Exchange to continue to regulate its affairs on a day-to-day basis under the overall supervision of the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>I join with the Minister in welcoming and commending the Bill.  The only reservation I have is that we need to ensure there is an effective method for the practical implementation of its powers. There is, perhaps, a need for the Stock Exchange to look at its ability to become much more relevant to the Irish economy.  It is very good in reflecting international trends but I am not happy that it reflects national trends and the performance of individual companies as well as it might.  I accept this would be extremely difficult because to do so depends on the demands of the market place.  I feel that, for many small investors and the Irish economy, the Stock Exchange is not as relevant as it might be.  It should be far more progressive in getting more firms to be quoted on it and to become public; it should be far more aggressive in getting a higher level of investment flowing through it.  These are the worries I have.  I know this Bill cannot attempt to deal with those problems but it is time people in the Stock Exchange addressed some of those issues so that it can become more important and relevant and of more value to the development of the economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That could be a bit down the road.  Like Senator Fahey I welcome the Bill which has been introduced not before time.  It is more than 200 years since the last legislation dealing with the Stock Exchange was introduced.  That Act is in need of reform and I welcome the Government's decision to introduce this legislation to modernise it.</P>
      <P>This Bill aims to promote confidence among people investing in Irish companies. The Central Bank will be given a role in monitoring and supervising the operation of the Stock Exchange and any future stock exchanges.  It will be given power, not only to approve rules and powers &mdash; a power held already by the Minister for Finance &mdash; but to initiate changes in the rules of the Stock Exchange.  Reports of disciplinary proceedings by the Stock Exchange will be passed on to the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and can be published if they deem it appropriate.</P>
      <P>The world of the Stock Exchange will be more broadly based with representations on it by exchange members, users of the exchange and sufficient independent members to promote the public interest and the protection of investors.  The Central Bank will be the regulatory authority of the Irish Stock Exchange and for any future stock exchanges which may be established. The Bill also meets obligations under EU Investment Services and Capital Adequacy Directives in respect of stock exchange and member firms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It amazes me that it has taken until 1995 to set up an independent stock exchange.  I know there are historic reasons for the present arrangement.  In the 1970s the London Stock Exchange <Col N="1104" /> was changed to make it the main stock exchange in a federation of exchanges. It is important in an independent State, with an independent currency, to have a stock exchange of our own and I am glad that EU directives have ensured this will happen.</P>
    <P>The objectives of the Bill should be to ensure that the new structures and stock exchange must facilitate the maximum development of the Irish Stock Exchange as a vehicle to provide capital to indigenous industry.  The best means of doing this is to ensure we have the highest and most transparent standards of stockbroking activity which will give the maximum level of information and protection to ordinary investors.</P>
    <P>I am delighted this legislation will soon be in force.  Its main thrust is to give the Central Bank the role of regulator. This follows the allocation of a series of new powers and responsibilities to the Central Bank.  Initially it was only responsible for banking and the capital adequacy ratios of banks.  In 1989 this power was extended and the Central Bank was given full remit and responsibility for building societies.  This was followed by the Central Bank Act, which greatly widened its powers and we now have this legislation coming on stream.  The Central Bank will be able to impose conditions and regulations on the Stock Exchange and its member firms.  This is a welcome step.</P>
    <P>It will be able to appoint inspectors to investigate breaches of conditions and regulations by the Stock Exchange and its member firms and those breaches of the Stock Exchange rules to ensure the Central Bank can carry out its duties and the stock exchange operates within defined parameters.</P>
    <P>The Bill outlines a comprehensive procedure in the event of any institution breaking the law.  All breaches of the Stock Exchange rules will be investigated by the Exchange in the first instance and the report of the outcome of investigations will be made to the Central Bank.  The Minister for Enterprise and Employment and the Minister for Finance will be able to <Col N="1105" /> obtain and publish the reports.  I hope these reports will be placed before the Houses of the Oireachtas so that Members can debate and discuss them. It is rare that we get such an opportunity. Hence, the lack of interest in this type of Bill.  As I understand it, there are two essential purposes for a stock exchange: to raise funds for industry and to provide a method of matching buyers and sellers to their mutual advantage.  In many cases the general public's view of the Stock Exchange is that of a huge moneylending or gambling facility where people make or lose millions of pounds.  It is quite the opposite.  The Stock Exchange plays an important role in the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>I welcome a number of inclusions in the Bill.  It lays down a clear code of conduct under which the Stock Exchange must operate.  The board of the Stock Exchange must represent a balance between the member firms, the exchange users and the public interest. It must include enough independent members to promote the protection of investors and the maintenance of proper standards.  I welcome the decision that the chairperson is to be independent.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank will have the power to object to the acquisition or disposal of significant holdings in the Stock Exchange and member firms.  It will also have power to apply to the High Court to appoint an inspector to investigate the affairs of an exchange or member firm.  The Bill provides for a committee to investigate breaches of the Central Bank's conditions or requirements by a Stock Exchange or member firm if the exchange or member firm so agrees.  If not, the Central Bank can ask the High Court to investigate.  The committee or High Court can require that a sum of up to £500,000 be paid where there has been a breach.  This is welcome.  It also provides for fines of up to £1 million and jail sentences of up to ten years for offences &mdash; for example, failure to keep proper books and records, supplying misleading information to an auditor or the misappropriation of clients' funds. All those measures are welcome.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1106" /> This is a balanced Bill.  Any changes to the memorandum and articles of association of a member firm will have to be approved by the Central Bank, which will be able to require such changes.  Where the bank refuses to authorise a member firm, or to approve a change a member firm wishes to make in its memorandum or articles of association, the member firm can appeal the Central Bank's decision to the High Court.  This is a welcome decision too and it adds greatly to the balance to the Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and have no doubt that it will make a major difference to stockbroking and the Stock Exchange in Ireland.</P>

      <P>I am sorry.  It is my mistake. The Minister is welcome and I thank him most sincerely for taking part in the debate on this important piece of legislation.</P>
      <P>I join in welcoming the ending of the English hold or control over the Irish Stock Exchange.  That is not to say that the Stock Exchange, as it has operated since 1799, has been totally divorced from the Irish authorities.  In fact, as I understand it, there always has been a fairly close liaison between the Department of Finance and the Stock Exchange, at least since 1922.  When it came to the Minister's attention that there were shortcomings or problems in relation to the Stock Exchange, he was quite entitled to make those feelings known.  Unfortunately, there was no power on the part of the Minister for Finance to initiate change under the Stock Exchange and that was the major problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1107" /> It is interesting how old many of the pieces of legislation that come before the House are.  Only recently we amended the Punishment of Incest Act, 1908.  This legislation before us certainly goes back a little further.  Indeed, it would be difficult to understand the English, let alone the content, of the Act.  It is printed with f's as s's and so on.  The second Act that is amended by this Bill is, of course, the Stockbrokers (Ireland) Act, 1918.  How times have changed since then.  I opened up the statutes, <i>The Public General Acts, 1918 (8 &amp; 9 Geo.5),</i> and saw that The Stockbrokers Act was chapter 46 but on the opposite page, chapter 47, was another Act, &ldquo;an Act to amend the law with respect to the capacity of women to sit in Parliament&rdquo;.  We certainly have moved on and society itself has moved on.</P>
    <P>One of the most dynamic parts of any society is commerce.  We live in a capitalist system, although the economy is regulated and guided by Government and its agencies.  Essentially, the main motor of economic development is capitalism and there appears to be all-party consensus on that.  Capitalism involves the utilisation of capital for profit.  If profit is not made, there will not be regeneration of capital and it will run out.  How do firms raise capital?  There are two ways to raise capital: through lending and on the Stock Exchange, so the latter is an absolutely vital part of any capitalist economy.  Companies need money.  They need finance to promote and expand their activities, to market abroad, to innovate with new products and so on.  Raising capital is the kernel of any capitalist system.</P>
    <P>We should be a little ashamed that it has taken so long to bring in a new scheme for the regulation of the capital creation or the capital providing aspect of our commercial economy.  The Bill is welcome and, as has been indicated earlier, there are two European Union Directives to implement as part of this legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1108" /> It is all very well to talk about regulation and, in so far as the Bill addresses regulation, I support it.  The Central Bank is ideally placed to do that. Another essential element in a stock exchange is consumer confidence in the rules and the members of the exchange. It is quite clear that the broad-ranging powers given to the Central Bank, and the Minister on appeal, will enable the Central Bank and the Minister to regulate in a fairly efficient way the Stock Exchange and its members.  It is fair to say that, despite a hiccup or two, the vast majority of members of the Irish Stock Exchange have conducted themselves with great integrity over the years.  There have been a number of blips, but there is no need for me to mention them.  The integrity of the members of the Irish Stock Exchange has, by and large, been of an extremely high standard.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister &mdash; perhaps rhetorically, perhaps not &mdash; if the public has that same self-standard of confidence in relation to firms that raise money at the Stock Exchange?  In the past three to five years there have been numerous cases of companies raising large amounts of capital on the Dublin Stock Exchange.  It subsequently transpired that the financial data upon which the raising of that capital was based was not accurate.  Many shareholders have lost out as a result.  I will not mention specific companies.  The public are well aware of companies that had shares valued at £5 one day which were worth 25p some days later.  That is very bad for confidence.  Perhaps it is not the function of this Bill, but there do not seem to be adequate policing provisions for the Stock Exchange or for the members of the Stock Exchange in relation to companies seeking funds on the Stock Exchange.</P>
    <P>Another issue which arises is, for example, that some companies become cash companies.  They accumulate vast hoards of cash and then stop trading.  By the rules of the Stock Exchange, such companies should be delisted.  Again, without naming names, it is a matter of <Col N="1109" /> common knowledge that there are some companies who are not trading, who have large amounts of cash but are still permitted to trade on the floor of the Stock Exchange.  Given that there may be sufficient regulation of the Stock Exchange and its member firms, what policing is there if those responsible for regulating the Exchange fail to police the people who raise the capital in the first place?  That represents somewhat of a gap in the Bill because most people do not have direct contact with the Stock Exchange.  If somebody wants to buy shares they will contact their stockbroker. The largest purchasers of shares are institutions who represent fundholders or pensionholders.  Most people never come into contact with the Stock Exchange.  They will never come into contact with those responsible for policing the Stock Exchange.  However, many people will come into direct contact with the companies and will be disappointed to see their shares worth £5 one day and 25p the next.  This is not an extraordinary case.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of this issue is the whole question of directors' abuse of their positions.  This is still in the area of policing of companies.  Without mentioning specific cases, there are two very large Irish companies quoted on the Stock Exchange, both in the financial services area.  As has been mentioned on the Order of Business of this House, the salaries paid to the directors of those companies are a cause of great public concern and disquiet.  People seem to be at a loss as to how they can have an effective input into an issue such as this.  The same situation occurred in England when the bosses of the utility companies &mdash; water, gas and electricity, which again are privatised companies now quoted on the Stock Exchange &mdash; decided to pay themselves obscene amounts of money as directors' emoluments.  The public seem to be impotent in relation to that issue.  Perhaps the Minister will tell me that I am slightly off the track in relation to this particular Bill.  However, it seems that there should be some provision in this <Col N="1110" /> Bill to enable the regulators of the Stock Exchange to have an input into the running of companies, in so far as they relate to the raising of capital by those companies.  Perhaps the Minister will address that point in his closing remarks.</P>
    <P>I have some further points to make but I do not wish to detain the House. One provision which is very worthwhile is that the Bill allows for the possibility that there will be more than one stock exchange in Dublin.  I understand that there were other stock exchanges in Ireland earlier in this century and in the last century.  There is only one stock exchange in Ireland at present.  The way the Bill is drafted means that the Irish Stock Exchange will be deemed to comply with its requirements until the procedures have been completed.  Once the Bill is passed the Irish Stock Exchange does not automatically become invalid. There is a presumption of validity for the present exchange.  It will be a different matter for another stock exchange. It is very feasible that the Minister's own city of Cork or another region might decide that it wants its own stock exchange.  I would like to know if the Minister can give this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I said that.  I do not think you were here.  I would like an assurance from the Minister that it is not the intention to close the door, so to speak, on other applicants for a stock exchange.  People considering opening a stock exchange would like to have that reassurance.  Another point which the Minister might consider is the question <Col N="1111" /> of consultation with the public in relation to the running of the Stock Exchange.  There does not seem to be any shareholders or users council, or any consultative body made up of members of the general public operating in relation to the Stock Exchange.  Would the Minister consider it appropriate that there should be some type of advisory council or consultative group where ordinary members of the public, particular securities firms or other interested parties, could deliberate and say that in their opinion the day-to-day running of the Stock Exchange was falling somewhat short of their requirements?</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  It was introduced by the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Bertie Ahern, now leader of Fianna Fáil.  I note the comment of the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, who said when she introduced the Bill on Second Stage in the Dáil: &ldquo;As a socialist I am in a peculiar position introducing legislation on the Stock Exchange&rdquo;.  I am sorry to hear that socialists consider themselves somewhat alien to the provisions of a stock exchange.  Perhaps she did not mean to say that in the way it came out. This is a very important piece of legislation. It puts the regulation and control of the Irish Stock Exchange firmly within the grasp of the Irish people through the Central Bank.  It is to be welcomed on that account.  I hope the Bill has a relatively speedy passage through this House and that there is a constructive debate also.  Some of the provisions are quite technical.  I foresee quite a detailed discussion on some of the enforcement provisions and other provisions regarding privilege etc.  I ask the Minister to take on board some of the comments I have made.  This House should support the Bill; it is long overdue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Stock Exchange Bill, 1995.  It is the first major legislation in that area for almost 200 years &mdash; 1799.  In his address to this House, the Minister of State, Deputy Higgins, spoke of the Act of Union, which came shortly after it, the 1798 Rebellion, which occurred a little before it, and the Famine.  Senator Mulcahy mentioned some of the laws that were contemporaneous and referred to the 1914 Act.  When we talk about Acts of that age, we definitely need to update matters and this Bill is doing that.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Central Bank will be the regulatory authority for our Stock Exchange.  With its experience in finance and running financial affairs, it will do a good job.  This Bill has been especially prompted by the European Union Investment Services Directive and the Capital Adequacy Directive.  The European Union Investment Services Directive requires a common standard of regulation for investment firms so that they can be allowed to invest and trade freely in the European Union.  The second directive sets out the level of capital which investment firms must meet for the requirements of their business; that is exceptionally important.  The updating of the title &ldquo;Investment Stock Exchange of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland Limited&rdquo; may be one of a number of links that have been broken since 1922.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I especially welcome in the Bill the role that will be played by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and the fact that the Houses of the Oireachtas <Col N="1113" /> have been mentioned.  It is of extreme importance for democracy that an important body like the Stock Exchange can be referred to the Houses of the Oireachtas if the need arises &mdash; and I hope it does not.  When higher standards and transparency are required in a changing environment that will involve Europe to a greater extent than before, this Bill is very necessary.</P>
    <P>Many technical points in this Bill were badly needed, especially in the regulation of money and investments, but the appointment of a broadly based representative board of directors is of extreme importance.  Some of these directors have the interests of the member firms and users of the exchange at heart, but there should also be some directors who will take the side of the public interest and the chairman must be independent of the Stock Exchange and its member firms.  I am glad there are sections that deal with complaints and disciplinary actions that must be taken in the regulation of the Stock Exchange.  After all, money invested belongs to the clients and their rights must be honoured.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to some of the regulations and Parts of the Bill on which I would like to comment.  He said:</P>
    <P>Part VII of the Bill sets out the powers of authorised officers of the Central Bank, of bank appointed inspectors and of inspectors appointed by the High Court.</P>
    <P>.... Sections 57 to 63 provide for the High Court, on the application of the bank, to appoint an inspector to investigate the affairs of the Stock Exchange or member firm.</P>
    <P>.... Section 64 provides for the appointment of an inspector by the bank to investigate particular matters relating to an exchange or member firm, including their compliance with any requirements of this or any other Act or with stock exchange rules or codes of conduct.  The bank may publish, in whole or in part, the report of an inspector appointed by it, and must forward any such report in full <Col N="1114" /> to the Ministers for Finance and Enterprise and Employment, who again may decide to lay it before the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Such regulations will keep the Stock Exchange running on a firm basis.</P>
    <P>In his concluding remarks, the Minister summed up what this Bill is about. He complimented the Stock Exchange for the way it helped in the preparation of the Bill.  Legislation that is nearly 200 years old is now being replaced with a modern regulatory framework with the Central Bank playing a central role in regulating banks, building societies and futures and options exchanges and the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and the Houses of the Oireachtas will play an important role also.</P>
    <P>In future, let us hope that with this new Bill and the closer liaison with the Stock Exchange, the Ministers concerned and the Houses of the Oireachtas will ensure that the economies of a country like Ireland are not jeopardised at the hands of unscrupulous and greedy international money merchants who can put the economy of a country in jeopardy with their wheeling and dealing and I hope this Bill will root out that practice.  Pensions and investments have been ruined and loans, investments and interest rates have been thrown into jeopardy by the work of these people.</P>
    <P>It may be no harm for the appropriate Departments or the Stock Exchange to conduct a public relations exercise because many people feel that the Exchange is divorced from the man on the street.  Such an exercise would be of great benefit to the Exchange and to our economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and wish him well in his new portfolio.  I know he will find his work there satisfying and rewarding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this substantial Bill which has been brought before the House today and I congratulate the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, <Col N="1115" /> Deputy Higgins, and his officials on the production of such a difficult and technically impressive document and for such a comprehensive Second Stage speech.</P>
    <P>It is noteworthy that this is the first substantial legislation dealing with the supervision of the Stock Exchange to come before the Legislature since this State was founded.  As was mentioned by the Minister, one of the purposes of this legislation is to repeal the existing substantive legislation applicable to the Stock Exchange, the Stock Exchange (Dublin) Act, 1799, and the Stockbrokers Act, 1918.</P>
    <P>This legislation appears to be somewhat overdue and I hope I will not be criticised for exaggerating if I say, in more ways than one.  I say this because I understand that the Stock Exchange has not, to date, been subject to a form of statutory regulation in this country that is comparable to statutory regulations that are in place in most other European countries.  Rather, it has been subject to regulation by the UK based London Stock Exchange and the UK regulator, the Securities and Futures Authority.  For a number of reasons, I do not believe that this historic state of affairs is satisfactory.  A modern independent State should apply its own regulatory apparatus and, as a matter of principle, should not be relying on the regulatory apparatus of other countries. A system of regulation where there is no political accountability in the country in which the regulation occurs is likely to be weak.</P>
    <P>The enactment of this Bill will mark the formal legal separation of the Irish Stock Exchange from the London Stock Exchange.  I welcome this because a modern State should have an independent Stock Exchange, the operation and development of which should focus on the specific needs of the State.  I am conscious of the significant advantages to both brokers and Irish investors from the close relationship between the Irish and UK Stock Exchanges.  This relationship probably provided Irish investors <Col N="1116" /> with easy and direct access to the London Stock Exchange, which is no doubt a benefit.  It can be argued that the Irish Stock Exchange standards were equivalent to those adopted in the UK and major stock exchanges in the world. There may be some value in this, but I would not over emphasise it.  I see no reason why the appropriate standards should not be adopted by an independent stock exchange.</P>
    <P>I am speaking on this Bill today because I have a personal interest in the financial pages of our newspapers and I have taken an active interest in the activities of the Irish and London Stock Exchanges.  The activities of the London Stock Exchange are fascinating. The advent of teletext on our television sets means we can watch as prices go up and down on an hourly basis.  The Stock Exchange is a sensitive barometer of the economic activities of a country.  When there is good news, it is reflected in the Stock Exchange as prices go up and when there is bad news, the opposite happens.  It is more fascinating that, with the advent of satellite television, we can now monitor stock exchanges not only in Europe but also in North America, Asia and the Far East.</P>
    <P>The principal focus of the Bill is regulation and I will have some specific comments on that later.  It is important that the new arrangements and the attitude of the authorities, including the Minister and the Central Bank, should facilitate the maximum development of the Stock Exchange and its firms consistent with proper regulation.  In modern economies, capital markets are replacing or at least supplementing the role of the banking systems and act as intermediaries between savers and investors and those who have a demand for capital. The enormous growth of mutual funds, the capitalisation of world stock markets and the growth of over-the-counter markets highlight the importance of capital markets in the world economy.</P>
    <P>A vibrant stock exchange is indispensable to capital markets in each state and the development of a vibrant, <Col N="1117" /> efficient and effective stock exchange is therefore very important to the economy and well being of our country.  I reiterate that the Stock Exchange, the stockbrokers, the Government authorities and the Central Bank should be very conscious of the need to develop the business of the Stock Exchange.  The focus of the development should be international.</P>
    <P>There are a number of areas &mdash; for example, the selling of Irish Government bonds and equities to international investors and the selling of international bonds and equities to Irish investors and the listing of international mutual funds &mdash; where the Stock Exchange's members have made progress in recent years.  Stockbrokers have done much to internationalise their business.  However, further progress must be made.  I would welcome the introduction of overseas brokers here, whether they be from the United Kingdom, Europe or America.  This would enable domestic investors, whether they be institutions or private clients, to access international investments in a cost effective way.  Such a development would also assist the sale of Irish investments abroad.</P>
    <P>I note that the provisions of this Bill dealing with supervision are comprehensive and vigorous and I welcome this.  They give much power to the Central Bank.  Such comprehensive powers are necessary in a modern environment because of the sophistication and complexity of company structures and investment business.  I am not sure whether it is coincidental but I also note that there are significant proposals to change the market structures for Government securities.  Under the old system the broker could give advice to the institution on how the market was moving.  The fund manager would then place a buy or sell order with the broker.  The broker risked nothing and obtained a commission on both sides of the deal.  The price was irrelevant and this was a most lucrative business.</P>
    <P>In June 1994 the Competition Authority ruled that the practice of giving <Col N="1118" /> stockbrokers fixed commissions on dealings in Government stock was anti-competitive. A large portion of the Irish public debt is quoted on the Stock Exchange.  As the debt increased, the brokers dealing rooms grew fat on the fixed commissions the exploded national debt was generating.  The proposed reform will see stockbrokers buying and selling Government stocks with their own funds in addition to those of their clients.  They must always be willing to deal at reasonable prices in large amounts between £1 million and £2 million. In effect they become market makers rather than agents dealing with other people's money.  They will hold a large inventory of Government stocks on which they will have to bear the risk if the prices go down.</P>
    <P>The National Treasury Management Agency has issued its guidelines for the introduction of the market making trading system.  Under the proposed system each broker will have to quote an offer price for whatever his client may express an interest in.  In this way the client can shop around to get the best rate on parade.  The National Treasury Management Agency's thinking is partly based on the hope that foreign investment will be encouraged by price competition on Irish gilts and the fact that these can be executed immediately without the need to match buyers and sellers.  This will have the effect of making Government stocks more attractive to German and other foreigners, who now hold over £3 billion of our national debt.  It will also have the effect of making it easier for the Minister for Finance to raise &mdash; I hope a diminishing amount &mdash; funds in the future.</P>
    <P>This new development must be welcomed, but I ask the Minister what implications it will have for the private investor.  At present it is very difficult for a private investor to buy or sell Government securities at market price. The market appears to be solely for institutions and it is a scandal that facilities have not been made available to the private investor to buy Government securities at market prices.  As a matter <Col N="1119" /> of principle, individuals should have the right to participate in the funding of the national debt.  In light of prevailing interest rates.  Government securities markets are very attractive to non-tax paying investors at the moment. However, when combined with special savings accounts the Government securities will be attractive to long-term investors.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to outline in his reply what provision he has made to enable special savings accounts to be used in the context of an investment in Government securities and what facilities he has made available to enable investors to invest directly in these securities in a convenient way and at market prices.  In the UK, for example, individuals can invest through post offices.  Whatever facilities are available here should be widespread, cheap and widely advertised.  I renew my welcome for this Bill.  I hope it will assist in bringing about a thriving, modern, transparent and a well regulated Stock Exchange.</P>

      <P>It is interesting that this Bill is the first major legislation relating to the Stock Exchange in almost 200 years.  The last legislation in this area was in 1799.  The Minister outlined the major points of the Bill.  The first is that the Central Bank will be the new regulatory authority for the Irish Stock Exchange and its member firms.  The concern of the Progressive Democrats is that the Central Bank itself has not been accountable to either the Minister for Finance or the Houses of the Oireachtas in relation to its own affairs. <Col N="1120" /> It is questionable to expect the Stock Exchange to be responsible to a body which itself is not accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I understand it is necessary for the Central Bank to be independent in relation to its monetary functions, but I question it acting as a regularly authority for the Irish Stock Exchange.  If anything was found to be wrong there, this House should be able to question the Central Bank on it.</P>
      <P>In his speech, the Minister stated:</P>
      <P>... the Bill provides a significant role for the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment [who] has responsibility for company law issues and has, of course, a particular interest in the access of Irish firms to capital.</P>
      <P>This is an important area because investing in shares does not seem to interest many ordinary people.  Most people invest their money in areas of least risk such as property and other areas that do not create employment, and that is a major flaw.  We tend to see tax advantages in urban renewal and we regard houses and property as a safe bet, but we do not consider investing in small or medium sized enterprises that are trying to raise capital to generate employment.  The Government should address itself to this matter.</P>
      <P>As regards privatisation, the Government should encourage everybody to take a share in enterprises that it wishes to privatise.  Following the recent flotation of the Irish Permanent Building Society, people who had accounts in the company were given free shares.  This was the first time that huge numbers of ordinary people became involved as shareholders in our Stock Exchange and it was a welcome development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's comments on investment intermediaries and I understand that a second piece of legislation has been promised.  When this Bill went through the Lower House last October it was hoped to have the second piece of legislation through the Oireachtas by the summer of 1995.  In summing up, perhaps the Minister can <Col N="1121" /> tell us when this investment intermediary legislation is expected to pass through both Houses of the Oireachtas. Senators are concerned that there is no legislation controlling investment intermediaries in this country.  While insurance brokers are subject to strict regulatory mechanisms, no such mechanisms are in place for investment brokers. Over the years many innocent people have lost their life savings to gangsters operating without conscience in this area.</P>
    <P>We have either been slow or unable to prosecute those involved in fraudulent financial transactions.  The Garda fraud squad is not in a position to deal with complex fraud and, because the necessary legislation is not in place, company directors involved in fraud have never been brought before the courts.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission has made relevant proposals which need to be examined seriously.  The right to silence has been effectively used by many criminals, and the same right can be claimed by those breaking company law. In such cases it is difficult for the DPP to obtain sufficient evidence to prosecute, yet nothing has been done about the huge amount of white collar fraud.</P>
    <P>This Act gives the Central Bank regulatory powers in respect of individual Stock Exchange members.  But if there is no improvement in the law governing corporate crime to enable those in the wrong to be prosecuted, people will rightly say that introducing such legislation is a waste of time.</P>
    <P>The Government also has a job to do in relation to access to capital.  This Bill arises from a European Union Directive and demonstrates that the EU has been good for us in forcing the introduction of legislation in areas that we are slow to tackle.</P>
    <P>We are changing part of our legal system, but the authorities are still using 18th century laws to deal with very sophisticated criminals operating in the corporate sector at the end of the 20th century.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney) Avril Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their kind remarks.  The past few days has been an interesting experience for me, but the kindness of people in this House has been very touching and I appreciate it.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to reply to this debate.  The Stock Exchange Bill will make substantial changes in the regulation of stock exchanges and member firms and I am glad to have had the views of Senators on its proposals.  I also welcome the support for the Bill expressed by Senators today.</P>
      <P>The main points of the Bill can be quickly described.  It marks a radical departure, naturally enough, given the differences in the regulatory climate between then and now, from the Stock Exchange (Dublin) Act, 1799 &mdash; the basic legislation in this area &mdash; which has survived for nearly 200 years and which is being repealed by this legislation.</P>
      <P>The main requirements of that Act are that individuals selling gilts on commission must have a licence to do so.  In modern times this requirement is met where a stock broking firm employs a person who holds a gilts licence and that stock exchange rules be approved by the Minister for Finance, who has, however, no power to initiate changes in such rules.</P>
      <P>The Bill now before the House establishes the Central Bank as the regulatory authority for stock exchanges and their member firms; requires stock exchanges and member firms to get authorisation from the Central Bank; equips the bank with powers to monitor and supervise exchange surveillance of its member firms and to set down requirements and conditions which exchanges and member firms must meet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill also gives significant powers to the two Ministers who are closely involved in this area: the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  The Minister for Finance, with the consent of his colleague, will have power to set down guidelines <Col N="1123" /> to assist the Central Bank in administering the system of regulation guidelines which will have to be published. He will also, again with the consent of his colleague, be able to obtain reports of Stock Exchange disciplinary proceedings and to publish them where both Ministers think it proper to do so, having regard to the public good and the rights of any person referred to in the reports.</P>
    <P>The Bill aims at making the Stock Exchange more transparent in other ways also.  The Exchange will be required to have a board of directors which is broadly based and which strikes a balance between the interests of the member firms, users of the Exchange and the public interest.  Moreover, the board will have to include enough independent members to promote the protection of investors and the maintenance of proper standards and the chairperson of the Exchange will have to be one of the independent board members.  While these provisions are aimed at ensuring openness and transparency, I am confident that over time they will also be seen as having benefited stock exchanges and their member firms.  This is because they will produce greater accountability and this, in turn, will increase investor confidence.</P>
    <P>The Bill also reflects the provisions of two European Union Directives.  The Investment Services Directive, which must be provided for in national legislation by 1 July, obliges member states to ensure a common standard of regulation for investment firms.  The Capital Adequacy Directive sets out the levels of capital which investment firms must have in relation to their business.  The Department of Finance, in consultation with the Central Bank and the Department of Enterprise and Employment, is about to publish legislation to implement these directives in respect of non-stock exchange investment intermediaries. I expect to introduce that legislation shortly.  In the meantime, the present Bill will meet our obligations in <Col N="1124" /> respect of stock exchange member firms arising from the two directives.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with points made by Senators in the course of this debate. Senator Fahey spoke about the Central Bank's supervisory approach.  The bank's supervisory approach involves considerable interaction with supervised institutions through regular review meetings and inspections.  The bank has developed a considerable body of supervisory experience, much of it in activities not dissimilar to stockbroking, such as treasury and investment dealing.  The bank, through its banking supervision role, is currently indirectly responsible for the prudential supervision of the stockbroking arms of the Irish banks and, as part of this role, already carries out prudential inspection of these firms. In addition, the bank regularly meets international supervisory bodies and has contact with overseas regulators either to give or seek assistance or to exchange views on current regulatory practice.</P>
    <P>The bank attended all meetings of technical experts in drawing up the EU Investment Services Directive and the Capital Adequacy Directive and attends implementation meetings on these directives and other relevant EU fora. The bank is also a member of the International Organisation of Securities Commissions, the international umbrella organisation for supervisors of investment firms.  Staff of the relevant department of the bank have considerable regulatory experience and a substantial majority have relevant graduate, post-graduate or professional qualifications. Qualifications of staff have been supplemented by a strong emphasis on external technical training in the financial area.  The bank will continue to develop its resources through internal training and external recruitment.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the foregoing that the bank has the experience, expertise and trained staff it needs to carry out successfully its functions under this Bill. The bank will include a statement of how it has exercised these functions in its annual report which must be laid before the Oireachtas under the Central <Col N="1125" /> Bank Act, 1989.  This will ensure that the House is kept informed of developments in relation to the bank's functions when the Bill has been enacted.</P>
    <P>Senator Fahey also raised the subject of monitoring.  The Central Bank will monitor member firms and the exchange carefully.  If it becomes necessary to do so, the bank will issue a direction to the exchange or the member firm by writing to it setting out what it requires.  The bank will be able to go to the High Court if a direction is not being implemented and the court can order that the direction be obeyed.</P>
    <P>Senator Fahey pointed out that stock exchanges are becoming more aggressive in getting funds for companies and getting more companies listed.  The Bill is aimed at regulation of exchanges and member firms.  However, the new independent chairperson and independent members should help to bring fresh thinking to the Exchange and to its operations.  I believe that will happen.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy spoke about a shareholders council.  We require the Stock Exchange board to be representative of users and the public interest as well as of member firms.  We also require it to have an independent chairperson.  In that way we will achieve what Senator Mulcahy alluded to in his reference to a shareholders council.  We do not need both.  In addition, the Bill deals with regulation of the exchange and member firms.  The operations of quoted companies and the details they supply to the exchange are matters for company law.  They would also be matters for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  However, I take the Senator's point.  The Senator's reference to directors' pay applies to more than quoted companies and is essentially a matter for shareholders.  The Central Bank cannot be expected to take on a role in that area which would be outside its remit.</P>
    <P>There is no problem in principle with regard to other stock exchanges being established.  If a group of people puts forward a serious proposal that is well researched and well supported to the <Col N="1126" /> Central Bank, the bank can authorise the establishment of other stock exchanges.  It is not the intention to preclude that possibility.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan raised a number of points.  With regard to accountability to the Houses of the Oireachtas, the Governor of the Central Bank has indicated that he will appear before the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs and he has already done so.  In addition, the bank's annual report will include a report on its regulation of the Stock Exchange and that will be laid before the Houses for scrutiny.  The Senator also asked about the investment intermediaries Bill.  That Bill is to be published in the next day or two and we will be pressing to enact it before 1 July. It is important to have the two Bills enacted together on that date.</P>
    <P>In summary, the Bill replaces legislation that is two centuries old with a modern regulatory framework.  It establishes the Central Bank as the regulatory authority and provides a significant role for the two Ministers closely involved in the Stock Exchange.  It meets Ireland's obligations in respect of Stock Exchange member firms arising from the European Union Investment Services and Capital Adequacy Directives. Finally, it ensures that the Stock Exchange will be more open and transparent than it has been up to now and that its board of directors will be representative of the users of the Exchange and the public interest as well as of its members.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann welcomes the holding of the International Whaling Conference in Dublin; and urges other EU Governments to follow the example of the Irish Government in declaring specified waters to be whale and dolphin sanctuaries.</P>
      <P>Over ten years ago the Irish Government chose to become part of the International Whaling Commission.  We have established a whale sanctuary in Irish waters.  As an EU member we are in a unique position to give an example to other member states with regard to the provision of sanctuaries in their territorial waters.  I am delighted the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Michael Higgins, is here as he has a particular interest in this matter. He is concerned about conservation in all forms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The level of scientific research carried out on whales is limited.  If it was not for the International Whaling Commission very little work would have been done. The Irish Wildlife Federation and the Office of Public Works and its Director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, Mr. Michael Canny, have done good work in Ireland in this regard.  It is pleasing for us that the International Whaling Conference is being held in Ireland this year.  It provides us with a unique opportunity to use our position to express an opinion and to urge other EU members to follow our example and <Col N="1128" /> establish sanctuaries in their territorial waters.  I ask the Minister to influence his European ministerial colleagues to follow Ireland's lead on this issue.</P>
    <P>The activities of the Faroese Government in killing whales are of great concern. The whale hunt and kill conducted around the Faroe Islands must be condemned. It complies with no standards; it is indiscriminate cruel killing of whales with a disdain for civilised activity.  I appeal to the Minister to use the conference in Dublin to publicly condemn the Faroese Government for the manner in which the whale hunt and kill is conducted.</P>
    <P>At one time whale hunting was necessary for survival.  We must now accept that the Faroese people have a standard of living as good as any in Europe.  The Danish Government, to which they are associated, also has a responsibility in this matter.  We must call on the Danish and Faroese Governments to end this slaughter, oblige them to sign the convention and become part of the International Whaling Commission.</P>
    <P>The manner in which this kill is conducted is cruel in the extreme.  Whales are directed by boats into 20 licensed bays and brought into shallow waters. Large metal hooks weighing five pounds are struck into the whales' flesh, ropes are attached and the whales are dragged ashore.  Once ashore, knives with six inch blades are dug into the flesh and blubber of the whales and they are killed.  Evidence suggests it can take up to 15 minutes for the whales to die.  It is a cruel, uncivilised activity which is not necessary for survival.  Any argument that it is essential to the economy or the survival of the islands is not true; it is a false premise on which to make a case.</P>
    <P>The Minister should condemn publicly the manner of the kill.  It is not a selective culling of specific whales but an indiscriminate killing, regardless of type or age, or whether they are lactating whales or calves.  This incredible procedure is taking place about 200 miles outside our territorial waters. Many of these whales migrate from our waters to the area around the Faroe <Col N="1129" /> Islands and are trapped and killed.  That is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>We should be proud that some years ago the Government signed the convention and established a sanctuary in Irish waters.  It is one of the good conservation measures we have taken.  We should fully support all the international efforts for a full scientific research on the world whale population and their activities.</P>
    <P>We must continue to resist strongly the attempts by Japan and Norway to reintroduce commercial whaling. Ireland supported the ban on commercial whaling in 1986 and we have consistently supported it at various conferences. It is important that we continue to support the ban until proper scientific research and analysis are carried out.  Strong commercial arguments will be put forward by Japan, in particular, and by Norway to reintroduce commercial whaling, which should not be supported until that scientific research and data is available.  It would be foolish to do otherwise.  I urge the Minister to ensure that that stand is taken by our Commissioner when he attends the convention.</P>
    <P>Research on Faroese women has shown that they carry ten times more PCBs in their milk than women in Sweden.  This could possibly be because of the amount of whale meat eaten by the Faroese.  The Faroese health department is monitoring the effects of these and other pollutants on children.  The health of women and children in the Faroe Islands should be examined.</P>
    <P>Whales are affected by hunting and also by pollution, which affects all sea life, illegal fishing and the use of illegal nets.  The fact that whales are subject to other dangers in addition to the hunt must also be taken into consideration.  I urge the Minister to continue to support the moratorium on commercial whaling. I ask him to condemn the methods used and the indiscriminate killing of whales regardless of age, whether they are calves or lactating females.</P>
    <P>The Environmental Investigation Agency must be complimented on the <Col N="1130" /> good work it has done since its establishment in 1984.  I am delighted Jennifer Lonsdale is here this evening.  It has done considerable undercover investigation into wildlife abuse and it has launched hard hitting case campaigns internationally, which have been successful.  Possibly the most successful of these has been the campaign to ban the international ivory trade.  We must be conscious and aware of damage to our environment.  Nature takes its course and if we damage one aspect of it, it automatically has an effect on other areas.  It is important to understand that and to do everything possible to ensure that the natural order is maintained.</P>
    <P>We have an opportunity to utilise our whale sanctuary and to highlight its advantages.  It is unique and perhaps it could be used as a tourist attraction, although perhaps the Minister does not like zoning in too much on the tourism aspect.  We have seen how the dolphin has affected Dingle.  In my area in Carrigaholt, dolphins swim up the Shannon and are becoming an attraction.</P>
    <P>Those from coastal counties will have seen small and large whales beached on shores and on platform rocks along the coast.  Perhaps this is an opportunity for the Minister or the Minister for the Marine to do scientific investigation into whale life around the coast, because we do not know much about the type and numbers of whales which live in Irish waters.  In recent years a number of whales have been beached along the coast in my constituency, including calves and large whales &mdash; one of the largest was beached in Fanore three years ago.  It would be interesting to know the whale population around our coast.  As this is the only country in Europe with a whale sanctuary, we should utilise it for tourism purposes.  If we knew the location of whales, whalewatching could become a tourism feature for coastal counties.</P>
    <P>I hope Members will support this motion, particularly the Opposition and Senator Fitzgerald.  It is to be commended. I welcome the fact that the international whaling conference is <Col N="1131" /> being held in Dublin.  I hope it will use the opportunity to highlight the importance of the ban on whaling, of establishing whale sanctuaries in waters around the coasts of member states and of doing necessary research.  It is important that the International Environmental Agency is assisted in doing necessary research and in getting data.  The work it has done over the years is commendable and I wish it every success in the future.  I wish the conference well and I hope the outcome of its deliberations will further highlight the importance of the whale population and of protecting and appreciating this unique species.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to this debate.  Approximately three months ago, when I asked the Leader of the House if we could have statements or a motion on whaling, he was more than willing to comply.  I am delighted the Minister is here and that he has taken such an interest in this. Sean-chara liom is ea an Teachta Ó hUigín agus tá fáilte roimhe go dtí on Teach.</P>
      <P>I asked for a debate because this is the European Nature Conservation Year and the 47th annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission is being held in Ireland.  It will take place for a month and people with scientific knowledge will discuss protection, etc. Both Houses have an opportunity to acknowledge what these people have done for whales, dolphins and porpoises, which were once in abundance. I am not a specialist on whales and I would love to know more about them than what I read in books.  I was a fisherman for 17 years and on a couple of occasions I saw two or three whales in the distance.  I also saw two dead whales west of the Blasket Islands.  I reported this to a friend who, in turn, reported it to the Whale Watch Society in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About a month or six weeks ago a shoal of dolphins arrived in Ballydavid, <Col N="1132" /> County Kerry, and remained there for two or three weeks.  People said this was a sign of great weather and the following week we had a heat wave.  I wish they had stayed there.  They created great excitement and fishermen who normally went fishing watched the dolphins in the harbour.  I am not sure if the Minister has seen Fungi, but he can be my guest the next time he is in Dingle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am worried that Fungi is overexploited.  I understand how a young lion or tiger could be trained as pets, but it is strange that this dolphin, a mammal, loves the company of people and that he can distinguish between males and females in the water. People from the Dolphin Society have visited Dingle and they are happy with the way he has been treated; no one is doing him any harm.</P>
      <P>There is a great sense of safety in Dingle because there is a superstition &mdash; we call it a piseog &mdash; that no lives will be lost while there is a dolphin in the harbour.  No lives were lost in the port since the dolphin arrived, although two boats sank last year.  Perhaps there is some truth in that superstition.  We hope the dolphin stays there for a long time and that people will learn to protect his environment.  He has taught the people of Dingle a thing or two about the environment. He acts as a watchdog because whenever the water becomes dirty or polluted, he moves out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Approximately ten years ago a great film was made called &ldquo;The Seas Must Live&rdquo;.  I wish RTE would show it again because it highlighted the fact that if the seas did not live, neither would we.  We are not careful about protecting our seas or enforcing our laws.  We are lucky that oil can float because if it sank to the bottom of the sea everything would have died years ago.  I welcome those who are attending the 47th conference and I wish them well in their deliberations.  I <Col N="1133" /> hope their meeting is well publicised so that people will learn more about what is happening.</P>
    <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn said that in June 1991 the then Taoiseach, Mr. Charles Haughey, declared that the waters under our jurisdiction would become a whale and dolphin sanctuary.  This is the only country in Europe with such a sanctuary.  This is an opportunity to call on our EU partners to make their waters a whale and dolphin sanctuary as well.  I support the International Whaling Commission and I sent it a subscription as soon as I saw its advertisement in the newspaper yesterday, which read: &ldquo;Get your bloody hands off our whales, Norway!&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn mentioned the methods used to kill whales.  We should also call for the killing of dolphins to stop.  I watch a number of wildlife films and in the year in which a film on dolphins was made 60,000 were killed for human consumption in Japan.  These mammals are doing no harm and if this killing continues, many of these species will become extinct.</P>
    <P>In 1982 the International Whaling Commission decided at its convention that commercial whaling would be set at zero by 1986, which is almost ten years ago.  It amazes me that some countries continue to kill whales for scientific purposes. They could be shamed into stopping this needless killing if small countries in the EU put pressure on them. This year Norway has a licence to kill over 300 whales.  Although the number was reduced, it is now being increased again.  Is this situation being monitored properly?  Is it similar to other illegal fishing carried out under the guise of law and order?</P>
    <P>A clear message must be conveyed by unanimous support for the motion. Some Senators will recall that three or four years ago I took an unpopular step in the House when I called for the banning of strychnine which was being used extensively, in a crazy sort of manner, to kill foxes.  I received the full support of the House and shortly afterwards strychnine was banned in the country, <Col N="1134" /> except for some small amounts which are used for medical purposes.  Since the ban, nothing has been said about a plague of foxes.  We appear to have controlled the foxes without the use of strychnine.  The sheep and lamb populations are healthy and growing.  I thank those who supported me in calling for the banning of strychnine.  Perhaps we should now take another unpopular step and bluntly and plainly tell the countries which are needlessly exploiting and killing these whales to stop, once and for all.</P>
    <P>We support the ideals of the people trying to protect the whales, the International Whaling Commission and those who have taken the trouble to visit Ireland to attend its annual meeting. If the Minister, with his responsibility for nature, culture and wildlife, calls for support to end the needless killing of whales, we on this side of the House will support him.  He should also call on the rest of Europe and other countries with waters under their jurisdiction to make them whale and dolphin sanctuaries.</P>
    <P>I thank the Leader of the House for allowing the motion which we are proud to support.  Hopefully the annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission will be successful.  It can be assured the support of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I support the motion. For many people whales are simply large mammals which live in the water and very little is known about the different varieties of whales.  We need to know much more about the lives of whales to understand the urgency of the call by the International Whaling Commission to have specific waters designated as whale and dolphin sanctuaries, as are the waters of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people do not realise that whales, especially the baleen whales, breed in the temperate and warm equatorial waters in the winter months and feed in the polar waters during summer. There are wide ranging migrations each <Col N="1135" /> year between the breeding and feeding areas.  Most baleen whales feed for only four or five months in the year when they are in the polar seas, which are especially rich in food.  It is often not realised that a large whale will swallow up to two tons of food a day and it builds up a store of energy which forms into a thick layer of blubber under the skin.  In previous centuries it was a lucrative source of energy for the primitive peoples living around the Arctic Ocean and in many ways this was the origin of the large scale commercial culling of the whales in search, not of their meat but their oil.</P>
    <P>The whales then migrate several thousand miles to their breeding grounds in the warm waters where they pair and mate.  The females carry a single young for almost one year.  During this time they migrate to the summer polar feeding grounds and then return to calve in the warmer areas.  The calf of a blue whale is approximately 23 feet long at birth and weighs approximately 2.5 tons.  Pity the mother whale.  It feeds on its mother's milk for approximately seven months and the mother then has approximately a five month resting period in her breeding cycle during which she migrates back to the warmer waters where she mates again, two years after the start of the previous pregnancy.</P>
    <P>It must be realised that at any time during that period the mother whale is at her most vulnerable.  Great care must be taken to study this migration pattern so that future generations of whaling stock can be protected and improved. This is why the widespread and indiscriminate killing of whales, described by Senator Taylor-Quinn, is so barbaric.  It makes no distinction between the mother whales, which may be carrying or feeding young, and young whales.  All are hoovered into a bay and ruthlessly slaughtered.</P>
    <P>An even more efficient, but equally barbaric way of killing whales has now been discovered.  It involves shooting the whale with an explosive which explodes on impact, but does not always <Col N="1136" /> kill it.  Hearing is the most important sense for whales as it is the means by which they navigate and any explosion, even if it falls short of killing, will seriously damage the whale's hearing, rendering it helpless.</P>
    <P>In the southern hemisphere whales are now starting to reproduce at an earlier age.  Previously they reproduced at ten to 12 years of age; now they do so at six to seven years.  This is a reaction to the decimation of their numbers and is nature's way of trying to increase the population.  This is why it is so important that other countries support moves to allow whales to return to their natural reproductive cycle and increase their population.  In this respect, France has called for the southern Antarctic to be made a whale sanctuary.</P>
    <P>If at some point the whale population returns to a more acceptable level and there is a possibility of surplus, as occurs in other species of sea life, there is no reason for not allowing whaling again in countries like Norway which have a tradition of whaling.  Until that level is reached, whale killing will decimate the population and we could find ourselves living on an earth which is devoid of our largest mammal.</P>
    <P>We must commend the former Taoiseach, Mr. Charles Haughey, for declaring Ireland a whale and dolphin sanctuary in June 1991.  It is important that this country, with such a long coastline, has taken this step.  Other countries should follow our example.  There is no reason why Britain and France should not also declare their coastal waters as whale and dolphin sanctuaries, especially since France is active in calling for a sanctuary in the southern Antarctic Ocean.</P>
    <P>As Senator Taylor-Quinn pointed out, there are benefits for any country which pursues this policy.  The dolphins feel secure and come to the shore and they are beautiful animals to watch in their natural setting.  About 15 years ago I saw what I took to be dolphins &mdash; my eyesight is not good &mdash; playing off Kerry Head.  My children were fascinated by these large animals jumping in and out of the water.  This will happen more <Col N="1137" /> often in our seas if we continue this policy. Dolphins and whales are animals with a certain amount of intelligence; they know where they are welcome and safe.  We can turn this to our advantage and develop it as a tourist attraction.</P>
    <P>I lend my support to this motion, which welcomes the conference in Ireland and calls on our fellow EU countries to follow our example in creating whale and dolphin sanctuaries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Minister and I am sure he is conscious of the interest of Members of the House in the wildlife aspect of his portfolio.  It is a great delight that hardly any environmental issue, or even an issue only slightly concerned with the environment, comes before the House without Members insisting on an environmental impact study to see if the project would affect our wildlife.  It is good that so many people realise our wildlife is precious and in need of conservation.</P>
      <P>This is a wider issue than wildlife in our country or seas.  While I welcome the International Whaling Conference, I support the second part of the motion, which urges other EU Governments to follow our Government's example in declaring specified waters to be whale and dolphin sanctuaries.  It is worth remembering that the former Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, took this step, as Senator Kelly said.  I agree with her that efforts should be made to create a whale sanctuary in the Antarctic region.</P>
      <P>Whales and dolphins are fortunate in that they have a good public profile; it would not be as easy to appeal on behalf of the shark or the monkfish.  However, this is an excellent start.  I listened to Senator Fitzgerald talk about his friend Fungi, who is a highly prized citizen of Dingle.  The only trouble in the area concerning Fungi was when others tried to entice him away from the town.  I was afraid there would be faction fighting in the Kingdom, developing to a high pitch.  Rude messages were sent from town to town about what would happen if Fungi was lured across the bay with fish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>He remained in Dingle because he knows when he is with his own.  As the Senator said, Fungi is a great tourist attraction.  While I would not see our desire to increase the whale and dolphin populations around our coast as primarily motivated by tourism, when we promote our green environment we should stress Ireland is a part of Europe which is friendly to wildlife and prizes it highly.  We already have great advantages in that ours is an island nation; we do not have trouble keeping under control many diseases which affect wildlife, such as rabies.  I hope this is noted also.</P>
      <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn's point about research is important.  Difficulties are caused because of the many conflicting figures for the populations of whales and dolphins and of various species of whale.  The Minister should consider what help we can give to the EU through our great marine biology institutions in Galway and other parts of the island, which could assess difficulties within the whale population.  All of those interested in preserving whales, dolphins, porpoises, etc. agree that the more independent the research, the more notice is taken of it by others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The economic side of whaling has been covered.  While it was important for the economies of Norway and Japan in the past, it is doubtful that it is now the case.  That is even true of the Faroe Islands.  If those countries insist whaling is necessary for their economies, perhaps we should consider taking steps similar to those taken in salmon fishing. The Minister will remember there were great problems with drift net fishing in the vicinity of the Faroes, which had a terrible effect on salmon runs some years ago.  Due to the munificence of an Icelandic businessman, the Faroese were given subventions to desist from interfering with the run with fine-filamented nets.  This was crucial in hugely improving the run of salmon coming to <Col N="1139" /> Ireland and increasing the catches in our waters.</P>
    <P>Another Irishman, Dr. A.J. O'Reilly, the chief executive and chairman of Heinz, was informed of the disastrous effect of tuna fishing on the dolphin population.  Dolphins and porpoises swam at a higher level than tuna; they became entangled in the tuna nets, were pulled under and drowned.  He took action to ensure the tuna fishing which supplied his company did as little damage as possible to the dolphin population. Some tins of tuna state they are &ldquo;dolphin friendly&rdquo;, which I presume we can believe.  We can have greater influence in this area by supporting such efforts, as well as those of the Government. I hope that the Minister will commend the efforts of such individuals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate the Government side on having this debate at this very opportune time when the International Whaling Commission Conference is taking place in Dublin.  It is an ideal opportunity to express our views on the conservation of creatures which have given great pleasure to many people over the years.</P>
      <P>Some years ago I spent two very enjoyable days on a whale watching expedition off the coast of Boston and I was amazed at the amount of interest and tourism it created, even in a country as large as the United States.  Senator Fitzgerald mentioned Fungi, the Dingle dolphin.  An amazing number of people take pleasure in this creature.  Prior to Christmas, a whale was washed up on Ballyheigue beach.  During the four or five weeks before the local authority decided how to dispose of the carcass, more people visited Ballyheigue than at any time during the tourist season.  I compliment the local people on the initiative they took to preserve the whale, which they hope to have as a tourist attraction this year.  Such creatures give great pleasure to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very concerned about the destruction of our sea life, particularly <Col N="1140" /> whales and dolphins.  There is now modern technology to kill these creatures and the days of Moby Dick and the sailboats are over.  As Senator Kelly stated, modern technology means that these creatures can be destroyed with high speed and explosives.  Television programmes are playing a large part in putting pressure on these people by showing this destruction and the baby whales left behind, which cry and make sounds for weeks afterwards.  I learned from a very interesting television programme that the whale provides food for thousands of different species of sea life. Senator Fitzgerald made a very valid point that we are lucky that oil pollution does not sink into the water because not alone would it destroy the water but it would also destroy other sea life, such as shellfish, which keep the entire system going.</P>
    <P>People can get close to Fungi the dolphin and he enjoys their company.  They play with him in the water and he enjoys it as much as they do.  Some years ago I saw a whale in Florida and it was wonderful to see such a large creature doing tricks for the public.  It is very hard to see these majestic creatures being taken out of our waters.  I support the motion. We cannot put enough pressure on the countries which are trying to destroy all the different species of whales and dolphins. One species of whale is under threat at present and once a creature is gone, it is gone forever; it is not possible to restart breeding programmes once a creature is extinct.  Lions, tigers and polar bears can be taken into zoos but it is very difficult to do that for whales and dolphins.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, who, on 7 June 1991, announced that all our sea area within a 200 mile radius was a whale and dolphin sanctuary.  I also congratulate the Minister on the work which he is doing to try to preserve our environment.  After all, we are just caretakers of this world for the future and we must keep everything intact.</P>

      <P>Tá fíor áthas orm bheith anseo libh tráthnóna agus cuireann sé áthas orm go bhfuil daoine ar aon intinn faoin ábhar tábhacht seo a bhaineann le gné tábhacht cúram oidhreachta atá orm faoi láthair. I hope to be able to reply to some of the points which have been made.</P>
      <P>There are some Members present who will remember that the longest speech I ever gave in my life was about 20 years ago on the Wildlife Bill, 1975, which became the Wildlife Act, 1976. The only quote which I can remember from that speech, which went on for several hours &mdash; I was much younger then &mdash; is that I said it was very important that we look at the philosophy which lay beneath our assumptions in relation to matters environmental and ecological.  I quoted Francis Bacon's notorious phrase in defence of the idea of progress: &ldquo;I leave to you nature and all her children in bondage for your use&rdquo;.  This idea of progress, and what went with it in terms of its political implications, the colonial project and the project of despoliation of the environment in the name of inevitable linear development, has caused most of the problems.</P>
      <P>I said then that it was necessary to reconsider the assumptions which we held in relation to the forms of life on the planet.  I drew a distinction between the wonderment of children and the destructive attitudes of adults.  Listening this afternoon, 20 years later, the wonderment is returning to many of the Senators, who have spoken movingly about their experiences of looking at dolphins.</P>
      <P>I will attempt to answer some of the points which have been specifically raised and any others which are raised during the time available for this discussion. While I do not want to anticipate all of what I will say next Monday, I can give the House some idea of my thinking on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is, of course, proud to be hosting the 47th annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission in Dublin from 8 May to 2 June.  I am proud and <Col N="1142" /> honoured to host this major event which brings 500 delegates to Dublin over one month.  I note that there are some significant people in the Visitors' Gallery whom I met before, some as far away as Rio de Janeiro, when in another incarnation I was making a documentary on UNCED.  I had an easier life then and I was able to fire myself into Greenpeace's agenda with more enthusiasm or, rather, more freedom.</P>
    <P>I admire and commend the work of Ms Jennifer Lonsdale of the Environment Investigation Agency, Mr. Fergus O'Gorman, an old friend from the Irish Wildlife Federation and Mr. Ciarán O'Donoghue from the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.  One of the sadnesses of my new position and my lack of time is that I was not free to visit the Galway performance of <i>Whaling Nation,</i> Heathcote Williams' magnificent long poem, with another old friend, Mick Lally, and others; nor am I free on Sunday, unfortunately, when I am making a rare visit to my family in Galway.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to all those who have raised awareness, but more importantly, stood fast in times that were perhaps less amenable to public support for issues like these.  A number of very important points must be made about whales.  I must sound a word of caution: it is easy to condemn nations but it is far more complicated and difficult to bring nations with you.  I say that with an immediate assurance that the position Ireland will be adopting at the conference will be strongly conservationist. I will return to this point in a moment.  Members have to bear in mind, for example, a sensitivity to cultures. If we condemn cultures outright and then suggest that they take another path, that path of dependency may in turn be worse in terms of its ecological consequences than anything else.</P>
    <P>We may well be able to communicate our own experience to other countries, that is, of having turned away from the things for which we condemn other people now.  It is not that we condemn <Col N="1143" /> them, but that we seek to convince them that there are other paths which do not require the destructive activity they are pursuing at present.  In one of our most famous pieces of writing by a person who lived close to Senator Fitzgerald's area, Tomás Ó Criomhthain in his book, <i>An tOileánach</i>, wrote of an account of the hunting of small cetaceans by driving them ashore off the south coast in the last century which seems to have been fairly frequent.  The translation of that passage reads as follows:</P>
    <P>I jeered at the old woman whenever she came along with a creel full of porpoise meat balanced on her rump.  You might imagine that she came out of the porpoises herself with her creel, she was so thickly smeared with blood.  But she earned a meed of praise for she nearly killed the Captain of one of the Dunquin Boats with a blow of a shovel.</P>
    <P>The Islanders had no lack of pork for a year and a day, and it would have lasted two years if it hadn't been for all the relations they had everywhere on the mainland.</P>
    <P>Ireland has not granted licences to engage in whaling activities since 1939. Prior to this two whaling stations were operated by Norwegians in County Mayo and County Donegal.  Whaling records indicate that nearly 700 of the great whales were killed in commercial operations off County Mayo between 1908 and 1914.  A former colleague of mine, Professor Jim Fairley in University College Galway, gives these figures in his book <i>Irish Whales and Whaling.</i></P>
    <P>The International Whaling Commission was set up under the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling which was signed in Washington DC on 2 December 1946.  The purpose of the convention is to provide for the proper conservation of whale stocks and thus make possible the orderly development of the whaling industry.  Its main duty was to keep under review and revise as necessary measures laid down which govern the <Col N="1144" /> conduct of whaling throughout the world.  In addition the commission coordinates funds and encourages whale research.  A moratorium on all commercial whaling came into effect in 1986. Quotas continue to be set for certain aboriginal subsistence operations by the Inuit and similar communities in Alaska, Russia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines.</P>
    <P>The International Whaling Commission is under pressure from whaling nations such as Japan and Norway, as Senators have said, to set quotas for a resumption of commercial whaling of minke whales.  The IWC is preparing a revised management procedure and scheme designed, as they would see it, to allow catch quotas in such a way as to enable our whale populations to recover to pre-hunting levels.  I can tell the Seanad that Ireland will not support setting catch quotas because there are key concerns to be satisfied on the necessary safeguards which include an inspection and observation scheme, data reporting and monitoring.  The issue of humane killing must also be addressed.</P>
    <P>Ireland ratified the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling on 2 January 1985, having become concerned at the over-exploitation &mdash; perhaps that is the wrong word &mdash; of most species of large whale.  The blue whale in particular has come close to extinction and populations of other species have been dangerously reduced. Ireland has a comprehensive legal framework in place to protect whales and dolphins under the Whale Fisheries Act, 1937, and the Wildlife Act, 1976, to which I referred.  The Seanad will be aware that I am committed to amending the Wildlife Act and bringing it up to date to make it stronger, hopefully this year, but certainly not later than 1996. Protective measures have been introduced under European Union and CITES regulations on trade in cetaceous products.</P>
    <P>Ireland's position on whaling has been a pro-conservation one based on scientific evidence and in line with the principles of sustainable development.  I <Col N="1145" /> ask Members to bear in mind the <i>caveat</i> I put on the word &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo; in my opening philosophical speculation in which I say that sustainable development is as good a concept as the content one gives to the meaning of &ldquo;sustain&rdquo;. What is being sustained and how does one define it in terms of its impact?  This position that we have developed is in line with our domestic policies on game hunting and fishing.</P>
    <P>In line with national policy to ensure conservation of stocks, Ireland has supported the creation of sanctuaries and in June 1991 we declared all waters in our exclusive economic zone to be a whale and dolphin sanctuary.  The tributes paid to former Taoiseach, Mr. Charles J. Haughey, are well made.  He was interested in this area and he deserves all the credit due to him for being farsighted in this.  That declaration was in line with the Government's environmental policy and was a clear indication of Ireland's commitment to contribute to the protection of cetaceans in their natural environment.</P>
    <P>Ireland has been to the fore in efforts to obtain international agreement on the establishment of whale sanctuaries under the auspices of the International Whaling Commission and has played no small part in the adoption of a proposal for a southern ocean sanctuary at the 46th international meeting of the International Whaling Commission held in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, last year.  We strongly support the concept of the sanctuary as a valuable conservation tool where specific breeding and feeding areas are protected and where stocks can recover.  Ireland took a very strong position on the proposed boundaries of the sanctuary, and with Monaco, was responsible for eventually achieving an increase of 75 per cent in the area of the sanctuary to 7 million square miles of ocean.  The extension of the area meant that populations of sei and fin whales are protected in addition to the minke whale stock which is the primary target for protection.</P>
    <P>In combination with the pre-existing Indian Ocean sanctuary, the new sanctuary <Col N="1146" /> will provide protection for some cetaceans throughout their migratory range and life.  I take particular interest in what Senators have stressed in their contributions to this motion on the migration patterns of species.  If there is one element that reminds us that our responsibilities do not stop with boundaries, national and otherwise, it is the migratory patterns of species which create an international obligation.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Business and Finance</i> in its issue of 18 May 1995 has an encouraging message for myself in that one of the contributors from the other side of the argument sees our declaration of sanctuary as somewhat cynical.  The point is that we are required to take actions that are beyond our remit of time or in terms of interests.  Anyone who has heard what has been said here this evening will agree that we were being far from cynical in adopting this progressive attitude. The sanctuary now provides the IWC and other scientific institutions with an excellent opportunity to co-operate in conducting scientific research on undisturbed whale populations.</P>
    <P>I will deal with questions as I go along.  I am delighted to tell Senator Henry that I will be recruiting a marine biologist to the National Parks and Wildlife Service this year.  This will strengthen the staff and help in the preparation of a further expansion of policy in this regard.</P>
    <P>The sanctuary will be important as a place for research.  My Department is also examining the question of the extension of the Agreement on Small Cetaceans on the Baltic and North Seas, ASCOBANS, to Irish waters.  This agreement was drawn up under the Bonn Convention, which Ireland has ratified, and aims to achieve and maintain a favourable conservation status for small cetaceans.  This would also involve conservation and management plans for small cetaceans.</P>
    <P>I commend the Irish Whale and Dolphin Group, which has co-operated so well with the National Parks and Wildlife Service in promoting the Irish sanctuary, for taking a lead on so many <Col N="1147" /> aspects of the conservation of cetaceans. I am delighted that I am accompanied this evening by the Director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, Mr. Michael Canny, and we see our approach as one of partnership with regard to the future role of the service. I intend to stress this emphasis.</P>
    <P>I will cover the specific points raised by Senators, but the views we will bring to the international discussion of these issues will be strongly conservationist.  If in doubt, we will come down on the side of conservation in the interest of developing our policy.  We will not let matters go if we have questions in relation to suggestions of departure from that stance &mdash; for example, where we find either methodological defects or defects in principle.</P>
    <P>The Irish Whale and Dolphin Group gave a lead on so many aspects of conservation. It has conducted a number of studies in relation to the sanctuary and manages the whale and dolphin stranding and sighting network.  It has also been of major assistance in preparing for the IWC meeting and has organised a series of events during the meeting to celebrate Ireland's sanctuary and to raise public consciousness of it.</P>
    <P>I mentioned Heathcote Williams' long poem earlier and the way in which the whale issue has struck a chord with people in general is interesting.  Perhaps this has something to do with the long psychic memory, back through the evolutionary chain to the seas from which we all came, but I will restrain myself.</P>
    <P>A number of research projects have been carried out relating to the Irish sanctuary.  Ireland participated in a study of cetaceans in the Celtic Sea, with assistance from the EU in association with ASCOBANS.  A smaller study was conducted into the possibilities of whale watching off the County Mayo coast in conjunction with the International Fund for Animal Welfare. The UCC zoology department has carried out post mortems on stranded cetaceans to collect biological and pollution data.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1148" /> Whales were over exploited in the past and many populations were endangered.  We must now seek to promote non consumptive use of whales to give them time to recover.  In particular, there is great potential for the development of whale watching off the west coast.  There is a curious dimension to this in that we move into a better symmetry with nature by being willing to look and wonder rather than consume.</P>
    <P>There are already small scale dolphin watching enterprises operating on the west coast, some of which were informally described during the debate. Many affectionate references were made to Fungi and his importance to Dingle.  I strongly support the development of the whale and dolphin watching industry as a long-term sustainable use of this resource.  My Department will prepare draft regulations to ensure the industry develops properly and on whale friendly lines.  My interest in this matter goes back a number of years and the impact of humans on Fungi and his equivalents is not always beneficial.  If there is to be a developed whale watching industry, it is only proper that it should be regulated and whale friendly. We can feel proud that Ireland's efforts on both national and international fronts have made a significant contribution to the worldwide conservation of cetaceans.</P>
    <P>Ireland's declaration of a whale and dolphin sanctuary within our economic zone was the first in Europe, as Senators pointed out.  Ireland will continue to support the establishment of sanctuaries as an important part of conservation management.  I hope our example will be followed by other nations and in particular by our EU partners.  Several Senators urged me to bring moral persuasion to bear on our EU partners and I have no difficulty with this.  I will be delighted to bring to our partners the views of Seanad Éireann and the supportive views of Government.</P>
    <P>Public opinion, which regards cetaceans as special animals that should not be exploited, clashes with cultures which view cetaceans as a marine <Col N="1149" /> resource.  As I stated earlier, the IWC is the recognised international forum where these conflicting views are expressed and which has the authority to implement any agreed resolutions on the issue.  Senators may find it untypical of me, but I make a plea for patience with regard to convincing people of the long term case.  It would be short term to involve oneself in simple condemnations. We should try to maintain the opportunities which exist within the forum for convincing people to change their tactics.</P>
    <P>On the other side of the argument, some people make the case for dependent communities, stating that they must be treated sensitively in moving from one form of dependence to ensure that they do not become involved in another.  This argument has been over-stressed by people who are interested in simple economic benefit.  We must bear these type of considerations in mind.</P>
    <P>This is European Nature Conservation Year, the theme of which is conservation outside protected areas.  This is why we wanted to host the conference this year.  People should not think that this debate has been an entirely sentimental exchange and that we are all of one mind.  I listened with interest to what was said about whales in general, but I am mindful of the fact that 0.5 million small whales, dolphins and porpoises die each year.  This is a reality we must bear in mind and we must extend our efforts.</P>
    <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn raised the question of the Faroese.  I have no difficulty with communicating my views, those of Seanad Éireann and the history of our experience to the Danish Government and the Faroese and I will take the opportunity to do so.  It would be very wrong if we got locked into a certain situation.  We will take a principled stand, but I hope we will not be isolated, with the support of one or two countries.  I hope we will be able to convince others and one way of doing this is by conveying the convictions of this House and our experience.  I mentioned Tomás Ó Criomhthain at the outset.  We <Col N="1150" /> were in that position in the last century and at the beginning of this one, but we are not now at that position.  I hope we can communicate that to the benefit of others.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelly made many points.  It is most important that we consider the practicalities of this matter.  Many of the claims made regarding the characteristics of whales have been debunked in some respects.  However, it is important that we do it, because it is right.  I answered Senator Henry's suggestion in relation to marine science and facilitating research.  As I stated, I intend to augment my staff with a marine biologist this year.  This will give me another advantage in this area and supplement the work being done by our Commissioner.</P>
    <P>Senator Kiely mentioned the death of a small whale.  It was most interesting to hear him describe this event and the reaction of a local community to it. Local communities establish the best of themselves as they wonder together about this.</P>
    <P>I welcomed our visitors.  I pay particular tribute to our visitor who has done so much to expose the appalling ivory trade.  It is important that business people and those who exploit the advantages of irresponsible business practices, such as the purchase of ivory, be subject to opprobrium on an international scale, which puts them off their activity as well as giving a good wallop to their pockets when it comes to commercial benefits.  It has been immensely valuable that they have been exposed from within.  I know the background to this.  The aspect of the issue in relation to the Faroese which will upset most Senators is the practices and method of killing.  This has an impact immediately not just on Senators but on the public.  The issue goes further than this.</P>
    <P>There could be an examination by the scientific committee of the International Whaling Commission.  We will have to be careful, given our history.  We cannot say it is easy to impose our cultural values, as they are at present informed by ecological considerations, on others <Col N="1151" /> and it would be wrong to do so.  This is what I meant by the patience of being able to listen to people &mdash; many of whom are genuine &mdash; on forms of dependency.  Before referring something to a process which might take years, we must immediately communicate to the Danish Government and the Faroese the opinion of this House, the opinion of the Government and the position it has taken on the issue and the history of our own relationship to this issue.  I shall do so this week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to support the motion.  I listened with great interest to the final part of the Minister's statement. A number of countries are involved, including Japan, Norway and Denmark.  The involvement of the Danes has been fairly well ventilated so I will start by speaking about the Norwegians in case I get side tracked or exhaust all my time.</P>
      <P>I clearly remember reading <i>Moby Dick</i> many years ago.  Anybody who has compassion for animals and reads that book will be overwhelmed by a feeling of sadness at the violation humans commit on these magnificent mammals who are gentle, caring and some of whom have highly developed nervous and linguistic systems.  This may not, perhaps, be the case with whales but is certainly true of dolphins.  I am aware that the argument about the cubic capacity of the cranium and its relation to intelligence has been used against female members of our own species and I regard it as totally specious.  There must be some correlation.  If we look at the linguistic patterns of dolphins in particular and their complex behaviour, it is clear they are highly intelligent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also have a personal propensity towards dolphins.  I read a scientific book by Wainright Churchill, in which he said that homosexual behaviour occurs throughout the mammalian order with increasing regularity as one ascends the philogenetic scale.  He instanced the fact of life long homosexual monogamous partnerships among <Col N="1152" /> dolphins.  They are very close to my heart because they behave in a way which commends itself to me.</P>
    <P>On 2 May Norway began commercially killing minke whales, despite its admission that the scientific evidence it used to justify the slaughter was incorrect. That is why, in the context of this important meeting of the International Whaling Commission, we should make a strong point not just to Denmark but also to Norway.  A letter has been leaked in which the Norwegians admit their estimate of 86,700 minke whale in north-east Atlantic waters is completely and utterly wrong.  Computer error is the excuse they give.  They admit the true figure is more likely to be about 53,000 whales, a difference of 33,000 animals.  Nobody believes this could be due to computer error so what is the underlying reason?  I am sorry to have to say that it appears to be political because it was regarded as a vote catcher in elections.</P>
    <P>In addition, in a completely cynical move, the Norwegian Government brought the whale hunt forward by a month in order to boost their catch when it was being taken into account in terms of allocating quotas.  One of the real problems with this, apart from the slaughter, is the nature of the beasts which are being slaughtered.  Because of the season, they are much more likely to be whales in calf.  Pregnant females are likely to be the main targets as they also yield more meat and are easier to catch because they are slower.  The Norwegian Government lowered the quota from 301 to 232 whales but, in open defiance of their Government and world opinion, the Norwegian whalers rejected the new quota, declaring their intention to slaughter the original figure of 301 whales.</P>
    <P>I think it is a very useful moment for Ireland, which has a good reputation because of its record in declaring a whale sanctuary in its waters, to make these points to the Norwegian and Danish Governments.  We could find ourselves in a situation where once again the slaughter continues and we have up <Col N="1153" /> to 2,000 whales being killed every year by Norwegian whalers alone.  If this is tolerated, it is only to be expected that the Japanese, seeing this breach made in conservation policy, will themselves follow suit.</P>
    <P>What we should be calling for is, first, Norway to immediately stop slaughtering minke whales in the north-east Atlantic.  Second &mdash; I know the Minister is particularly committed to the principles in political life of openness, transparency, clarity, honesty, integrity and full disclosure of the truth &mdash; the Norwegians ought to admit in public they have been wrong, that their figures were inaccurate and they do not underestimate the intelligence of the human mammal by trying to maintain it was simply a matter of computer error.  They should be subjected to an unlimited moratorium on all scientific and commercial whaling.  The use of research and scientific information gathering etc., for slaughter is a cynical exercise which demeans the whole concept of science itself.</P>
    <P>The Faroe Islands are a Danish responsibility.  Faroese nationals sit on the delegation of the Danish Government to the International Whaling Commission.  This is where we can make our feeling clearly known to the Danish Government.  The Faroe Islands are only 400 miles off the north of Ireland and are a whale sanctuary.  There is a clear contradiction in having a whale sanctuary so close to an area where whales are so clearly and unpleasantly slaughtered.  The whale hunt of the pilot whales is not for food.  Historically, as the Minister said, it was understandable when this was part of a natural process and people used whale meat but this is no longer the case.  It is clearly for sport.</P>
    <P>The Faroese authorities, because of the PCB contamination of whales, have advised their own people not to eat the meat of whales.  The Faroese Government consistently blocks efforts by the International Whaling Commission to gain protection for the half million other small whales, dolphins and porpoises <Col N="1154" /> which are dying every year.  They also attempt to impose a kind of censorship on the International Whaling Commission so that the proper and scientific scrutiny of the hunt may be impeded.</P>
    <P>Pilot whaling can take place at any time of the day, any day of the year.  It is totally indiscriminate in that entire herds of whales are killed, including pregnant and lactating females and their young, and this sort of indiscriminate killing is banned elsewhere in Europe under the Berne Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats.</P>
    <P>I gather from what the Minister has said that some of the descriptions of the way in which these unfortunate animals are hounded, battered, bludgeoned and sliced has already been placed on the record of the House, so perhaps it will not be necessary for me to go into this matter.  I have recently seen a film in which this process was made clearly visible to a television audience and it was one of the most revolting things I have ever seen.  I feel ashamed of my humanity when the superior intelligence of mankind is being used to slaughter these animals, who have no defence against the extraordinary technology that is now employed against them.</P>
    <P>In the 19th century people were dependent upon the whale hunt for food and resources.  The oil from whales helped to light their igloos.  The whales were on a more equal level with their hunters because they were in a natural environment without the kind of additional technological aids that the whalers now have which give the whales no chance at all.  There is something particularly disgusting in this form of slaughter and it cannot be justified nowadays. People are not dependent on whales for natural resources.</P>
    <P>As I have been made aware by an excellent briefing from the Irish Wildlife Federation, either the Faroese people are eating far more whale meat and blubber than is safe, or they are consistently wasting large numbers of whales. Anything I know about the hunting of seals, dolphins and the different varieties <Col N="1155" /> of whales would lead me to the second conclusion, that there is enormous and disgusting waste.</P>
    <P>I gather from what the Minister has said that he feels the best way to tackle this is for Ireland to use its moral leadership in this area to persuade the Danish, the Faroese and perhaps, the Norwegians; but I hope there will be a sting in this persuasion and at least the threat of some degree of sanction.  From my experience of the human animal, I am afraid that unless there is some weapon or sanction that can be applied, then moral suasion, particularly when, as in the case of the Norwegian Government, who perceive an electoral advantage by pursing this policy, it is unlikely to have the kind of effect that this House, I imagine unanimously, and the Minister would like to see.</P>
    <P>When one confronts and views the armoury of the whalers and the way in which they inflict injury, mutilation and damage upon whales in calf, pregnant females and so on, offering or proposing the small marginal weapon of some degree of sanction is but a reasonable and moral counterbalance to the kind of savagery to which these Governments, to their eternal shame, continue to lend their sanction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief.  I welcome the Minister to the House and I also welcome the opportunity of speaking on this motion.  I commend the Minister for what he has already said and for his promise to greatly strengthen the Wildlife Act &mdash; he said that he hoped to do this later in the year.  I also welcome the Minister saying that he will carry the opinion both of this House and the Government to the Faroese and show them how much we disapprove of what is happening in their waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have taken a principled stand on this issue and have a good reputation internationally.  We should commend our own commissioner on the International Whaling Commission, Michael Canny, from the Office of Public Works Wildlife department.  He has an excellent <Col N="1156" /> reputation, is highly thought of and is strong on conservation issues.  It is good for us to realise that we have such a highly thought of representative on that commission.  We are not yet aware of the effect of environmental damage on whales.  A study is being carried out by the International Whaling Commission as to the effects of global warming, pollution etc.  It is essential that we press for the moratorium on commercial whaling for a long time to come.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about <i>An tOileánach</i> and ethnic Indians, but times have changed and we have moved on. We, and those in the Faroe Islands, are no longer looking to whales as a source of food.  Whale hunting is now mainly seen as a sporting occasion and what is going on there could not have the approval of any civilised nation.  I accept that it may be better to bring people along by encouraging them to do this through conservation methods, but a strong statement should be made to the Faroese, the Danish authorities, and, as Senator Norris said, the Norwegians. Japan is another country that is involved in using large factory whaling ships; and if we do not operate a conservation policy, the numbers of whales will decrease significantly.  Like all things in nature, sometimes it is only when we have destroyed it that we realise its worth and then it is too late for us to do anything about it.</P>
    <P>I strongly support this motion.  Most of what I was going to say on the whales has already been said by Senator Norris; unfortunately, he arrived a few minutes before I stood up.  I support what all of the Senators have said.  I welcome the comments from the Minister and urge him to express our feelings to the countries involved in the strongest possible manner.  The Minister said that he would carry the opinions of this House and the Government and make them known to the Faroese authorities; but, as Senator Norris said, sometimes one may need sanctions to get results from people.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Government for putting down this motion.  It is <Col N="1157" /> important that we get an opportunity to speak on such matters.  We often get carried away with many issues that we see as important, but when we are talking about the protection of our environment, wildlife and sealife, it is good to see the concern that Members of this House have for these issues, that they will put them down for a lengthy debate and that we all have an opportunity to state that we are on the one side on this matter and commend the Minister and the Government.</P>
    <P>I finish by paying tribute, like most Members, to a previous Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, who gave us a lead in what needed to be done with our wildlife.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion and I also welcome the Minister's colourful statement on it.  As somebody who lives inland, I do not know a lot about sealife, but I did see the world famous Dingle dolphin some years ago and have also learned a lot from this debate, especially from Senator Fitzgerald's contribution. It is a timely motion and I support it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mr. R. Kiely)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister is anxious to speak.  It is not normal for a Minister to speak a second time on a motion, but he can do so if the House agrees?  Is that agreed?  Agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, and the House for its flexibility.  The Leader of the House told me it would be operating like this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not abuse my privilege.  I only want to reassure the three Senators who spoke after my contribution and who wanted to know where we stood on the matters they raised.  For example, Senator Norris raised the question of the attitude we would be taking with Norway.  We will be raising questions at the IWC about the legality and propriety of Norway's whaling.  This is a stronger position than that of those we may seek to persuade.  When I was speaking about persuasion I was thinking of those countries which do not accept the IWC's legal competence to <Col N="1158" /> deal with, for example, small cetaceans. This is an area where such a tactic would be appropriate.  Patience is necessary, but there must also be a sting in the tail.  Senator Honan made a similar point.  Both Senators Norris and Byrne welcomed the motion.  One of the reasons we will be raising questions at the IWC about the legality and propriety of Norway's whaling is that, it seems to me at least, the estimates used by Norway are without scientific basis.</P>
    <P>I appreciate all the points made by Members.  We will continue our critique of the revised management scheme and its methodology.  We will continue our efforts in relation to the compromise formula, which would have the effect of preventing the resumption of commercial whaling.  We will be taking a conservative approach towards the United States' request to increase their aboriginal catch.  We will certainly support sanctuaries and whale watching.</P>
    <P>I have given the thinking and theoretical basis for our approach and this will be developed in the contribution.  I thank the Senators for their remarks and also for their tributes to the Irish commissioner, who has made a very good contribution.  I assure the House that their views will be communicated speedily to where they can have most effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all those who spoke on this motion for their support. We have had a very good debate and a variety of contributions which dealt with all aspects of this problem.  I particularly thank the Minister for dealing in such detail with the various points raised in the course of the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank Senator Fitzgerald, who gave us a fine appreciation of the environment in Dingle and the importance of Fungi, not just to the tourist industry but also to the environment in Dingle. He referred to him as the watcher of the environment.  That is an important aspect which should not be underestimated. As a west of Ireland woman, I equally appreciate and fully value superstition in relation to the sea.  I fully <Col N="1159" /> respect the superstition that no life has been lost in the port since Fungi appeared.  I am sure the Minister, as a fellow Clare person, would share the traditional superstitions of Clare with me.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelly made a fine contribution on the variety of whales that exist and their migratory, feeding and mating patterns.  She also elaborated on the beauty of these mammals and the importance of preserving and protecting them.  Senator Henry also gave a fine contribution and referred in particular to the importance of research and how it could be assisted by research being done currently in various universities and institutions in Ireland.  I am delighted that the Minister has taken the opportunity this evening to announce that an additional marine biologist is to be employed in his Department to assist the wildlife section.  That is highly commendable and I welcome that announcement.</P>
    <P>Senator Kiely gave us a full report of what the Kerry lads did in Ballyheige with the beached whale.  In true Kerry fashion, they used it to its full advantage and potential and I presume that on my next visit to Ballyheige I will see a stuffed whale as a tourist attraction.  It shows how the local community can respond to any given situation and must be commended.</P>
    <P>I fully understand and share the Minister's view that it is more complicated to bring nations along with you and it is easy to condemn.  There is no better person than the Minister to use his brilliant flow of language and linguistic skills to convince the international delegates who will come to Dublin of alternative and better paths for the future. We will rest our case with the Minister and leave it in his capable and competent hands to bring to the international community.  We have full confidence that he will do that successfully, bearing in mind that a strong conservation line will underline all his contributions at that conference.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1160" /> Patience is required to convince people to change their tactics.  Nevertheless, as Senator Norris said, there also has to be a little sting in the tail and an element of sanction is necessary.  I thank the Minister for promising to convey the views expressed here this evening.  They include the view that there is a need for some sanctions against those whalers using extraordinarily forceful tactics on the whaling population.  We welcome the Minister's announcement that he will bring the views of this House to the Danish Government and Faroese Government and we will depend on him to use his full powers of persuasion.</P>
    <P>I welcome particularly the Minister's announcement that catch quotas will not be set for certain stocks because there are still key concerns to be satisfied on necessary safeguards.  These include an inspection and observation scheme, data reporting and monitoring. The issue of humane killing must also be addressed.  The Minister reiterated that Ireland's position on whaling has been pro-conservation, one based on scientific evidence and in line with the principles of sustainable development.  I note the Minister did not go into great detail on sustainable development and I appreciate the delicacies, various patterns and different cultures involved. However, we will depend on the Minister to elaborate as he sees fit when he presents our arguments.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris dealt in detail with the situation in Norway, which had not been addressed by other Senators.  The advertisement in <i>The Irish Times</i> today clearly states the entire case of Norway. It is on the public record and deserves full support.  I thank Senators Honan and Byrne for their contributions.  I am delighted that our commissioner, Michael Canny, is here to hear the views of the Senators and I wish him well as our member of the whaling commission. I am also delighted to see in the Visitor's Gallery, Fergus O'Gorman, Brendan Burgess and Jennifer Lonsdale.  It has been a worthwhile debate and I thank all the Senators for their support.  I am delighted this is <Col N="1161" /> going through the House without a division.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for allowing me to raise this issue.  I wish the Cathaoirleach a speedy recovery and I appreciate the Minister's presence in the House.</P>
      <P>At a recent meeting of South Tipperary County Council a detailed discussion took place on the Abattoirs Act, 1988, and in particular on the cost of operating meat inspection procedures as required by the regulations.  Arising from those discussions I am raising this urgent matter on the Adjournment.  I would like to outline the council's response to the requirements of the Abattoirs Act, 1988, and the regulations made thereunder.</P>
      <P>Since the introduction of the legislation dealing with meat inspection, South Tipperary County Council has taken a responsible approach to its operation notwithstanding the high costs involved.  The present staff complement for the operation of the legislation is as follows: one permanent, fulltime county veterinary officer; two wholetime, temporary veterinary surgeons; and one part-time, temporary veterinary surgeon.  These vets are mainly engaged in the operation of the abattoir regulations, particularly in carrying out ante and post-mortem inspections and fixing stamps to the meat.  The estimated cost of the scheme's operation this year is £166,000 and the estimated receipts for fees total £35,000.  Therefore, the net cost to the council of operating this scheme is estimated at £131,000 for 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1162" /> That is quite a lot of money, given the scarce resources available to most local authorities and it is a burden that no council should have to carry, even though I am well aware that the purpose of these regulations is to ensure proper public health standards in abattoirs and family butchers' slaughterhouses.  It is expected that the most recent increase in fees provided for under the European Communities (Fees for Health Inspection and Control of Fresh Meat) Regulations, 1995, will generate additional revenue to the council to the value of £1,600 this year, thus giving rise to a revised shortfall of approximately £129,000.</P>
    <P>When this EC Directive, along with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry regulations, came into force in 1988, it was supposed to be operated by all local authorities and other bodies responsible for dealing with meat.  To date, however, only five authorities are operating the scheme. South Tipperary operates the scheme to the letter of the law but the other four are operating it partially.  This results in an unfair playing field for family butchers, who have to compete with people in the Border counties who can get their cattle slaughtered more cheaply.  The old saying has it that &ldquo;Tipperary leads and Ireland follows&rdquo;, but I do not want to see the family butchers of south Tipperary, or the council, being martyrs for the cause.</P>
    <P>Since we joined the European Union we have gone stark raving mad over the reams of regulations that have been introduced.  Under successive Governments, EU regulations have become a growing industry.  Our implementation of every regulation to the letter of the law has cost many jobs and much money to individuals.  Members of South Tipperary County Council noted that the 1995 regulations, referred to above, also made provision for the imposition of a levy on abattoir owners to recover the difference between the cost of operating the service and the amount realised from fees.  There are 28 abattoir owners in south Tipperary and if the levy was <Col N="1163" /> applied to recover the shortfall it would increase the existing fees payment fivefold in 1996.  In other words, it would put all the family butchers out of business. Whether a family business is a public house, a small grocery or a butcher's shop, were it not for the unpaid labour undertaken by family members, many would have gone out of business long ago.  That would be a sad day for Ireland.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will look sympathetically at this problem, which has serious implications for abattoir owners in south Tipperary.  Council members felt that the proposal to allow local authorities to apply a levy on abattoir owners would prove difficult to operate in view of the level of charge required. Naturally, there would be resistance and people would drop out of the scheme, causing all kinds of problems.  Council members also felt that with costs increasing each year, there is no guarantee that this council will be in a position to continue the same level of inspections in future, particularly with its funds cut in other areas such as roads.</P>
    <P>In view of the impact that any additional levy could have on abattoirs &mdash; and by that I mean family butchers' domestic abattoirs &mdash; council members have suggested the following alternatives: (a) The shortfall in the cost of operating the scheme should be met by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry; (b) an adequate subsidy should be provided to abattoir operators by the Department to offset all or part of the proposed levy; or (c) responsibility for the operation of the scheme should be taken up directly by the Department.  Regardless of whether the scheme is taken up by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry alone or together with the Department of Health, this additional burden should not be imposed on any local authority or family business.  My primary concern is to protect the family butcher who is obliged to operate this scheme at enormous cost, as well as protecting the local <Col N="1164" /> authority from shouldering the financial burden of operating the scheme.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to clarify the matter urgently.  I have brought the issue to the attention of MEPs, who have raised it in the European Parliament. It has also been discussed by the European Commission, which proposes to relax the strict rules for small-scale slaughterhouses.  These regulations have already been criticised for being too bureaucratic and for sending many family businesses to the wall because they could not afford to comply.</P>
    <P>Despite the overzealous application of the rules, they have been blatantly ignored in certain counties here as well as in other EU countries.  In holy Ireland we are crucifying people who have reasonably high standards and are trying to put them out of business. There should be a little more cop on in all Departments and, within reason, we should not go overboard.</P>
    <P>A group of EU inspectors recently arrived, unannounced, from Greece of all places.  They went around the south of Ireland visiting meat factories and family butchers.  The report they sent back was terrible.  We all know the standard of food in their country &mdash; you would want to watch what you eat there.  There is no level playing pitch with regard to standards.  I made inquiries at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry last week about the Commission's intentions and they did not know what I was talking about.</P>

      <P>Thank you.  It is the intention of the Commission to ease the rules <Col N="1165" /> for small slaughter houses and to adopt a more flexible approach according to the needs of member states.  I ask the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to make an urgent statement on this issue and to act immediately in the national interest.  Only five counties are operating the scheme, four are partially operating it and south Tipperary is operating it in full.  That is a burden for the families and local authorities concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Byrne for raising this important issue.  Section 44 of the Abattoirs Act, 1988, prescribed the fees payable to local authorities by abattoir licence holders in respect of animals slaughtered at domestic abattoirs.  The Act provided that the Minister may by regulations vary these fees, provided a draft of the regulations was laid before each House of the Oireachtas and a resolution was passed by each such House approving the draft.</P>
      <P>Since this enactment an EU Directive was adopted extending the rules previously applicable to the production of meat at export plants to all meat produced in the community, including small domestic abattoirs.  As EU law supersedes national law, regulations had to be introduced under the European Communities Act, 1972, to implement the directive, which amends charges previously applicable to premises licenced under the Agricultural Produce (Fresh Meat) Act, 1930, the Pigs and Bacon Act, 1935 and the Abattoirs Act, 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The latest regulations &mdash; European Communities (Fees for Health Inspections and Controls of Fresh Meat) Regulations, 1995 &mdash; give effect to Council Directive 93/118/EEC and revise the standard fee rates in respect of animals slaughtered as follows: cattle, £3.78 per head; sheep, £0.40 per head; and pigs, £1.03 per head.  The directive also includes a provision which allows member states to impose charges to recover the full cost of providing the veterinary inspection service to individual <Col N="1166" /> plants.  A provision was therefore included in the national legislation for charging the real inspection cost rather than the standard fee to a licence holder if desired.</P>
    <P>Under section 35 of the Abattoirs Act, the onus is on local authorities to carry out veterinary inspections of animals and meat in accordance with the Abattoirs Act, 1988 (Veterinary Examination) Regulations, 1992 and Abattoirs (Health Mark) Regulations, 1992, which implement EU legislation on the inspection of animals and meat. There can be no relaxation of the inspections required under EU legislation. It is therefore at the discretion of county managers whether to impose charges on licence holders which reflect the real cost of providing veterinary inspection service at individual abattoirs. That is the legal situation resulting from EU law, but I understand that county managers will seek to go down that road.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for Justice to the House and I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this important matter on the Adjournment. It is a matter of which the Minister is fully aware.  I hope she and her Government colleagues will be able to respond positively.  I am aware of their concern about urban crime.</P>
      <P>I raise this matter following the RGDATA survey, which paints a bleak and disturbing picture.  There is no doubt that action must be taken.  As a result of greater security in the premises of banks, building societies and other places which were the targets of old for robberies, the gangs &mdash; often Dublin based &mdash; and individual thieves have switched their attacks to smaller suburban groceries and business premises where sums of money are held.  We must respond quickly to meet this challenge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will be aware of the many vicious attacks on shopkeepers and their staff, both young and old. <Col N="1167" /> Vicious assaults and muggings have resulted in serious injuries, people being hospitalised and even fatalities.  The attacks appear to be focused more on the suburbs and on areas which are probably more difficult to police.  There is no immediate and complete solution to this problem.  The Minister and her colleagues as well as the Garda Síochána have sought to address the problem. I hope that she will meet, if she has not done so already, members of RGDATA to hear about their concerns and the state of fear in which they live.  This fear also affects ordinary individuals.  One need only reflect on last night's headline in the <i>Evening Herald</i> which spoke of a vicious attack on a woman in her eighties. The thieves took her hearing aid. These attacks, particularly on the old, are becoming more vicious and cowardly. We have also seen these so-called Dublin gangs involved in abductions and kidnappings.  There is probably a drug related aspect to some of those crimes.</P>
    <P>It is important that we tackle this problem.  That will not be easy. Obviously, other elements must be involved.  The Minister made some positive suggestions about the bail laws.  I hope there will be a ready response, because these times are different from 30 years ago when important decisions were handed down by the courts.  There is also the ongoing question of insurance costs, which add to the problems of people who are running small businesses and operating on reasonably small profit margins.  They cannot afford the services of security firms.  Obviously, they can take certain precautions which are valuable.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;Crimeline&rdquo; programme, which is shown on television on the first Monday of each month, reports on the vicious crimes being carried out by vicious individuals in society.  I hope for the Minister's total commitment to eradicating this problem.  I hope she will discuss it with the Garda Síochána and, whether or not she decides on a task force to respond to the problem, I hope <Col N="1168" /> she will not be found wanting.  The Minister is well aware of the situation as there have been unfortunate incidents in her own constituency.  It is important that this House signals our abhorrence of this situation and our willingness to tackle it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Cosgrave for raising this issue.  The question of establishing a task force on violent crime in shops was one of the many issues raised at a meeting I had with representatives of RGDATA on 12 May.  At that meeting I received a copy of the organisation's report <i>Violence in Shops</i> which was compiled over the past two years.  There is genuine concern about the level of crime and the Government regards it as unacceptable that people going about their lawful business should be subject to attack by criminals.  I have discussed with the Garda Commissioner the findings of the report and the adoption of an innovative and comprehensive approach to tackling the crime problem.</P>
      <P>Without in any way minimising the information in the RGDATA report, the Garda have given me some figures today from 1993 and 1994 in relation to attacks and burglaries in the retail outlets throughout the country.  I will be coming back to that issue with the Garda.  The figures the Garda have given are somewhat different to those in the RGDATA report.  That is not to minimise the awfulness of being subject to attack when going about one's business.</P>
      <P>There are approximately 30,000 retail outlets.  In 1993 4 per cent of those outlets were subject to burglaries; that is 1,137 premises.  In 1994 the figure was slightly down to 3 per cent, or 1,006 burglaries. There is some conflict in the figures in the report and the recorded figures for burglaries in shops.  I recognise there will always be burglaries that will not be reported, although most business premises have to report crime for insurance purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I requested from the Garda Commissioner his views on setting up a task <Col N="1169" /> force under his guidance.  When these views become known to me I will take up the matter again with RGDATA. The Commissioner also confirmed that the Garda are taking strong action to address the increasing level of attacks on shops.  They report a number of successful arrests of culprits in the past few months particularly.  It is important to note there is probably a small number of people responsible for a great number of the burglaries that take place. Many of them have already been arrested, will serve a sentence, come out of prison and, unfortunately, get back into the same crime.  When successful arrests are made and people are put away, one sees an instant drop in the number of crimes committed.  It is important that those people serve a full sentence and stay in prison for its duration.</P>
    <P>It has already been agreed this year to provide £413 million for the Garda &mdash; the highest amount ever.  The allocation of an amount of this magnitude will be of assistance to the Garda in the fight against crime by enabling the following measures to be taken: the recruitment of 1,050 gardaí during the next three years; implementation of an information technology plan for the Garda Síochána and the upgrading of the Garda communications network; installation of closed circuit television cameras to combat crime in certain areas &mdash; they have already been introduced in the Temple Bar area of Dublin; further development of community based measures in areas of disadvantage &mdash; I recently announced another such community based measure in the Blanchardstown area in Dublin in which we hope to bring on board a number of youths who would, perhaps, otherwise find their way into lives of crime; measures to combat serious fraud, including the implementation of certain non-legal proposals of the Government's advisory committee on fraud.</P>
    <P>In addition, there are approximately 700 clerical civilian staff employed in the Garda Síochána at present. Additional funding is being provided <Col N="1170" /> this year, next year and in 1997 to employ a further 200 civilian staff in the Garda Síochána.  All of these civilians will replace gardaí on a one for one basis, releasing them from administrative duties to perform police work for which they were specially selected and trained.  This will lead to a substantial increase in the operational strength of the force.</P>
    <P>Adding new gardaí by recruitment is one way to increase the strength of the Garda.  Another way is to increase the operational strength by releasing gardaí from jobs that are important but are not what citizens consider police work. When calculations are made of the number of gardaí available now compared to other years, they should not forget that more gardaí are doing more operational work and fewer gardaí doing office work that can be done by civilians.</P>
    <P>It is unacceptable that any group, such as the people RGDATA has highlighted, should be exposed to such attacks.  The Garda authorities and I are determined to continue to do everything in our power to effectively deal with these attacks.</P>

      <P>A recent planning application to Laois County Council by the ESB for the removal of asbestos waste buried in the grounds of a power station and the removal of asbestos contained in the buildings prior to its ultimate removal to an approved site has raised serious concerns among people in the Portarlington area.  The main concern is that Portarlington will be used as a permanent dumping site for this asbestos. The ESB has stated that this is the beginning of the complete removal process, but the ESB's licence to transfer waste to a firm in Germany expires in March and this has raised considerable concern.  The process involving the present planning application lodged, the possibility of an appeal and the examination of an environmental impact study <Col N="1171" /> also lodged could not possibly be completed before March 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I call on the ESB to remove immediately to an approved site the asbestos currently held in bags on the site.  This would reassure the people of the town of the ESB's ultimate intentions. People's fears have grown due to the long delay in solving the problem there. The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, the ESB, the county council, public representatives and the people of the area would like to see a satisfactory conclusion to this problem. <Col N="1172" /> Many questions need to be answered before the public is satisfied this is the case.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications is ultimately responsible for the actions of the ESB, I call on him to ensure it begins immediately to remove the asbestos from the site in Portarlington.  Otherwise, the sincerity of its intentions must be open to question.</P>
