      <P>I have notice from Senator Mooney that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine to clarify the current position of the angling tourism allocation under the Operational Programme 1994-1999; indicating the amount of money expended and the areas to which it was allocated under this programme and the steps he is taking to implement the recommendations of the Shannon Fisheries Board, Bord Fáilte, the Lough Allen Angling Club and all tourist interests in County Leitrim that funds be provided for access roads to Lough Allen.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Cassidy of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to provide two new prefabs at Fore national school, County Westmeath, to cater for the urgent additional needs of this school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senator Mooney and Senator Cassidy as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and <Col N="1166" /> they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Order of" RHead="Business">
    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is items 1, 2, 3, 4 and 15, motions 21 and 16.  Item 1 will be taken immediately and will be followed by item 2, Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill, 1995 &mdash; Committee and Final Stages.  Item 3 will not commence before 2 p.m., on the assumption that item 2 has been completed. If item 2 is not completed at 2 p.m., item 3 will start immediately on its completion.  Item 4, Powers of Attorney Bill, 1995, will be debated for one hour on Second Stage and it is not expected that Second Stage will be completed today.  Item 15, motion 21, will commence not earlier than 3.30 p.m.  It may commence later, depending on how business is running.</P>
      <P>I am proposing to allocate one hour for item 15, motion 21, with seven minutes for the principal speaker and five minutes for speakers thereafter, but I am flexible on that.  If the Whips feel there is a need for more than one hour and there are more speakers offering, we can extend that time by up to an hour, as necessary.  I gave a commitment previously on item 15, motion 16, and had forgotten about it.  It is a motion upon which all sides of the House can agree and we will allocate ten minutes to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader for the extensive Order of Business and in particular for item 15, motion 21.  As he will be aware, this side of the House has highlighted this problem on the Order of Business for the last few weeks.  Will there be a Minister present to outline the Government position on this issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome that.  I also welcome the fact that, if there are more speakers, the Leader will be flexible, with the agreement of the House.  Is <Col N="1167" /> item 15, motion 16, being taken without debate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>It was meant to be, but Senator Norris would like ten minutes to explain what it involves, if that is agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to consider whether we should go into total recess for three months. Many things may occur during such a long period and we are sending a specific message to the rest of the world.  Let us take one instance which is concerning so many people around the world at the moment &mdash; Bosnia.  Two world wars started during summer months.  We should not set an example by taking a three month recess.  I am not suggesting we should come back on a regular basis, but perhaps the Leader could consider this issue, particularly because of what is happening in Bosnia and because of the call I made here last week to urge our Minister for Foreign Affairs to urge other nations to consider military intervention when necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a debate on that last Friday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes but we will go into recess for that length of time and things are moving so fast in Bosnia.  The Leader should seriously reconsider that question of reconvening the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Quinn has a point and I am sure that the Leader would take the view that, if there was a matter of significant gravity during the recess, he would consider reconvening and the case Senator Quinn instanced would merit possible further discussion. While the Cathaoirleach has rightly remarked that we did discuss it last week, events are changing at such a pace that it would be important, particularly given our membership of the European Union and the UN, that we continue to raise our voices to defend life and human rights in Bosnia.  I am <Col N="1168" /> sure the Leader will take that on board and, if necessary, reconvene the House.</P>
      <P>The Leader will be relieved to hear that I am not going to launch into a diatribe as to why we have the Consumer Credit Bill, 1994, back with us once again.  I will leave that for when we debate the matter.  It is a very unsatisfactory way to do business.  There have been far too many amendments.  The Bill should have been redrafted and brought back because we would then have had far less work to do on it.  I was not clear about item 1; I assume we are taking it without debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Bureaucracy is alive and well in this country and it does not matter which party representative is sitting in the Leader's chair.  During this session I said some harsh words about the flooding problem, particularly in south Galway.  Everything I said has turned out to be true.  It is no reflection on the Minister.  It is frustrating that despite all the promises made &mdash; it shows how irrelevant this House and indeed the Oireachtas are &mdash; no Government money has been paid to the householders in south Galway.  No work has taken place despite the promise that work would commence during the summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Senator's deep interest in this matter but it does not arise on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that and I will conclude.  No consultants have started work yet.  At a time when we profess to have a modern high-tech economy, it is a tragedy that bureaucracy should treat people this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a matter for the Order of Business; there are other ways in which to raise it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader that, when we resume in autumn, we will continue the debate on education, particularly the responses to the White Paper. <Col N="1169" /> Many people wonder about the direction in which the educational process is moving.  It would be opportune to discuss education as soon as possible after the recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>On a number of occasions I raised with the Leader the serious decline in county roads.  He indicated that the Minister for the Environment had some proposals to deal with the matter and was about to make some announcements.  At this stage the county councils are in a state of crisis and are laying off staff.  Some of the roads in the most scenic parts of the country, including west Clare, are impassable and tourists are flocking into areas where the road structure has broken down.  Can we have some indication before the recess whether the Minister intends to do anything about it or if there is any prospect that he may provide additional finances for the local authorities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, it is a pleasure to address you properly for the first time as Cathaoirleach.  The last time I did so I was simply anticipating events.  I thank the Leader for making provision for taking a brief note of the report on the AIDS meeting in Barcelona. It is important that the text goes on the record and that is all I seek to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I concur with my friend and colleague, Senator Quinn, about the need for us to be ready to reconvene should there be a further serious escalation in Bosnia.  The House will be aware that the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs is meeting at 4 p.m. and Bosnia will be the principal item on its agenda.  I hope we will not use the occasion for sentimental evasion of reality by simply dealing with humanitarian aid and war crime commissions because it is far, more serious than that.  I said in the House and at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs when the safe havens were established that they would turn out to be a cruel deception, and that is what has happened.  I find it astonishing and <Col N="1170" /> repulsive, although understandable in human terms that troops which have been committed as peacekeepers to monitor the safe haven should now have representatives of the United Nations saying their primary objective is to save their own skins.  How can that be the primary objective of peacekeepers who are supposed to protect the civilian population?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot discuss this matter any further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader for including item 15, motion 21, on the agenda today and ask if I will have seven minutes to speak on the psychiatric services.  I also support what Senator Quinn and Senator Norris said about Bosnia.  Since we will not be meeting for some time we should ask the Leader if the Tánaiste would speak out strongly on the Serbian atrocities and, through our European partners, actively support action as proposed by France.  Humanitarian aid is also important and we should indicate our willingness to take more Bosnian refugees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The French are completely cynical and their proposal means nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to convey my sympathy to the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, who is doing her best to come to grips with crime and drugs but is being stifled by the Government. Her proposals for a jail in Castlerea, to change the bail laws and for seven days detention have all been rejected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not discussing that; it does not arise on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there a conspiracy within the Government to aid and abet <Col N="1171" /> criminals?  That seems to be what is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>That is uncalled for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I, clearly, without qualification, support the request of Senator Quinn and other colleagues that the House be available to debate not only Bosnia but other issues which are now of burning concern to the people.  I took part in the debate on Bosnia and we were anxious the Minister would report to us and use the debate to make the case we felt should be made.  We should now receive that report.</P>
      <P>There are a number of major issues on which this House has also expressed a responsible, mature and reasonable political attitude and we should at least be here to discuss them.  Bosnia is clearly one of these.  The drugs issue is another; the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen would be reassured by the support she would receive from us for the crackdown on the drug barons and we should give her the opportunity to come here.  The third such issue is Northern Ireland; I am my party's spokesperson on that subject and we have always taken a responsible position. The matter is in abeyance at present and this House should be available to speak on behalf of the Irish people, as this is the only House sitting.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to convey these suggestions to the Government, who will find us more supportive than obstructive.  It is important that these issues would be fully discussed in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader for arranging to take item 15, motion 21 today.  Since the Minister for Health will be in the House, I ask the Leader to arrange to make an additional five minutes available so that he may respond to a problem in my constituency, which is that over 150 women in the Blanchardstown area are being <Col N="1172" /> refused access to comprehensive family planning services because a GMS doctor has said she will not prescribe the contraceptive pill for her patients, although she did so for 13 years.  I wrote to the Minister about this two months ago and received a one-line acknowledgement but nothing else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not discussing that issue today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>During those two months there may have been many unplanned pregnancies due to lack of family planning services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is hardly due to a lack of condoms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>It usually is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be due to a lack of responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>Another women's health problem is that the breast screening clinic in Eccles Street is closed and will not take appointments until after 8 August.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Some weeks ago I asked the Leader to organise a debate on emigration and related issues.  He responded graciously and agreed in principle to hold such a debate but indicated time constraints might preclude having it before the end of the session. I would be grateful if he would initiate such a debate at the earliest opportunity. Could he also comment on reports that the Cabinet is about to publish draft proposals for the creation of three Seanad seats for emigrants &mdash; which was part of the Programme for Government &mdash; and that these proposals will come before the Cabinet in the next two weeks, during the summer recess?  There is also a strong indication that the referendum required to create these three seats will take place on the same day as the divorce referendum, which is not helpful either for the divorce referendum or the issue of emigrant <Col N="1173" /> rights.  I am concerned by these reports and I would be grateful if the Leader could convey to the Government the importance of debating the issue of emigrant rights and of these Seanad seats rather than having them lost in the more dominant debate that will take place on the divorce issue.  Can the Leader organise a debate as soon as we return after the summer recess?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>While we in Ireland have a tremendous reputation for raising humanitarian aid for all sorts of emergencies abroad, we will have to do far more than that now given the situation in Bosnia.  When the United Nations protection force went into the former Yugoslavia they had a mandate to protect the Bosnians.  Can the Leader find out what the Minister for Foreign Affairs meant when he said that the UN Secretary General must use all the resources available to him to restore the status of the safe area of Srebrenica?  As that comment was made a few days ago we should now include Goradze and Tuzla also.  We need to know more definitely what exactly he meant by that, in view of the fact that the mandate of the UN was to protect the Bosnians which it patently is not doing at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This House should express its thanks to the Minister for Justice for her efforts to tackle the major problem of drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We wanted to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that there have been a number of important meetings and I am satisfied that she will achieve positive results in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to raise the issue of French nuclear testing which has been raised before on a number of occasions.  The French propose carrying out not just one but a number of such tests.  Our Government and other member states of the European Union, as well as the <Col N="1174" /> Governments of Australia and New Zealand, have condemned the resumption of these tests.  This House passed a resolution outlining our objections to them.  I presume that the French Ambassador has been contacted and, if so, I would like to know what was the outcome.  What results have we achieved?  The real fear I have is that once the French Government commences these tests other governments will pursue the same course.  It is a serious matter for everybody.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader of the House for arranging the debate on item 15, motion 21.  Over the past few weeks I have been seeking a debate on health and while this is not a broad debate it deals with a particular problem that is of public concern.</P>
      <P>Senator Fahey raised a matter concerning compensation for flooding.  I understand that no local authorities have been reimbursed for work on flooded areas nor has any money been paid to them for the alleviation of flooding in future.  Each local authority, including our own, has made a submission to the Minister, yet no response has been forthcoming.  Can the Leader find out if any money will be paid to the local authorities which are strapped for cash?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>You are supporting the question raised by Senator Daly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  Last week I raised with the Leader the question of grants for the control of farmyard pollution. However, when he responded he did not mention those grants nor did he say if he would bring the matter to the attention of the Minister.  I raise it again today because it is a matter of grave public concern that those grants have been suspended.  There seems to be a contradiction in the fact that the Minister for the Environment is introducing a Waste Bill, which is an anti-pollution measure, while the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry has removed <Col N="1175" /> grants for the control of farmyard pollution. Can the Leader convey to the Minister the grave concern among the farming community about this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the debate on item 15, motion 21, and compliment the Leader of the House for arranging it.  It is a good example of the Seanad being used to deal with something which is timely and is causing a great deal of concern. Will the Leader of the House impress upon a Minister the will of this House?  The issue I raise is the matter of Clonmannon.  It comes before the High Court on Friday next and a number of us have sworn affidavits in regard to it. The Minister for Enterprise and Employment, who has indicated his and the Government's concerns in this House, has a confidential document which was produced on examination under section 19 of the Companies Act. Will the Leader of the House approach the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, and ask him to make that document available to the High Court on Friday so that the High Court can fully consider all of the issues relating to the receivership?  I welcome the appointment of an interim receiver last Friday.</P>
      <P>In regard to the issue touched on by Senator Finneran, there is a link between fish kills and farm pollution. The problem here is that the farm pollution scheme is effectively in abeyance. Will the Leader express the concerns of Members to the appropriate Ministers that undoubtedly as the summer progresses, the Government's inaction on the control of farm pollution grants will cause further fish kills, which none of us wish to see?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I know we do not have much time to discuss what I want to bring up but will the Leader of the House convey our deep concern at figures released yesterday from Bord Fáilte showing a reduction of 8 per cent in the tourism traffic at Shannon Airport. This spells disaster for the west, the midlands and the south-west.  In <Col N="1176" /> view of the grave concern it is causing throughout the tourism industry and because there is no time to debate the matter here, will the Leader bring it to the attention of the Minister who is a native of the west and ask him to take remedial action, even at this late stage? A reduction of 8 per cent is a colossal one in tourism coming into Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the calls by various Senators for the recall of the House in the event of circumstances requiring it.  The first day of September is a very historic day and we should be recalled at some stage to discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.  This process is slowing down and this House would not do itself justice if it did not reconvene between now and the official reconvening to discuss the matter.</P>
      <P>I too sympathise with the Minister for Justice.  In future, instead of her publishing details to the Cabinet, she should bring them to this House first, because there is more agreement in this House than there is at Cabinet.  I ask the Leader to convey to the Minister for Justice our wholehearted support for her endeavours to ensure that crime and law and order&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope so but the rest of her Cabinet colleagues do not understand what she is trying to do, so I assure her that she has the support of the vast majority of people in this House in ensuring that crime and law and order is at the top of the agenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated some time ago.  There have been many calls from Senators for a debate on agriculture. Agriculture is in crisis with the vets' dispute and the suspension of the control of farm pollution scheme which was already referred to.  As Senator Finneran said, when the Leader was replying to the questions raised on the Order of Business he ignored the issue of agriculture. <Col N="1177" /> I imagine this was not deliberate; I am sure it was an oversight.</P>
      <P>I concur with Senator Fahey in regard to flooding.  It has been some time since the Arterial Drainage (Amendment) Act was passed, and many schemes on the priority list given were to be undertaken immediately.  Has the Leader any information whether any of these schemes have been started or will we have to wait for more flooding? August is nearly here and action will have to be taken fairly soon.</P>
      <P>Another point, which was raised last week by Senator Fitzgerald, relates to the facilities in this House.  I appreciate and cherish the facility of having newspapers available in the Library and it is disgraceful that they are taken away.</P>

      <P>A number of points were raised on the Order of Business.  On Senator Quinn's point in relation to the Seanad going into recess until the autumn, that is not the case.  This House is adjourning <i>sine die.</i>  That means we can be recalled at short notice at any time without a fixed date.</P>
      <P>On Bosnia and on a point raised by another speaker about the French nuclear testing, we have had two debates in this House on these issues. We had a debate last week on Bosnia, when the Minister came into the House at short notice, and I must say there were very few people offering after the great entreaties on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Committee on Procedure and Privileges and the House will keep an eye on developments.  We are in a position to come back at very short notice should circumstances warrant it.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges will be meeting by agreement quite frequently <Col N="1179" /> during the summer to keep matters under review.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis again raised the Consumer Credit Bill, 1994.  I happen to agree with him that there are some times when it is better to go back to the drawing board, but we did not.  The Bill is now as near good as it can be and is at completion stage so I appeal to the Senator for his continuing co-operation and a positive approach to it later today.</P>
    <P>Senator Fahey raised a point about which I am concerned.  I will speak to him afterwards.  Senator McDonagh raised the question of an education debate in the early days of the next session. That will take place.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly has consistently raised the question of county roads.  I am informed that there is a major package in preparation.  It is not ready yet.  I had hoped to come to the Senator with information but I did not have it.  I did not overlook the points he made so consistently.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy raised the point, and I agree with him, that we will be in a position to come back urgently should that be thought useful.</P>
    <P>On the health matters raised by Senator McGennis, while each is important, I do not think either is appropriate to the focused debate which we are having today.  The Minister will be present and, no doubt, you can raise the issues with him.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney raised the question of emigration.  I am not aware of any draft proposals.  That does not mean they do not exist, but I am not aware of them.  I will make inquiries.  It would be worthwhile to have a fairly serious debate on the whole question of emigrant representation fairly early in new session and that will be done.</P>
    <P>I will refer Senator Henry's query to the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I join Senator Enright in expressing my total confidence in the Minister for Justice and in her ability to lead the fight against drugs.  The Cabinet is totally behind the Minister, and I will convey&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This will greatly hearten her and I thank Senators on the other side of the House for their support for the Minister and the Government on this matter.</P>
      <P>Senator Finneran and Senator Kiely raised the issue of farmyard pollution. We should have spent more time debating agriculture this session and I will endeavour to arrange a major debate on agriculture and the issues raised next session.</P>
      <P>As the Minister will attend the House today, Senator Roche can raise his issue again.  However, now that it is in the legal arena, I do not believe it is appropriate for debate.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Senator Brian Mullooly be elected Leas-Chathaoirleach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have great pleasure, as leader of the Fianna Fáil Party in the Seanad, to propose Senator Mullooly for the <Col N="1181" /> important position of Leas-Chathaoirleach. Senator Mullooly will bring to the position a great wealth of experience. He has served on his local authority in County Roscommon since 1974 and had the distinction of being its chairman for six years.  He is a former member of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body. Since his election to the Seanad in 1981 he has been our spokesperson on Education.</P>
    <P>Over the last number of years I have seen at first hand, in his role as Fianna Fáil Chief Whip, as the Government Chief Whip and in his membership of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, his dedication and total commitment to the House, and like you, Sir, his absolute commitment to further reform of the Seanad.  For these reasons, Senator Mullooly is well qualified for the position of Leas-Chathaoirleach and I so commend his name to the House.</P>

      <P>Cuidím leis an tairiscint atá molta ag an Seanadóir Wright go dtoghfar an Seanadóir Brian Mullooly mar Leas-Chathaoirleach ar Sheanad Éireann.  I second the proposal by Senator Wright that Senator Mullooly be elected as Leas-Chathaoirleach of Seanad Éireann.</P>
      <P>I have known Senator Mullooly since his election to Seanad Éireann in 1981. I shared an office with him on two occasions, the first approximately five or six years ago and, more recently, the office which Senator Wright, Senator Mullooly and I shared as Leader of the House, Chief Whip and Assistant Whip respectively.</P>
      <P>I was Assistant Whip to Senator Mullooly in and out of Government.  There is no harder worker for his constituency, the country and the Seanad in pursuing local, national and international problems. He is also totally loyal to his party, Fianna Fáil, of which he has been a member all his life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Wright outlined, Senator Mullooly has held numerous positions in his political life and before he entered politics.  He is respected by every Member and held in high esteem by his electorate. <Col N="1182" /> It gives me great pleasure to second the proposal.</P>
    <P>Question, &ldquo;That Senator Brian Mullooly be elected Leas-Chathaoirleach&rdquo;, put and agreed to.</P>

I endorse the comments of his proposer and seconder.  I have known Senator Mullooly for 21 years as we were both elected to Roscommon County Council in June 1981.  He held the chairmanship of Roscommon County Council for an unbroken period of six years which indicates the high respect in which his county council colleagues hold him.  It will be a pleasure to work with Senator Mullooly.  He is very able for the position of Leas-Chathaoirleach and I send every good wish to him, his wife Nancy and family.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Government Senators I congratulate Senator Mullooly on his election as Leas-Chathaoirleach, he brings all the essential qualities to that office.  He is a person of his word; in all our dealings with him as Fianna Fáil Chief Whip when he gave his word a deal done was a deal kept.  He was always very straight in his dealings with us.</P>
      <P>We have no doubt he will display the utmost impartiality and uphold the high standards of fairness which attach to the Chair of this House.  He has a great respect for this House, its potential and what it stands for, and he will be a custodian of these traditions as Leas-Chathaoirleach. On behalf of the Government Members I extend our warmest congratulations to him and assure him of our full co-operation in carrying out his onerous responsibilities. We are conscious of the great honour bestowed upon him.</P>

Senator Mullooly has been a Member of this House for longer than I and I have always found him to be a man of courtesy, decency and intelligence.  He is, of course, a strong and committed Fianna Fáil supporter.  However, he has never been partisan and that is an important quality, particularly in this House.  His qualities of decency, sensitivity, balance, tolerance and intelligence will adorn the office of Leas-Chathaoirleach.  We can look forward to a fruitful session starting in the autumn with two Roscommon people in positions of eminence in the House.</P>

I look forward to working and co-operating with him.  He will bring excellent qualities to bear in his chairmanship of the Seanad.</P>
      <P>I commiserate with the defeated candidates. I am pleased I was not forced to make a choice between them &mdash; that was a matter for the Fianna Fáil Members.  The defeated candidates did not have a hope as Senator Mullooly is from Roscommon and the offices of Cathaoirleach and Leas-Chathaoirleach seem to be in the permanent custody of Roscommon Members.  That does not detract from the qualities of the present incumbents.  Senator Mullooly has our congratulations; he will have our co-operation and we look forward to working with him.</P>

It is a great honour for him and his family, particularly his wife, Nancy.  The qualities he has shown all through his political life will aid him in the position of Leas-Chathaoirleach.

History will record that at 12.10 p.m. on 19 July Senator Brian Mullooly was unanimously elected Leas-Chathaoirleach by Seanad Éireann.  We will miss him as a great Whip.  He is an understanding man whom we have all come to like and love. His great qualities will stand to him in his new position.  It is great to see him being acknowledged here as a person of <Col N="1185" /> great ability.  He has been a Member of this House since 1981.  It is a great day for his family, for Strokestown and for Roscommon.  I congratulate him and wish him many years of hard work in his position.  We look forward to working with him.</P>

      <P>Drumshanbo, from where I come, is one mile from the Roscommon border.  It is perhaps not widely known that my part of County Leitrim was, for some years, part of the Roscommon-Leitrim constituency.  It was at that time that I first came to know Senator Mullooly as an officer of the Comhairle Dáil Ceanntair, so our relationship goes back quite a long way. I am absolutely delighted that he now joins you, a Chathaoirligh, in a high office in the Seanad.  Perhaps that is only correct because, as history has shown, the traditional home of the kings and queens of Connaught was County Roscommon.  The legacy of that particular form of government is that County Roscommon now rules the Seanad.  I know that the Cathaoirleach and Leas-Chathaoirleach will continue to give the kind of service we have come to expect by bringing the important element of a personal touch to both offices.  I wish them both well, particularly my friend and colleague, Senator Mullooly.  The Seanad's gain will be Fianna Fáil's loss. He will be a hard act to follow as party Chief Whip.</P>

I hope the Minister understands why we tabled this amendment, which is to highlight the slight discrepancies which exist. The amendment may confer a charge on the Exchequer but could the Minister explain why such a provision was not included in the Bill?  We have tabled similar amendments to other sections to highlight this matter.  Can the Minister clarify why it was not included in the Bill because it could have been debated in full when in the Dáil?  Under the rules of this House, we may not introduce an amendment which would involve a potential charge on the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>When the Minister for Social Welfare was here last week, he told us he had plans for an integrated social welfare allowance for all lone parents and that this would be provided in the Social Welfare (No. 3) Bill, which he hoped would be introduced later this year.  A report in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> said this would not go ahead in view of cost on the Exchequer and the cuts that had to be made in next year's budget</P>
      <P>We also had other queries last week about the changing of the name of adult dependant allowance.  Since the plans for the Social Welfare (No. 3) Bill seem to have been dropped &mdash; we were promised the reforms we asked for on Second Stage would be taken care of in that Bill &mdash; can the Minister outline the situation and allay our fears in this regard?</P>

It is not true the Bill has been scrapped or consigned to the waste paper basket.  It is going ahead.</P>
      <P>This amendment is out of order because this proposal is already in train; our officials are working on the structures. That proposal is still on stream. The scheme will be brought into force in 1996, which means it is still on target. There is no proposal to stop or reverse it.</P>

      <P>In my Second Stage contribution, I said that some provisions in this Bill were panic measures and the Bill was not as coherent or as well thought out as it should have been if the Government is committed to the referendum on divorce later this year.  Disallowing these amendments in both Houses indicates that some measures in this Bill have not been fully thought out. I said on Second Stage that some of these measures were slightly incoherent in parts and I was disappointed there had not been enough debate on them. The Social Welfare (No. 3) Bill will be coming on stream soon and it will add to the present confusion on social welfare.

I also welcomed that the Minister was giving this commitment, although I would prefer it if he did it now.  I am dissatisfied <Col N="1191" /> that we do not know the details of the Social Welfare (No. 3) Bill when discussing this Bill, but it is essential the adult dependant allowance title is changed, that we move forward to accelerate the individualisation of rights, particularly women's rights, in social welfare and continue the commitment to social welfare reform the Minister promised last week.</P>

      <P>I have not contributed to the debate so far, but the fact the Minister indicated another Bill is being introduced seems to suggest that Senator Kelleher's amendments are not only in order but are necessary.  I do not know the contents of the Social Welfare (No. 3) Bill either, but since this Bill was hailed as pre-divorce legislation, can the Minister indicate if that Bill will be in both Houses prior to the holding of a referendum on divorce?</P>
      <P>Could this section be deemed to be discriminatory, if not unconstitutional, because it only refers to a woman's right to a specific payment after the dissolution of a marriage?  A Fianna Fáil-Labour Government introduced the widower's pension because the previous arrangement discriminated badly against men.  This legislation refers only to deserted wives' benefit.  Cases of deserted husbands being left as the providers and supporters of children are becoming more common.</P>
      <P>This section refers to the deserted wife's allowance when a marriage has been dissolved.  During the debate on the Family Law Bill, about which I had reservations, I asked the Minister for Equality and Law Reform to refer to the position of nullity.  What is the position of section 4 when a marriage has been annulled and there is no judicial separation or divorce?  To what benefits is the deserted wife entitled in those circumstances?</P>

      <P>Social welfare legislation is complicated and this Bill is further complicated by the fact we have been asked not to pursue this amendment as it will be covered in the Social Welfare (No 3) Bill.  Can the Minister give us an indication of the anticipated expenditures under that Bill?  In framing that Bill, the Minister would, at this stage, have a general idea of the total estimated costs of that legislation to the Exchequer.  Is the reason for the delay in some way due to the fact that there is an in-depth review of spending currently taking place in the Department?  The Minister can respond to this if he likes, but the Government is giving out strong indications that a review of expenditure in this area is under way and the Minister for Social Welfare is having difficulty in convincing his colleagues of the necessity to provide the finances to meet these provisions.</P>
      <P>We have been forced to abandon our amendment on the basis that it involves expenditure to the Exchequer.  At this stage the Minister must have an idea how much it will cost to meet the provisions in the Bill being drafted.  Can he give us an indication in that regard?

      <P>All Governments review their spending programmes at this time of the year in anticipation of the subsequent year's Estimates.  The review that is currently taking place in my Department is no different to any other year.  There are no unforeseen circumstances where the Government has changed its mind on any aspect of its legislation as a result of unforeseen or other matters of expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of expenditure as regards the Social Welfare (No. 3) Bill was discussed adequately on Second Stage in the other House and here.  The position is still the same in relation to expenditure, the final details of which are not yet known.  There are fairly adequate projections based on information readily available, which are still <Col N="1193" /> valid.  We do not anticipate anything which will change the legislative proposals arising from financial considerations. It is anticipated that the scheme provided for under amendment No. 1 will come into operation in 1996.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to accept these amendments in view of the fact that the Social Welfare (No. 3) Bill is proposed. The final details of that Bill are in the course of preparation and it would be unusual for the Government or the Minister to accept amendments which would pre-empt that legislation.  We appreciate that these amendments have been tabled.  However, the procedure which will be followed in this situation is that the Minister will introduce the Social Welfare (No. 3) Bill in due course.  He is on target to do so and, therefore, the amendments are not acceptable.</P>
    <P>Another amendment relates to nullity. That matter will be dealt with under amendment No. 14.  However, where it has been deemed that a marriage is null and void, then it is automatically presumed that it never existed because those are the grounds on which nullity is granted.  I hope I have covered points raised.</P>

Is this the case in relation to some child benefits to which this section refers?  This is confusing and I would like the Minister to outline the provisions in a booklet or document which would be available to the public after we pass this legislation.  There is widespread confusion about what the Minister is attempting to do and whether he will get the money to do it. Has the Minister been asked by the Government to curtail spending on social welfare, which is one of the reasons this legislation is being deferred?</P>

      <P>I presume the Social Welfare (No. 3) Bill goes hand in hand with the Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill, <Col N="1194" /> 1995, and is an essential plank to the divorce legislation.  Will it be in place before the divorce referendum?  As regards Senator Daly's point, if I recall correctly the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, stated publicly that the cost of the provisions of the Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill, 1995, will be £1 million in the first year of implementation. That struck everyone as a low figure.  As a result of Fianna Fáil amendments to the legislation, it appears that the Social Welfare (No. 3) Bill will pose a much greater burden on the Exchequer than the £1 million indicated by the Minister.</P>
      <P>If the Minster makes these announcements, he should come to the House to answer questions.  He did not mention the fact that there was another plank of legislation that was vital to the constitutionality of this legislation, which was welcomed by all sides, in press releases and on Second Stage in the House.  If that is the case, the Minister has misled the public because this is not the only vital legislation.  As the Minister will be aware, social welfare was a major stumbling block to the success of the 1986 referendum.  People were rightly scared about losing their entitlements.

      <P>It is intended that the new scheme will coincide with the legislation on divorce.  One cannot be certain whether the dates will coincide, but I hope that will be achieved.  It will <Col N="1195" /> require a great deal of effort to try to bring that about.  Senator McGennis's comments on the 1986 referendum are recognised by everybody.  I reject the suggestion that there are vast increases or liabilities hidden somewhere and that they are now being uncovered for the first time.  There have been substantial legislative changes and payments, including equality payments, since 1986 which have in turn dealt with the areas where difficulties of a financial nature might arise relative to social welfare. That has been addressed by the relevant section in the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the officials in the Department of Social Welfare will identify the possible financial pitfalls which might exist.  The expertise in the Department has identified the type of extra costs already indicated by the Minister in the first and second five year period.  It is not expected that there will any extraordinary unforeseen costs.  The Opposition has overlooked the fact that if the proposed legislation on divorce does not bring about a renaming of particular entitlements for which individuals are eligible, they would possibly and, probably in most cases, be entitled to an alternative payment.  That is why there is not a vast difference between the figures already expended and projected and those which are likely to fall due after the new legislation.</P>
      <P>As regards the divorce legislation and making the necessary provisions in the Social Welfare (No. 3) Bill, it is essential that we do everything possible to cooperate in a constructive way &mdash; I know that is the intention &mdash; to ensure that there is no scare or unfounded suggestions which might lead to a scare and which would cause problems to other legislation.</P>
      <P>Senator Daly mentioned serious cutbacks. All cutbacks are serious and, as is normal, all Governments &mdash; and Senator Daly was a Minister in this Department &mdash; review spending around the months of June and couch their estimates accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1196" /> A number of economies have been suggested by various Departments to bring their expenditure within certain guidelines.  This is not unusual and how serious those cuts are likely to be can be best measured by looking at the total social welfare budget of £4.2 billion. Some newspaper reports suggest that a £17 million restriction has been placed on the Department.  However, given the level of total expenditure in the Department of Social Welfare, the economies being introduced at present to bring expenditure within European and other guidelines are not likely to cause any problems for social welfare recipients, such as those receiving child benefit or dependent allowances.</P>

      <P>We do not agree with section 4 for the reasons outlined.  By opposing the section we are putting down a marker and indicating our disapproval of the way in which the matter has been handled.  We have been informed that a Social Welfare (No. 3) Bill is on track.  The amendments which were ruled out of order identified a cost to the Exchequer.  Will the Social Welfare (No. 3) Bill place a serious burden on the finances of the Department of Social Welfare?  The purpose of opposing the section is to highlight the costs to the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>Our opposition also highlights the fact that serious thought was not given to this Bill.  It has been rushed and I cannot understand why the entire matter could not have been encompassed in one Bill.  This would have ensured the matter was debated in a way which would not have caused confusion. Nobody wants to cause confusion on this sensitive issue but people must be guaranteed security in the event of the passage of a divorce referendum.  They are entitled to safeguards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Social Welfare (No. 3) Bill will come before the House and we will be in the position of trying to clarify that also.  The entire matter could have been <Col N="1197" /> covered in one Bill.  If that had been the case, enough time could have been allocated to the Houses of the Oireachtas to discuss the issue.  This would have ensured that there was no scare-mongering; nobody wants to engage in scaremongering.  We oppose section 4.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, was in the House last week but he skipped over the cost implications of the Bill.  We must highlight this issue because it would be disingenuous of this side of the House to support the Bill knowing that funding may not be available to implement the legislative changes.

      <P>All the reasons for this have been outlined and since this is the case &mdash; although Senator Daly was previously being helpful and positive &mdash; it is unhelpful to close on the note that the reason the amendment is not being accepted is that hidden expenditure is included for which provision cannot be made.

      <P>The amendment was put down to highlight a discrepancy. The amendment states: after &ldquo;committed&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or remanded&rdquo;.  People can be remanded for quite some time.  Where does that leave them?  The section deals with the rights of people whose spouses have been committed to prison but not remanded.  That is a serious issue because many people will be without some form of entitlement if their spouses are on remand.  As well as that, we have proposed the deletion of the words &ldquo;for a period of not less than 6 months&rdquo;.  Why is there a provision in the section for a period of six months? What is the broad thrust of this section and why, even though our amendments would involve a charge on the Exchequer, was the &ldquo;period of not less than 6 months&rdquo; included?  Why were the words &ldquo;or remanded&rdquo; not included in this section?  It is discriminating against a vulnerable element of our society.

By and large, there will be no difficulty with the United Kingdom because of the agreement we have with it.  As a result of that legislation, it is likely that quite a few prisoners who are in prisons overseas now will be transferred to prisons in this country.

      <P>Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 would have provided for changes in the prisoner's wife's allowance scheme, under which allowances could be payable to a woman whose husband was committed to custody for a period of less than six months or where he was being held on remand.  Those amendments were ruled out of order.  In any event, they did not fundamentally relate to this legislation.  It appears that they anticipated legislation subsequent to divorce, and they are not relevant to the Bill, nor do they have anything to do with divorce legislation.  It would not be practical to give entitlement to prisoner's wife's allowance to women whose husbands were being held on remand for short periods.  Hence the period of six months.</P>
      <P>On Senator Daly's inquiries about prisoners on remand, the normal provisions will apply.  If any unforeseen situations arise, which are not anticipated at this stage and will not create serious financial burdens in any event, financial commitments of an equal nature will be in place.

As Senator Henry said, if a person's spouse is in prison, even on remand, the situation of the person on the outside does not change.  I presume these provisions under section 7 were introduced to ensure that somebody who was receiving a prisoner's wife's allowance would continue to receive it if they separated or divorced.  I presumed this Bill was introduced because it is relevant to the divorce legislation.

We proposed a simple amendment to the section to include those remanded in custody.  How can the Minister state that it not relevant to the impending referendum on divorce and to this legislation?  It is relevant and it is important that something is done to clarify the issue I have raised.  The circumstances of the person outside of prison <Col N="1203" /> are the exact same whether the person inside is on remand or is serving time.  This is relevant to the legislation and is relevant to the people who will find themselves in those circumstances if we pass the Bill as it is.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to give effect to the principle of no loss of entitlement.  In the event of a person being divorced, it will not alter the basic conditions of entitlement.  That is why I said the amendment was not relevant; it does not affect the conditions of entitlement.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry mentioned newspaper reports.  I mentioned in relation to the previous amendment that we should not always believe what we read in the newspapers.  I can assure the Senator that the suggestions of major difficulties, as outlined in some newspaper reports, have been greatly exaggerated.  The legislative proposals are on target and will be introduced and a scheme will be put in place in 1996.  There was a change of date, but there are no proposals to reverse any of the Government's intentions. I am sure Senator Henry will be delighted to hear that.  Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 are out of order for the reasons already given.  I will probably not satisfy the Members, but that is the way it is.</P>

I would not anticipate that acceptance of the amendment would involve huge expenditure and this is why we are suspicious that underlying this is the financing of the whole chapter.

      <P>It is the prerogative of any Minister in any Department to set his or her own programme in accordance with the Government's legislative programme and to introduce legislation which is consistent with his or her own objectives and timetable.  For all the reasons I have outlined, it is good Government planning to initiate a legislative package and accept amendments which relate to the specific Bill under discussion and not pre-empt future <Col N="1205" /> legislation by accepting amendments now.  There would not be much sense in deciding to forget about the social welfare (No. 3) Bill and do everything by way of amendment to the Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the points made by the Members.  However, I cannot understand how, without any research, the Senator anticipates huge cost increases in the area.  Notwithstanding the transfer of prisoners or anything else, any changes will be minor in the context of the total social welfare budget.  Some changes were introduced already.  The text of subsection (4) was amended on Committee Stage in the other House to ensure consistency with provision relating to deserted wife's benefit in section 4 of the Bill.  The amendment does not alter the substance of the Bill and continues to provide that prisoners' wives allowances will cease as and from the woman's remarriage.</P>

As the songs says: &ldquo;what's another year?&rdquo; The fact that only eight women are in receipt of prisoner's wife's allowance means it is even more important to co-ordinate the various schemes.  The administrative costs of separate schemes must be to the disadvantage of the Department.  It might save money to bring it forward to early 1996.</P>

      <P>The root of the problem is the directive to the Department of Social Welfare to save money where possible.  That is the harsh reality.  We pointed out that this amendment would only represent a few thousand pounds in the overall budget which runs to millions. Could the Minister not find it in his heart to accept it?  I know he is sympathetic to my case but unfortunately he cannot accept my amendment because it has been ruled out of order.  This highlights the fact that having been allocated <Col N="1206" /> its budget, the Department has been directed to scrimp and save every penny.  While my amendments were ruled out of order because they constitute a burden on the Exchequer, they should have been accepted in the other House and that just validates my argument.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, I have to disagree with the Senator.  He mentioned earlier that he is a novice, having been in the House a mere two years. However, he is heading in the right direction by identifying what Ministers should be doing.  I appreciate his anxiety to assume the office of Minister and I will be more than happy to move over in due course but the situation is exactly as I indicated.</P>
      <P>I reject absolutely the suggestion that major draconian cuts are being enforced on the unfortunate people who have to depend on social welfare payments. That simply is not the case.  I have, to the best of my ability, detailed the relevant figures for the current year.  One sees the figure of £17 million mentioned in newspaper reports but one can never believe everything one reads in newspapers. I do not intend any disrespect to the media; there is always much speculation on such matters.  The sum of £4.2 billion is an extensive budget.  I assure the House that there will be no erosion of the general thrust of Government policy and no hardship will be caused to any social welfare recipients.  Since the foundation of the State Governments have conducted mid-term reviews.  It has always been the tradition to introduce corrective measures which will, for the next six months or thereabouts, ensure that the economy stays on course.  That has been done very effectively.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important section.  While some of the previous sections did not affect many people, this section affects an enormous number of people.  Like the Minister I am careful about what I read in the papers, even if it is in <i>The Irish Times.</i>  When I read that the Irish topped the EU single parent league I was extremely alarmed.  I got the Eurostat population and social condition statistics and I hope the Minister has read them because they are extraordinarily serious and show the situation in which many Irish families are living.</P>
      <P>The figures are for the 1990/91 period. In proportion to population, the percentage of Irish households which are lone parent family households was 10.6 per cent and at the top of the league.  Children of lone parents in Ireland represent 15 per cent.  These are astonishing figures.  When we describe the family in Ireland the two parent nuclear family is in a prominent position. However we must seriously look at the sort of families who must be catered for nowadays.</P>
      <P>The Department of Social Welfare should give this area high priority.  We should not be pleased to be topping this league.  I am not sure how the statistics are compiled; other countries cut off the age of childhood at 18 or 25 but here a 40 year old bachelor living with his mother could be described as a child of a lone parent.  I hope great cognisance is given to dealing with lone parent families in all future social welfare legislation.</P>

      <P>The Minister, Deputy De Rossa, announced that deserted wife's benefit would be encompassed in this scheme.  Is this the section which would have brought that about?  It states that reference to a lone parent shall include reference to a person who would otherwise be a lone parent but for the fact that the person's marriage has been dissolved and that dissolution has been recognised as valid in the State.</P>
      <P>Some people who currently qualify for deserted wife's benefit feared being classed as lone parents because as they had been in a marriage they would have many commitments, for example to mortgages or loans.  If the dissolution of that marriage is recognised by the State they could find themselves in circumstances different from those of a person who became a lone parent by choice.  A person who would now find himself or herself classified as a lone parent may have had to dissolve a marriage due to circumstances outside his or her control. Is this the section which provides for that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know Senators like concise answers but perhaps not that short.  The points raised by the Senators are valid because this is an important matter requiring careful attention and monitoring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to Senator Henry, I will give the figures for recipients of lone parent's allowance from 1990 to 1994.  In 1990, there were 18,061 unmarried parent recipients; 4,059 separated spouses; 2,217 widowed persons; and 194 prisoners' spouses.  In 1991, there were 21,366 unmarried recipients; 5,391 separated spouses; 2,263 widowed persons; and 164 prisoners' spouses.  In 1992, there were 24,077 unmarried parents; 6,438 separated spouses; 2,277 widowed persons; and 135 prisoners' spouses.  In <Col N="1209" /> 1993, there were 26,735 unmarried parents; 7,585 separated spouses; 2,219 widowed persons; and 114 prisoners' spouses.  In 1994 there were 29,987 unmarried parents; 8,714 separated spouses; 1,880 widowed persons; and 119 prisoners' spouses.  The fall in the number of widowed persons is because some of those people were transferred to the survivor's pension.</P>
    <P>The total recipients for each year were: in 1990, 25,231; in 1991, 29,184; in 1992, 32,937; in 1993, 36,653; and in 1994, 40,700.  I obtained these figures from the pensions and allowances sections.</P>
    <P>To take the point mentioned by Senator Henry, the number of unmarried parents rose from 18,761 in 1990 to 29,987 in 1994.  Those are worrying figures and great attention is being paid to them and to the figures for separated spouses.  Various social reasons have been put forward for these increases and there are no easy answers.</P>
    <P>As one who has spent considerable time over the years dealing with applicants for deserted wife's allowance and benefit, I have come to recognise the significance of what Senator Henry has said about the status and the increase in numbers in those areas.  We must isolate the cost factor, although that is not the point the Senator made.  Regardless of the cost society still must address the position as it stands by way of education and a comprehensive social review.  It is not a simple matter and it will not become easier.</P>
    <P>The figures are similar to those in other countries and I note that Ireland is top of the league, which is alarming. Some of our neighbouring states went through similar, circumstances in previous years.  We read the alarming statistics in neighbouring democracies and convinced ourselves such phenomena would never be visited on us but of course they have been.  These matters will require careful examination by all Governments henceforth.  Senator Kelleher mentioned the social problems which have arisen in relation to people who became single parents by choice.  I <Col N="1210" /> am not sure that is a huge problem, although there may be occasional cases.</P>
    <P>Be that as it may, we still must look at the issue in so far as society has changed and is changing.  I recently addressed a conference organised by the Council of Europe in Helsinki, the purpose of which was to address the changing structure of the family, given the statistics mentioned here, and to identify how society could address the problem. I am speaking merely of the social structures and how to ensure children and parents are catered for and social responsibilities are met, while at the same time ensuring society is in a position to meet the financial burdens which might arise in the future.</P>
    <P>I am sorry for discussing this at length but I have taken a keen interest in this subject and I know Senators have done likewise.  They are right to identify the importance of these trends.  Any helpful suggestions that can be utilised either now or in the future will be looked at sympathetically, but this will be done in the overall context of social welfare legislation.  This is also happening in other European countries, and particularly within the European Union.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply and I am reassured that he is so concerned about the matter.  Senator Kelleher pointed out that some people may be lone parents by choice but the Minister is right in saying that within these figures they are probably a very small proportion.  I was also asked to go to the Copenhagen conference and wish I could have gone.</P>
      <P>As the Minister pointed out, we could probably deal with the financial implications but the social supports to be put in place for the children of single parent families and for single parents themselves are extremely important.  I am glad to see that the Minister is taking such a concerned interest in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also thank the Minister for his reply to the concerns raised by Senator Henry and Senator Kelleher. As he said, we can probably deal with <Col N="1211" /> the cost involved.  However, it is a matter of concern that between 1990 and 1995 the number of unmarried parents jumped from 18,000 to almost 30,000. Also of great concern is the number of young girls who are having children.  I do not think it is a question of choice for many of them.  I am sick and tired of listening to those who say that such people are having children for the money.  If they are doing it for the meagre social welfare allowances they get from the State, then the conditions they are leaving behind must be pretty bad. A co-ordinated effort by the Departments of Health, Education and Social Welfare is necessary to address this frightening problem.</P>
      <P>The Minister says this has happened in other countries in the past.  Many children are born outside wedlock, particularly in the Scandinavian countries, but they grow up in family situations with both parents present.  In this country the woman is effectively landed with the baby and is expected to take care of it with very little support from the child's father.  It is necessary to educate boys and girls about their responsibilities regarding parenthood and the risk of young girls becoming pregnant.  In this regard, a co-ordinated effort between the Departments of Health and Education is necessary.  The Department of Social Welfare ends up picking up the tab but it is a small price to pay.  The social consequences are enormous and need to be addressed.  There is no point burying our heads in the sand because this is a huge problem.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 6, paragraph (b), line 33, after &ldquo;spouse&rdquo; where it firstly occurs, to insert &ldquo;by regular transfer of income to his or her spouse&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1212" /> The reason for this amendment is that an entitlement to claim for an adult dependant with whom one is not living should be qualified by a duty to show evidence that the transfer of income has taken place to that spouse.  It is not acceptable for a man to receive payment from the State for a partner with whom he is not living unless that person, and it is usually a woman, has given her consent to that claim.  In this case I do not think it would have any financial consequences for the State.  If the State is paying out money for somebody it should pay it directly to the person, particularly if the person is not living with her spouse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Honan and Senator Kelleher's amendment. This is similar to the difficulties that arose in getting maintenance enforced. One could have a spouse &mdash; in most cases the husband &mdash; receiving income from the State which will not be passed on to the spouse from whom he is separated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>This a worthwhile amendment which I implore the Minister to accept.  The Department of Social Welfare is paying money to two people who are claiming, yet one of them is not passing it on to the recipient who is entitled to it and for whom the claim was made in the first place.  Major problems are caused by the fact that money is claimed on someone's behalf who is not receiving it.  This amendment would sort out those problems by the regular transfer of income to his or her spouse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Without this legislation or this amendment it would still be possible to sort out that anomaly, as we all know from dealing with it on a regular basis on behalf of our constituents.  The amendment seeks to define in primary legislation the circumstances in which a person will be regarded as wholly or mainly maintaining his or her spouse or former spouse for the purpose of the family income supplement scheme.  It <Col N="1213" /> provides that the spouse being maintained will have to be in receipt of a regular transfer of income.</P>
      <P>As I said, the amendment is unnecessary in that section 10(3) of the Bill contains regulatory powers to determine the circumstances in which the person is to be regarded as wholly or mainly maintaining another person.  These powers will apply to all social welfare payments, including the family income supplement. Under this section of the Bill as initiated, the regulations may provide for the circumstances in which a person is or is not to be regarded as wholly or mainly maintaining another person.  The Minister agreed to accept an Opposition amendment to this provision on Committee Stage in the Dáil which replaced the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; with &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The regulations in question will have to be made and, unfortunately, I will have to oppose this amendment because the provisions are already in hand.  The Minister has already so agreed because of the amendment moved in the Lower House on Committee Stage and the Minister's indication in relation to the precise regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the amendment not be accepted to ensure that the money claimed by a person would actually go to the recipient?  This amendment would safeguard that.  If that is already to be included in legislation why not accept it here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said there is already provision where people can look for direct payment and that we may have dealt with this ourselves. However, that situation usually involves the case of a woman having to request that this should happen.  That is not acceptable because while some women may know about their entitlements, others may not.  It is disgraceful for the State to pay a dependent relative's allowance to somebody who is not even living with the woman who should receive it.  It goes against the grain of the Minister's stated intention to accelerate the individualisation of rights.  Such <Col N="1214" /> allowances should not be paid out unless there is evidence of regular payment. I cannot understand why the Minister cannot reassure us by accepting the amendment, given that it is already taken care of in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only say again that the suggestion is to amend or define in primary legislation whereas, currently, under the normal procedure it is possible to obtain separate payments.  I know Members are concerned that the payment should come automatically as of right instead of by request, but difficulties can arise from such a request.  If, for example, a marriage is in difficulty and a request is submitted for separate payments, it can accelerate the difficulties that are already there.  I know that from dealing with individual cases.  On the other hand it may well be that on assessment of an individual case a suggestion is made to the Department to the effect that given the circumstances in the household where one or other partner is not providing as he or she should, it might be better to have the payments made in a particular fashion.  The difference there with what is proposed in the amendment is that in the current situation and in that provided for by the Minister on Committee Stage of this Bill in the other House, there would be an individual examination of the case rather than a broadly based, across the board change.  The provisions of this Bill apply to all schemes, not just the family income supplement. I note the points made by the Senators but from my experience of dealing with those situations, there is no rule of thumb that one partner is better than another.  In some instances it may be better to proceed as at present, in other cases it may be better to have a more general situation as indicated by the Senators.  My own feeling is that adopting one system in preference to the other would have very little impact.</P>

      <P>I am a little older than Senator Kelleher and Senator Honan and I remember the same arguments <Col N="1215" /> when changes were made to the children's allowance scheme to pay it to the mother instead of to the father.  Of course in some circumstances the parent who had the children &mdash; probably the mother in these situations &mdash; was not as careful as she should have been in managing the family finances but that was allowed for when the change was made in the children's allowance and it did not happen very often.  The same will occur here.  The original children's allowance legislation was altered so that payment was made to the mother and exactly the same thing will happen here. A great deal of pressure could be put on women who apply to have the money sent directly to themselves if it is not <i>de facto</i> and <i>de jure</i> the case that the money is sent to the woman and then, in the small percentage of cases where she is not carrying out her duties as well as the State would like her to, the money is transferred back to the husband. It is the other way around at the moment.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment from Senator Honan and Senator Kelleher.</P>

The Social Welfare (No 3) Bill may well be the appropriate legislation to deal with this issue.</P>
      <P>I do not want to mention specific instances but in the last 12 months I have come across a number of cases in relation to family income supplement. Legislation dealing with family income supplement is slightly different from other social welfare legislation in the sense that it is payable when one of the spouses is working.  It is very difficult to identify the best method of dealing with the issue raised, but it is something that we will re-examine sympathetically.  I am interested in hearing from Members in regard to the number of these cases which have arisen in which they have a particular interest.  I have dealt with cases and I am familiar with cases referred to me by colleagues, but there are pitfalls as has been illustrated.  If Members have any other suggestions they will be sympathetically examined.</P>

      <P>With regard to the family income supplement, the Minister earlier agreed with me on the financial and social problems pertaining to single parent families.  A very small proportion &mdash; approximately 7 per cent &mdash; of the population is involved in part time employment, and of that proportion, approximately 70 per cent are women. Most are employed in the services sector, in the retail trade.  However, there <Col N="1219" /> is an even smaller category of women involved in job sharing.  They find a full time job impossible, although they need the money.  However, they have grave difficulties from a social viewpoint in maintaining the structure of their families and have, therefore, opted to become involved in job sharing.  In taking up job sharing these women take a reduction in income.  At the same time, they are not eligible for family income supplement.  Cherish has written to the Minister's Department on many occasions.  I have also telephoned the Department to discuss the matter and have raised it in the House previously. Is there any movement on this matter?</P>
      <P>Section 97 (2) of the Social Welfare (Consolidated Payments Provisions) Regulations, 1994, states:</P>
      <P>A person who is engaged in employment on a job sharing basis shall not be regarded as being engaged in remunerative full-time employment as an employee, but account may be taken of the number of hours worked by that person in determining the aggregate number of hours worked by that person's spouse.</P>
      <P>This is fine and legalistic, but it leaves those who are job sharing, and single parents in a very serious situation.  As I have not managed to get any replies on this matter privately &mdash; nor has Cherish &mdash; I ask the Minister if he has any further thoughts on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the points made and am aware of Senator Henry's concern and the concern of Cherish with regard to the section.  Amendment No. 6, which is out of order, relates specifically to the subject matter.  To qualify for a family income supplement the person must be engaged in remunerative full time employment as an employee.  In accordance with regulations, a person is regarded as being engaged in remunerative full time employment where he or she works for at least 20 hours a week in employment <Col N="1220" /> which is expected to continue for a period of at least six months.  In the case of married or cohabiting couples where both parties are in paid employment, the hours worked by the couple can be combined.  Amendment No. 6 in the name of Senator Henry, which was deemed to be out of order, seeks to extend the family income supplement scheme to people who are job sharing and who are not regarded as being engaged in remunerative full time employment as already laid out in other legislation.</P>
      <P>The family income supplement scheme is designed to provide cash support to families on low earnings and thereby preserve the incentive to remain in employment.  To extend the scheme to people who voluntarily opt to work on a job sharing basis would be inconsistent with the rationale of the scheme, which is to encourage people to remain in employment.  I appreciate the vantage point from which Senator Henry is considering the situation and I have come across cases where I can understand her concerns.</P>
      <P>Where people can only obtain work on a job sharing basis, it will be open to them to apply for unemployment benefit or assistance in respect of the days they are not employed.  It is possible to sign on and sign off, as it is termed, and to cover that type of situation under existing legislation.  However, I am also aware of some recent amendments to the legislation which created some difficulties, and this is the source of Senator Henry's concern.  I will have the matter further examined within the Department and a comprehensive reply will be issued to the Senator.  She mentioned that Cherish has not recieved a substantive reply.  I will also ensure that is speedily addressed.  If, for example, the concerns expressed by Senator Henry are still apparent we will be happy to look at the matter in the context of other social welfare legislation.  I am sorry that we cannot do so at present and with regard to this Bill, but we will certainly consider it in the light of other legislation.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Henry. The legal working week is 39 hours and somebody job sharing is under the limit of 20 hours.  The Minister made a distinction between a person who had no choice in job sharing and somebody who voluntarily opted for it and, therefore, would not be entitled to family income supplement.  This is unsatisfactory, particularly for women as it is difficult to combine work and home responsibilities.</P>
      <P>In an era of high unemployment we should encourage job sharing if it suits individual circumstances and make it easier for women to stay in the work-force on a part-time or job sharing basis and look after their children in the home.  We should not discourage them but this restriction on family income supplement is a discouragement.  In an era of high unemployment the Government should consider this seriously.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for undertaking to send a reply to me and to Cherish as soon as possible.  This is a serious matter.  We discussed the social and financial implications of people &mdash; generally women &mdash; bringing up children alone.  This is a method by which they would be enabled to devote more time to their children and family matters. The Constitution provides that women should not have to work outside the home for economic reasons.  If we are to uphold the Constitution we need to support schemes such as this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 7, before section 10, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>10.&mdash;The Minister shall within 3 months of the commencement of <Col N="1222" /> this Act lay before each House of the Oireachtas regulations determining the circumstances in which a person can be regarded as cohabiting with another person as husband and wife.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Cohabitation is not defined in the Principal Act or in the social welfare code, yet the accusation of cohabitation is one of the major grounds for refusing a lone parent entitlement to social welfare support. The issue of cohabitation has raised many complex policy issues with regard to the treatment of women in married and non married households.  It has been addressed in judgments from the Supreme Court and the High Court, and the review group could not arrive at a definitive view on the subject.  It should be addressed in a social welfare Bill and now is the time to do so.</P>
    <P>In deciding whether a person qualifies, a deciding officer must be satisfied that the claimant is living with someone as husband or wife.  The Department of Social Welfare must have guidelines as to how that is determined but the public is not aware of them.  If there was a definition of cohabitation people would see how this matter is dealt with by the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment would impose an obligation on the Minister to define cohabitation in regulations.  It has been a condition of entitlement for a number of social welfare payments for many years that the person is not cohabiting.  This condition applies, for example, in the case of lone parent's allowance, deserted wife's benefit and allowance, and widow's and widower's contributory pension.</P>
      <P>The incidence of people disqualified from receiving payment on grounds of cohabitation is rare.  For example, 114 people were disqualified in 1994, mainly in cases of unmarried parents in receipt of lone parent's allowance, and about 40 people have been disqualified to date this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In deciding whether a person is disqualified from receiving a payment on <Col N="1223" /> grounds of cohabitation, the deciding officer must be satisfied the claimant is living with someone as husband or wife. There is no single factor by which this can be determined, and as relationships and domestic and financial arrangements between husbands and wives can vary considerably, each individual case must be decided on its merits and facts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) Any increase in a social welfare payment in respect of an adult dependant shall, if requested by any such adult dependant, be payable to the adult dependant in his or her own right.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is demeaning for a person to be called an adult dependant.  This amendment would give such persons their own identity.  If they so request, the money should be paid to the dependant in his or her own right.  It is a worthy amendment as it will give a status to people who have none at present when it comes to social welfare payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in relation to earlier amendments, this is already possible under existing legislation without specific amendment to the Bill.  Amendment No. 12 would provide that an increase payable in respect of an adult dependant would, at the request of the adult dependant, be payable directly to them.  Under existing legislative provisions payment may be made directly to an adult dependant where the circumstances so warrant.  These are known as separate payments.  These provisions are used in cases of difficult <Col N="1224" /> family circumstances which generally involve situations where the claimant is not using the benefit or allowance to support the dependant.</P>
      <P>Where the adult dependant is living with the claimant, they can receive half the married rate of payment, that is, half the personal rate plus the increase for the adult dependant.  They also receive the full increases for children.  These provisions, where applied, are more favourable than those provided for in amendment No. 12.  That is the important factor in relation to that item. I appreciate the Senator's genuine concern but there is provision for the matter and it has been used on countless occasions by recipients of social welfare benefits, particularly in recent times.</P>
      <P>In other situations where the adult dependant is not living with the claimant they may receive the adult dependant increase and the full increases for any dependant children.  These provisions are more favourable than those provided for in the amendment.</P>
      <P>The existing situation is better and more favourable from the point of view of the dependant than those provided for in the amendment by way of specific legislation.  There is also provision at present for a certain amount of discretion and each individual case examined will receive greater consideration than if there was a global legislative proposal which does not have regard to the individual case.</P>

      <P>References to the words &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall&rdquo; have bedevilled debates here and in the Dáil over the <Col N="1225" /> years.  There are reasons, which I will not go into now, for the use of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in this case.  At the request of a dependant the Department may or may not consent depending on the reason for the request in the first instance.  The legislation is adequate at present.  I take on board the Senator's point but the existing legislation is better from the point of view of protecting the dependant's rights than the proposal in the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 7, before section 11, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;11.&mdash;In all circumstances where a person is entitled to a social welfare payment on the basis of a marriage which has been dissolved, being a dissolution that is recognised as valid in the State, such payment shall be called a &lsquo;special maintenance payment&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, I have no option but to oppose this amendment. First, the text is defective in that it refers to a person &ldquo;entitled to a social welfare payment on the basis of a marriage which has been dissolved&rdquo;.  There are no provisions in the Bill which entitle a person to payment on the basis of a marriage which has been dissolved.  In this respect, the text is defective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, I am advised that even if the deficiency in the text was rectified, it is likely that the amendment would necessitate certain consequential amendments to other provisions of the Social Welfare Acts.  These would include section 209 which deals with overlapping provisions under which, as a general rule, a person is not entitled to receive more than one social welfare <Col N="1226" /> payment at the same time.  Members will be aware of this in relation to qualification for other social welfare benefits. This amendment would have a knockon effect on other unrelated social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>Amendments to sections 30 and 118 of the Principal Act, which describe social insurance payments, would also have to be considered.  That would mean major social welfare legislation which would be unacceptable.  In effect, the nature of the amendment is such that it would be necessary to undertake a comprehensive examination of the Social Welfare Acts and regulations to identify all of the required consequential changes.  For these reasons, I will be opposing the amendment.</P>

However, they all stemmed from a genuine concern for people who have to depend on social welfare payments.

    <P>Members can see the text of the message from the Dáil outlining its decision on the amendments made by the Seanad to the Consumer Credit Bill, 1994.  On 30 June the Seanad returned the Consumer Credit Bill, 1994, to the Dáil with 152 amendments to which the agreement of the Dáil was sought.  The Dáil considered those amendments and accepted the majority of them without change, but made additional changes in some instances which I shall now outline briefly.</P>
    <P>In one instance, amendment No. 77, it found that the amendment was superfluous and, therefore, it did not agree to it.  The Seanad must now decide whether it wishes to insist on that amendment.  In three instances, amendments Nos. 29, 127 and 141, the Dáil accepted the amendments but made further amendments to them.  The Seanad must now decide if it agrees to <Col N="1231" /> the additional amendments made by the Dáil.  In five other instances, amendments Nos. 5, 21, 49, 87 and 124, the Dáil accepted the amendments made by the Seanad but found that further amendments were necessary, consequential on the acceptance of those amendments.</P>
    <P>In each instance to which I referred I will be calling on the Leader to move a motion suggesting the action to be taken by the Seanad.  I will then call the Minister to explain the decision taken by the Dáil.  I remind Members that each Senator may only speak once on each motion.</P>

      <P>These amendments are consequential on the amendments put through in this House.  Some technical changes are necessary to ensure that they are internally consistent in the Bill. That is their general purpose.</P>
      <P>Updating the cross-reference in amendment No. 77 will happen automatically and the amendment is not required.  Therefore, I will not move amendment No. 77.  I wish to bring to Senators' attention that the reference in amendment No. 76, to inserted subsection (1), is a reference to subsection (1) inserted by way of amendment No. 74.</P>

      <P>The clarity of the Minister's explanation is inspiring.  I am more confused than I was before.  The way this Bill has been guided through both Houses is highly unsatisfactory. This is, in effect, a new Bill because so <Col N="1232" /> many amendments have been made to it.  It is a tribute to the staff of both Houses, particularly the staff of the Seanad, that we have not encountered more difficulties.  The capacity for mistakes is enormous as a result of the number of amendments and their consequential effects.  I do not believe the House will insist that amendment No. 77 be retained.</P>
      <P>There is an implication that this amendment was a result of an amendment put forward by the Opposition but that is not the case.  Nearly all those adopted were Government amendments. Because of the Government's minority position in the Seanad, if we were to adopt an amendment which was then returned to the Dáil, would the same procedure be followed?  Perhaps that is question should be addressed to the Chair or the Leader, not to the Minister.  There is no need to unduly delay the House on that matter.  It is extremely difficult&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It has been virtually impossible to conduct a meaningful debate on certain parts of the Bill because of the plethora of amendments and their consequential effects on other parts.  This leads to a suspicion that things can be slipped into legislation without giving them due and adequate attention.  It is our responsibility to carefully scrutinise legislation, deal with it effectively and ensure that it will be amended if required.  Usually the Seanad fulfils that responsibility very well but it is extremely difficult to fulfil it in this instance.  I know the Minister will take that on board.  I can understand the reasons so many amendments were required.  Nevertheless, it comes back to my central point that it would have been far better for the Bill to have been reintroduced in a redrafted form as we would not have experienced the confusion we have in this case.  I do not know if it is necessary to deal with each <Col N="1233" /> amendment individually but perhaps there are procedural reasons for not taking them together.</P>

      <P>These are technical amendments which correctly reposition the reference to section 147 &mdash; the nature of finance to be arranged &mdash; to be explained to the consumer.  Subparagraph (1) sets out these sections in Part X, contravention of which results in a summary offence.  As a result of Seanad amendment No. 123, section 147 was moved from Part X into a new Part XI entitled &ldquo;Credit Intermediaries&rdquo;.  Subparagraph (j), which specifies those sections in Part XI contravention of which is a summary offence, is therefore the correct position for the reference to section 147.</P>

It was necessary, on the advice of the Office of the Attorney General, to include a provision whereby the holder of such an authorisation complies with the requirements of subsection (1) which caters for the situation where the licensee ceases to act on behalf of the undertaking specified in the authorisation or commences business for an undertaking not specified in the authorisation.

      <P>This underlines my earlier point.  If we were to assume that the Bill had not been thus amended, the initial reference would have remained. It has been changed because somebody spotted the mistake when the Bill was returned to the Dáil for further consideration. That is why the word &ldquo;Revoke&rdquo; is being replaced with the word &ldquo;Withdraw&rdquo;.  It would have been better if this had been dealt with originally rather than dealing with it in this manner.  It is quite possible that legislation could have been adopted which contained the word &ldquo;Revoke&rdquo; rather <Col N="1235" /> than the word &ldquo;Withdraw&rdquo;.

Throughout Part IX, which deals with moneylending, the previous references to &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; had already been replaced by the term &ldquo;borrower&rdquo;.  In the interests of consistency it is also necessary to insert &ldquo;borrower&rdquo; in place of &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; in sections 104 and 105.  Section 107 is concerned with moneylending agreements which include a collection charge.  Again, in the interests of consistency, the term &ldquo;consumers&rdquo; on page 28, line 56 has been replaced by the word &ldquo;borrowers&rdquo;.</P>

Although it had to be dealt with under the imperative of the brief time we had before both Houses rose, the alternative of rewriting the Bill, as has been suggested, would, at a minimum, have deferred its enactment.</P>
      <P>I do not pretend to challenge Senator Dardis on his point about a person needing to be an eminent senior counsel to follow some of the complex amendments. The Bill is complex and perhaps some of the amendments might have been foreseen.  I would not like to over stress the amendment the Senator chose to make his point, which referred to &ldquo;withdraw&rdquo; and &ldquo;revoke&rdquo;.  I do not think a great deal would have hinged on this if the appalling vista he envisages happened.  Many of the amendments involved tidying up, repositioning and restructuring the Bill; for example, a provision for uniform advertising was inserted but we found that another section which dealt with advertising became superfluous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill was processed under pressure. It has been scrutinised and has been <Col N="1239" /> a long time in gestation.  This is not a sufficient excuse or defence to make to Members but it took a great deal of time for the Bill to go through the system. If Ministers are amenable, as I and my predecessor have been, to take amendments on board, this, <i>per se</i>, ought not to be criticised.  This is a tribute to the Committee Stage process.  An argument may be made that the Bill should not have escaped from the parliamentary draftsman's office as early as it did but we are now all agreed that we have an infinitely better Bill than the one introduced in the other House.  This is a good day for consumers, the Bill is good and I greatly appreciate the House facilitating it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill will commend itself to Senators as a worthwhile amendment of the law relating to powers of attorney.  It is an important social measure, the purpose of which is to allow persons to put in place arrangements for managing their affairs in the event that they should become mentally disabled.</P>
      <P>At present the law, which is almost exclusively of common law origin, enables a person, called the donor, to grant a power of attorney to another person, called the attorney, to act on the donor's behalf.  Powers of attorney may be granted for many purposes.  Their scope may be limited or unlimited as regards their subject matter or duration. For example, a power may be granted to an attorney to look after the affairs of a person who is temporarily out of the country or to act on behalf of a person in a specific matter, for example, the purchase of a particular property.</P>
      <P>However, supervening mental incapacity of the donor automatically revokes the attorney's authority.  Thus a power of attorney can lapse at a time when it is most needed.  When a person becomes mentally incapable and the question of managing his or her affairs arises, the only option open under the existing law is to have that person made a ward of court.  Wardship can be a complex, time consuming and expensive procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not surprising then that bodies such as the Alzheimer Society of Ireland <Col N="1242" /> and the Incorporated Law Society have been advocating legislation to facilitate the management of the affairs of people who succumb to mental incapacity.  The present Bill does this by providing for a new type of power of attorney, an &ldquo;enduring power of attorney&rdquo;, which will take effect should the donor become mentally incapable.  The Bill takes into account recommendations contained in a report of the Law Reform Commission on the subject.</P>
    <P>Before turning to the actual provisions, I should like to make a few general points.  The incidence of Alzheimer's disease &mdash; there are believed to be more than 25,000 Irish men and women sufferers &mdash; is not confined to the elderly. It is mainly a disease of old age but it can and does strike as early as 50, 40 or even 30 years of age and, of course, there are also other forms of dementia.</P>
    <P>Mental incapacity can also result from brain injury at any age, perhaps most commonly from road accidents.  The existence of a power of attorney which would not be revoked on the occurrence of mental incapacity would act as a kind of insurance against the effects of accidental injuries of this kind.  In fact, in jurisdictions where enduring powers of attorney have been introduced, many young people have executed these enduring powers as a precaution against such an eventuality.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill deals with enduring powers.  What it seeks to achieve is a procedure that will not be over formal but will nevertheless provide adequate safeguards against possible abuse.  A primary consideration is that the donor of the enduring power must intend the power to be effective even if he or she should become mentally incapable.  The donor must understand, and have the mental capacity to understand, the consequences of creating the power and there must be no question of the power being executed as a result of any undue influence.</P>
    <P>The need for safeguards arises from the fact that should the donor become mentally incapacitated, the recipient of the enduring power, the attorney, will <Col N="1243" /> have full authority to manage the donor's affairs subject only to any conditions or restrictions in the enduring power itself or in the Bill.  For example, subject to any such conditions or restrictions, the attorney will be able to do whatever the donor might be expected to do to meet the needs of the attorney or those of other persons.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives effect to these safeguards in section 5.  Section 5 (1) makes it a key characteristic of an enduring power that the instrument creating it must contain a statement that the donor intends the power to be effective notwithstanding any supervening mental incapacity.  Other requirements for a valid enduring power will be specified in ministerial regulations.  This will give a measure of flexibility, though the matters which may be specified are set out in some detail in the section.</P>
    <P>The regulations will provide first that the document creating the power incorporates adequate information about the effect of creating or accepting it.  Then there must be a statement in the document by the donor either that the donor has read that information or that it has been read to him or her.  It must also include a statement by a solicitor that after interviewing the donor and obtaining any necessary reports, he or she is satisfied both that the donor understood the effect of creating the power and that no undue influence has been used.  The possibility is being left open for the Minister to specify not only solicitors but also members of some other class of persons who might perform the same function.</P>
    <P>The regulations will also provide for a statement to be made by a doctor that the donor had the mental capacity to understand the effect of creating the power, with the assistance of such explanations as may have been given.  The owner of a nursing home or a person concerned with its operation may not act as attorney under an enduring power.</P>
    <P>Another requirement, which will be important in this context, is that requiring <Col N="1244" /> the donor to give notice to specified persons of the execution of the enduring power.  When a donor becomes mentally incapable, the attorney is required under the Bill to serve notice on certain people, including relatives, that he or she intends to register the enduring power.  That may be the first intimation those relatives have received that the power exists.  The experience of other jurisdictions is that notification at the point of registration has tended to give rise to suspicion and to prompt what often are unnecessary or unfounded objections to the registration.  Under the Bill this difficulty will be minimised because of the advance notice that will be required.</P>
    <P>So far I have dealt with the safeguards to be applied when the enduring power is being created.  Subsequently, when the donor becomes or is becoming mentally incapable, the attorney must apply to the Registrar of Wards of Court to have the power registered. Before applying, the attorney must notify the persons who were informed of the creation of the power that he or she intends to do so.  The notice will tell them of their rights to object to the registration and specify the grounds of objection set out in the Bill.  If those persons have died, are mentally incapable or if their whereabouts are unknown, notice must be given to not more than three relatives from groups comprising the donor's spouse, children, parents and siblings, in that order.  However, if at least one person in any group would be entitled to get notice, then notice must be given to all the persons in that group.  For example, if a donor is married with four children, the spouse and all the children must be notified.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the need to serve these notices and to allow time for any objections to be raised and for the registration to take place, the attorney is being authorised, once application has been made to register the power, to act under it to maintain the donor or to prevent loss to the donor's estate.  The attorney may also maintain himself or herself or <Col N="1245" /> other persons within the limits set out in section 6(4).  Under that provision the attorney may do whatever the donor might be expected to do to meet the attorney's needs or those of other persons. The court is also being empowered by section 8 to intervene, if necessary, at any time before registration has been effected.</P>
    <P>Section 10 deals with the procedure for registration.  Registration will be automatic unless a valid notice of objection has been received or a person to whom notice must be given has not been notified by the attorney or there is reason to believe that appropriate inquiries might bring to light evidence establishing one or more of the grounds of objection specified in the section &mdash; for example, that the donor was not, or was not becoming mentally incapable or that the attorney was unsuitable to be the donor's attorney or that fraud or undue pressure was used to induce the donor to create the power.</P>
    <P>Once the enduring power is registered the attorney may proceed to exercise the authority given by it and the donor may no longer validly revoke the power unless the revocation is confirmed by the court.  The attorney cannot disclaim the power unless the donor is notified and the court consents.</P>
    <P>The scope of the authority given by the enduring power can be a general authority under which the attorney can do anything the donor can do by attorney or it can be limited to a specified part of the donor's property or affairs.  In either case it may be subject to conditions or restrictions imposed by the donor.</P>
    <P>I already referred to the power which an attorney may exercise &mdash; subject to any such conditions or restrictions &mdash; to provide for his or her own needs or those of other persons to the extent that the donor might be expected to do. Section 6 (5) goes further and authorises an attorney to make gifts out of the donor's property subject to certain conditions. The first is that specific provision to that effect must be made in the instrument creating the power.  The gifts <Col N="1246" /> must be of a seasonal nature or in connection with a birth or marriage or an anniversary and the recipients, who may include the attorney, must be related to or connected with the donor.  The gifts may be to a charity to which the donor made or might be expected to make gifts.  There is an overriding condition that the value of each gift must not be unreasonable having regard to all, the circumstances and, in particular, the size of the donor's estate.  It is also subject to any other conditions or restrictions that the donor may have included in the power.</P>
    <P>These are extensive powers and they may be exercised so long as the enduring power is registered.  However, provision is made in section 12 for the court to intervene after registration when applied to by the donor, the attorney or, indeed, any interested party.  On such an application the court can give directions on a wide range of matters such as the rendering of accounts by the attorney, the attorney's remuneration or expenses and the repayment of excessive remuneration.  It may authorise the attorney to act for his or her own benefit or for other persons over and above what is permitted under section 6, but always subject to any conditions or restrictions in the enduring power.</P>
    <P>In an appropriate case the court may cancel a registration.  It would do so, for example, if it was satisfied that the donor was, and was likely to remain, mentally capable; that the attorney was unsuitable to be the donor's attorney; or that fraud or undue pressure had been used to induce the donor to create the power.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides protection for attorneys where an instrument has been registered although it did not create a valid enduring power.  That should not occur very often having regard to the safeguards being provided when these powers are created.  There could, however, be technical defects in the execution process, such as the attestation of signatures, which could render an enduring power invalid and which might not have been detected before <Col N="1247" /> registration.  If some such defects exist, section 13 provides that transactions between an attorney and a third party will be valid in favour of that person unless the attorney knows of the invalidity of the power.  There will be a presumption that a purchaser from the third party will be protected either if the purchase is completed within 12 months of the date of registration or if the third party makes a statutory declaration, before the purchase is completed or within three months afterwards, that he or she had no reason to doubt the attorney's authority.  These protections are in line with those available at present in relation to ordinary powers of attorney and which are restated later in section 18.</P>
    <P>Section 14 is a technical provision which, along with the Second Schedule, deals with the application of this Part to cases where more than one person is appointed attorney under an enduring power.  Attorneys may be appointed to act either jointly or jointly and severally. If they are appointed jointly, one cannot act without the other.  If they are appointed jointly and severally, any of them can act.</P>
    <P>Part III is concerned with updating the law on powers of attorney generally. The main provisions are those in sections 15 and 16.  Section 15 amends the law relating to the execution of a power of attorney in three respects: it enables the power to be signed by another person in the donor's presence and by the donor's direction where the donor is physically incapable of signing &mdash; but in that case that person's signature must be witnessed; it requires the power to be signed by the donee; and the power need not be under seal. Section 16, together with the Third Schedule, provides a simple form of general power of attorney which will enable a donee to do anything the donor can lawfully do by attorney.  A form to the like effect can also be used but it must be expressed to be made under this legislation.  The remaining sections are of a technical character and <Col N="1248" /> they would be best left for consideration on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>As Senators will see, the most important provisions are contained in Part II and relate to enduring powers of attorney.  I have no doubt from the reaction to the Bill on publication that this House will be disposed to give a general welcome to its provisions.  The Bill is carefully framed to achieve a proper balance between avoiding an unduly complex procedure for the creation of these powers and minimising the risk of possible abuse.  I expect that many people will wish to avail of the opportunity presented by the Bill to decide for themselves who should manage their affairs when they are not in a position to do so.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and that he is initiating another Bill here.  He said he had no doubt from the reaction to the Bill that the House will be disposed to give it a general welcome and I certainly do.  My remarks to the Leader of the House which he perceived as criticism were not so.  As Fianna Fáil spokesperson on equality and law reform, I like to have a thorough understanding of legislation. My understanding of this Bill is not as thorough as I would wish, although I am familiar with its precept and content.  I hope that by Committee Stage I will have spoken with people such as those from the Alzheimer Society of Ireland to ensure their requirements are covered.  That is why I directed that question to the Leader.  I was surprised he reacted so strongly to it.</P>
      <P>This legislation is welcome.  As the Minister said, at present powers of attorney are automatically revoked if a donor becomes mentally incapable. Given that the population is ageing, perhaps it was not imperative that the legislation be introduced on the last day of this session, but it is required to address the needs of those who are mentally incapable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The validity of powers of attorney are frequently questioned.  A person cannot arrange in advance to give somebody <Col N="1249" /> the authority to handle his or her affairs when at a later date he or she becomes incapable.  As the Minister said, the only mechanism under the law as it stands is that such a person would be made a ward of court.  I understand this can be an expensive process.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives effect to an enduring power of attorney which gives an authority that continues in force even if the donor becomes mentally incapable. There are a number of safeguards to which the Minister referred.  Power of attorney must be arranged in advance but may not be registered until the donor becomes incapable.  The attorney must give notice of the registration to the donor and to certain relations or friends who may be specified in the document.  A solicitor or doctor may need to state that the donor understood or had the mental capacity to understand the effect of creating the power when it was signed.  The safeguards contained in the Bill are welcome.</P>
    <P>The Bill appears to contain the necessary safeguards for both the donor and the person receiving the power of attorney.  Both carry equal weight of responsibility and the Minister has managed to cover this aspect and provide safeguards.  However, on Committee Stage, perhaps the Minister could address one specific area which may not be covered by the Bill.  The Bill gives wide-ranging powers and the Minister said he may introduce the extended powers of attorney by regulation.  Does this apply to a case where the donor is hospitalised and the type of care with which the donor would be provided during his or her lifetime?  The Minister said the attorney has the right to administer the estate and conveyancing is also covered.  However, I am not sure whether the Bill covers the type of care that somebody who has become incapable needs.</P>
    <P>The restrictions placed by the Minister on the type of functions available to an attorney are welcome.  Responsibilities are also placed on an attorney and there is the safeguard that people must <Col N="1250" /> be informed when the document is being registered.  The Minister mentioned that in an appropriate case the court may cancel a registration if it is satisfied that the donor was, or was likely to remain, mentally capable or the attorney was unsuitable to be the donor's attorney.  Will it be difficult to have a power of attorney reversed or is it a reasonably simple process?  When somebody gives power of attorney, there is always a fear that something will go wrong and that they will not be looked after as well as they hoped. However, when somebody selects a person as their attorney, I presume they will choose somebody whom they feel they can trust in the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the court can refuse to register the power of attorney or can revoke the powers after registration on any of the following grounds: the enduring power was not or is no longer valid; the donor is not becoming mentally incapable; that, having regard to all the circumstances, the attorney is not suitable to be the donor's attorney; or that fraud or undue pressure was used to induce the donor to create the power. These are worthwhile safeguards but will they be easy to implement?</P>
    <P>I do not feel I have adequately dealt with Second Stage of this Bill.  As the Minister is aware, I am the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on Equality and Law Reform and I usually approach Second Stages of Bills in a much more thorough fashion.  I did not expect this Bill to be taken today but I look forward to dealing with it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate him on his initiative in introducing the Bill.  The Minister has initiated other Bills in the House and since it is the end of the session, we should congratulate him for doing so.  The House has responded well to the initiation of Bills, which have been improved by suggestions from this side of the House and amendments from the other side.  These have improved the quality of legislation processed by the House and the Minister <Col N="1251" /> should be congratulated for accepting them.  The Minister for Justice, who is in the news today, is also very open to the views of the House and has accepted amendments which have improved the quality of legislation.  Both Ministers are an example to other Ministers by the way in which they approach the work of the Seanad.</P>
      <P>This Bill will reduce the trauma for families when a relative of any age becomes mentally incapable.  This does not necessarily apply only to an elderly relative because a younger person can have an accident or suffer a stroke and become mentally incapable.</P>
      <P>The Bill gives effect to the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission and the Alzheimer Society of Ireland who have done excellent work in this area.  The Bill will ensure that the persons granted these new powers of attorney can manage the property and affairs of the persons concerned if and when they become mentally incapable. It is important to provide safeguards in this area since enormous powers are being given to people who in most cases are outside the family.</P>
      <P>The Minister has included these safeguards in the Bill in that a solicitor must be satisfied that the person granting the enduring power understands the effects of creating it and that it is not being granted as a result of any undue influence. This is most important.  A doctor must be satisfied as to the person's mental capacity when granting the power. The Minister has also ensured that specified persons must be notified by the donor that the power has been granted and he expanded on this aspect during his contribution.  The power will not come into effect until it has been registered in the court and there are no valid objections by the persons concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In its report published in 1989, the Law Reform Commission stated that there was a clear case for the review of the law governing powers of attorney generally and for the introduction of legislation governing the creation and <Col N="1252" /> operation of powers of attorney.  Powers of attorney are most frequently used when the donor will be absent from Ireland.  They are given either for a special purpose, such as the sale of the donor's house, or a general purpose, for example, to manage the donor's property and investments in Ireland while he or she is abroad.</P>
    <P>There is no provision in this jurisdiction for enduring powers of attorney. The result is that a person who is concerned that he or she may become incapable of managing his or her affairs is unable to make provision for that possibility.  It appears one result of the increase in the life expectancy of the population is an increase in the number of people who will become senile.  The Minister referred to figures in that respect during his contribution.</P>
    <P>At present, a person who wishes to deal with the possibility of becoming incapable of managing their affairs may only hope that an arrangement will be made in due course to have him or her made a ward of court.  This is a very expensive and traumatic process for a family.  The power of attorney is a document which one person gives to another to act on his or her behalf concerning financial and property affairs.  At present, this is automatically revoked if a donor become mentally incapable and this causes major problems for families. For example, it is often unclear when a donor becomes incapable, particularly in the case of a person's failing powers because of the onset of old age.  When does one decide that a person is incapable in the process of them becoming less mentally aware?</P>
    <P>At present, there is no means by which a person can privately arrange in advance to give someone the authority to handle his or her affairs when he or she becomes incapable at a later date. As I mentioned earlier, the only mechanism in the law as it stands provides that such a person must become a ward of court.  This can cause extreme stress for a family at a very difficult time.</P>
    <P>The process of obtaining wardship of court is also expensive and results in the <Col N="1253" /> person's financial affairs being managed by the court or court officials.  The Bill before the House changes the present unsatisfactory situation.  It gives an enduring power of attorney, which will give an authority which continues in force even if the donor becomes mentally incapable.  The representative &mdash; legally referred to as the attorney &mdash; may, under the Bill, manage the property and affairs of the donor and may specify things on the donor's behalf.  He may act on the donor's behalf with the prior authority of the donor.</P>
    <P>I welcome the safeguards contained in the Bill to ensure the protection against abuse, which is important.  The power of attorney can only be acted upon when the attorney has reason to believe that the donor is or is becoming mentally incapacitated.  The attorney must then apply to register the power of attorney in the wards of court office.  A strict procedure must be followed to ensure this.  The attorney must give notice of the registration of the donor, as outlined by the Minister.  The attorney must give notice of the registration to certain relations or friends who may be specified in the document. A solicitor or doctor may have to state that the donor understands or has the mental capacity to understand the effect of creating the power when it is signed.</P>
    <P>I welcome a further safeguard in the Bill to protect the donor.  Any person served notice of intended registration can object to the registration within five weeks of the notice.  If the decision is made to give the power of attorney, the donor or any other interested party may apply to have the power revoked or to ask the court to give directions regarding the duties of attorney, for example, in filing annual accounts in court.  The court has the power to refuse to register or to revoke the power on the following grounds: that the power is no longer valid or was not valid at the time of creation; that the donor is not or is not becoming mentally incapable; that the attorney is unsuitable or that fraud or undue pressure was used to induce the donor to create the power.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1254" /> I welcome the Bill.  It is a technical but important one.  For those of us who, like Senator McGennis, are not lawyers, it does take some time to study.  I was aware of the introduction of this Bill since the end of last week and I did take some time to look at it.  It is difficult to respond spontaneously to such a complex Bill if one is not a lawyer.  I commend the Minister for introducing it and look forward to a detailed explanation of the Bill on Committee Stage when we return later in the summer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator McGennis, I welcome the Bill but I have not had much time to read it, having only received a copy of it yesterday.  As Senator Neville says, it is a complex and important Bill and it is difficult for those of us who are not lawyers to go through it.  The Law Reform Commission has been looking for a Bill along these lines for about six years, so it is most timely that the Minister has introduced it.  The Bill looks good and there are plenty of safeguards in it regarding the donor, the provisions regarding who can be a donee and the general regulations in those areas.</P>
      <P>It is important that the donor can revoke the power of attorney because there are cases where a person may be mentally incapacitated for a length of time and then make a miraculous recovery. We have to recognise that, in this country, the vast majority of people who would come under the provisions of this Bill are elderly people.  As is pointed out in the Bill, a person has to have the mental capacity to know that he is signing the power of attorney declaration before it is valid.  I do not anticipate that this would happen too often with people who had accidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that the Minister has included many safeguards regarding who can be the donee.  The exclusions he has introduced regarding those employed in nursing homes and so forth are absolutely essential.  The provisions should be strengthened even more on the amount of use the donee has of the funds of the person's estate.  For <Col N="1255" /> example, it could be written into whatever declaration the donor was making that sums of money for birthdays and so forth could not be more than £100, subject to inflation.  The area of gifts and what the donor may use for themselves in the way of funds from the estate should perhaps be specified a bit more. I would like to see that made tighter, because one person's idea of a generous birthday gift is not necessarily the same as another person's.  I would like to see some figures inserted there and also, if necessary, provisions for inflation.</P>
    <P>There is one area the Bill has not addressed, the area of advance directives and what are commonly known as &ldquo;living wills&rdquo;.  The Bill does not rule out giving the attorney power to implement advance directives by a patient but, if it is not intended, it would be wiser to insert a clause saying whether or not this is allowed.  This has been one of the areas where power of attorney has been of importance in the United States where, in 50 of the 52 states, it is now possible to make legal advance directives. In this country, that could end up being just as important, because we now have a smaller average family size and there is much emigration.  There is internal migration within America and a large number of older people end up in the sun states without the benefit, in times of severe illness, of a close relative being at hand to say what they do or do not think the person would like.</P>
    <P>These directives are not that difficult to draft.  I have one here from the state of Texas, which starts off much the same as a declaration giving power of attorney:</P>
    <P>I,..., being of sound mind, wilfully and voluntarily make known my desire that my life shall not be artificially prolonged under the circumstances set forth in this directive.</P>
    <P>The directive is a short statement, but the thought of the prolonging of their life in circumstances which they might not want can be as difficult a problem for the elderly as can what happens to <Col N="1256" /> their property.  I recommend to the Minister to read a book called <i>Life's Dominion</i> by Ronald Dworkin, which goes into the pros and cons of giving people the right to have an advance directive in great detail.  The Department should consider this issue, because it is a serious issue for elderly people who may feel that they do not want resuscitation, which may only prolong their lives for about a month, in situations that they feel would be miserable for them.</P>
    <P>I would like to see this issue addressed in this Bill.  We do not have to constantly introduce complex legislation for such areas.  Only this morning, I picked up four copies of a bulletin of medical ethics, all trying to deal with this issue in Europe.  Why is Ireland's voice not as good as any other country's in discussing this issue?  This idea is not associated in any way with euthanasia. It is allowing those, who will almost always be elderly people, to say what amount of resuscitation they want in certain circumstances.  Some people will say that they want resuscitation to the last moment, whereas there are others who will say the opposite.  If it is not intended that this Bill deal with that situation it should be clearly stated that this is so.  It dovetails to deal with the property and affairs of whoever is involved and one's medical affairs may be far more important to a person than what will happen to one's inheritance. I would prefer to address this now and consider including it in the Bill rather than have another complex conversation in a few years time.  Plenty of other jurisdictions have introduced such legislation and we are not less competent philosophically, mentally, emotionally or intellectually to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister and his advisers take what I have said into consideration and that we can discuss it further.  Perhaps I could introduce an amendment if the Minister does not find time to do so before the autumn.  This matter could be addressed here and that would be useful to the medical and nursing professions. <Col N="1257" /> These are people who have been mentally incapacitated and this is what thev want at the end of their lives.  I hope the Minister will address that in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Like previous speakers I was taken by surprise when I found this legislation on today's Order of Business. I did not get much time to consider it but at least it is an area with which I am familiar.  This quiet little Bill, slipped in on our last day before the recess, has the potential to affect every one of us. From now on we will all be capable of making an enduring power of attorney and it should be considered by everybody. This will become law during the next session and I hope there will be an information campaign to make people aware of this useful new development.</P>
      <P>This initiative was recommended by the Law Reform Commission and was also sought by the Alzheimer Society and the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland.  The existing ordinary power of attorney under common law allows people with full mental capacity to make provision for matters which may arise when they are unable to attend to them.  For example, I have drawn up powers of attorney for soldiers going abroad to the Lebanon who wanted their affairs dealt with in their absence. However, the powers immediately cease if the person becomes mentally incapacitated. The family of the person who is unfortunate enough to suffer a lapse of mental capacity is then forced to employ solicitors and barristers and attend to the complex procedure of a ward of court application.  This takes a long time and costs a great deal of money.  It is not within everybody's range and it is not cost effective for people with a small sum of money to make a ward of court application because all the money would be spent on the application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is sound legislation.  As usual the Minister has ensured a comprehensive procedure framed in simple terms.  We will not be put through hoops in order to grant a power of attorney.  At the <Col N="1258" /> same time adequate and necessary safeguards are provided in the Bill.  Everyone approaching old age fears losing his senses and ending up like so many others sitting in the corners of old folk's homes or hospitals, totally incapacitated and unaware of what is happening.  It must be frightening for people who gradually become incapacitated.  Each one of us could be affected.  It is reassuring to know one has the power to take matters into one's own hands and if something unfortunate happens, one has already provided for one's most important wishes and requirements.  It is a marvellous safeguard.  Just as one should make a will, one should make an enduring power of attorney.</P>
    <P>The Bill is well drafted.  The safeguards are essential because we must ensure that people granting such a power are not doing so under undue influence.  It is crucial that those powers are incorporated to ensure the independence of the person involved and the expression of his true intentions.  It is important that the Bill clarifies when the power will come into effect and when a person can be deemed mentally incapacitated or mentally incapable. This problem arises on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>I am often called to the local old folk's home to make a will only to find, having talked with the person, they cannot remember what I asked them five minutes previously.  Yet, a relation has said this person wants to make a will. One must be concerned that there is not some undue influence involved.  It is important to have a safeguard to determine when somebody is mentally incapable of looking after his own affairs.  The legislation proposed by the Minister is very sensible in that area.</P>
    <P>The legislation affects everybody but when one looks at the number of people suffering from senility, it is obviously serious legislation in terms of its potential impact.  We often underestimate how people wish to provide for their own affairs under varying circumstances. This Bill allows them to do so with adequate safeguards.  Somebody mentioned that there should be restrictions <Col N="1259" /> on the allocation of the person's income and this is important.  It is crucial to provide accounts.  The person receiving the power of attorney should be obliged to submit accounts, either to the wards of court office or elsewhere on an annual basis to ensure supervision of how the power of attorney is being administered.</P>
    <P>The Minister should examine this area because safeguards are important. Money tends to corrupt even in the hands of well-intentioned people.  It is often difficult to determine what the donor intended because the power of attorney may not be specifically clear on matters as they arise.  It is important to ensure some control on how the person receiving the power of attorney administers it.</P>
    <P>The Bill takes a sensible approach and provides something that was badly needed.  We may not have heard it being shouted from the rooftops every day of the week but if affects everybody.  The safeguards are adequate but I would prefer to see a provision requiring annual accounts.  It is a sensible Bill and I look forward to discussing it in the next session.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers I would have preferred advance notice of the Bill.  I give it a certain welcome but I am not sure how relevant it is.  In the last few years it has been virtually impossible to persuade people to make a will but we are now introducing legislation to improve powers of attorney, which may be granted for many purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reasons for taking out power of attorney include the purchase of property or being out of the country for a period.  It is suggested that soldiers going to the Lebanon would take out power of attorney but I imagine less than 0.01 per cent of them do so.  That is an example of when one might use this power but it does not often happen. A person takes out power of attorney under companies legislation because he cannot deal with his affairs.  He gives <Col N="1260" /> power of attorney to another person until such time as he puts his affairs in order.  What is the position in this regard?</P>
    <P>Under this legislation the attorney gives notice of the registration to the donor.  If that notice is given, the donor must be deemed to have been incapacitated at that time.  What is the point of giving notice to the donor of the registration? If the person is not incapacitated mentally, why give notice?  The Bill provides that the registration will occur only after the attorney has given notice of the registration, which suggests the donor is incapacitated.  Naturally, the Law Society welcomes this legislation because its members will get more business.</P>
    <P>Problems occur when people get Alzheimer's disease but the number who will benefit from this Bill will be minimal, because people do not expect to get the disease.  Should we recommend that everyone takes out powers of attorney in case he suffers from Alzheimer's in the future?  Are we suggesting that if a person gets Alzheimer's his relatives will be in trouble, because they would have been better off to take out power of attorney?</P>
    <P>The Bill needs more consideration than we are giving it today and I am glad we will have time during the summer to think about it.  The most important effects this Bill might have are first, to persuade people to make a will and second, if a person was out of the country or had problems, to persuade him to take out power of attorney or give such power to another person. Normally one gives power of attorney to a solicitor or someone else with knowledge of the law, because there is little point giving it to someone without such a background.</P>
    <P>There are many forms of mental incapacity. At present we hear most about Alzheimer's disease but people can become mentally incapacitated at any time of life.  If the Bill suggests people should make a will and at the same time take out power of attorney it is worthy legislation, because it would make <Col N="1261" /> people conscious that they may become incapacitated.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the donor must understand and have the mental capacity to understand the consequences of creating the power.  This will not help 90 per cent of the carers of people with Alzheimer's, because they would not have taken out power of attorney before contracting the disease. People must be made aware that they could become mentally incapacitated and may need someone to look after their affairs.  If that is the reason for the Bill, that is its strength but people must be persuaded to take out power of attorney.  However, if one makes a will it need not cost anything but to take out power of attorney one has to go to a solicitor and use the legal system, which costs money.  I say that although members of my family are in the legal profession; I do not know how they would respond to that statement.</P>
    <P>The need for safeguards arises because one member of the family may see another becoming incapacitated and put pressure on the first person to take out power of attorney.  This is where problems arise.  It is difficult to decide at what stage in a person's incapacity pressure may be applied.  No psychiatrist will decide a person was sane and capable of making a decision on a particular day and was neither sane nor capable the following day.  There are grave medical difficulties in deciding when a person is and is not capable of giving power of attorney.</P>
    <P>I have difficulties with this legislation. The court can refuse to register the power of attorney or revoke it if the enduring power is no longer valid or if the donor is not, or is not becoming, mentally incapable.  How will a judge decide whether someone is capable?  If he needs help from a group of psychiatrists, there will be an increase in legal costs for a person when a court must decide whether he is incapable. There will be a bonanza for someone and that might occur when it is not necessary to adjudicate whether someone is capable of dealing with his affairs <Col N="1262" /> or whether the power of attorney should be continued.</P>
    <P>The court can decide, having regard to all the circumstances, that the attorney is unsuitable.  A person may choose to give his solicitor power of attorney but if a decision has to be made to continue that power, a court will decide whether the person should have chosen that solicitor.  That is crazy, if I am interpreting it correctly.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry signalled the real significance of the Bill when speaking about euthanasia and advance directives. She said if a person decides in certain circumstances to end his life and gives another person power of attorney to carry that out&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information, I did not say that.  I said &ldquo;not to be resuscitated&rdquo; and I said that this had nothing to do with euthanasia.  They are two totally different things and it is very important to separate them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>We should not get into the nuances of language as to whether euthanasia amounts to life being terminated or not.  What is being suggested is that if I give power of attorney to somebody to make certain that the doctor does not resuscitate me if I have some sort of problem, the attorney has to carry out my directives in that regard. That person has to decide whether I am to die or not.  The power of attorney is absolute in that sense.  It means that the poor person to whom I am giving power of attorney has to follow through on my wishes even though those wishes might be against the tenets of medicine.  That element is being brought in.  We are saying that if I give power of attorney to somebody they have to carry out my wishes irrespective of the laws of the land and irrespective of the medical profession.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Minister for Health to defer the signing of the Draft Regulations pursuant to the Health Insurance Act, 1994, to allow new negotiations to take place with hospitals and health insurers, in view of the very serious implications that these regulations would have for public and private psychiatric patients and services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy O'Shea, to the House.  As the Fianna Fáil frontbench spokesperson on health I am calling on the Minister for Health not to sign the new regulations pursuant to the Health Insurance Act, 1994, because in their present form they will discriminate against people who suffer from psychiatric illness.  Under the proposed new regulations VHI cover will reduce from the present 180 days to a minimum of 40 days psychiatric in-patient treatment per year.  This is a major change and a clear attack on one of the most vulnerable sections of society.  If the Minister <Col N="1264" /> signs these regulations it will result in over 1,000 patients leaving psychiatric hospitals each year before their in-patient treatment is complete.  Other medical illnesses will continue to have 180 days insurance cover.  This clearly discriminates against psychiatric illnesses such as depression, manic depression and schizophrenia which have just as much medical and biological basis as diabetes or heart disease.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health maintains that these regulations are necessary to enable other insurance companies to enter the Irish market.  Through these regulations the Minister is following the requirements of insurance companies which have always discriminated against people with psychiatric illnesses when providing travel insurance, mortgage protection and critical illness cover. Insurance opportunities are being taken up here by companies from outside the State which have traditionally discriminated against people in the psychiatric sector.</P>
    <P>It is one thing for insurance companies to discriminate but it is quite another matter when the State joins with them in that discrimination.  On this occasion, the Minister should show a firm hand in not signing these regulations.  The Minister's first obligation is to provide proper medical care for the citizens of the State and to protect their interests.  If that means standing up to the vested interests of health insurers then the Minister should not be found wanting as far as psychiatric patients are concerned. I call on the Minister, as a matter of duty and responsibility, to stand up for such patients.</P>
    <P>There is grave concern among health care workers about this matter.  I have been contacted by private hospitals, Aware, the Schizophrenia Association and Alzheimer Association, all of which are perturbed about what is being proposed.</P>
    <P>I know that regulations have to be brought in under the new terms of health cover because the sector is not regulated at the moment.  I compliment the VHI on the excellent cover they <Col N="1265" /> have provided over the years and the great service they have given to the public. Now, however, we will have competition which usually means an even better service but instead of that a diminution or removal of services is being proposed.</P>
    <P>The reduction from 180 days to 40 days for psychiatric in-patient treatment cover is to accommodate outside insurers operating here.  Elsewhere, in the past, these people have not provided the same level of cover as the VHI.  We should not and cannot allow them to discriminate between general medicine and psychiatric medicine.  Why should someone who is psychiatrically ill have a different set of rules governing their health cover from someone in a general hospital?  It is totally obnoxious that this regulation should be introduced at all.  I call on the Minister to stand up for psychiatric patients.  He should indicate that under no circumstances will he sign these draft regulations and that new negotiations will be entered into.</P>
    <P>Proper insurance cover and equal treatment should be provided to psychiatric patients.  I hope the Minister will respond positively. Psychiatric patients and health care workers throughout the country are listening to this debate and the Minister's response is eagerly awaited.  I hope the Minister will respond positively and we can promise equal treatment for psychiatric patients. We should be able to promise the level of cover provided to physically ill patients and that we will protect their interests, not the interests of those providing insurance cover.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a great pleasure for me to second this motion.  I sincerely thank the Leader, Senator Manning, for having so kindly arranged this debate which I specifically requested.  I do not want a Minister bashing session; I have no wish to score political points.  My concern was and remains the plight of a large body of patients who suffer from psychiatric illness.  We are all familiar with the caricature of a person who buttonholes <Col N="1266" /> one at a party to tell one about the intricacies and intimacies of his or her latest operation.  However, it is not so common to be buttonholed by someone who has recovered from depression or from an acute psychosis.  Generally these people like to forget about their illness and get on with their lives.  I wish to be a voice for the voiceless on this occasion.</P>
      <P>Recently there has been much greater public acceptance of mental illness following public education through debates, lectures and so on.  Indeed, St. John of God and St. Patrick's hospitals have been to the forefront of the provision of public education on mental illness. To date the sufferings of the mentally ill have not been voiced. Thankfully the Minister has not yet signed the draft regulations.</P>
      <P>Up to now people in need of in-patient psychiatric treatment and insured with the VHI have been entitled to 180 days in-patient treatment in each year. People suffering from alcohol dependency and other forms of substance abuse have been entitled to 90 days in-patient treatment every five years.  If the Minister signs these regulations, companies who in future wish to offer health insurance in Ireland need only provide a maximum of 40 days in-patient treatment per year and, for alcohol or other substance abuse, only 40 days in-patient treatment in a patient's lifetime.  That cannot be fair.  I have been reliably informed by insurers that the proposed minimum cover period will become the norm if these regulations are signed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many patients recover quickly from psychiatric illness but a substantial number require long term in-patient treatment and the patients who will be most seriously affected by these changes include sufferers from serious psychiatric illnesses such as manic depression, schizophrenia, anorexia nervosa, and psychiatric disorders associated with physical disease and ageing.  In psychiatry we do not use millions of pounds worth of expensive equipment, we do not use highly expensive diagnostic tests, or high technology therapy, yet if <Col N="1267" /> the Minister signs these regulations it is only the mentally ill who will be discriminated against.  The physically ill will get maximum, highly expensive cover and hospital care, but not those with a psychiatric illness.</P>
    <P>This is happening because the terms have been dictated by British health insurers.  If these major players in the health insurance field have their way and if the Minister gives in to their pressure, the result will be nothing short of catastrophic.  Some 90 per cent of all in-patient psychiatric treatment within the health insurance sector is provided by two hospitals, St. John of God and St. Patrick's.  Both are non-profit hospitals and the imposition of these changes will compel them to increase costs to a level close to that charged by equivalent private psychiatric hospitals in the United Kingdom.  That is a rate between two and four times what they currently charge.</P>
    <P>These hospitals have long traditions of quality care.  I worked with one of them for 25 years.  Not only do people come from all over Ireland to these hospitals; they come from abroad. There is no questioning the care that is provided.  We have received letters from many people including directors of both these hospitals, Dr. Conall Larkin of St. John of God and Dr. Anthony Clare from St. Patrick's.  Both men are competent, brilliant, caring doctors and are concerned that their hospitals will have to increase costs to patients.  These restrictions on in-patient psychiatric care together with the miserly recommended minimum rate for psychiatric day care, £25 per patient per day, will in effect mean that the role currently played by the private psychiatric services which accounts for 15 per cent of the overall provision of in-patient psychiatric care will be substantially eroded.  That is not what the Minister wants.  He is a caring man, from what I know of him, and perhaps his advisers did not give this matter sufficient thought before recommending this course of action to him.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1268" /> I ask him not to sign these regulations but to defer them.  He should talk to the people involved and come up with a solution that will not discriminate against psychiatric patients.  The real impact of these changes will be borne by patients who are most seriously affected by psychiatric illness and by their families. I demand that the mentally ill be treated no differently from patients suffering from physical illness and I beseech the Minister to see that the levels of cover currently provided by the VHI for psychiatric in-patient treatment should be the recommended minimum levels in the new regulations pursuant to the Health Insurance Act, 1994.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Third EU Directive on Non-Life Insurance came into effect on 1 July 1994, throughout the European Union.  This directive, which was part of the development of the Single Market, provided for competition in the private health insurance market and meant that overseas insurers were free to enter the Irish private health insurance market if they wished.</P>
      <P>When the directive was being drafted by the European Commission, it was agreed, on this country's initiative, in the interests of social and intergenerational solidarity, that the Directive should allow member states to sell policies which were community rated and also to practice open enrolment and lifetime cover.  It also allowed member states to require insurers to provide standard contracts-minimum benefit and to participate in a loss compensation-risk equalisation scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Health Insurance Act, 1994, which came into effect on 1 July 1994, was designed to allow for competition and to regulate the private health insurance market in accordance with the provisions of the Third Non-Life Directive. It requires health insurers to comply with the principles of community rating &mdash; an insurer must charge the same rate of premium for a given level of benefits irrespective of age, sex or <Col N="1269" /> health status &mdash; open enrolment under which an insurer is required, with certain qualifications, to provide cover to any individual who wishes to enrol and lifetime cover under which an insurer may not, with certain qualifications, refuse to renew cover once an individual has enrolled.  The protection of these principles was seen as crucial in ensuring access to private health insurance.</P>
    <P>The draft health insurance regulations, published by my Department in March, give effect to the supporting framework necessary to ensure the successful operation of the system of community rated health insurance provided for in the 1994 Health Insurance Act.</P>
    <P>The principal objectives in framing the regulatory framework for private health insurance are to maintain the current system of community rating, open enrolment and lifetime cover, to provide a &ldquo;level playing field&rdquo; for all health insurers with the minimum regulation possible, to structure the regulatory environment in order to maximise the incentives to heath insurers and health care providers to operate efficiently and to maintain the position of private practice within the well established public/private mix.</P>
    <P>The draft health insurance regulations comprise of five sets of regulations. These are regulations on registration, open enrolment, lifetime cover, minimum benefits and risk equalisation. The minimum benefit regulations set out a level of cover across a broad range of services which every insurer operating here must offer as a minimum. The minimum range includes general hospitals, outpatient and maternity benefits, convalescence, psychiatric treatment, substance abuse and day care.</P>
    <P>The minimum benefit levels have been set at the lowest level so as not to be perceived as presenting a barrier to trade while at the same time giving a protection to consumers by ensuring they will at least receive a minimum level of cover across a broad range of services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1270" /> In respect of psychiatric in-patient treatment, the regulations require insurers to provide minimum benefit in respect of in-patient psychiatric treatment for a period of 40 days in any one year.  I must emphasise that this is only a minimum period which is designed to set a basic level of cover for in-patient psychiatric treatment.  It is the first time that insurers will be required to provide cover for psychiatric treatment on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>The draft regulations had contained a provision which allowed insurers to require that treatment plans for psychiatric treatment be submitted to them for approval prior to admission, other than in an emergency.  Following representations, this has been withdrawn.</P>
    <P>When deciding to include in-patient psychiatric treatment in the minimum benefits regulations, we were aware that many overseas insurers do not cover psychiatric in-patient treatment or if they do so, cover up to approximately 30 days only.  Almost all require prior approval of treatment plans.  By including psychiatric treatment in minimum benefits, we are ensuring that all insurers wishing to operate in the Irish private health insurance market must offer at least a minimum cover of 40 days.  If it were not included in the minimum benefit regulations it is likely that insurers would treat it as they currently do in their home State.</P>
    <P>On arriving at 40 days as a minimum figure, we had to try to strike a balance between protecting the consumer and ensuring that we were not placing a barrier to trade to insurers who wished to enter the market.  Over 70 per cent of all discharges from psychiatric hospitals occur within 40 days.  It should also be noted that 15 per cent of all psychiatric in-patient treatment is provided by private psychiatric hospitals.</P>
    <P>The minimum benefit requirements for in-patient treatments for alcoholism, drug or other substance abuse is for a total of 40 days in-patient treatment for the whole period for which cover is provided by one or more insurers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1271" /> In relation to the benefits payable to private psychiatric hospitals for in-patient and day-patient services, these have been set at the lowest market level so as not to be inherently inflationary.  If they were set any higher a situation could arise whereby a hospital which charges rates lower than the minimum benefit would be paid at the higher level.</P>
    <P>The specific issue of day care cover is ill-defined.  The Department is currently examining the possibility of dropping the requirement for day care cover in the regulations and having it studied by the assessor later this year in a review of the minimum benefit regulations.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed at the arrival of profit motivated commercial companies in this country on the grounds that they will put profits before the welfare of their members.  The reality is that as a consequence of our membership of the EU, we must participate in the development of the Single Market which means allowing overseas commercial companies to operate in our country on a commercial basis. However, the Health Insurance Act, 1994, and these regulations allow us to ensure that competition in the private health insurance market will take place on terms which ensure the greatest possible equity for all those who wish to buy private health insurance.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the minimum benefit regulations do not adversely constrain the development of a competitive market in private health insurance in Ireland.  We must leave insurers with sufficient flexibility to develop imaginative, innovative packages of health cover in the interest of the customer. The EU Commission would not accept a regulatory framework which would require insurers to offer benefit which simply repeated the 180 days hospital cover available from the dominant insurer.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Health will appoint a minimum benefits assessor in the autumn as provided for in the Health Insurance Act, 1994.  The assessor's role will involve the review of the minimum benefit regulations to take account of developments in the private health insurance market, new technology and procedures and inflation.  The regulations can be changed to incorporate the recommendations made to the Minister by the assessor.</P>
      <P>Departmental officials have consulted a wide range of interest groups, including public and private sector providers, since the publication of the draft regulations. It is expected that these consultations will be completed in the next week.  The Department will then consider all the issues which have been brought to their attention during the consultation phase.  I will, of course, bring to the Minister's attention the views expressed in the House this afternoon. It is anticipated that a final copy of the regulations will be submitted to the Minister for his approval and signature in the near future.  The regulations will then be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as provided for in the Health Insurance Act, 1994.</P>

      <P>I raised this issue last Tuesday on the Adjournment and I was <Col N="1273" /> not satisfied with the reply given by the Minister of State, Deputy Currie.</P>
      <P>As other Senators said, the proposed changes will discriminate against the psychiatrically ill.  The levels of treatment and support will be eroded leaving only crisis management in the private psychiatric service and the burden will fall on the families of the sufferers.  I cannot understand why the Minister refused to meet concerned professionals in this area if he is so sure of his views and of how right he is in introducing these regulations.</P>
      <P>I am extremely concerned at the effects of these changes on the future availability and quality of psychiatric care.  We all know what the proposed changes entail: the reduction from 180 days, which is the extent of cover provided by the VHI at present, to a minimum of 40 days' treatment per year and the provision of only 40 days' treatment in a subscriber's lifetime for sufferers of substance abuse.  These regulations are totally unacceptable.  While it is true that many people suffering from psychiatric illnesses recover quickly with treatment, many more need long term care and support to fully recover.</P>
      <P>There is no other area of treatment in which the Minister proposes to set minimum cover periods.  By doing so in the area of psychiatric illnesses, he is discriminating against sufferers in a way which would be unthinkable if any other form of illness was involved.  If it was proposed to limit the number of days, for instance, which a patient who was having a by-pass operation could spend in hospital, it would not be acceptable and it is not acceptable in the psychiatric area.</P>
      <P>The alteration in cover for people suffering from psychiatric illnesses will reduce the role of private psychiatric services. The introduction of such a severe minimum period will have damaging effects on sufferers of psychiatric illnesses and their families, who now must bear the burden of caring for them when their health insurance cover runs out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister refused to meet representatives of the two major providers <Col N="1274" /> of private sector psychiatric care, St. Patrick's Hospital and St. John of God Hospital, and with the patient support bodies of voluntary organisations working in the area.  I cannot understand that and it is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister not to sign these proposed regulations into law at the end of the month and to meet these representatives immediately.  He should give a commitment that the level of cover currently provided by the VHI for psychiatric in-patient treatment should be the recommended minimum level in the new regulations and that the psychiatrically ill should not be treated differently from patients suffering a physical illness.</P>
    <P>I thank Professor Anthony Clare and Dr. Conall Larkin for providing helpful briefing documents.  Members have had many representations from families of psychiatrically ill patients and from patients themselves who are disturbed and concerned about this matter.  There is widespread support for changing the proposed regulations.</P>
    <P>Insurance coverage and benefits for patients with psychiatric conditions have traditionally been more or less in line with general medicine.  This approach has led to the development of the psychiatric services in the private sector, which is very different from what happens in other countries, and is something we should be proud of.  For example, in the USA, President Clinton's task force on health has attempted to look at treating psychiatric illness equally with other forms of illness.  The task force is trying to move towards our situation, while we have now decided to move away from it.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Equality and Law Reform will introduce equal status legislation later this year.  It is in preparation at present and will guarantee equal treatment in the provision of goods and services to everybody, irrespective of gender, disability, race or whatever.  I cannot understand how one arm of Government is introducing legislation to give equality to everybody, while the <Col N="1275" /> Minister is introducing regulations which would fly in the face of it.</P>
    <P>Over the years private psychiatric hospitals have played a major role clinically, through their teaching and research.  As such they play a different role from private psychiatric services in other countries.  The Minister's proposal regarding the reduction of in-patient benefits will have a huge effect on those who are suffering from schizophrenia, on those who are single, divorced or separated, on the young, on women and on patients who have to be admitted on a temporary certificate.</P>
    <P>It is apparent that the consequences of the Minister's proposal are not obvious to him.  We must defend the rights of the mentally ill, a very vulnerable group whose voice is seldom heard and for whom in the past society has often had little sympathy.  We have moved away from that, and I hope we have done so permanently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am impressed with the case made by the Minister and I understand it much better.  Some of the terms he used were excellent, for example, &ldquo;customer benefits&rdquo;, &ldquo;competition&rdquo; and &ldquo;market place&rdquo;.  This will further what we are attempting to achieve.  However, it is impossible to introduce change unless one has the support of those working in the area to be affected.  Dr. Larkin and Dr. Clare are very unhappy with the Minister's proposals.  If the Minister is intent on pursuing them he is unlikely to succeed unless he is able to listen to such voices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Honan said that the burden will fall back on families.  I understand that it will also fall back on the taxpayers, who will find that the Minister's proposal is false economy.  The wording of the motion is moderate and temperate. It states: &ldquo;That Seanad Éireann calls on the Minister to defer the signing of the Draft Regulations...&rdquo;.  Motions such as this usually contains words like &ldquo;deplore&rdquo; and &ldquo;condemn&rdquo;.  These words were not used.  I urge the Minister to rethink and to defer the signing of the <Col N="1276" /> regulations until he has had the opportunity to listen to those concerned in Saint John of God Hospital and Saint Patrick's Hospital as they are close to the patients and to the real problems.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that the regulations provide for only a minimum and other foreign health insurers do not even provide a minimum.  However, I understand this minimum will effectively become a maximum and those providing the service will be unable to provide the same level as hitherto.  I urge the Minister to reconsider and delay until he has had the opportunity to listen to those who are deeply involved.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  As the Leader of the House stated this morning, anybody who wishes to contribute to the debate will be afforded the necessary time to speak.  I welcome the debate.  Senator Maloney, Senator Finneran, Senator Lydon and other Senators have better knowledge of this subject than myself and some others.</P>
      <P>Any of us who know those who are psychiatrically ill and who have visited St. John of God Hospital and St. Patrick's Hospital know the great work that takes place there.  While hopefully many patients reach the end of the tunnel, unfortunately there are cases which are more difficult and profound.  These must be looked at.  Following the extra time and care they require, problems can be resolved.  Those of us who have known people, whether friends or relatives, suffering from a psychiatric illness know the difficulties and problems involved and how it falls back on members of their family to deal with their GPs and those who are trained in this field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased the Minister has advised that consultation is taking place.  From my dealings with the Minister and the Minister of State, I know that any meetings which experts in the field wish to have with the Ministers or their officials will take place, in the same way that such meetings between these experts and other public representatives have <Col N="1277" /> already occurred.  We should get the views of experts on this matter.</P>
    <P>The whole question of insurance cover must also be looked at.  While not knowing the full details of the treatment provided by these hospitals for those suffering from this type of illness, I am aware that with regard to other aspects of the insurance industry there are restrictions, such as cut off limits and policy excesses, where one pays the first stated amount of each claim.  In this respect, perhaps the impending competition will be good.  The VHI has served the country well but there have been complaints about the level of cover in certain areas and about risks which are not covered.</P>
    <P>It is important that we remember the patients.  As Senator Lydon remarked, they probably will not be shouting loudest, which I can confirm, having visited people in St. John of God Hospital and St. Patrick's Hospital.  EU regulations may come or go but ultimately we are dealing with people who must be helped.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to ensure that the necessary consultation takes place.  He is always available to listen, as is the Minister.  There are only a certain number of people in this field who must be talked to.  If changes are to take place so be it, but at least let us ensure that, as far as possible, it is not the patients who will suffer in the long term.  If people have to stay an extra week or month they should be looked after.</P>
    <P>I welcome the debate.  There is unity across the House on the issue.  I hope the debate, combined with the consultations that must take place, will ensure that matters are resolved satisfactorily.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The net effect of these draft regulations, if they are signed in their present form, would be seriously to curtail insurance cover for patients suffering from psychiatric ill health.  I appreciate the consultations that have occurred at official level and with representatives of those who represent the psychiatrically ill.  Nevertheless, there is a widespread view that they are not <Col N="1278" /> advancing any change in the regulations as currently drafted.  A number of requests have been made to the Minister for Health to intervene before the draft regulations are finalised and meet with the representatives of the two main institutions involved, St. Patrick's Hospital and St. John of God Hospital, the representative organisations and others who are concerned about these developments, organisations such as Aware, which has done such tremendous work on behalf of patients suffering from depression and other psychiatrically-related illnesses.  It would be an advantage if, as a result of this discussion, the Minister of State could impress upon the Minister for Health to intervene with the officials of the Department and the institutions mentioned so there can be more detailed discussion with a view to arriving at a draft agreement acceptable to the private institutions involved.</P>
      <P>The directive is sufficiently vague to allow for latitude in drafting these regulations. As the Minister of State is aware, these regulations will be laid before the Seanad for 21 days as per section 3 of the 1994 Act.  If we are not satisfied with the final draft regulations we will have the opportunity to vote them down.  That, as the Minister of State knows, is a real possibility.  The Government barely won a vote here earlier this afternoon and, on an issue such as this, it would be roundly defeated.  In the Minister's own interests it would be advisable to see if he can reach agreement with the various representative bodies before these regulations are laid before the House.  During those 21 days they will be challenged if they remain in their present state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to go over ground covered by other speakers, but the people who will be affected most by these new regulations will be psychiatric patients and their families.  Everyone knows the burden upon families in some such cases.  We all have experience of dealing with people suffering from depression and related illnesses, and we are aware of the trauma this causes for <Col N="1279" /> families.  While we have some understanding of the points of view put forward by the institutions, my concern is for the patients and their families.  They are looking to this debate to see some sign of the Department changing its view.</P>
    <P>The draft regulations as they have been drawn up will be seriously detrimental to and will discriminate against a sector of people who had adequate cover up to now.  We must examine this situation carefully as this directive which had the intention of benefiting the community will, in reality, have a negative effect.</P>
    <P>We do not comply totally with many of the directives that emanate from the EU.  In many cases we have sought derogations and time to enable us meet the requirements of directives.  The Oireachtas Library is full of EU directives which have not been fully implemented, in many cases for good reason.  There are good reasons why this directive should not be fully implemented along the lines of the regulations being drafted at present.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to talk to the organisations involved, such as Aware. We have had representations from Doctors Larkin, Clare, McKeon and others attached to the institutions involved.  I have had numerous representations from individual patients who are upset and worried.  Every Member of the House has had representations from patients who are grievously worried.  We should not upset this category of patients further.  I ask the Minister of State to persuade the Minister to discuss this matter with the interested parties before the draft regulations are laid before the House.  If they are left in their present form they will be rejected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this motion which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Minister for Health to defer the signing of the Draft Regulations pursuant <Col N="1280" /> to the Health Insurance Act, 1994, to allow new negotiations to take place with hospitals and health insurers, in view of the very serious implications that these regulations would have for public and private psychiatric patients and services.</P>
    <P>People who avail of the psychiatric services have been stigmatised for far too long.  This appears to be another attack on behalf of the insurance companies.  I would not like to think we would consider money before people.  I agree with the motion and I am glad the matter has been raised.  As they stand, the regulations would have serious implications for the welfare of psychiatric patients and for the future of the public and private psychiatric services.</P>
    <P>Up to the present people in need of psychiatric treatment and who are insured with the VHI have been entitled to 180 days in-patient treatment in each year.  People suffering from alcohol dependency and other forms of substance abuse have been entitled to 90 days in-patient treatment every five years.  According to the proposals as outlined in the draft regulations, companies who wish to offer health insurance in Ireland need only provide a minimum of 40 days in-patient treatment per year, and for alcohol and other substance abusers only 40 days in-patient treatment in a subscriber's lifetime.</P>
    <P>These proposed minimum cover areas are likely to become the norm and, as someone who worked in the psychiatric field for many years, that would be of concern to me.  Many people who suffer from psychiatric illnesses recover quickly with treatment, but successful treatment can take much longer for others.</P>
    <P>This provision will attack the way of life of people who live in rural areas. Many people from rural areas feel embarrassed going to the local psychiatric hospital and to save embarrassment to themselves and their families they take out VHI cover which allows them to go to St. John of God Hospital or elsewhere for treatment.  This is <Col N="1281" /> understandable because of the stigma that has been attached to people going to psychiatric hospitals.  This provision will attack an element of rural life.</P>
    <P>Psychiatry does not call upon highly expensive diagnostic and therapeutic technologies but relies on some highly effective treatment methods by a well trained and highly motivated psychiatric staff.  It is only psychiatry and the psychiatrically ill who are being singled out for discrimination in terms of time allowed for in-patient treatment.  No such time constraints are imposed in any other medical speciality.</P>
    <P>In many representations made to me by private hospitals, ordinary people and people working in the public and private psychiatric services, it was put to me that they are extremely worried about these regulations.  When one looks at the recommendations concerning people suffering from substance abuse the position is serious.  At present the VHI allows 90 days every five years and the draft regulations propose to allow 40 days only within a lifetime.  The incidence of alcohol and other substance abuse is not reducing; if anything, it is getting worse.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a 40-day limit constitutes a more serious discrimination against psychiatric patients and no other group is singled out for such a limit.  It will mean that people receiving private psychiatric treatment will now have to go to the already overstrained public psychiatric services.  It will include sufferers of all psychiatric illnesses, whether it is schizophrenia, psychiatric disorders associated with ageing and other physical diseases or manic depression.</P>
    <P>In certain cases people can recover in a short time.  However, if one speaks to psychiatric nurses, behavioural psychotherapists or addiction counsellors they will say that in many cases it can take people anything up to 6 months to recover &mdash; this is supported by the percentages outlined by the Minister.  What are we to do in such a situation?  The <Col N="1282" /> staff are already working in fairly overcrowded conditions.  There are staff shortages in psychiatric hospitals and we must do what we can to help them.  The constraints imposed under the draft regulations outlined by the Minister of State will cause serious problems for patients and staff in the psychiatric services.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has the power, with a stroke of pen, to make the changes which are required to look after those who are psychiatrically ill, and not to bow to the whims of the European insurance companies who seem to be making the running.  People should come before money and the insurers have a duty to provide care for the people who are paying for it.  These regulations would make a bad situation worse.  I ask the Minister of State to seriously reconsider the decision to sign these regulations into law on 30 July.</P>
    <P>It smacks of another attack on people suffering from psychiatric illnesses.  As I said earlier, I worked in that sector and I saw how life treated these people. They have always been discriminated against within the health services. Psychiatric services have never received the recognition or money to which they are entitled.  I hope the White Paper on the Mental Treatment Act, due soon, will go some way towards alleviating and highlighting some of the discrimination against those with psychiatric illnesses. We should not discriminate against such people in any way.</P>
    <P>I know the regulations are being brought in to enable other insurance companies to enter the Irish market. However, competition should not mean discrimination.  The greatest quality of care for all patients should be our priority.</P>
    <P>The Health Insurance Act, as the Minister of State outlined, provides for the appointment of an assessor whose role is to review the minimum benefit regulations.  I call on the Minister of State to move for the appointment of the assessor before these regulations are signed into law.  We agree with the motion.  We should move to appoint the <Col N="1283" /> assessor and no decision should be taken to sign the regulations into law by 30 July.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>With his experience in the psychiatric services, Senator Maloney has expressed how we all feel.  It is great that someone which such experience in this area can address the House.  I know the Minister of State has great difficulties with competition law within the European Union.  However, we have a great tradition of trying to put health before other concerns and that is most important.</P>
      <P>As the Minister pointed out, only a small proportion of those with psychiatric illnesses are in hospital for such a length of time &mdash; those with schizophrenia, severe psychoses, severe depression and so on.  We must try to put them in context and realise that early discharge of these people is disastrous for them, and can be disastrous for the community.  I do not want to appear hysterical about this but there have been cases in the very recent past of people who could not get admittance to psychiatric hospitals being involved in murder here and in England.  It is essential that there is never a compunction on people with serious psychiatric diseases to leave hospital.  That is very serious not only for themselves but for those around them.  There have been great community service improvements in psychiatric care which is laudable and that is what we all want.  However, this is very difficult for patients with very serious illnesses, and these are the people we are really talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are serious about tackling our appalling drugs problem, it is not enough to interrogate people for seven days.  We most also improve our seriously deficient treatment centres for patients who are drug dependent.  I would loathe to see the Minister of State being in a position where he had to cut back on those facilities while we have such a serious problem.  The drug situation is multi-faceted; we must <Col N="1284" /> tackle it from every angle because it is no good dealing with just one part of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I am very concerned that the European Union should be in a position to effectively impose a two tier health system on the Irish public in the context of so-called deregulation.  That is exactly what these regulations, if signed, will mean. Health care is being treated by the European Union like any other commodity or service which must be deregulated at all costs in the name of the market.</P>
      <P>What these draft regulations will mean is very simple.  As has been mentioned, health insurance companies will continue to provide 180 days in-patient cover per year for physical conditions but they will be forced to provide just 40 days cover per year for psychiatric conditions.  They will have to provide just 40 days cover during a subscriber's lifetime for substance abuse treatment.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State said that concern has been expressed at the arrival of profit motivated commercial companies in this country.  If these regulations are not brought into force these commercial bodies will have no place because people will not want to do business with them.  The regulations must not be signed or enforced.  A person in their twenties taking out private health insurance can expect to live another 50 years, during which time they are guaranteed just 40 days of in-patient cover for conditions involving substance abuse &mdash; less than one day per year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We already have a two tier health system where one-third of patients are privately insured and the rest must rely on the under-resourced and over stretched public health system.  Democratic Left has long argued for a universal system of health care which is free at the point of entry.  However, we must legislate for the world as we see it and not as we would wish to see it.  The inevitable result of these regulations will be that private patients with serious psychiatric or substance abuse conditions will be <Col N="1285" /> forced to seek care in the public system, placing even greater strain on our public facilities.</P>
    <P>In the 1980s, the VHI cover for long stay patients in psychiatric hospitals was one year &mdash; later reduced to 180 days.  In Cork city patients had to leave a private psychiatric nursing home because they could not afford to pay.  This will now happen on a very large scale at a time when the Department and the health boards are seeking to have psychiatric patients treated in the community &mdash; that system is not working but that argument is for another day.  There will be great demand for places by patients who will have to leave hospitals, placing even greater strain on public facilities while draining resources from our private facilities which currently account for 15 per cent of overall psychiatric patient provision.</P>
    <P>These regulations reinforce an ancient prejudice which I had hoped we had discarded, along with all the other shibboleths which used to pervade our society.  They reinforce the notion that those with psychiatric disorders are less ill than those with physical conditions and less deserving of society's care and protection.  That notion is unacceptable to me.  I hope the Minister will reconsider before he signs these regulations into law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. I thank the Leader for agreeing to take the Fianna Fáil motion on this matter. I am loathe to criticise the Minister of State's officials because the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, rapped my knuckles for seeming to do so in relation to another issue.  However, the Minister of State should speak to the official responsible for writing his speech because it shows an underlying lack of appreciation or understanding about this issue.</P>
      <P>I refer to the language used in the speech.  For example, it states that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The minimum benefit levels have been set at the lowest level so as not to be perceived as presenting a barrier <Col N="1286" /> to trade while at the same time giving a protection to consumers.</P>
    <P>...On arriving at 40 days as a minimum figure, we had to try to strike a balance between protecting the consumer and ensuring that we were not placing a barrier to trade to insurers who wished to enter the market.</P>
    <P>...It is essential that the minimum benefit regulations do not adversely constrain the development of a competitive market in private health insurance in Ireland.  We must leave insurers with sufficient flexibility to develop imaginative, innovative packages of health cover in the interest of the customer.</P>
    <P>No Member has referred to consumers during this debate.  Everybody, without exception, has spoken about people who are ill.  We are discussing patients not consumers or customers, as Senator Quinn referred to them.  These are people who are ill and require hospital care.  That is the first point of change which the Minister of State needs to address.</P>
    <P>As many speakers have stated, the regulations are discriminatory.  I am awaiting the Minister for Equality and Law Reform's equal status legislation. These regulations are discriminatory and would be in conflict with any equal status legislation.  If the Government proceed with signing these regulations we will attempt to amend the equal status legislation to overturn this kind of discrimination.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State's speech said that this has been forced upon us by Europe because:</P>
    <P>The EU Commission would not accept a regulatory framework which would require insurers to offer benefit which simply repeated the 180 days hospital cover available from the dominant insurer.</P>
    <P>If those companies wish to enter the marketplace and trade on a commercial basis then we should dictate the terms. This is the basis on which our private <Col N="1287" /> health insurers are providing cover. There is no reason that we should reduce the kind of cover we are providing to attract outside competitors.  I could understand why a level was being set if the VHI was not able to provide the level of cover it does.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech also states that he will be appointing a minimum benefits assessor.  He goes on to state that &ldquo;The regulations can be changed to incorporate the recommendations made to the Minister by the assessor.&rdquo;.  If that is the case, why is the Minister of State setting his face against accepting what we are saying?  Why does he insist on signing these regulations?  If they have to be put in place &mdash; because we are obliged to do so and the EU will not allow us to simply repeat the 180 days cover &mdash; how can the Minister of State insist that the regulations can be changed to incorporate the recommendations made to the Minister?  If they can be changed, they should not be introduced at the level the Minister has suggested.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State refers to a victory he secured by not having to accept treatment plans.  Is the Minister aware that one private insurer in the Republic has required such treatment plans prior to offering insurance cover?  Senator Finneran and Senator Maloney, who both work in the area of psychiatric medicine, have made a clear case on this issue.  A further point of which Senator Maloney may not be aware is that the 90 days cover for alcohol and substance abuse is vital and necessary.  By my reading of the Minister of State's speech, the 40 day in-patient treatment is not per annum or per five years but for the entire period for which cover is provided.  That represents 40 days in the life of somebody suffering from alcohol, drug or substance abuse.  Senator Sherlock referred to the fact that mental health was stigmatised in the past.  We are taking a step back into the Dark Ages.  These regulations cast it in stone that people who suffer any kind of <Col N="1288" /> psychiatric or substance abuse problem will be stigmatised.</P>

      <P>I hope the motion will be accepted.  These regulations are far-reaching and need to be given further consideration and analysis.  I hope this will happen because it will have many implications for the future.</P>
      <P>Until now, people in need of in-patient psychiatric treatment who were insured with the VHI were entitled to 180 days in-patient treatment per annum.  People who suffered from alcohol, drug or similar problems were also entitled to 90 days in-patient treatment every five years.  The new regulations propose that companies, including the VHI, who wish to offer health insurance in Ireland should provide 40 days cover for in-patient treatment per year but, as Senator McGennis pointed out, 40 days in-patient treatment is provided, in the subscriber's lifetime, for people who suffer from alcohol or drug abuse.</P>
      <P>I have met many people who suffered serious psychiatric problems and different forms of ill health in the past.  It is a great tragedy to meet people who have suffered with psychiatric problems.  Friends of mine who suffered with such problems found they were unable to cope on returning home to their families.  People suffering from psychiatric problems can upset the entire household which may have extensive repercussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope there is a delay in signing the regulations.  People entering into contracts with insurance companies are <Col N="1289" /> entitled to obtain cover for different risks.  We should ensure that the VHI maintains the insurance cover it provides at present.  Many suicides in this country are related to psychiatric problems and the victims might not have killed themselves had they received treatment in time.  Similarly, if people have to leave hospital prior to their treatment being completed, they may take such drastic action.  This is a serious matter and I am certain the Minister will be sympathetic to the motion.  When we speak about health, we must recognise that the patient is the important person. While we have difficulties with health services in Ireland, we can be proud of the fact that they are as good, if not better, than health services throughout the world.</P>
    <P>If I have a heart problem I am entitled to treatment for 180 days whereas if I have a psychiatric problem my treatment is limited to 40 days.  I cannot see why a person with a heart problem should be treated differently to a person with a psychiatric problem. They both have serious illnesses and need care, treatment and attention.  It would be wrong to discriminate between one type of illness and another.</P>
    <P>I was worried when I heard about opening up the market.  Tougher systems are being introduced and the market is becoming leaner but it is also becoming meaner.  There is a great deal of talk about competitiveness.  This may be helpful in ways but it has an impact on patients and I have great reservations about it.</P>
    <P>Over the last few days I have received more telephone calls and letters about this issue than about any other problems or difficulties which have arisen from legislation over the years and I do not think this has been a co-ordinated effort.  I hope the Minister will accept the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1290" /> Senator Enright said he received telephone calls and messages about this issue to an unusual degree and so have I.  I received a telephone call about two hours ago from a woman who gave me details of her situation.  I asked her if I could place that situation on the record of the House and she said I could.  I told her I would do so without naming her. She said she would be happy to be named but I indicated it is not in the tradition of the House to name any person. The strength of feeling of this family is shown by the fact that it is prepared to be named in public on such a matter.</P>
    <P>Since 1969 this woman's husband has suffered from manic depression; he has had seven hospitalisations.  Under the present programme, because there is not a restriction of 40 days care, he can have continuity of care from the psychiatric services.  This family is afraid that if the Government pursues the line it appears it wishes to pursue, he will be forced into public care and the continuity of care which has been vital to his mental and psychological wellbeing will not be sustained.</P>
    <P>This woman gave me her full name and said she and her entire family are members of the VHI, although they are not in good circumstances.  They are members, not for snobby reasons but because they regard membership as vital to their wellbeing.  She said she would pay VHI subscriptions before she would put the dinner on the table.  She is asking for equal treatment for those with disability.</P>
    <P>We have a Minister for Equality and Law Reform.  One of the forms of equality we should look at is equality between patients who suffer from mental and physical illness.  It is an extraordinary way to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the foundation of St. Patrick's Hospital by the great Jonathan Swift, Dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral, by attempting to reduce the amount of cover available for patients with psychiatric illnesses.  Swift's great contribution to the 18th century was to make it clear that he, at least, regarded mental illness, <Col N="1291" /> or what was then known as lunacy or madness, as an illness parallel to physical diseases of the body.  I call on the Minister to ensure those suffering from mental illness are treated in the same fashion as those with physical illness.</P>
    <P>There is a suggestion that people may be pushed out into care in the community. We have seen this happen in Great Britain and the United States with frightening repercussions.  People are put into the community before they are in a position to take care of themselves and this has serious social consequences. Anybody who visits the major cities of the UK and the US can see this fallout in action.</P>
    <P>There are a number of problems involved &mdash; Alzheimer's disease, Huntingdon's chorea and schizophrenia.  I received a telephone call this morning from a young woman who suffers from schizophrenia.  She was extremely concerned at what the implications of Government policy might be for her.</P>
    <P>I understand &mdash; and I am concerned about this &mdash; that the Minister refused to meet the representatives of the consultants. Is this the case?  If so, why?  At this juncture is the Minister prepared to meet these representatives?</P>
    <P>I believe the present policy, if unamended, will lead to unacceptable pressure on carers, relatives and others who have to support a person with psychiatric illness.  I strongly urge the Minister to take on board this prudent motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage the Government, through the Minister, must be clearly aware that it faces an uprising.  I compliment speakers from the other side who put forward the most cogent reasons for accepting the motion.  I am at a loss because it is clear from the Minister of State's speech that he is not accepting it.  These regulations are a barbaric discrimination against people who should not be the subject of discrimination. I compliment Senator Finneran and Senator Daly for pressing this issue and Senator Maloney for his clear <Col N="1292" /> exposition as to why these regulations are repugnant, discriminatory, barbaric and unacceptable.</P>
      <P>Will we have a debate and accept the motion, after which the Government will sign these regulations or, in accepting the motion, will the Government defer signing them?  It is not clear from the Minister of State's speech that they will be deferred.  It is clear from my reading of it that the Minister will sign the regulations despite what has been said in the House.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that the minimum of 40 days will become a maximum.  Speakers, including some from the Government parties, have made this point. Market forces will determine that 40 days will be the minimum.  When this issue arose in the US, President Clinton would not allow a minimum of 40 days to be stated and the regulations there provide for a minimum of 90 days.</P>
      <P>These regulations will result in repugnant discrimination.  If a person breaks his or her leg and there are complications, they are entitled to VHI cover for a full 180 days.  However, if a person suffers from a psychiatric illness, he or she will only be covered for the minimum of 40 days.  There is no medical, ethical or defensible reason put forward for this 40 day minimum other than the extraordinary suggestion that market conditions should determine the minimum time.  Compassion and medical practice should determine it.  The existing figure of 180 days, which is not availed of in the majority of cases, is a humane figure and is determined by medical practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nothing in the Minister's speech argues the case against 180 days. However, there are a series of serious contradictions in it.  I draw exception to the Minister saying &ldquo;Over 70 per cent of all discharges from psychiatric hospitals occur within 40 days.&rdquo;.  That may be the case and Senators with professional experience have accepted that, but what of the other 30 per cent?  They will be shoved back into the community or onto the State services by these regulations. Senator Maloney said there are good <Col N="1293" /> reasons people would want to avoid that stigma.  If there is a stigma people can only avoid it by having the choice available through medical insurance.  Senator Norris said this is why people put themselves to the pin of their collars to afford medical insurance.  The Minister is a humane person, although I do not know about the person who wrote his speech. I am sure the Minister cares for the other 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech contains statements which directly contradict each other.  It says &ldquo;If this is not demonstrated to the satisfaction of Brussels, then much of our legislation on private health insurance may be seen by them as invalid.&rdquo;.  That is conjecture.  There is no evidence that that is the case.  There is no argument I know of in European law that we should introduce lesser reasons.  The only argument about restraint in trade that can be put forward in European law, as the Minister and his officials know, is that of unfairly discriminating.  If the 180 days rule applies to Irish insurers, it also applies to every insurer and cannot be regarded as a constraint on trade.  I challenge any official in the Department to produce a scintilla of evidence that any case has ever gone under European competition law on the basis of unfair discrimination when the recipient nation, in this case Ireland, has a set of regulations because once they apply across the board to all companies in the field, it cannot be argued, as is done in this specious argument, as being unfairly discriminatory.</P>
    <P>I wish I had further time to read a letter circulated by AWARE into the record.  The Minister must clarify that he will not sign these regulations because that is the wish of all Members who have spoken so far.  I commend all Members for their clarity and wish the Minister had exercised the same.</P>

      <P>Everything has been said at this stage and I can only reiterate some of the points made by my colleagues. I especially compliment Senator Finneran for spearheading this motion.  It is good to hear from all sides <Col N="1294" /> an admission that there is blatant discrimination against the most vulnerable in our society.  The Minister's presentation is the most clinical I have come across and has nothing to do with the motion.</P>
      <P>The Minister's contribution says &ldquo;Departmental officials have consulted widely with a wide range of interest groups&rdquo;.  I would love to see the officials the Department consulted because the people to whom I have spoken were not consulted.  All we want is to allow consultation to take place.  Interested groups like the St. John of God's Hospital, St. Patrick's Hospital, AWARE, the Alzheimer Society of Ireland and others have approached me and told me this legislation discriminates against the ordinary person.  I ask the Minister to return this legislation and I support the calls not to sign it into law.</P>
      <P>I will not delay the House any further. I fully support this worthy motion and I hope the Minister will have second thoughts on it.</P>

      <P>Everything has already been said on this issue.  The Minister has refused to see deputations from St. Patrick's Hospital and St.  John of God Hospital, which cater for a high percentage of mental illness cases.  The Minister is definitely not speaking for any Member of this House in doing this.  It is a retrograde step.  In this age of communication and technology, the Minister would not see them for even a few minutes to discuss the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all who contributed in a positive way to this debate. Providing cover for our psychiatric patients has caught everybody's attention. The Minister must now consider the views of this House.  I am not clear of his intention from his speech and it would help if he could clarify it.  I appreciate the Minister of State is deputising for the Minister for Health and in those circumstances, I am not sure how far his brief would extend.  I know he is interested in the matter and <Col N="1295" /> it would help us if this matter was clarified. If the 40 day minimum is allowed, the norm will become 40 days.</P>
      <P>The Minister has to comply with section 3 of the Act and put the draft regulations before the House in 21 days. If they are the same as those mentioned in his speech, I will introduce a motion to annul them.  The wishes of this House will have been ignored if the Minister signs those regulations.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister, if at all possible, to clarify this matter for us so that this House can adjourn feeling confident that he has taken on board the serious reservations everybody has experienced about these draft regulations.  He should defer signing these regulations and negotiations should take place with the different groups.  The discrimination to give psychiatric patients less cover than those with other illnesses should be removed so that we will treat our citizens equally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann takes note of the final statement issued from the Conference of European parliamentarians concerning HIV/AIDS.  held under the auspices of the European Public Health foundation in Barcelona on 19th-20th May, 1995.</P>
      <P>I am grateful to the Leader of the House for facilitating me and, in particular, for allowing me the opportunity to say a few words on this matter.  I particularly want to place on the record the final declaration of the Barcelona conference of European parliamentarians on HIV-AIDS which was attended by Senator Henry and I at the invitation of Mary Banotti MEP.</P>
      <P>The final declaration states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The continuing spread of the HIV virus, its capacity to mutate and defeat even the most sophisticated medical treatment, its long latent period before it progresses in the vast majority of cases to AIDS, and its devastating effects on individuals and their families, as well as on whole economies, are factors which combine to present a formidable challenge to <Col N="1297" /> health care, social and preventive policies, medical science, and human solidarity within Europe and worldwide.</P>
    <P>This conference of European Parliamentarians on HIV-AIDS has been convened in response to the resolution of the previous gathering in London in April 1993, which urged the Institutions of the European Union to assist in the creation of a Standing Conference with the object of extending the principle of inter-parliamentary co-operation both within the European Union and across the wider European region. We, who have come together here for this purpose, recognise and pay tribute to the crucial role of the European Commission in enabling this major advance in European collaboration to take place; we acknowledge likewise the constructive attitude of the European Parliament in welcoming &lsquo;the notion of creating a standing conference of European Parliamentarians on HIV-AIDS&rsquo;.  We also welcome the participation of certain neighbouring states.</P>
    <P>All of us present, who have participated in the Conference, being Members of Parliament, scientists, social scientists, medical professionals, public servants or voluntary sector workers in our respective countries, affirm our desire to create a co-operative association of European Parliamentarians committed to stemming the spread and turning back the tide of HIV infection in our own and other countries, to alleviating the condition of those affected and their families and to promoting parliamentary action and social and scientific research directed towards those ends.  We also aim to develop networks for co-operation between the various zones of Europe and in particular the north and south.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, we hereby resolve that the Standing Conference which we have inaugurated here in Barcelona should become a parliamentary network.  We, as delegates to this conference, <Col N="1298" /> pledge ourselves both to recruit our fellow Parliamentarians individually, and to work towards the affiliation of the relevant committees or study groups in our parliaments. We wish to encourage Parliamentarians from countries not currently members of the European Union to join the new association with a view to extending it to cover all European countries.  We propose that nongovernmental organisations working in the field and bodies representing people with HIV and AIDS should be eligible for associate membership.  We call upon the European Institutions and National Parliamentarians to support us in this initiative.</P>
    <P>We recommend that there should be a small permanent secretariat to service the association, and to perform all the necessary administrative tasks such as arrangement of meetings and seminars, the commissioning of studies and research, and the circulation of all relevant reports and documents to the full network and supporting bodies.  We further propose that the Steering Committee for the current Conference should become the permanent Advisory Council, reflecting participation across Europe and including other Parliamentarians who wish to become more directly involved in the activities of this Pan-European Group.</P>
    <P>More specifically, we request the European Public Health Foundation to make fresh proposals to the Commission, in accordance with the terms of their current contract, for further work to be carried out under the aegis of the Standing Conference in the following areas which we have identified here as important and which we believe need to be pursued as resources permit, namely:</P>
    <P>&mdash;Exchange of information and good practice</P>
    <P>&mdash;Improvement in networks of HIV surveillance</P>
    <P>&mdash;Sex education</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1299" />&mdash;Training issues of health and social care workers and volunteers</P>
    <P>&mdash;Role of voluntary organisations</P>
    <P>&mdash;Care and support of people with HIV-AIDS</P>
    <P>&mdash;Medical and biological research</P>
    <P>&mdash;Research into ways of alleviating the effects of the disease and minimising its impact on the quality of life of people with HIV-AIDS</P>
    <P>&mdash;Psycho-social impact of HIV-AIDS</P>
    <P>&mdash;Economic impact of HIV-AIDS</P>
    <P>&mdash;Needs of developing countries</P>
    <P>&mdash;HIV-AIDS legislation</P>
    <P>We also recognise the need to give special attention to the following groups:</P>
    <P>&mdash;intravenous drug users</P>
    <P>&mdash;homosexual and bisexual men</P>
    <P>&mdash;sex workers</P>
    <P>&mdash;women and families</P>
    <P>&mdash;mobile populations</P>
    <P>&mdash;inmates of prisons</P>
    <P>We recognise that a start can be made on some of the above topics by means of exploratory seminars as the beginning of the post-conference work.  However, we are conscious that the completion of this work, including research and its dissemination as a guide to policy and good practice, will be dependent on continuing institutional support, which we hope can take the form of medium-term contracts to give the new association time to build on its experience, maximise its effectiveness and extend its scope.</P>
    <P>Believing that much of value can be accomplished if resources are employed on well-designed studies, seminars, working parties, and dissemination of their results to members, we propose that the Standing Conference should not reconvene <Col N="1300" /> in plenary session for at least 18 months, unless urgently summoned by a majority of the members, with the approval of the funding institutions. Specific recommendations made by working parties during the conference will be recorded in the published report which will be sent to all delegates and made more widely available.  However, the Parliamentarians present wish the following two additional recommendations to be recorded:</P>
    <P>&mdash; that all methods of HIV prevention should be free of VAT, especially condoms</P>
    <P>&mdash;that sex education in schools should commence before the start of sexual activity</P>
    <P>We further recommend that work of a comparative nature with real European &lsquo;added value&rsquo; should receive preferential consideration and that high priority for funding should be given to those projects which contribute most to our overriding aim, which is to reduce the rate of increase of HIV infection in Europe and set it on a downward path in the adult population by the year 2000.  This aim should be treated as even more urgent in the case of young people becoming sexually active.</P>
    <P>In attempting to advance these objectives we recognise the need for accurate surveillance to assess the impact of current policy.  We urge the countries of the European Union to apportion, according to need, the amount of financial aid given to the regional areas within them, especially major urban areas.  Such a policy should aim to support, in particular, the unique contribution that can be made by the voluntary sector.</P>
    <P>We also support the view that to deal effectively with AIDS we must identify, reduce and prevent the profound forms of discrimination which diminish the capability of people to learn about and respond to HIV infection.  Discrimination affects particular <Col N="1301" /> groups of people such as gay men, injecting drug users, cultural and linguistic minorities and people in prison. The issue of discriminatory practices in employment and in the provision of insurance should also be addressed.  Additionally, we urge the European Parliament to include in the European Commission's proposed programmes on HIV-AIDS and drug harm minimisation action to address the ways in which legal, social and cultural discrimination facilitate the spread of HIV infection.  Further, bearing in mind that prevalence of HIV is rising amongst heterosexuals, it is important to focus attention on the needs of affected women and children. In particular, it is essential to ensure that all women and children receive appropriate treatment, especially therapies that are now available to aid prevention of vertical transmission.  More generally, home-based programmes should be developed to improve quality of life and to reduce the costs of unnecessary hospital care for all.</P>
    <P>We urge, furthermore, that the knowledge and experience accumulated by this Standing Conference be applied to promoting dialogue with, and practical help to, other continents and cultures.  We suggest that funds should be sought from multinational and bilateral aid programmes for initiatives aimed at containing, managing and abating the disease in Africa, Asia, South America and the countries of the former Warsaw Pact.</P>
    <P>Finally, we pledge ourselves to keep these issues alive in our own parliaments and to urge their importance on our governments with a view to ensuring the best use of resources in care and treatment, the maximum efficacy of prevention and the necessary research base for continuing advance both in prophylaxis and towards cure.</P>
    <P>We further believe that understanding of the social and cultural factors influencing the direction and extent of HIV-AIDS epidemics in <Col N="1302" /> different cultural settings is crucial to our efforts.  We undertake to work and consult closely with people living with HIV and AIDS and to encourage support for...everything in our power to bring about medical, social and material improvements in the condition of people living with HIV and AIDS, and to halt and reduce the incidence of infection throughout the European region and, where possible, beyond.</P>
    <P>The declaration was accepted by all the delegates.  I wish to place on record my appreciation of the work of my colleague, Senator Henry, who, because of her association with the medical network, was able to contribute in a valuable sense.</P>
    <P>I attended a post conference meeting, where the hard work was done after the conference concluded and it was chaired by Lord Kilmarnock.  I suggested there should be a networking arrangement and information exchange between the different European Parliaments so that we could be aware of the different legislative approaches in all the areas mentioned in the document, such as discrimination. Having unwisely opened my mouth, I was asked to be on that committee but, unfortunately, I had to cancel my attendance last week because of illness.  It will be an important body and I will be happy to report regularly either to the House or to whatever committee is deemed appropriate with regard to the different changes in the various legislative areas.</P>
    <P>Another point is important to this country.  Barcelona probably has the highest rate of HIV in Europe because of the enormous prevalence of intravenous drug abuse in the community in that area of Spain.  They are also concerned about the sexual element.  A woman, who I thought was quite conservative &mdash; she was certainly not a radical or a red revolutionary &mdash; spoke about sex education and made an extremely important point which Ireland would be well advised to take on board.  She said that people talk <Col N="1303" /> about desensitising young people and introducing them to sexual information too early &mdash; before the onset of sexual feelings.  However, as a result of an intensive research programme, the woman said that is precisely when one should introduce it.</P>
    <P>She drew the analogy that on a road with a dangerous bend, one does not put up a hazard warning saying &ldquo;Dangerous bend&rdquo; when one's car has already gone over the edge.  People should be warned of the dangers before they take the action which will expose them to critical risk.  I thank the House for its indulgence.</P>

      <P>Before the House adjourns, I wish to make a number of brief points.  We have reached the end of a very long and wearing session of the Seanad.  The House sat on as many days in this session as it did throughout last year.  It has also been a very difficult session because we lost our beloved Cathaoirleach and one of our most beloved and distinguished Members, Senator Gordon Wilson.  It has been a very hardworking and sad session for us all.</P>
      <P>I wish to pay tribute to the staff of the House.  They have served the Seanad in an exemplary fashion with hard work, exacting standards and unfailing courtesy to us all.  The staff is small and we all owe them a great debt for the tremendous public service which they perform on behalf of the Seanad.  I also pay tribute to the other staff of the House, the transcribers, who record Senators' thoughts, which perhaps are not that great, with accuracy and fairness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the media which, to a decreasing extent, cover the activities of this <Col N="1304" /> House.  One of the issues which may be addressed over the summer is the media coverage of this House.  I am not attacking but thanking those who have done their jobs so well but perhaps we could consider how we can engage the attention of others a little more.</P>
    <P>I also thank the Cathaoirleach for his work as Leas-Chathaoirleach and Cathaoirleach and for his courtesy and professionalism.  In particular, I thank the leader of the Opposition and the former Opposition Chief Whip, who is our new Leas-Chathaoirleach.  The Seanad works on the basis of co-operation and a high level of trust and of people setting out to achieve common standards.  This trust has always existed as far as the Opposition parties are concerned. I hope I have not omitted anybody and I thank all those who put so much work into making this session so successful.</P>

I compliment you on the kind, efficient and courteous way in which you carried out your duties as Leas-Chathaoirleach.</P>
      <P>I concur with the Leader of the House that this session will not be forgotten for a long time, given the loss of our distinguished Cathaoirleach, great friend and colleague, Senator Seán Fallon, and Senator Gordon Wilson.  They have left their mark on us and the Seanad and their contributions will not be forgotten for years to come, particularly the guidance of the former Cathaoirleach during his 14 years in the House.  I will never forget Senator Gordon Wilson's maiden speech about the peace initiative in Northern Ireland or the amount of good he did.  His membership of the Seanad is a shining example to us all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Leader of the House for the smooth running of the Seanad and the leaders and Whips of all the groups. I thank the Clerk of the Seanad and her <Col N="1305" /> staff for the very efficient way in which she carried out her duties.  We are very fortunate to have a person of her calibre conducting our affairs.  As Senator Manning said, the staff running the affairs of the Upper House is small and it takes a person of great quality to keep everything running smoothly and everybody motivated.</P>
    <P>As the Leader said, the House is receiving a diminishing level of coverage in the press.  Perhaps this matter can be addressed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges over the coming months and we can examine how the position can be improved.  I wish everybody well over the short summer vacation.  As mentioned earlier, the House is adjourning <i>sine die</i> but the committees will continue until the end of July and throughout most of September. Although the House is adjourned Members of the Oireachtas probably work harder and longer hours at the committees than during sitting days of the Houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me time to raise this matter which relates to the national school at Fore, County Westmeath.  It was built in 1896, which will be 100 years ago next year.  In that time, very little money has been spent in terms of modernising or renovating the school. Approximately 20 years ago, outside toilets were provided.  However, students must leave their classrooms <Col N="1306" /> and cross a yard in all types of weather to use these facilities.</P>
      <P>This matter relates to the position of teachers and students at present.  Class numbers are in excess of 60 and the Department has granted an additional teacher, who will start teaching in the first week of September.  There is also a remedial teacher in the school who has no room or facilities to teach the students other than the vestry of the local church.  In this era of modernisation of our education system, the situation in which the students, parents' council, the board of management and the teachers find themselves is deplorable. An inspector has told the people in Fore that, if facilities are not improved, he will have to review the position of the remedial teacher.  The provision of the prefab which I am calling for would, in the short term, alleviate the situation and allow the extra teacher to be appointed.  There are two teachers in the school now, one teaching junior infants to second classes and the other teaching third to sixth classes.</P>
      <P>Many eminent people started their education in Fore school.  A Member of the other House of the Oireachtas, Deputy Flood, was educated in this school, as was his father, who distinguished himself over the years.  Many other people in important professional positions across the world came out of the national school in Fore.  It is a historic place of beauty and of importance to the Office of Public Works and to Westmeath County Council.  People come to visit the seven wonders of Fore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basic necessity for the people living there is that a reasonable facility be granted for the primary education of their children.  Because this school is almost 100 years old and there has been such a lack of investment over the years, with no existing toilets linked to the classrooms, no play area for students and a lack of teacher facilities, I call on the Department of Education first to provide a prefab as a matter of urgency to meet the requirement for the extra teacher and, second, to carry out a full and urgent examination of the school's needs before the autumn.  These are <Col N="1307" /> basic demands which the Department should meet.</P>
    <P>I compliment the parents' council and the board of management, who have worked tirelessly to try to improve facilities for the teachers and the students over the last number of years. Without the help of the Department, it is extremely difficult to continue in the present circumstances and I await the Minister's reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Education, I am glad of the opportunity Senator Cassidy has presented to clarify the position in relation to this matter.</P>
      <P>The school requested one prefab on 30 June, 1995, to cater for an additional teacher due to be appointed from September 1995.  The Senator will appreciate that it is not possible to organise additional permanent accommodation in a two month period.  The provision of a permanent prefab requires full planning permission and approval from the fire authority.  In view of the tight timescale involved, the best option is for the school to rent accommodation for the new school year.  The Department of Education will contribute towards the rental costs.</P>
      <P>The school has been in touch previously with the Department of Education concerning proposed renovations to the toilet block.  Plans were formulated and subsequently the school authorities required some changes to them. In view of the fact that the question of additional classroom accommodation has now been raised, it would seem appropriate to undertake a comprehensive examination of the school's full accommodation requirements.  This examination will be undertaken as a matter of urgency.  The Department of Education will be in touch with the school authorities.</P>

      <P>In relation to the September deadline for the extra teacher, what is the Department's position in the event of there not being additional <Col N="1308" /> space available to rent in the village of Fore?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">

      <P>The Department's response on this issue has been encouraging. The application for the permanent prefab was only made on 30 June and, as I indicated, it is not possible to make a permanent arrangement in that short space of time.  The Department of Education will be in touch with the school authorities and the requirements of the school for September can be discussed at that stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I am grateful to the Cathaoirleach for allowing discussion on this matter on the final day of the term, as it were.</P>
      <P>Angling tourism has been one of the largest contributors to the economy of County Leitrim over the last 25 years. Its annual worth nationally is estimated at £68 million, while the estimated income generated in the northwest region &mdash; Leitrim would perhaps be the strongest county in terms of coarse fishing &mdash; is around £11 million.  This figure is based on a percentage of the bed nights in the northwest regional tourism area identified as being due to angling tourism, which stands at 17 per cent. These figures indicate how important this entire industry is to my part of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sixteen lakes, including Lough Allen, have been identified by the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board in their development plan 1994/98.  All of these lakes are well stocked and attract coarse fishing visitors from all over Europe, who are united in their praise for the amount of fish caught but are equally vocal in their criticism of the lack of proper access.  In order to address this major problem, the Lough Allen Angling Club, whose membership encompasses fishing enthusiasts from the immediate Lough Allen area, entered into discussions with the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board, Bord Fáilte, Leitrim County Council and <Col N="1309" /> local accommodation providers with a view to improving the access facilities at specific lakes in their area with the emphasis on Lough Allen, which is referred to locally and internationally as the jewel in the crown of the upper Shannon.  The club met with a ready response from all of the various agencies and when the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board launched its development plan for 1994-98, 17 lakes including Lough Allen were included for funding under the angling tourism section of the EU operational programme for tourism.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil-Labour Government is to be commended for including angling tourism under measure three of Tourism 2000, the blueprint for the development of tourism over the five years of the operational programme.  It was the first time that angling tourism was identified as a tourist niche market and I commend the current Government for continuing that policy.  A total of £18 million has been allocated, £13 million of which comes from the European Regional Development Fund.  It will be distributed through the Department of the Marine to the Central Fisheries Board and ultimately to the regional fisheries board, which will then dispense it under its development plan. However, I am concerned by reports that, 18 months into the operational programme, the only allocation of money has been to the Moy Fisheries Association and that even this sum has not been handed over.  The Moy group are currently operating on an overdraft in anticipation of Government funding. I would be grateful for clarification in that regard.  I only mention it in the context of the overall funding for the programme. Eighteen months into it, there seems to be a lack of movement.</P>
    <P>In November of last year, representatives of the Lough Allen Angling Club, the Central Fisheries Board and the official responsible for co-ordinating the Department of the Marine's plans for the implementation of the angling tourism allocation met, at my request, with the Minister's predecessor.  Deputy Andrews.  Deputy Andrews and those present acknowledged the importance <Col N="1310" /> of providing proper access for coarse fishing visitors and agreed that Lough Allen should be given priority for development funding.  It was agreed that three sections of Lough Allen should be provided with proper access roads, car parking and picnic facilities.  Everybody at that meeting was left in no doubt as to the importance attached to the provision of EU funds for access if the Lough Alien and the upper Shannon lake district were to develop to a level where we could compete effectively with similar fishing stretches in Britain and other parts of Europe.</P>
    <P>In order to impress upon the Minister's Department the wide level of support which this development plan has received locally and regionally, the Lough Allen angling club prepared a dossier of letters of endorsement of their plans, a copy of which has been in the Department since last February. The letters of support come from the following agencies: the ESB, Bord Fáilte, the National Coarse Fishing Federation of Ireland, Carrick-on-Shannon Chamber of Commerce, the Arigna Leader Board, Drumshanbo Community Council, the Border Regional Authority comprising the counties of Cavan, Leitrim, Donegal, Louth, Monaghan and Sligo, Leitrim County Council and the elected representatives from the area.  The angling club also sought the views of angling interests in Britain including the following who gave their support: Leisure Angling Complete Holidays of Liverpool, Countryman Angling and Games Supplies Limited of County Kildare which supplies the international game fishing market, Derby &amp; Derbyshire Angling Association Limited, the Erne Anglers Club of Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, Cliff Smart's Angling Holidays of Northampton, GP-Chasse Et Peche, a leading French travel agency specialising in coarse fishing trips to Ireland, Shamrock Irland Reisen of Hagen in Germany, Empire Angling Holidays of Cumbria in England, Ecole Francaise De Peche of France, UFEV Travel Agency of Lorraine, France, and Dream Angling Holidays of Wigan in the UK. There are also letters of support from <Col N="1311" /> the local tourist providers in the area and from the business community who rely on the earnings generated by angling tourism to maintain a viable business.</P>
    <P>The message contained in all these letters of endorsement highlights the extreme difficulty anglers experience in gaining access to what is perhaps one of the finest coarse fishing lakes in Europe. The managing director of Countryman Angling states that he finds it hard to believe that it has taken so long for this development to take place.  The secretary of the Derby Angling Association states that he would welcome facilities for disabled anglers on Lough Allen. This is a growth market.  The secretary of the Erne Anglers Club in Enniskillen states that there can be no doubt that providing access in the form of roads, car parks and bank side paths will be of great benefit to anglers visiting the area.</P>
    <P>The National Coarse Fishing Federation of Ireland, in its submission to the Central Fisheries Board on 30 January 1995, states that some fishery development in the past has been done on a haphazard basis with little regard for overall strategy, that fisheries should be able to produce for most of the year and that these waters could be used to create a major extension to the tourist season.  Venues that give all year round sport, for example.  Lake Muckno in Monaghan and Lough Gowna in Cavan, share one important virtue, that access is available to a range of shore lines with a variety of depths.  The federation went on to state that it strongly supports any proposal to develop access to Lough Allen since it could also be an excellent all year round fishery.</P>
    <P>Mr. Cliff Smart of Angling Holidays in Northampton, England states that there is a lack of access to that superb water, Lough Allen, and that Lough Allen has tremendous potential.  He further states that development should take place as a matter of urgency.  The two French agencies who sent visitors to County Leitrim over the last number of years state &ldquo;the road conditions in your area are very poor and access to the lake shore of Lough Allen is very bad <Col N="1312" /> and might discourage some of our anglers to come fishing.&rdquo;  The German company Shamrock state that the provision of access should be an immediate priority and &ldquo;if the people in charge are not in the position to help we shall in future direct tourism to those areas that are more co-operative and of assistance to the people who bring money into the country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Empire Angling Holidays of England state that more and more anglers are visiting Ireland which is putting more and more strain on the accessible but limited angling venues throughout Ireland and that all visiting anglers require are small tracks, hard standing or lay-bys with access to some good banks.  Another French agency states they regret that nothing is done on Lough Allen and that they could certainly organise more fishing groups if Lough Allen was more accessible. Finally Dream Angling Holidays of Wigan in a letter dated 20 January 1995 to Mr. Ken Johnston, the former European projects manager at the Central Fisheries Board, states: &ldquo;In our view Lough Allen is the sleeping giant of Leitrim and if awakened will ensure prosperity for those people in need of direction in the way of job opportunities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In a survey carried out over a two year period by this company the overwhelming majority stated that more access points were needed, platform-stagings needed erecting, and more litter bins and better maps and directions were required.  They added that most anglers were happy with the weights and the standard of fish caught in the Lough Allen area and they also stated that the town of Drumshanbo is a delight and that, in this little wedge of Ireland, the people are of good heart and health.</P>
    <P>I hope that the foregoing will impress upon the Minister the urgency of implementing the development proposals contained in the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board document.  I would like the Minister to clarify his Department's priorities in the implementation of the subprogramme on tourism angling and I refer him to the criteria under which this money should be expended.  I refer to the Guide on the <Col N="1313" /> Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99, page 11, measure 3, which states that work supported under the measure must attract additional foreign visitors, be readily available for tourist use and generate economic benefit and additional jobs.  I believe the proposals contained as outlined more than fulfil these criteria.  I readily acknowledge that there is a need to improve fish stocks in our lakes and rivers but County Leitrim does not have that problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister should give serious consideration to the establishment of a national coarse fishing authority which will market Ireland as a coarse fishing destination internationally in much the same way as An Bord Bia promotes and markets our food industry.  The Central Fisheries Board and regional boards cannot and will not carry out this important function under their present mandate and if we are to obtain value for the £18 million allocated to angling tourism, we need to put in place the proper structures to exploit this hidden jewel, Lough Allen, in our tourism industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to inform the House of one of the most important developments in the inland fisheries sector for many years.  The House will be aware &mdash; and as Senator Mooney summarised &mdash; that the National Development Plan 1994-1999 provides for a basic investment programme of £650 million in the tourism sector through the tourism operational programme.  This programme's central objective is to further increase the Irish tourism sector thereby creating sustainable jobs through increasing overseas tourism revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recognition of the importance of our inland fisheries resource, a comprehensive investment programme to develop the tourism angling product totalling almost £19 million over the six year period from 1994 to 1999 has been included in the tourism operational programme. The purpose of the tourism <Col N="1314" /> angling measure is to ensure that our coarse, game and sea angling is upgraded to the best international standards with a view to increasing substantially tourist angling and revenue, and the creation of valuable sustainable new jobs, particularly in the more remote and disadvantaged areas where the majority of our prime fisheries are located.</P>
    <P>The main areas of development under the tourism angling measure will include physical instream and bank development, including pre-development and surveys, and the provision of additional angling spaces, stands and stiles, the removal of physical obstructions to passage or migration of fish, stock management to include stocking out and predator-competition control, the provision of improved systems for monitoring and protecting water quality in the fisheries context, the establishment of new stock coarse and game fisheries, the rehabilitation of depleted sea trout fisheries and other measures to ensure the rational use and management of sport fish stocks, including the curtailment or phasing out of certain identified commercial fisheries to increase potential, spawning stocks and access for anglers.</P>
    <P>Applicants under the tourism angling measure must demonstrate that the proposed works will, among other measures, be sufficient to ensure their retention as Bord Fáilte branded fisheries or be capable of qualifying them for inclusion as Bord Fáilte branded fisheries, be capable of attracting additional foreign visitors leading to increased employment and tourist revenue, be readily available for tourist use and generate economic benefit and additional employment.  All applications for funding are subject to detailed technical, operation, management and financial assessment by committees comprising representatives from the Department of the Marine, the Central Fisheries Board, the Department of Tourism and Trade and Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>The level of EU funding available under the measure is up to 75 per cent of eligible expenditure and up to 50 per cent of eligible expenditure in respect of public sector and private sector applicants <Col N="1315" /> respectively.  The Central Fisheries Board is responsible for the day to day administration of the programme.  The allocation of £19 million under the measure is broken down on an annual basis as follows: £272,000 in 1994, £2.86 million in 1995, £2.84 million in 1996, £3.669 million in 1997, £4.375 million in 1998 and £4.616 in 1999.  These allocations may of course vary depending on the actual expenditure undertaken each year on approved projects.</P>
    <P>Projects involving a proposed investment of almost £2.9 million have been approved to date under the tourism angling measure.  Estimated expenditure to date on these projects is approximately £420,000.  I have circulated a schedule setting out details of projects approved to date.  The closing date for receipt of applications for consideration for funding under the measure in 1996 is 15 September 1995.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney has raised the question of the provision of funds for access roads to Lough Allen.  This is a matter for Bord Fáilte and Shannon Development under measure 4 of subprogramme 2 of the operational programme for tourism. I have no function in the matter of the provision of roads.  I am sure, however, that Senator Mooney will pursue the matter with Bord Fáilte and Shannon Development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will.  The Minister has not really addressed the matter.  He spoke about roads but we are talking about access.  We have all the facilities. He put access for anglers at the bottom of his priority list, yet he went on to state the qualifying criteria, which have been fulfilled in our area.  Will he clarify the position of the development plan submitted by the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board, which identifies the points I am making?  It is a valid question and the Minister must have a function <Col N="1316" /> in that regard.  The development plan encompasses most of this.</P>

      <P>There may be some confusion as to what has been applied for by the board.  The question raised by Senator Mooney refers directly to the provision of access roads to Lough Allen, which will not qualify for funding under the tourism angling measure. Bank access and access to the water will qualify for such funding.  In so far as the application made by the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board and supported by other agencies relates to that development, it will be considered for funding.</P>
      <P>I indicated the closing date for the 1996 funding has been brought forward to 15 September 1995.  This was done because last year, when the closing date was later in the year, the approvals were consequently later and in some cases they were so late it was difficult to complete the work during the fine weather. The date for 1996 funding has been brought forward so approvals can be made and work begun earlier.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for the evaluations committee concerned to evaluate the application made by the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board.  However, to make the matter clear, the provision of roads <i>per se</i> will not qualify.  It is not proposed to spend the £19 million in providing roads, rather it will be spent on bank and in-stream development.</P>
