      <P>I take this opportunity to welcome you all back.  I hope we have a very successful session.</P>
      <P>Before we start our proceedings, we will have a vote of sympathy to the family of Philip Burton who served as a Member of the Oireachtas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose a vote of sympathy to the family of the late Phil Burton.  He was a man I got to know very late in his life; he had left this House four years before I was elected. He lived through some of the stormiest and most colourful days of modern Irish history and I heard many a good story from him about those days.</P>
      <P>Phil Burton spent 18 years in the national Parliament, four of them in this House.  He was a man of great decency and integrity.  He served quietly but very effectively.  He was widely respected across all party boundaries.  I take this opportunity to convey the condolences of my party and of the House to his window and family?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>May I, on behalf of the Fianna Fáil group, be associated with <Col N="1282" /> the sentiments expressed by the Leader and send our sympathies to the late Philip Burton's wife and family.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cashin</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I would like to join with the expression of sympathy to the family of the late Philip Burton.  I knew him and his family in the town of Kanturk over a number of years.  I was aware of the service given by him in the Dáil, in this House and in Cork County Council.  I have dealt with him in his business and have found him to be a decent man.  On many occasions in recent years he gave me very good advice about my political future.  I wish to express my personal sympathy and that of my party to the Burton family.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I would like to join in this vote of sympathy to the family of the late Philip Burton and to express our sympathy to his colleagues in Fine Gael.  I did not have the privilege of knowing him but I know he was held in very great respect and was widely admired.  May he rest in peace.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to be associated with the message of condolence to the window and family of the late Philip Burton, a Kanturk man.  When I was elected to Cork County Council in the 1970s he was a member of the northern division of the council.  The first thing that struck me about him was that he was a man of great experience.  He also had long service in the Oireachtas. When he asked a question he got an answer.  I often compare present day standards in local authorities with the standards then.  I wish to be associated with the expression of condolence.</P>

      <P>I have notice from Senator Fahey that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to outline in detail the time schedule for the development of facilities which have been approved at University College Hospital, Galway, and the amount of money allocated to the project in 1995.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to include the submission by West Limerick Resources under Leader Two funding for 1995-99.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to ensure that the examination papers for the junior certificate are printed in this country.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Mooney of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to extend public liability insurance for pupils attending Carrick-on-Shannon community school in order that school buses may dispatch and pick up students in the car park of the sports complex adjoining the community school and so resolve a disagreement between CIE and the Summerhill Residents Association.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Enright of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The proposal to cease sittings of the Circuit Court in Birr, County Offaly.</P>

      <Col N="1284" /> I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I formally congratulate Senator Wright on his appointment as Leader of the Opposition in the House. He set the highest standards of civility, courtesy and effectiveness when Leader of the House and I know he will bring the same qualities to bear on the even more onerous burden of leading from the other side of the House.</P>
      <P>Today's Business is Item 1, with the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs to be called on to make a statement in reply not later than 5.45 p.m. A time limit of ten minutes per Senator was agreed by the House on 20 October when this item was last discussed but, if there are not too many speakers offering, there could be flexibility on that point.  Perhaps the Whips could arrange it.</P>
      <P>Item 6, Fianna Fáil's Private Members' Motion on drug abuse, will be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, I congratulate Senator Maurice Manning on his appointment to the position of Leader of the House.  The decision to appoint him is a welcome one.  His commitment to the House is well known and, while I would not wish him too long a stay in that important position, I wish him well.  He is a person who is totally committed to the Seanad. We, on the Opposition side, will certainly support his moves to introduce more reforms to the House.  I am also delighted that his <i>aide-de-camp</i> of many years, Senator Cosgrave, has also been appointed as Government Whip.</P>

      <P>Our group will do its best to ensure that he is kept busy over the next couple of years.  I wish both Senators well and hope they will have an opportunity to implement the reforms of which they spoke when in opposition.</P>
      <P>We agree to the Order of Business. If the Leader agrees, I suggest that 15 minutes per person should be permitted. I would also ask the Leader, if possible over the next week, to bring to our notice the programme of legislation for this session.  I understand it has been issued in the Dáil and we would like a copy.  At the earliest opportunity we would also like a further debate on Northern Ireland given the progress that has taken place.  As the Leader will be aware, this is an issue that has been debated here on many occasions.</P>

      <P>I also extend my congratulations to Senator Manning on his appointment as Leader of the House and to Senator Cosgrave on his appointment as Government Whip.  I welcome Senator Wright to this side of the House and congratulate him on his new role. In the midst of all this musical change, movement, enthusiasm and argument, there is one area of stability in this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On a serious note I wish to remind Senator Manning of the many impassioned speeches he has made about reforming the House.  We look forward to discussing some ideas with him.  For many years he has put forward the idea of having an hour during the week for discussions of topical issues. The unusual make-up of the House at the moment allows all sides to work <Col N="1286" /> together to reform and to make this House as effective as it can be under the Constitution.</P>
      <P>I reiterate what Senator Wright said about a list of the forthcoming legislation, particularly the legislation which it is intended to initiate in this House.  I often wonder if those words are inscribed on the Opposition Leader's desk.  This would be critically important as part of initiating a programme intended to extend and expand the influence and the work of this House in the way it was intended.  This is an unprecedented opportunity to do that.  I hope this matter will be taken in hand &mdash; I know it will be &mdash; by the Leader of the House by taking on broad issues of importance and ensuring that we are all given the resources and support to do our jobs as well as we can.</P>

      <P>I join in the tributes to the Leader and the Whip.  I congratulate Senator Manning on his nomination as Leader of the House and Senator Cosgrave as Whip on the Government side. I also congratulate Senator Wright on his appointment.  Senator Honan and I have not yet resolved the great difficulties that exist between the two of us in respect of who might lead from our side. I want to say to Senator O'Toole that there is stability in other areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought there was more diversity in their ideology than in ours. I support the views already expressed about the legislative programme.  I ask the Leader if there are any plans to introduce amendments to the Road Traffic Act in the coming session, bearing in mind the vigorous opposition which was brought to bear on aspects of that Bill by the Fine Gael Party when it was coming through this House.  The provisions of that Bill are in stark contrast to other parts of our law which seem to allow people to roam our streets freely&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Leader agree that there are aspects of the Road Traffic Bill which are in stark contrast to some of the deficiencies in other parts of our law which seem to allow people to roam our streets freely when there is very serious crime being perpetrated?</P>
      <P>I also ask the Leader to arrange a debate on education in the near future because both third and primary level education are very much in the news. We could usefully look at that area in the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>I agree that Northern Ireland should be debated but I am not sure whether it should be debated before the framework document is to hand.  Perhaps we should wait until we have that document before we debate Northern Ireland again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to arrange for an early debate on the Price Waterhouse report into the Army.  This wide ranging report has major implications, not only for the Army but, for cities and towns around the country which have had an Army presence for many years.  The role of the Army abroad has to be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much of the report is taken up with matters which do not relate to the military. They are purely financial matters <Col N="1288" /> which have no relevance to the running of a modern army.  They may be good in economic terms but definitely do not suit the requirements of the Army.  I would also like, if possible, the relevant Minister to make a copy of the report available to Members of the House as we should have it.  There are grave problems in the Army at present in the sense that we do not have a Chief of Staff.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Leader if he would bring to the notice of the Government the fact that there is not a Chief of Staff.  As soon as that appointment is made, the morale of the Army will be raised dramatically.</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader of the House for an early debate on developments in the EU as it is some time since we had a debate on European affairs.  Since then, there have been major problems relating to the Spaniards, fishing and so forth.  There are a number of items we could discuss which relate to the EU.  If possible, could we have our lady MEPs in to discuss their attitude to Padraig Flynn?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps arrangements could be made for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to come to the Seanad to discuss the serious situation in Chechnya. The Government has sent a note of <Col N="1289" /> protest to the Russians because of the invasion of Chechnya.  However, there are a number of implications, including the fact that that particular state wanted to opt out of the Russian Federation but it was not allowed to do so.  We should ask why it was not allowed to opt out when other states were.  I would like a debate on that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Lanigan covered my main points.  As regards Chechnya, perhaps the Leader could tell us when we could have a debate on this matter because it is of the utmost importance to have a full debate on this invasion.  The Government has protested about the loss of life, the destruction and the murder of innocent civilians but this House should be afforded an opportunity to discuss it.</P>
      <P>I join with Senator Dardis in asking the Leader when amending legislation could be introduced.  I look forward to hearing if Senator Dardis wants to increase or reduce the penalties.</P>

      <P>Would the Leader provide time as soon as possible for a debate on the different agencies, the county enterprise partnership boards, INTERREG, Leader and IFI funding, as these are all related?  Every Member knows it is easy to have a structure in place without a backup.  The Donegal County Enterprise Partnership Board, in which I am involved, does not have funding.  It is a statutory organisation with no funding and we have received an indication that the Minister may not have funding for county enterprise partnership boards in the future.  I ask the Leader if he will arrange a debate on this subject as soon as possible.  The Leader will appreciate that I raised this <Col N="1290" /> matter when I sat on that side of the House.  I ask the Minister for Finance to cover all these items.  I am sure Members on both sides of the House would be interested in such a debate.</P>

      <P>Last week at the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation we were addressed by former prisoners from Northern Ireland and by people involved with prisoners in the North and in the Republic.  I know <i>A Government of Renewal</i> has stressed that it will ratify the Council of Europe Convention on the transfer of sentenced persons.  I ask the Leader of the House to stress to the Minister for Justice the urgency of this because the prisoners' issue is so important to the peace process and is an area where we could make a contribution. This convention dates from 1986 and we are the only European Union country which has not ratified it.  I raise this issue not because I believe the Government will not make an effort to ratify the convention but because I asked two years ago for the ratification of the Convention to the 1977 Protocol to the Geneva Convention and it has not yet been ratified.  I would not like the same lack of urgency to apply to this convention.</P>

      <P>The matter I wish to raise this afternoon concerns the major flooding nationally and in the catchment area of the River Shannon in particular. I ask the Leader of the House to arrange for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to come to the House to debate this urgent matter.  We have seen on television areas in towns and cities which were flooded, but in the <Col N="1291" /> Shannon catchment area hundreds of farming families have suffered severe hardship and major losses.  This an important issue as far as they are concerned. Again, I ask the Leader of the House to arrange as a matter of urgency a debate so that we can evaluate and discuss what has happened and to see if there will be a reasonable response from the Government.</P>

      <P>Shortly before the last Government left office, a list of Bills was circulated to our Whips Office.  I was interested in a Bill which was supposed to come before the House before Christmas but because of special circumstances that did not happen.  I want to ask the Leader about the Fisheries and Commercial Harbours Bill which deals with a number of fishery harbours. I have a particular interest in the Bill because it is proposed that Dingle be made a major fishery harbour centre.  In fact, prior to Christmas I suggested to the Minister that the part of the Bill dealing with the Dingle major fishery harbour centre be dealt with as a separate Bill, in other words, it would be a short Bill which could pass through the House quickly.  The rest of the Bill could take eight or nine months or even longer to be passed through both Houses.  I ask the Leader to find out what he can about that.</P>

      <P>As regards the Programme for Government, I ask the Leader of the House to clarify whether a commitment was made that the question of votes for emigrants would be addressed &mdash; the proposal being that three Seanad seats would be set aside for emigrants.  If implemented, it would have far-reaching constitutional and electoral implications. I agree with those who have been lobbying in the UK for greater representation for emigrants in the voting system in this country that this falls far short of what they seek.  Perhaps the Leader could arrange a debate on the matter at an early stage or clarify that section of the new Programme for Government.  Emigrants have strong views on this issue; as someone who travels to the UK frequently, I know they believe it should have been addressed by either the last Government or the one before.  This Government knows the importance of this lobby and I hope it addresses this matter and that there can be an open ended debate.  I urge caution on the proposals that three seats &mdash; not extra seats &mdash; be set aside in this House for emigrants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the congratulations to all those who obtained office, in particular the Leader of the House, Senator Manning.  I look forward to working with him and making sure he has a busy and fruitful time in the short period he will be Leader.</P>
      <P>In the document <i>A Government of Renewal</i> a number of Bills are specifically promised which do not appear in the list of legislation circulated yesterday. One of these has been completed and would be ideal for introduction in this House &mdash; the Freedom of Information Bill.  The Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, had almost reached the final stage of her deliberations on that matter.  The new parties in Government will obviously want to have an input but that legislation should be introduced here expeditiously.</P>
      <P>The second Bill promised in that document will concern administrative procedures.  Again it would be ideal if that was introduced in this House and it would be a fruitful contribution to public administration.  The third piece of legislation concerns positive changes to the Ministers and Secretaries Act.  I do not mean the item we will discuss tomorrow, rather a commitment in the new Programme for Government &mdash; and in a programme produced to other partners who were almost in Government &mdash; to amend that Act in so far as it refers to ministerial responsibility.  All three items could be introduced and progressed rapidly in this House.  They could then be brought to finality and placed on the Statute Book.</P>
      <P>I also ask the Leader to make time for two debates.  The first concerns an issue as important to him as to me, university funding and fees.  That debate is taking place at present.  It is a difficult issue, there are arguments on both sides, but the Seanad, especially because of its university representation, could make an interesting contribution.  I ask for an early debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second debate I call for is on fisheries. Major decisions have been made over the last six weeks, particularly with regard to access by Spanish fishermen <Col N="1294" /> to the so-called &ldquo;Irish box&rdquo;.  Anyone from a coastal constituency and anyone who considers the amount of damage those fishermen have already done would be anxious that we discuss that. Again, it is an ideal matter for the Seanad.</P>

      <P>When is it proposed to take Item 4:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht to set up a music council to cater for the needs of the live music industry in order to save existing jobs and to create further employment in this great growth industry.</P>
      <P>We have had an efficient and good Arts Council for many years.  The establishment of the Film Board has been a major boost to the film industry which is generating an enormous number of new jobs.  However, the industry that at present employes about ten times more has no council or board to represent it <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Government.  That must be looked at and deserves a full discussion in this House.  We are fortunate to have a Minister who is sympathetic and who understands this magnificent industry which creates many jobs for young people.  These young people are great ambassadors for Ireland throughout the world.</P>

Even now they are affecting parts of County Clare such as Sixmilebridge, Ballyvaughan, Kilrush and the Shannon estuary.  These severe problems are <Col N="1296" /> causing untold hardship for many people.

I concur with the sentiments expressed by my colleague, Senator Norris, in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday with regard to the Packard workers.  Some of the arrangements that have been made there are disincentives rather than incentives.  I am worried that if we continue down this road all the hard won privileges secured by union negotiators during the years since the lock out will be swept away in the interests of big business. Perhaps we could have a debate on this issue.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I assure Senators that reform of the Seanad will be my first priority.  I should remind the House that reform of the Seanad is not a matter for Government, it is a matter for the House.  It is my intention to engage in consultations with all groups in the House to see that the reforms &mdash; upon which I suspect there is a wide measure of agreement &mdash; can be put through as speedily as possible. We are in a fortunate position, thanks to the absence of stability in certain aspects of the House, which strengthens the hand of those who wish to <Col N="1297" /> make Government listen.  Having consulted with members of the Government I have found that there is widespread support for us doing our own business and ensuring that this House is not left behind as a result of the recent reforms that have taken place in the other House.</P>
    <P>With regard to Northern Ireland, I too am anxious to have a debate on it at the earliest opportunity.  Senator Dardis made a point about the timing and to the publication of the framework document. In fairness, this House has always debated Northern Ireland in a particularly sensitive way and has never embarrassed a Government in the middle of negotiations.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis and others raised the Road Traffic Act.  I suppose it is a matter of great regret that voices in this House were not listened to when the legislation was going through.  I understand that at present the Government is consulting with a wide range of interests.  The matter is actively under review and I will report back to the House as soon as I have something more specific to say.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis also raised the question of a debate on education.  During the last Government, the ongoing debate on education was especially useful. I would like to reopen the debate, and to have education almost as a permanent part of the Order Paper because there are major changes taking place at all levels.  The most recent has been the funding for third level fees.  It is something I wish to get on the Order Paper quickly.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan raised the question of the Price Waterhouse report on the Defence Forces.  The new Minister for Defence and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, would like to hear the views of Members on this report.  When in Opposition we asked that the report be debated, and our position has not changed.  I will, therefore, see if I can address this matter at the earliest possible opportunity.  I will also ascertain if copies of the report can be made available to Members.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1298" /> Senator Lanigan also, in the course of a long and discursive contribution, appeared to advocate that we should discriminate against male Members of the European Parliament.  However, the political correctness on this side of the House would not allow us to do that.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan raised the question of the county enterprise partnership boards.  If he could draft a motion to incorporate the main points he wishes to make on this issue I will ascertain if time can be made for it.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry raised the issue of legislation in respect of prisoners.  I can assure her that the transfer of sentenced persons Bill is high up on the Order Paper priority list for the Government and I will ensure that the Senator's concern is brought back to Government and I will attempt to have the Bill introduced in this House if possible.</P>
    <P>On the question of flooding, I am sympathetic to Senator Finneran's request.  I am not sure if our procedures would allow us to act quickly enough, and a motion on the Adjournment might be a speedier way of getting the Minister to attend.  Perhaps I could talk to the Senator later to see if there is some other way we can have a fuller debate on this issue.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Bill mentioned by Senator Fitzgerald, it is not on the list I have at present.  This is a pity because all of us would like to see Dingle grow and thrive.  I will make inquiries&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and get back to the Senator.  Senator Bohan's contribution spoke for itself.  His point is well made. On the question of votes for emigrants, raised by Senator Mooney, this is a firm commitment in the Programme for Government.  The mechanism has not been decided.  I believe that the more likely approach will be not the taking of any seats from any of the panels, or, indeed, on this day especially, no attenuation of university seats, which we all cherish, but perhaps the addition of <Col N="1299" /> extra seats.  One way or the other, that proposal will need constitutional verification and I will report to the House as soon as there is further detail because it is obviously a matter of great concern to all Members.</P>
      <P>Senator Roche made a number of important contributions.  I take his point regarding the Bills he has mentioned. This House might be the better forum in which to have them introduced.  I will pass on this suggestion and see what pressure I can bring to bear on the matter. I also agree with the Senator that, perhaps as part of an education debate, the question of university funding could be incorporated.</P>
      <P>Senator Farrelly mentioned the Road Traffic Act.  With regard to Senator Cassidy's remarks on Item 4 on the Order Paper, this is a Fianna Fáil private Members' motion.  If the Senator could persuade his colleagues to give him the next Fianna Fáil slot, that would be a good way of discussing the matter.  It is the kind of motion upon which we could all agree.</P>

It seemed to me during the long Order of Business &mdash; I allowed an element of flexibility as it was our first day back &mdash; that many of the items, the Leader made the point himself, could be dealt with on the Adjournment or during private members' business.  The other question to be clarified is that on the statements on ending long term unemployment we have a number of speakers &mdash; Senator Taylor-Quinn, Senator Roche, Senator Henry, Senator O'Sullivan, Senator Honan, Senator Daly, Senator Cotter, Senator Calnan and Senator Quinn.  If they request an extension from ten to 15 minutes, will the House agree to that? Agreed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome the Minister back to the House.  It has been some time since the end of October when we discussed this very important issue.  A lot has changed since then and we are now back to discuss this issue more fully.  I welcome the report on long term unemployment.  I congratulate the National Economic and Social Forum, including two Members of this House, Senator O'Sullivan, the Leader of the Labour Party, and Senator Henry, who <Col N="1301" /> were involved in the production of this report.</P>
      <P>It is frightening to see that out of 135,000 people who have been out of work for one year, more than 65,000 or 10 per cent have not worked for three years.  The problem for the long term unemployed is that employers do not consider them for work before the short term unemployed.  There seems to be a bias inherent in the whole employment area against the long term unemployed. People out of work for more than a year have an 80 per cent chance of being unemployed at the end of the following year.  It is an indictment of society, and of our attitude to work, that the people who probably need work most &mdash; those who have the experience of long term unemployment &mdash; do not have an opportunity to work.</P>
      <P>It is a feature of long term unemployment that it hits local authority housing areas more severely than others.  This pattern is repeated throughout the country.  I see this in my local towns in west Limerick and it can be seen as readily in Dublin, Cork and other urban areas.  It is stressful to see housing estates which have been established for the ten or 20 years where there are families with children, and four out of five of the heads of household are on long term unemployment.  We must look seriously at this issue because there are communities who have no hope of employment and have an acceptance that they will have no future part of the workforce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State has a duty to look seriously at this socio-economic problem and the report before the House which we are discussing today points a way forward. Communities like these should not be excluded from paying their full part in society through activity through work. Unemployment is the single most important cause of poverty in Ireland. The State has a special responsibility to the long term unemployed.  The Government has a duty to introduce policies and strategies to change the situation at a time when the economy is doing well.  It has little effect on the <Col N="1302" /> problems of those experiencing long term unemployment and the situation must change.  The long term unemployed must share the benefits of the economic prosperity which the economic indicators show we are achieving. The long term unemployed do not see the effects of this and they should. Improvements in the economy must help those most in need of an improvement in their standard of living and life opportunities through work.  Our strategies and policies over many years have failed the long term unemployed.</P>
    <P>We must have an objective to provide employment opportunities for every citizen who wants to work.  Such an objective might appear to many as an impossible and even naive ambition but I do not agree.  As the Minister said in October, in the early 1980s when the prophets of doom and gloom said that the finances of this State were in a hopeless state with no prospects of correction, firms decisions were taken by the FitzGerald led Government and by subsequent Governments.  The social partners and society recognised the need for such a strong approach to the economy which led to a turnabout in the State's financial position.  A similar, singular, firm approach must be taken to tackling long term unemployment and obtaining a solution to this awful problem.</P>
    <P>The two approaches which must be taken, as the report sets out, are preventing people from becoming long term unemployed and tackling the problem of placement for them.  It is a long term problem; there will be no overnight solution.  The programme will be long term and could take a decade or more.  However, we must have strategies and targets to achieve that goal.</P>
    <P>I welcome the approaches specified in the forum's report.  It has identified that today's early school leavers are tomorrow's long term unemployed.  We must have polices which produce more jobs in the economy.  I welcome the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Richard Bruton's, recent operational programme for industrial <Col N="1303" /> development which will contribute to this end.</P>
    <P>Intervention in the education sector has a vital role to play in preventing future long term unemployment. Resources freed up by the falling birth rate must be retargeted at schools in disadvantaged areas, whose pupils are most likely to be affected if the State does not intervene in the cycle of people in these areas leaving school early and entering long term unemployment.</P>
    <P>The forum's proposal to introduce a national, comprehensive, locally based employment service available to short term and long term unemployed, as well as the employed and lone parents, is innovative.  It will tackle both the prevention and reintegration issues which I already raised.  Such a service will act as a mediator between the unemployed and training organisations and link up with local employers.  It is proposed to base it on one mediator to 125 unemployed people, and registration would be voluntary.</P>
    <P>Such a service must have real options for the unemployed and prepare people to return to productive employment.  Its success, or otherwise, will depend on its track record once it is established.  It is important for this system to have early successes to show that it works.  Careful planning and thinking through the proposals must be done by those responsible &mdash; the Minister and the Government.</P>
    <P>It is important that strategies be worked out to break down resistance to employing the long term unemployed.  I was a personnel manager for many years and I am aware of the resistance of employers, such as corporate bodies, to employing the long term unemployed. There is a feeling that the short term unemployed are more amenable and used to work, and that there is a problem about the long term unemployed in that they are part of a culture which accepts long term unemployment and they will have difficulties going back to work.  This is a prejudice that must be overcome.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1304" /> We must convince employers that the long term unemployed are just as productive as the short term unemployed. We must have training programmes which demonstrate this and which are aimed at the long term unemployed to develop skills which will be available and sought after by employers, many of whom are prejudiced against the long term unemployed.  It must become attractive and cost effective to employers to engage people who are long term unemployed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the debate and the Minister. The Government must turn the proposals into an operational programme with specific targets to evaluate the success of its intervention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Minister to the House.  On this occasion I feel I am playing musical chairs.  I find it hard to adjust to speaking from this side of the House but perhaps a little distance will help me to adapt to my new position.  However, I know the Minister from another environment and I will have no difficulty speaking to her here.  The Minister is most welcome.</P>
      <P>I am particularly pleased to speak on this topic.  My interest is generated by the fact that I deal with students who are long term unemployed and who are now back in the education system.  I am also pleased to contribute because I produced a book &mdash;&ldquo;The Perceptions of the Unemployed of Unemployment&rdquo;&mdash; on which I got my master's degree.  It contains all the material and studies the Minister wants on how to handle unemployment; it looks at its causes and remedies. It covers the huge number of studies which have been carried out and addresses where we go from here.  There is no doubt that unemployment is a huge problem and we must examine it in the context of when it started, when it got out of control and how we can put some order on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the middle 1970s, when I did my research, the big organisations which employed many people &mdash; names with which we all became familiar &mdash; closed down.  The traditional family began to <Col N="1305" /> take on different pursuits.  The idea of the father going out to work while the family stayed at home began to disappear. It was the first time we heard words such as &ldquo;unemployment&rdquo; and &ldquo;redundancy&rdquo;.  It was also about this time that we all became interested in the video industry and quick food that could be taken home.  Our whole lifestyle began to change and a new way of doing things emerged.  Unemployment was becoming the keyword, and this was unsettling.</P>
    <P>Before we start putting forward solutions we must examine the situation as it stands.  The position is horrific and the psychological impact on families, individuals, children and society is enormous in terms of image, identity and role.  When we meet a person for the first time, one of their first questions is &ldquo;What do you do?&rdquo;  One is identified with one's status.  If one says &ldquo;I am a teacher&rdquo;, one is immediately put into a certain lifestyle.  There is a huge identity crisis for the individual who is unemployed.</P>
    <P>There is an impact on the family and a spouse in such a situation in terms of trying to cope with the family structures. There is an impact on mental health in terms of stresses and strains, to one's self-esteem, one's personal identity and on diet, normal routines and money in terms of wondering if one can go out and get involved in certain activities. The whole way of life changes.  Unemployment has a great impact on the family structure and is a threat to the fabric of society.  It also leads to a change in the social norms change.  We have to ask how we will adapt; we have to ask how we can sort out or overcome this huge problem with new ideas and we have to look for a new agenda.</P>
    <P>Change is taking place; the concept of work will never be the same again.  The old concept and structure of work &mdash; going in at 9 a.m., coming home at 5 p.m. with two or three weeks holidays &mdash; is changing.  The kind of work we do is changing; the technological era has come and gone.  We are now looking at new forms of work structures.  We have <Col N="1306" /> the contract system; we are questioning whether the idea of the interview for a job is the way forward, if one should be penalised if one does not perform well on the day of the interview when one could be able for the job.</P>
    <P>We have to look at all those matters before we introduce structures.  Are the ideas of placement and training now appropriate?  I deal with these issues and I do not have the answer.  I am not saying they are appropriate but we have gone beyond that.  We must examine the kind of jobs for which we will train people in the future.  What kind of retraining should we provide?</P>
    <P>There are skill shortages.  In my local authority we looked for people to do jobs like street cleaning on a Saturday afternoon and on a Sunday; we could not get them.  The trade unions stopped us, but the job had to be done; we need more people so that we can schedule buses more frequently; old people need to be cared for and we do not have enough people in that area; and we need another child care structure to educate children for a living.  The fabric and structure of society has to be looked at in each area.</P>
    <P>Where do we go from here?  We must have active links with the community and involve people from the community. Adult learning must go hand in hand with school learning, in other words, the adult population and the school population must work together. We have an adult population, a school population and the community, yet they do not at any time dovetail for the overall good and development of society. We must involve the community more; from now on we must acknowledge that the school is the oasis of stability in society.</P>
    <P>In 1983 Mr. Tony Watts wrote a book on education, employment and the future of work.  He said we must accept that we live in a society in which employment continues to be one of the main sources of status and that identity and income are accepted as another.  At the same time, we must also accept that there is a huge percentage of the population <Col N="1307" /> denied the basics &mdash; a status, an identity and an income.</P>
    <P>What do we do?  According to Mr. Watts, we must confront this system and the only way we can do so is through education; I agree with him because I have read a lot about this.  He says that at this time it is not a question of trying to put people into jobs; rather it is a question of a new education process not alone in skills but in values and attitudes. If we follow that thinking we will go a long way towards helping people adjust to a new way of life.  Mr. Watts also talks about undertaking education courses which will reduce the stigma attached to being unemployed and increase one's chances of impressing a potential employer.</P>
    <P>Dr. Jim Chamberlain of UCD has written a lot on this subject.  He said that school is now becoming &ldquo;the oasis of stability&rdquo; because we are in a transition from an insecure family as a result of the breakdown of unemployment and what it does to society and family, and there is a transition and an unease between insecurity in the home and the uncertainty of trying to launch oneself into the job market.  The only stability for the person to come into their own is through the school structure.</P>
    <P>We are looking at new ideas.  I compliment the National Economic and Social Forum for its work.  I was present at some of its first sessions; unfortunately I could not attend more often as I had so many other things to do.  We can move forward in that area.  There are many good things coming out of the forum, particularly in relation to the employment service concept which is coming into being.  It is set up in Coolock and on the north side of Dublin, but some elements of the concept do not gel.  We do not have an integrated system. We need an outreach centre, not haphazard approaches.  If somebody is long term unemployed how do I know that?  We must always remember that we are aiming to get the person back into the system.  We are looking for a <Col N="1308" /> user friendly centre in the local social employment exchanges.</P>
    <P>I deal with the unemployed.  They are vulnerable people; they are very insecure; they have no confidence; their esteem is so low they are daunted by anybody coming to talk to them.  They have the stigma of not being wanted. We need professionals in a user friendly atmosphere who will reach out to these people and try to get them to break the cycle of unemployment.  The long term unemployed are in a rut and we must try to get them out of it.  I have made a suggestion and I would like to see it looked at again.</P>
    <P>We must have a network of agencies who are not working in isolation.  FÁS is doing a good job but I would question them about their schemes.  The schemes are good but we must look to the new kind of work and the new style of life of the future.  We must also take the school as the base in the community; it is becoming the stability centre in the community.  We must look at the local enterprise boards that are being set up; they too are working in isolation.  We must look at the religious orders and what they are doing in society.  We must look at unemployed groups because they are doing a lot of work in their areas.  However we are not working together.</P>
    <P>When I was doing my research I went to all these agencies and groups and I realised it would have been better had there been one centre where I could have got all the information.  For example, when people in a local area collect their unemployment benefit it would be nice if there was a user friendly office It is very important that the number of guidance counsellors is increased.  These professionals understand how to deal with psychological problems.  If one can get these people thinking again and develop their confidence, I believe this is the way forward. Perhaps there are not enough people with the relevant information dealing with this problem together.</P>
    <P>We need a user friendly outreach centre. We also need to involve employers. <Col N="1309" /> We have already talked about the current employment service and I congratulate the forum for bringing forward that initiative.  We also need all the agencies working together and professionals giving seminars in each locality.  That would be my thinking on a regional philosophy.  That is the way of the future in dealing with the problem of the long term unemployed. Returning to the education system has had a dramatic effect on the confidence of the long term unemployed.  They are now ready to sit their leaving certificate and launch themselves into the jobs market.  They may not get a job, but they will no longer feel inadequate and left aside as they did in the last couple of years.  They are now meeting people who are in the same boat and they are learning from each another.  The return to second chance education is a great opportunity for them.  Coupled with the other services out there, we can break this trend and cycle of unemployment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I also welcome the forum report and I compliment the chairperson, Maureen Gaffney, and the members of the forum on its work and its preparation.  The report highlights one of the most serious social problems in our society, namely, long term unemployment. I congratulate Senator Ormonde for her excellent contribution. While I do not have her academic experience on unemployment, nevertheless I have dealt with unemployed people over a long period.  It is one of the most difficult problems that faces a public representative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed, the Minister said in her opening speech that long-term unemployment hits hardest in local authority areas, and this was also touched on by Senator Neville.  The Minister also stated that 80 per cent of tenants in local authority houses in the greater Dublin area were families who had no income from employment; the Minister was right.  A recent assessment for the rent section of Dublin Corporation shows <Col N="1310" /> that 80 per cent of our tenants are on social welfare benefit.</P>
    <P>It is important to dwell for a few moments on why the problem has occurred especially in Dublin and other urban areas.  During the 1970s employment in Irish owned firms declined by 3,800 people in the Dublin area.  During the same period, foreign owned firms increased employment by 230 people. This was because there was a Government policy between the 1950s and the 1970s to direct industrial investment away from the east coast.  Taking the entire period since entering the European Community in 1973, employment in Irish and foreign owned industries in the Dublin area has declined by almost 25,000 people.  The decline of indigenous employment in the Dublin area was caused by the increasing competitive environment arising out of entry into the EU in 1973 and the changed demand for other industrial products which placed traditional firms in a difficult position.</P>
    <P>Many contractors have closed down. The most significant losses occurred in the food, drink, tobacco, textile, clothing, footwear, leather, paper, printing and motor construction industries, but almost every sector of the indigenous industry base was affected.  Dublin's legacy of a high proportion of such traditional declining industries represents a distinctive disadvantage.</P>
    <P>At the same time, many new emerging firms have tended to locate, as I have said, away from the east coast due to incentives to do so.  This movement has resulted in a high proportion of growing industries, like the chemical and metal engineering industries, being established outside the Dublin area. That happened at a particular time in the 1970s and many of the traditional indigenous industries in Dublin were wiped out and nothing was put in their place.  Many of those who were employed at that time in Dublin are still long term unemployed; they never got back into employment.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the reasons manufacturing employment has declined significantly <Col N="1311" /> in the Dublin area over the last two decades.  This is a serious concern in Dublin.  Efforts to replace declining industries with appropriate alternatives must, therefore, be a central component of economic and social policy as far as Dublin is concerned.  With 29 per cent of the population, Dublin has 31 per cent of the national labour force and 34 per cent of national unemployment. Dublin's proportion of national unemployment has consistently been higher than the rest of the country.  As I stated previously, much of the manufacturing industry base has been eroded.  There are now 80,000 people out of work in Dublin, many of them on long term unemployment.  If nothing is done to improve the unemployment situation in Dublin, by 1996 that figure will have reached 105,000 people.  For this reason, I welcome this report.</P>
    <P>I attended a meeting of the regional council last night.  An interesting presentation was made to us by a professor from Trinity College.  In his slides, he showed us the decline of employment, which I have mentioned and of which I was aware, but he also referred to another aspect which frightened me &mdash; I am sure it is of great interest to the Minister &mdash; that is, that the Structural Funds being allocated to Dublin are less than those going to other parts of the country.  It is important that Dublin gets its fair share of Structural Funds to make up that gap which has been around since the decline in Dublin's manufacturing base.</P>
    <P>It has been my experience in dealing with the unemployed that the longer a person is unemployed the harder it is for them to get back into unemployment. It is a frightening statistic that three out of four people who have been unemployed for at least two years face at least another year of unemployment and it gets progressively worse.  That is the challenge.  It has also been my experience in dealing with the unemployed that after a lengthy period of unemployment, people have lost the will to work, <Col N="1312" /> which is the psychological factor Senator Ormonde was talking about.</P>
    <P>I concur with the report's finding, that training and education play an important part in helping the long term unemployed.  I am of the view that if a new industry is to be found for a long term unemployment blackspot, the workforce in that area should be trained well in advance of the new industry's opening.  It has been my experience in the past that when new industries are found for these areas, few of the local population are employed.  Employment comes from other areas.  It is important to train the local community in advance of the coming of the new industry to that area.</P>
    <P>At this stage, I welcome the statement which was issued recently by the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa.  He was responding to the latest ERSI paper which shows that those bearing most of the burden of unemployment had very low levels of education attainment.  The current risk of being in poverty is very high for those with substantial career unemployment. The Minister said he will continue to develop second chance education initiatives which offer opportunities without the loss of income to unemployed people who leave school early. The vocational training opportunities scheme, the third level education scheme and the back to work allowance will be expanded and the guidance and placement service will be set up at local level with resources from his Department, FAS, the vocational education committees, ICTU and others.  He also gave a commitment that a new special employment measure will be established providing job opportunities with a range of different public authorities and agencies, voluntary bodies and private sector employers.  This will be targeted at the most disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that these measures were part of a new approach to tackling long term unemployment. New and more imaginative measures are needed to ensure that unemployed <Col N="1313" /> people share fully in the benefit of the current economic growth.  That point is very important.  We have very high unemployment at a time when we have very low interest rates and low inflation and, for the first time, a balanced budget.  The unemployed should benefit from these measures.</P>
    <P>I concur with the views expressed by some speakers that the impact of redundancy law on long term employment should be reviewed.  It has been my experience that a number of people who have long term employment service find it very substantially rewarding to leave their employment and to avail of redundancy packages.  While this is their entitlement, nevertheless, there should be some system in place whereby they can be encouraged to invest their redundancy payments in other types of employment.</P>
    <P>There is an opening created by the employment enterprise boards.  I am heartened, as a member of the County Dublin Enterprise Partnership Board, to see the number of people who are coming forward with ideas to create employment.  Some of them have been long term unemployed and I am always sympathetic to their cause.  I would not agree with Senator Ormonde that we are dealing in isolation.  We deal with the partnership boards and other groups who are interested in the unemployed.</P>
    <P>I commend this report.  It is only a starting point but it is a step in the right direction.  The work put in by the Members of the Oireachtas and the representatives of the social partners has been most important.  The report represents a broad consensus of practical measures which have to been taken to overcome the problem of long term unemployment.  I look forward to seeing these measures outlined in the forum report implemented as soon as possible.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1314" /> May I ask a procedural question?  I learned a great deal from this discussion and in particular from Senator Ormonde.  She spoke from a depth of research and experience which made her contribution uniquely authoritative. Is it possible for her to speak again in this debate?  I am only going to speak for a few minutes and if it were possible for me to share my time with her I would gladly do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the worse for ourselves because she could have gone on for some time.  I was riveted by her contribution.  As I am going to speak briefly and superficially following what we have heard, I welcome the report very much.  Its content is very good and its tone is absolutely right.  Whatever the virtues of the market may be &mdash; they are very considerable in some areas because a certain amount of competition and market stimulus can help us all improve our performance &mdash; talking about the long term employed in primarily market terms is to simply misconceive the nature of the problem entirely.  The approach adopted in this report, whatever comments on and critiques of individual proposals one might have, is absolutely right and we should build on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unemployment is a very long term problem and its solution will be very long term, as Senator Neville and others have rightly observed.  The role of education is central.  Getting at the early school leavers is a major challenge.  This problem transcends the schools and cannot be solved by them on their own. There is a temptation &mdash; one notices it in some of the publications on education as well as in some of the publications on poverty more generally &mdash; to subcontract out to schools the problem of coping with poverty, deprivation and the cluster, multiplicity and layers of long-term problems which arise from this.  This is not good enough.  Schools <Col N="1315" /> have a central role to play but this can only be in the context of a total package.</P>
    <P>Poverty in this country is primarily a structural problem.  Poverty can be found everywhere but the culture of poverty is located very heavily in a fairly small number of particular areas.  If that culture is to be properly tackled as distinct from individuals being salvaged here and there from it, we need a total poverty action programme in which the schools have a major part to play and in which the solution to long term unemployment is central.  Without solving this problem, poverty will never be adequately tackled.  This problem is a crisis.  When there is a crisis for long enough, it ceases to be a crisis.  Just as once there was an acceptable level of violence in Northern Ireland, we have, I am afraid, nearly reached the stage where for many of us there is an acceptable level of unemployment in Southern Ireland.  If we are to overcome the temptation to lapse into that degree of complacency or, at least, a resignation about the problem of unemployment, particularly long term unemployment, we are in for a long haul.</P>
    <P>I was particularly taken by references in the report and in some of the contributions to the role played by women in trying to counter the culture of poverty. It is still disproportionately the mother and wife who has to struggle to hold some sort of collectivity and a family together.  The majority of the long term unemployed are men and, in many cases, fathers.  The temptation to give up, to resign to fatalism and to drop out psychologically is one to which unemployed men, and fathers in particular, are peculiarly vulnerable and an enormous psychological, financial and cultural burden falls on the mother to try to hold the family together in those circumstances. Any way in which their task can be lightened and in which they can be supported is also a contribution to changing the atmosphere and attitude to job seeking among the unemployed directly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1316" /> I was interested in the references in the report to the proposals of the Conference of Major Religious Superiors and the 1,000 jobs created under the auspices of that programme.  I am no authority on this area and I ask the Minister if the reports in the papers recently about far more than this number applying for these jobs and the degree of success achieved already are correct and if this programme is progressing as or even more successfully than many assumed it would.  May 1997 is the date recorded in the report for the final evaluation of this programme.  If the programme is recording significant success much earlier than this, we should consider expanding it at an earlier stage rather than waiting for the result of a pilot project to be evaluated two and a half years down the line.  This may be a short period in the overall time span which it will take to solve this problem but is very long for those who are now long term unemployed if there are prospects of expanding that programme and if it is as successful as some media reports suggest.  A great deal of praise is due to Fr. Seán Healy and Sister Brigid Reynolds for the quality and innovation of the thinking they have brought to trying to solve this problem. No proposal is ever 100 per cent correct, but over the past few years they have been instrumental in pushing back the frontiers of thinking about how we should approach unemployment.  Their tenacity and dedication should inspire the rest of us towards resolving the problem in as committed a way.</P>
    <P>The analogy has been drawn, both in the report itself and by a number of speakers, between the manner in which the problem of the public finances which plagued us in the late 1970s and early 1980s was resolved, or is on the way to being resolved, and the challenge confronting us on long term unemployment. The way in which the public finances were turned around was a major achievement and I do not want to deny that for one moment.  In our culture it was an extraordinary achievement, <Col N="1317" /> but the analogy is not quite perfect because the public finances were almost entirely under the control of Government itself and, therefore, governmental willpower was the central issue in turning them around.  For once, Government actually had under its control nearly as much as it normally claims to have.</P>
    <P>Fundamentally, the issue came back to willpower in that context.  Willpower is also absolutely central here, but even with the most committed willpower in the world Government alone certainly cannot solve the problem of long term unemployment.  It has to involve a commitment by the community to the value system behind those programmes.  Just as I said earlier, that I feared that many of us have now reached a stage where we are thinking in terms of the acceptable level of unemployment, there will be an onus on Government to raise public awareness and consciousness of the priority that ought to attach to this programme because it cannot do everything itself.  What it can do itself is to recognise that there are two aspects which cry out from this report, in terms of Government organisation of its own business, that can contribute significantly to the type of approach recommended. The report is emphatic on the importance of local initiatives and the local approach, within a national framework obviously but nevertheless emphasising the importance of local commitment and local energy.  While that is crucial, it cannot be confined to activities in that area alone.  I am not going to make a speech about empowerment and decentralisation but they are ultimately all part of the same package, the same cast of mind.  If the attitude at central governmental level towards empowering local activity &mdash; whether it is local government, private or partnership activity &mdash; is not genuine, if it simply remains rhetorical, then much of the potential impact of this will be subverted and weakened.  We will remain in the realm of rhetoric much longer than necessary.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1318" /> The second aspect concerns the fact, which arises from what Senator Ormonde and Senator Doyle said &mdash; although his emphasis was different &mdash; that the required programmes do not fit neatly into any Government Department remit but cut right across a series of departmental activities.  It would be sad if turf wars, bureaucratic brawls and all the things we are accustomed to, not only in Government but in every institution in the land, not excluding institutions of higher education, were to impede the achievement of the objectives. There is broad agreement on the objectives and a fair degree of agreement on how one should approach the resolution of them.  However, the organisation of the mechanisms and their implementation depends in large measure on the effectiveness of policy measures which in turn cannot be confronted within the existing departmental structures.</P>
    <P>We have had aspects of this discussion here before.  More and more, the real problems confronting this country defy the institutional structures we devised to try to resolve them in an earlier, less complex and less interlinked age.  One of the main problems confronting this Government, or any Government from now on, will be how to reorganise and reorient the activities of public servants, who as individuals are extremely able, to make sure that their energies go primarily into resolving real problems, as distinct from problems that can be slotted into departmental perspectives, rather than extending them, as we all do from time to time, in internal, internecine conflict.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Unemployment levels registered during recent years represent an all-pervasive abnormality which is demoralising families and communities. General unemployment is fast becoming a fact of life which is in danger of becoming accepted as the norm.  Neither I nor my party are prepared to countenance the permanent economic and social sidelining of hundreds of thousands of our citizens.  The old paraceas <Col N="1319" /> have not worked and are not likely to work in the future.  The world of work is changing at a rate unimaginable just ten or 20 years ago.  By the end of the century fewer than half of all workers are likely to be working in traditional forms of employment.</P>
      <P>At this point I should refer to the strategy of rationalisation adopted by employers in the mid-1980s.  Their priority, discussed in every forum, was rationalisation &mdash; get rid of the employees at all costs.  That strategy was never countered and nobody put up a hand to say &ldquo;Stop.  This is leading to a disastrous situation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Despite the amount expended on computers in much of the industrial sector, we must also have regard to people, even though we know that it is a modern and technological world now.  The number of part-time workers, voluntary and involuntary, is growing.  Many who would like to avail of part-time work or job sharing have, in the past, been faced with a variety of obstacles and disincentives. The problems of a modern world demand modern and innovative approaches and the programme <i>A Government of Renewal</i> contains a number of innovative policy proposals which will help to tackle unemployment and increase the range of choices available for those wishing to enter or reenter the world of work.  It is essential that the task of implementing these proposals should begin in next month's budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I particularly welcome the commitment to revitalise public enterprise and the recognition of the dramatic changes facing our State companies.  Employment policy must focus not merely on job creation but also on job maintenance. It is vital that our State companies be equipped to deal with the challenges posed by rapid technological changes and the demands of EU membership. During the past decade State companies in Ireland and elsewhere have all too often been viewed as little more than disposable assets to be ploughed up when the economic going gets tough. <Col N="1320" /> Our policy towards State companies should be one of commercialisation rather than privatisation.  I am glad that this is the route chosen by the Government parties in their programme.</P>
    <P>I welcome the commitment to give commercial State bodies a clear commercial mandate and to clarify the financial targets by which their performance will be measured.  I also welcome the Government's commitment to indigenous industry.  We have learned the painful lesson of over reliance on multinational enterprises which had little or no commitment to the communities in which they operate.  The lesson has been learned in terms of jobs lost and communities devastated, and I hope that it will not have to be repeated. The development of industrial clusters will revitalise whole communities and will allow for integrated industrial development.  There is, however, a danger that industrial development will by-pass those most in need &mdash; the long term unemployed.  All too often newly created jobs go to those already in employment or who have been unemployed for just a few months.  Why do the long term unemployed remain on the sidelines?  The report has done much valuable work in this regard, not only identifying the problems but also suggesting solutions.  I am glad that the Government programme borrows from the forum in its commitments to establish an intensive guidance and placement service operated at local level and involving local employers and trade unions.</P>
    <P>On a number of occasions since 1981 Cork County Council has raised with Ministers the employment of those receiving unemployment benefit or assistance on road works and general works undertaken by the council and the consequential transfer of funds.  The response was that these funds are intended to provide a degree of income and maintenance during periods of involuntary unemployment and that any alteration would involve far reaching legislative changes and would give rise to serious administrative implications.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1321" /> The local authorities have an abundance of work to be done if a system was devised whereby people could be recruited.  The policy statement issued by the council at the time said:</P>
    <P>For some time now Cork County Council has been deeply concerned by its inability to provide an acceptable standard of service to the people of County Cork.  The most notable reduction in services has been in the upkeep of the road network which was built with substantial investment in previous decades as well as the maintenance of burial grounds and similar operations.</P>
    <P>In our own areas we can see where jobs can be provided.  Many of these tasks are labour intensive and the basic cause of the decline in maintenance has been the reduction in county council financing which has not kept pace with inflation.</P>
    <P>There is a point which must be clarified. Is there an embargo on the employment of extra staff by the council? That question has to be answered by saying if one provides staff, one has to be able to pay for them.  However, if there is an embargo, it should be reversed to allow major job creation by the local authorities.  This happened in the 1987 to 1988 period when a policy of fiscal rectitude was being followed. Everybody thought it was all over at that point.  There was a vast reduction in the number of people employed in local authorities.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the work being done by the forum and similar organisations I am conscious of the danger that theory may be substituted for action.  The shelves in Government buildings are groaning under the weight of dust covered reports produced by various organisations during recent years.  The time has come for these reports to be taken down, re-examined and, where appropriate, acted on.</P>

      <P>Ar dtús ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire go dtí an Teach seo arís.  I congratulate Senator <Col N="1322" /> Ormonde on the very good book she has written.  It is great book which I look forward to reading at a later stage.</P>
      <P>Unemployment is a very big problem. We should ask ourselves why it is such a problem.  There was never more work to be done in this country.  Every county council and corporation could employ 50 to 100 people if the money was made available.</P>
      <P>The Minister told us last October that unemployment cost £2.16 billion in 1993.  It is costing us much more.  The old proverb says that idle hands find mischievous work.  There are young unemployed people running around the country and the city.  What are they involved in?  They are getting up at 4 p.m. and are out on the streets until 4 a.m. and then going home.  We have created a system that leads to unemployment in many ways.</P>
      <P>I am always quoting my own experience in my village where we have over 90 people employed in six little industries. Anyone travelling on the road from Sligo to Bundoran will see we have the most prosperous village in this country. I welcome the Minister to visit if she ever passes that way.  I give her an open invitation and I will show her around.</P>
      <P>I still have land and employ people, but I could not build factories today as I did a short 20 years ago.  Two men came into me and asked me to provide them with a little factory.  I asked them how soon they wanted it and they said they would be ready to start in six weeks.  I said I would have one for them and asked how much they wanted.  I went into the council the following morning and got planning agreed verbally which one could do then.  I got a contractor and had men working in that factory eight weeks later.  I could not do that today.  I am the same man and have more land but I cannot do it.  Planning laws have become very complicated and expensive.  One requires various reports on the site which could take up to 12 months and cost anything from £6,000 to £10,000.  It cost me nothing when I was starting.  That is one matter we must remedy; it cannot go on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1323" /> Where factories close and some of the employees want to set up on a smaller scale, they get no State assistance until they have been on the dole for six months.  People have said to me that after six months on the dole, the business is gone and the customers have gone elsewhere.  If they could start and receive assistance the following week, they would keep a business going and employ a number of people.</P>
    <P>I am not pessimistic.  I do not believe we should have unemployment.  In the city and throughout the country there are fields, rivers and land flooded.  Why can we not bring back some of the drainage schemes and introduce more environmental schemes?  Why can we not make some of this £2.16 billion available to the local authorities to repair roads which are in a disgraceful condition?  We are not trying to employ people.</P>
    <P>For years I fought on this issue. &ldquo;Multinational&rdquo; was a dirty word and the builders and those creating jobs were the speculators.  We spent years abusing them saying they should not be in our society and were a cancer we had to get rid of.  They are gone and the result is unemployment.  We did away with small contractors because we introduced a new tax system.  This affected small industry and contractors employing two or three men.  The employment of two or three people here and there in numerous areas creates much work.  These people are not in business today because they are operating under the same tax regime as the big organisations and are not capable of coping with this.</P>
    <P>I left business because &mdash; I cast no aspersions on the travelling community &mdash; I worked like the travelling community. The bank manager was my book keeper.  I had two little books; I knew who owed me money and I knew those to whom I owed money.  I looked at my bank balance and my book keeping was done.  I went out to collect a few accounts and just scratched the name out of the book when I got my money. <Col N="1324" /> Senator Sherlock has seen the same system in Cork and elsewhere.  Today, there is a ream of paper.  One has to have PRSI, VAT and so on.  Small industries do not have the ability to cope with it.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Sherlock.  One of my famous phrases when I was opposing this was &ldquo;amalgamation, rationalisation and conglomeration&rdquo;.  Those were the buzz words and only big could work.  I started small and I was proved right that small industries could play a big part. Small businesses should return to the system whereby one stamped a card.  If any of us wanted to employ people in the morning, we could not do it because we would have to register and get a PRSI number.  It would cost us too much so we hire a contract man.  It is easier to pay him and be done with it.  It is not encouraging.</P>
    <P>Our education system is also wrong because it is geared towards failure.  The buzz phrase on everyone's tongue after examinations is how did he or she do and people will say they failed or they did not get the points.  There should be a system so that if one reaches a certain standard, one qualifies for third level education in whatever discipline they are interested in.  Places in third level education should not be given on points. Schools were set up with career guidance teachers so that we would no longer try to put, the square peg in the round hole yet, because of a certain points system, people are taking jobs they never wanted.  They would have been better in other lines of work, if they had not been pushed in another direction by our system.  People will then say they lost because of the interview or some other system, perhaps a lottery system, but at least failure was not the reason they did not get it.  We must do away with the word failure among our youth.</P>
    <P>Long-term unemployed people over 50 years of age should be given a pension for life because they will not come back into the workforce.  We should provide money to ensure this happens.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1325" /> I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, is successful because there is too much scheming and truancy in this country.  Big schools cause this problem. When there were small schools in the towns, cities and in the country, the teacher knew every child in the class. Teachers do not know who is in their classes or in the schools today because the schools are so big.  Unless children go to school and are educated and trained, there will be no hope for them. We cannot allow that to happen.</P>
    <P>In years gone by, the travellers &mdash; or the itinerants and tinkers as they were known when I was a young boy &mdash; learned a trade, making cans, etc., when they were knee high.  No matter where they worked, everyone was geared to work from a young age.  We have got rid of all that.  People are no longer learning to work.  We must get back to the work ethic, get children back to school and we must spend money at the lower level.</P>
    <P>Culliton was right when he said there were two types of education in this country.  We have the technical schools, from which I graduated, and the universities. Universities are great for academics and we need them.  However, we try to have a school where everyone will be as good as the next, but we are not all the same.  I can repair a car or do mechanical work, but I would have a problem if I had to add three or four pages of sums.  The technical school catered for people who were good with their hands.  This meant they became interested in their work and they started to learn because they wanted to further promote themselves rather than doing exercises in which they had no interest. We must get back to the two types of education.</P>
    <P>My school in Grange, County Sligo, and many other technical schools in the country supplied the ESB with electricians, the post office with technicians and many of our hospitals with nurses. However, this new system has created nothing but unemployment and the <Col N="1326" /> good children, as I once said on a programme when someone asked me what I would do in a certain case, who can win their way through and get their examinations do not want any assistance because they will manage.  It is the weak children who need the most attention because the strong will succeed.  We are not giving education to the weakest because our system has moved away from trying to support those people.</P>
    <P>We must change our education system. Young people should not be unemployed. During the days of emigration anyone who went to England and got a job in the first couple of days made good, but if they did not, they became involved in the pub crawls and met disaster. That is happening here today.  Too many young people are going down the wrong road.  They are getting into trouble with the law and are becoming involved in vandalism and drugs.</P>
    <P>I often thought it would be a great idea if children, when they reached 16 years of age, were sent into the work-place for two years because that is the university of reality, and then went back to school.  They would have a greater appreciation of learning because they would have experienced the work ethic and they would know what they wanted to do.  It would make a big difference. Today people are going to school at 25 and 26 years of age.  The last year of technical school was a work experience year where students were sent out to do whatever they were good &mdash; carpentry and other trades.  We have tried to short circuit that with AnCO and FÁS courses, but we are not getting the volume of people into work.  Why?  If one employs someone today and keeps them for over six months, one must keep them or give them a lump sum to get rid of them.  That applies to health boards, county councils, etc.  That was not a problem years ago because one could employ someone and keep them at work and if the work ran out they were let go.  People accepted that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1327" /> There was also a system that where anyone who had 26 stamps in the summer months got double unemployment benefit for the winter.  This encouraged people to work and to get jobs because they knew they could stay at home and get double unemployment benefit. Many people of my age group will remember the dole and unemployment benefit; unemployment benefit was twice that of the dole.  Our system was geared to encourage people to work and to get better assistance.</P>
    <P>If a young girl or boy is living at home, they will only get £15 or £20 a week unemployment assistance.  However, if that same boy or girl puts a caravan in the garden, as they are doing in rural Ireland, or gets a flat in town, they will get £65 a week, plus £25 rent subsidy from the health board, which totals £80 a week.  Under our present system they are entitled to it.  This means that to encourage these people to go out to work an employer would need to pay them £160 a week.  They are not worth that to a business starting off.  We must give more finance to local authorities. We must also create jobs, develop a work ethic and get rid of the system which is discouraging people, particularly our young people, from working.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I seem to be the only politician in Ireland who does not have a solution to the unemployment problem. It is always easy to pontificate from here or from other public platforms and to say what should be done about unemployment, but the result of such statements is close to 300,000 unemployed.  I suppose I am one of the few people who believe there is a conspiracy among politicians and the vested interests against the unemployed and that those who come forward so frequently and so eloquently and who set up so many organisations to counteract it are weeping crocodile tears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1328" /> Unemployment is certainly the largest problem in this country.  We have confronted it for 20 to 30 years but we have singularly failed either to tackle or to reduce it.  This report will not make any great contribution to solving the problem.  This is one of a long line of reports; it comes from a forum set up by the last Government to convince the Irish people something was being done about unemployment.  Something was being done; a committee was being set up to look at unemployment and make recommendations.  It was not the first and certainly will not be the last committee to do such work.  Despite the goodwill of many of those who participated, the committee will be judged on its results and it will be impossible to say this report created any jobs.</P>
    <P>It did perform a wonderful window dressing job for a Government which could not do anything about the unemployment problem.  When this forum was set up we knew the unemployment figures were rising and would continue to rise up.  We knew there had been an Oireachtas all-party committee on unemployment which had been a complete and utter failure.  Fine Gael had honourably refused to participate in that committee because it was a cosmetic exercise.</P>
    <P>It was impossible for that Government, with its new complexion, to set up a similar body.  Instead it decided to set up a body containing people who were not Members of the Oireachtas.  That is perhaps a noble aim but it might have been better if there had been no Oireachtas Member whatever on this body, because while politicians are good at weeping about unemployment they are manifestly bad at taking action on it.</P>
    <P>My first problem with the National Economic and Social Forum is that it is too big.  It was established with 49 people to discuss, resolve and make recommendations to solve the problem of long term unemployment.  That is an unwieldy and impossible number of <Col N="1329" /> people to make decisions or credible recommendations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently this was necessary because of the window-dressing; it was necessary to make it look as though action was taking place.  The cosmetic reasons behind setting up this body were disastrous.  To have a body of politicians sitting in Dublin Castle or Kilmainham, apparently attempting to reach what the last Taoiseach called &ldquo;a consensus&rdquo; on unemployment, was unrealistic, absurd and insulting.</P>
      <P>Admittedly, for the first time it contained non-political elements.  It contained members from what was called &ldquo;the social partners&rdquo;&mdash; the trade unions, the employers and the farmers. It also contained representatives from what was called &ldquo;the third strand&rdquo;&mdash; the women's organisations, the unemployed, the disadvantaged, youth, the elderly, people with a disability, environmental interests and academics. How these people and groups were selected is as much a mystery to me as how the Seanad is selected and how people get on to panels for this House.</P>

      <P>It is a strange collection of people.  However, it was a way of buying the vested interests.  One of the worst things that happened on this committee was that on the first day &mdash; I am open to correction on that &mdash; a member of the Portobello unemployment group came to the meeting at the Royal Hospital Kilmainham and was removed for interrupting proceedings.  This gave a great symbolic meaning to the event &mdash; one of the unemployed, whose fate these grand people were discussing, was not allowed to contribute because he was making too much noise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>He was removed by the gardaí, Senator O'Toole.  What is more, this cosmetic exercise contains exactly the same business interests as have already discussed <i>ad nauseam</i> the problems of the unemployed since time immemorial.  It also contains the social partners, who have discussed unemployment and reached accord on the subject in various national agreements but have manifestly failed to make a dent in the problem.</P>
      <P>One of the difficulties with this form is that many of those participating are not interested in resolving the unemployment problem.  They will yield to pressure by giving a little, agreeing to schemes and giving certain amounts of money to resolve the problem. However, the interest of the social partners is to protect their members.  The employers will protect business interests; the interests of the trade unions is to protect their members, and exclusively so; and the interests of the farmers are the interests of their members.</P>
      <P>They are talking once again about what they will do for the unemployed, when they have done nothing under three programmes for Governments and national agreements.  It is unrealistic to expect them to do anything this time either but they portray an image of activity and action.  I feel sorry for those who did not sit on the last forum, who did not participate in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>, who are not members of the social partners but on this forum were duped into giving their imprimatur to a system of this sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will not create jobs although it will issue worthy reports.  This report's recommendations are unfortunately not new.  The main recommendation of this report is the establishment of an employment service unit, a super job agency, which in the words of the report will have to be well-resourced.  The forum is talking about subsidising jobs; this may be its mandate and one cannot blame it if that is the case, although it does not make any economic sense.  This <Col N="1331" /> is admitted elsewhere in the report where a subsidy is mentioned.</P>
    <P>If the forum's mandate is, as it says, to eliminate long term unemployment, it is certainly possible to do so by subsidising jobs by throwing taxpayers' money at them.  This is reverting to the old days when semi-State bodies were used simply as blotting paper to create jobs.  This is the easiest thing in the world to do but it does not create long term jobs; they are only created by producing more goods which the market wants to buy.  That is the only way to produce them, bar subsidising them.</P>
    <P>It is a great pity that this report has taken the subsidy route.  I cannot say I blame the forum because its terms of reference and objectives are singular &mdash; simply to create jobs, not to look at the macro-economic or other consequences.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that we have had so many academics, politicians, economists and other groups looking at unemployment when they do not take a realistic attitude to the unemployment problem. The realistic answer to this problem is that we can do something, certainly at a local level, about unemployment but we cannot simply solve the problem as is the impression given by some people.  It is not a problem that is soluble overnight. It is a problem that is fundamentally linked to the structure of our economy and to the problems in the world economy.  We are not going to solve it in Ireland by ourselves.</P>
    <P>What I object to in these reports and in the cosmetics surrounding these reports is the false hopes which they inject into the population and into the long term unemployed.  Politicians through the choreography and cosmetics of these reports, their launch and the surroundings in which they are made, give the deliberate impression of action in resolving a problem which they are not going to resolve and for which they are bankrupt of solutions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with growing boredom to Senator Ross's comments which were negative as usual: problems <Col N="1332" /> without solution, problems attaching to problems and blame everybody in sight &mdash; the scatter gun economist's approach to solving the problems of Irish life.  He knows that we agree to disagree on these matters.  He has reflected poorly on the work of the people on the forum who produced the document.</P>
      <P>What attracts me most to this document is the fact that it does not pretend to find solutions; it does not pretend to have all the answers.  It has the humility in the final pages to recognise, that for its proposals to be successful, it would require the support of certain groups which I will mention for Senator Ross' information &mdash; not that he would listen to anything that might spoil the nature of his arguments and the rant to which he subjected us for the last 15 minutes. The first group whose support is invited is the unemployed and it continues to the trade unions, the community and voluntary sector and employers.  That is a realistic approach to the problem.  The strategies of approach outlined earlier in the report deal with the macro-economic approach, the identification and intervention strategies in particular, preventing people in the labour market from becoming long term unemployed and getting the long term unemployed and similar groups back into employment. Any rational person can see that this is the approach required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people who drew up this report are to be complimented on taking a complex series of proposals and viewpoints which were represented and reflected by the membership of the forum and compiling a document that gives hope.  Hope is important.  If the problem is approached in that way we can look at the proposals in a balanced manner.  I regret the tirade to which the report has been subjected.  It is the essence of the lowest form of politics to simply take the scatter gun to everything in sight and to refuse to look at the good and bad and sift through them. There are aspects to the report with which I would take issue.  They are not major aspects.  There are aspects which <Col N="1333" /> I would like to develop, and that is a more progressive way of dealing with it.</P>
    <P>The report has made an invaluable contribution in its analysis of the people who are long term unemployed and tying that into the intervention strategies which will be required.  I wish to reflect on those strategies for a short period.  I am particularly interested in the education area because I wish to discuss the connection between education, the long term unemployed and the qualifications of the long term unemployed. However, before I do so I wish to make another point.</P>
    <P>The groups of people represented in drawing up this report, particularly the social partners, can be trusted to reflect positively on their own areas and can also be trusted to get it right.  I have been looking at the macro-economic factors and the main economic indicators in Irish life as they have changed since the beginning of the social partnership in 1987.  In 1987, if memory serves, we had a debt/GNP ratio of about 138 per cent, unemployment was soaring each quarter, the Exchequer borrowing requirement was in two figures for the first time in the history of the State and inflation and interest rates were at an extraordinarily high level. Since then, through the disciplined approach of the social partners in hammering out three agreements, we have turned those indicators right around to the point where this forum report can be applied to more fertile ground than was the case during the last ten years.</P>
    <P>With regard to the debt/GDP ratio, the objective of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> was to have it reduced below 90 per cent by the end of 1996.  In fact, the figure is already down to almost 85 per cent and is decreasing.  We could find that when it comes to meeting the conditions for convergence under the Maastricht Treaty it is not beyond the wildest expectations that Ireland might be the only State in the European Union which complies with all those conditions.  The Exchequer borrowing requirement is below 3 per cent, the debt/GDP ratio is <Col N="1334" /> approaching the 65 per cent required by Maastricht and control of inflation and interest rates is a good example for the rest of Europe.  However, that is outside the main issue we are discussing today.</P>
    <P>I complimented those responsible for drawing up the report on their analysis of the long term unemployed.  They make it clear that 48 per cent of the long term unemployed have no qualification beyond primary level, in other words, they do not have a junior certificate or intermediate certificate.  That figure has been fairly constant over a number of years.  Some time ago I saw the figure quoted as 50 per cent in the economic plan.  The figure of 48 per cent is probably the more precise.  What does that mean?  It means that half of the 290,000 unemployed have no qualification beyond primary education.  We must look at that for a number of reasons.  It means that these people have been failed by the primary sector and it gives me no joy to make that statement. However, those of us involved in the primary sector have failed them in some way although I am not saying it is the fault of the people working there.  I will return to this issue.</P>
    <P>In former times these were the people who found employment on assembly lines, in labouring or general operative jobs and in menial work that was freely available but that day is gone.  Those jobs are no longer available.  What happened last week in Packard was a type of miracle.  The Packard workers in effect are competing against the workers of Hungary and Portugal to get into the marketplace.  In both countries, and particularly in Portugal which is a member of the European Union, the workers in many cases are barely in the cash economy.  Portugal has tried to become competitive and to retain competitiveness by a continuous reduction in wages.  This attempt to compete with far eastern wage levels is not going to work.  It is an issue that is well reflected in this forum document.  It is not the way forward.</P>
    <P>There is also another reason.  The parents of Ireland today do not aspire to <Col N="1335" /> their children having jobs on assembly lines or to having general operative jobs.  They want what they call jobs of quality and status in society.  It is not therefore simply a kind of ochón ochón over the fact that all the jobs are going to the far east.  The reality is that many of the jobs going to the far east, and indeed perhaps eastern Europe, are jobs which the parents of Ireland do not want for their young children growing up as the new generation.  We must be aware of that, and it is therefore a question of re-gearing and moving forward.</P>
    <P>Let us say, for the sake of argument, that unemployment is 16 per cent, to take an even number.  This figure is made up of 8 per cent and 8 per cent, and one of these figures of 8 per cent comprises people with no qualification. I put it to the Minister that, no matter what work the forum does, no matter what levels of training we put in place and no matter what development we see in terms of economic growth, 8 per cent of people are virtually unemployable. Those are hard words to say, but that is the reality.  By contrast, the other 8 per cent, who are qualified to some extent, are people who can find employment, given the way employment is looking at present.</P>
    <P>What is the difficulty?  We must ensure that the problems experienced by the first 8 per cent are, to some extent, wiped out.  The only place that this can be done is at primary level.  The reality is that if the child fails at primary level, then he or she will not get any value out of post-primary and will never get into an apprenticeship, into third level or into university.  The clear line which has come through this document, and countless others, of education, qualification and employment is not something available to them.</P>
    <P>If one takes a child who has left primary level and does not have the basics of reading and writing, it is useless to consider putting that young person, at 16 or 17 years of age, into a grand training ambience and providing them with books and literature which they cannot <Col N="1336" /> cope with or read.  In other words, they may not even be trainable at that stage in the sense that they may not be able to get the value out of the most intense training procedures available.</P>
    <P>What is required, as the report says, is early intervention at an early level to ensure that the basics of reading and writing are available to all of our children, and that is where we must begin. In this respect I am pleased to see from recent documentation from the European Parliament that it has taken the same line.  Increasingly European consideration of long term unemployment is getting us back down to the fact that before people can be trained, they must be at a level of education where they can avail of the training.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that much of the money which has been directed at training at present is being misplaced, because we are trying to train people who do not have the basics of reading and writing.  The way to deal with that is by a remedial intervention at primary level and a programme to help those who have numeracy and literacy disfunctions. We also need to meet the needs of people who have problems with literacy and numeracy at an adult level.</P>
    <P>There is an even more worrying problem at primary level.  One of the things in the document &mdash; I stand to be corrected about this &mdash; which I would have liked to have seen more of is the distinction between creating employment and gaining employment.  All of our strategies should keep that in mind.</P>
    <P>The kind of person who has a post-primary degree in nuclear physics, or something like the fluidity of liquids or some narrow area of qualification is qualified in that area only and may not have the flexibility to move beyond that area when technology passes them out. Qualification of people to gain employment is a substantially different approach to the need to train, qualify and educate people for the creation of employment.</P>
    <P>With regard to the nature of the people who will create employment, or, <Col N="1337" /> in the words of Senator Ross, who will help to create wealth in the economy, if we take the education system as it exists at present, people do well academically at first level and by doing well academically at first level they get onto second level, and by doing well academically at second level they get the points for third level.  Such people have always been rewarded for being good academically. They get to third level and begin to concentrate even more on narrow areas of qualification.  They are finally qualified in a narrow area.  They are the best in the world for six months in that area and they know as much as anybody in the world.  What we do not know is if they have the flexibility, adaptability, openness, and professional self-confidence to deal with change in their area. Time and again we find people retreating into the security of the areas that they know best and refusing to open out into another area, or bring further people in with them.</P>
    <P>What does that mean?  Who are the people who will gain and create employment? This is probably the single most important analysis which we need to undertake.  There are going to be people who are leaders, who are articulate and creative, who motivate, calculated risk takers, team builders, team leaders and those who can work co-operatively within a team.  Those are the people who are going to create jobs rather than gain jobs.</P>
    <P>The simple fact of the matter is that those innovatory talents and aspects of personality cannot be turned on, like turning on a tap, in a person who has just qualified in a post graduate course at third level.  Consider the four year old child who will take a blank sheet of paper and cover it with colour and say &ldquo;That is my art for today&rdquo;, or the ten year old child who will stand in front of a class and say &ldquo;This is what I think about the green environment&rdquo;, or whatever it is, and put forward a point of view; or consider the child who will be part of the school chess team, or a member of the school debating team or involved in the school dramatics team, <Col N="1338" /> or the person who has learned on the sports field perhaps to take risks, make gains and go forward.  These are the people who have learned to develop those talents and they are the people who will be able to convince workers to follow them and to convince Governments and banks to have trust in their ideas.</P>
    <P>If those talents are not encouraged and developed from the age of four, they will never be developed.  Show me the 19 year old undergraduate at college who has never been part of the debating society, who has never found success other than in the academic field, who has the confidence to stand up and argue a point on an issue which is not directly in the area of their of own competence. There are very few.  The peer pressure brings uniformity rather than the old approach of developing differences in personalities.  This is so important as a way of introducing lateral thinking and development.</P>
    <P>Returning to education, the subject areas where we will develop those talents of articulation, of leadership, of risk taking and of creativity are the subjects like art, PE, drama and so on &mdash; the subjects that are on the edge of the curriculum, the peripheral areas of the curriculum. They are not the three Rs, and those in industry who consider close relationships with local schools in order to get the three Rs as being the basis and foundation of a developing economy are completely wrong.  It does not work.</P>
    <P>The people who are just qualified in narrow areas will be good at middle management.  They will be good at their job.  They might even be good at research and development.  That is a big &ldquo;might&rdquo;, because the innovation tap cannot be turned at age 20 or 21 if we have not given it encouragement and a sense of success at a much earlier age.</P>
    <P>In developing the ideas that have been so clearly and cogently put forward in the forum report, we need to take a special note of the kind of people who will be at the client end of what we <Col N="1339" /> are trying to deliver.  We therefore need to have first, people who have the three Rs, who have the basics of numeracy and literacy so that they can develop in whatever area they go to, and develop onwards.  Secondly, we need to have people who are fully and absolutely qualified.  Thirdly, we have to recognise that the qualities, including aspects of character, of people who will create employment, who will grow the economy, who will bring us forward and lead a new generation in every aspect of our lives, whether it be politics, social life or industry, will be developed in the peripheral areas of the school curricula. These are the areas in which we also need to invest.  An investment in education, parallel with training initiatives and initiatives in industry, is vital for dealing with the long term unemployed.</P>

      <P>A Chathaoirligh, in welcoming the Minister to the House I too appreciate the effort that has gone into the work of the National Economic and Social Forum.  As stated by the previous speakers, long term unemployment is the greatest curse that the country has at present.  I am pleased that another initiative has been put forward by the forum to try to change that situation. The report states that two thirds of the long term unemployed are probably heads of households.  One can realise the trauma and disappointment in such households and in the youth of such households in that they do not see what employment can do and what the benefits of employment can be for their family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In looking at the forum and the detailed recommendations, the central core seems to be the proposed employment service.  It states that each mentor will have 125 clients, if that is to be the word.  Early work in this regard is a must.  While the setting up of such a structure will take a long time, an effort should be made by the relevant Department to ensure that long term unemployed people have their criteria and their <i>curricula vitae</i> put in place.  We <Col N="1340" /> must go down that road to ensure that those people are given every chance at the earliest opportunity.  If, as is suggested in the recommendations, the mentor and the client must meet on a one-to-one basis, one can see from the number of people unemployed and the size of the long term unemployment list the length of time that is going to take, so I ask the Minister in her wisdom to ensure that the <i>curricula vitae</i> of all long term unemployed people are put together in the short term.  A parallel system implementing this scheme would mean that the unemployed could be helped in the shortest possible time.</P>
    <P>We must also have linkage between all Government Departments to ensure that we make progress.  We must have linkage between the career guidance teachers of the local schools where some of these long term unemployed people still have records.  We must not have a fragmented effort in this regard because if it is seen that even within one local exchange one mentor is working very well and her fellow mentors are not putting in the same amount of work, this will ensure that the scheme is not successful. We must ensure that there is coordination between the mentors so that where relevant jobs come on line, if a mentor does not have the person to fill that employment, the job is passed on to a fellow mentor or put back into the system in the shortest possible time.</P>
    <P>There are many areas where relevant employment seems to be a basic need. There is a need for development in areas such as lone parents, long term illnesses and home helps.  Each of us as public representatives has a number of areas within the constituency which need immediate development.  I have no doubt that the work of the National Economic and Social Forum will come to fruition but we must ensure that they are given every chance.  We must ensure that the Minister for Finance makes finance available to continue this proposal. The forum must be kept in its present form to encourage debate and to continue its efforts to ensure future employdenc <Col N="1341" /> ment, not alone for the long term but for the short term unemployed as well.</P>
    <P>In wishing the forum well I hope that ideas are brought forward by the different and relevant groups.  Many efforts are being made in the resource centres to ensure that employment is given. Many other such organisations must be given every chance to make submissions to the forum and ensure that continued progress is made.  Together with everyone else associated with the political and national scene, I hope that because of the work of the forum a major effort will be made and that the results will ensure that the two thirds of the long term unemployed who are heads of households will have employment. Again I wish the forum well, I thank them for their work so far and I hope that progress is made in the short term.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not concur with Senator Ross in his criticism of the individuals who worked long and hard to prepare this report.  There are respected public representatives on this hard working forum, as well as captains of industry and captains in all walks of life. I know one of the members of the forum, Mr. Phil Flynn, personally.  He is very highly respected throughout the community by employers, the trades unions, people who come from the farming community and those in any other walk of life who make a contribution to this economy.</P>
      <P>Unemployment is a very difficult subject. It has been the most difficult task to face all Governments over the last number of years.  If this problem were as simple as some people maintain it is, it would have been solved long ago and I sympathise with the Minister and the Ministers of State who have been charged with this responsibility.  As someone who employs people in considerable numbers, I must say that there should be a sub-committee of this forum appointed to represent the job creators. The job creators are the people who have the knack, skills, determination and the experience of creating employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1342" /> As an employer, I say to the Minister of State here this evening that I wish her well in her new portfolio.  I have had great respect for her for a long time, as have her constituents who gave her a massive endorsement in the last general election.  It must be a great source of confidence to her, helping her to carry on her duties and to go forward with confidence, because when a person has confidence they can move mountains.  It is the very same with this forum report. If these people are confident in the proposals they are putting forward and enhance them by adding, I suggest, this new job creators section for the people who have been giving employment, we can look forward to progress being made on the unemployment list.</P>
    <P>The biggest problem at present is twofold in relation to people, especially young people, who need training.  At present there is a tremendous pick-up in the construction industry.  It is absolutely starved for young carpenters, young plasterers, and young electricians because practically no training has been given in these industries for the past four or five years.  Urban renewal schemes in many areas, particularly Dublin, ended on 31 December last. With the pick-up in property purchases and the purchasing of new apartments in urban renewal areas, there was great demand for builders, plasterers and block-layers, in particular, who could not be found.  Those who carried on these trades retired happily after making a meaningful contribution, but there was no one in training coming after them.  The root cause was that there was no incentive for an employer to take on a young boy or girl and to pay them £80, £100 or more per week to start and also paying 12 per cent employer's levy.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State needs to take on this task of giving those creating employment, like Senator Cregan and me, the incentive to train people in the skills that are needed immediately. These skills will not be needed in three or four years, they are needed immediately. I would hazard a guess that 10,000 young people would be employed <Col N="1343" /> within the next 30 days if there was a scheme in the forthcoming budget for the construction industry to cater for those people.</P>
    <P>There has been great interest in this island since the peace initiative.  We are now a friendly destination.  Last weekend a major sporting attraction in which the nation was represented took place in the capital.  People from the UK came to Ireland without match tickets &mdash; about 20,000.  It was like the week before Christmas for the taxi drivers in Dublin.  One could not get bed and breakfast in this city last weekend. People had to travel as far as Kildare, to Naas, Newbridge and to the Rossnaree Hotel in County Louth; people travelled 40, 50 and 60 miles for accommodation.</P>
    <P>This is a great opportunity for those in the tourism industry to create new jobs by training people.  I suggest that 5,000 new jobs could be created by April if those in the tourism industry, in hotels and amusement places, did not have to pay this 12 per cent levy.  This 12 per cent levy is the difference between expanding a business and making a little profit.  People worked in the tourism industry for the past five years to get a net 2 per cent profit.  Things are going well, but times have been difficult.  This influx of tourists has been a great boost and the State will benefit enormously because they will go out to drink, to the theatre and to the shops.  For example, Icelandic people visit this country regularly.</P>
    <P>We all know about the massive sums of money which have come from the venture between Aer Lingus and TEAM Aer Lingus in servicing aircraft at Dublin Airport.  Millions of pounds have been spent because TEAM Aer Lingus won the concession to service these aircraft.</P>
    <P>We have well prepared, motivated and energetic young industrialists.  I have confidence in the future of industry. Between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs could be created in new industries if these people did not have to pay this 12 per cent levy if they provided training.  I <Col N="1344" /> meet trade union officials and captains of industry when I attend conferences and I count myself a personal friend of many of them.  I will put my business credibility on the line in this Chamber when I say that one simple move could create 40,000 to 50,000 new jobs immediately.</P>
    <P>As regards the Packard Electric industrial dispute, it frightened a lot of people in the trade union movement, in Government and in employment into saying that there was no incentive there for workers who would face long term unemployment.  There should be a major gap between the income of those employed and those unemployed.  The unemployed are on the breadline until they gain employment.  The system needs to be restructured.  A married man with two children should earn at least £10,000 per annum &mdash; £200 a week &mdash; before coming into the tax net.  That is the basic amount if one is not to be on the poverty line especially when we take into consideration the fact that a person may need a car to go to his place of employment.  If an unemployed person gets £140 per week and £70 for a day's work, or if his wife works for a night, that individual does not contribute, the State loses £140 per week and there is no return.  We must encourage people to seek employment and to be happy in their employment.  Peace of mind means a lot to everyone &mdash; politicians, civil servants, people in the Press Gallery, etc.  It would make a difference to one's peace of mind if one knew one could take home £60 to £75 per week extra because one is working.  It is dreadful to meet someone who asks what have you taken home this week? The employed person will say they have taken home £180 out of a gross amount of £260; the unemployed person will say they have received almost that amount without working.  That is a disincentive. The most important advice for young people is idle minds go to idle work, idle hands go to bad work.  That is what happens in an area with high unemployment. The temptation of drugs and falling into bad company is bad for the <Col N="1345" /> individual, bad for society and bad for the State.</P>
    <P>No Government in the past 27 to 30 years, had such an opportunity to address the unemployment situation meaningfully.  The Government will have the full support of all political parties and 90 per cent of the electorate. Such a move will be politically popular and good for the economy.  The system is wrong, not the people.  I do not blame any Government for what happened because they have all done their best.</P>
    <P>I was in America last week, but our enthusiasm for the future was not obvious in the United States, which is supposed to be the number one country in the world.  That country is not experiencing the growth which we have enjoyed for the past few years and which, I hope, will continue for the next three to four years.  I have not observed this enthusiasm or growth in the United Kingdom, to which I travel every two weeks.  We are now a peaceful and friendly country and we should exploit the opportunities which are available to us.  We are one of the few countries in Europe whose nearest neighbour is not their biggest tourism contributor. However, I think that is going to change this year and over the next few years.</P>
    <P>The Government is enjoying the best balance of payments since the days of Ritchie Ryan and the late George Colley. It has an opportunity to get people back to work, to reduce the numbers on the unemployment register and to inject more money into the economy by ensuring that people get paid for working. The vast majority of people would much prefer to work.  If the Government provides employers with incentives, it will reap the rewards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and wish her well in her new Department.  She has a strong realisation of what is happening with regards to work and she is committed to seeing that we have an opportunity to create more jobs in the long term, irrespective of the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1346" /> I listened to other speakers and Senator Cassidy made very valuable points about the way we are going about creating jobs.  I wish to elaborate on that.  Over the years, far too much emphasis was put on a particular type of job &mdash; high technology jobs for high technology people.  I am not involved in high technology employment, quite the opposite, but I worry when I see technology eliminating jobs.  For example, in my city certain insurance institutions have gone from being very big employers to very small employers. Centralisation of their equipment through high technology has meant that fewer people are working.  This matter is dealt with lightly in the forum's report.</P>
    <P>I welcome this forum but we should not always just talk about unemployment, I would like to talk about creating employment.  I always say &mdash; and I make no apologies for this &mdash; that I would gut you for one job; that is how far I would go.  It is very important to create even one job especially for the person who gets it, particularly a young person who is interested in just working and is not particular about which area.  For far too long, many people did not get such an opportunity; they just want to work.  I feel very sad for them.</P>
    <P>We always try to create employment. I have listened to Members on all sides over the years talking about the cost of employment.  Senator Cassidy is wrong &mdash; a person taking home an average of £180 a week has to be earning more than £260 a week because of the 48 per cent tax rate.  It has been said that this budget should ensure that the worker goes home with more money.  Of course, workers should go home with more, they are the backbone of our society.  It is imperative that we recognise that workers, the PAYE sector in particular, should have more take home pay.</P>
    <P>It is a sad reflection on us that the Department of Social Welfare is paying out £4 billion a year, £11 million a day. That is hard to believe; not more than five years ago it was £7 million a day and it has now increased by £4 million a day.  I never thought I would see that <Col N="1347" /> happen.  I see people driving taxis who were once managers.  They make no apologies for that &mdash; they are working and they were prepared to do anything. I had to make representations today for a person who was doing very well in business five months ago but is now looking for the dole.  I never thought I would see that.</P>
    <P>These matters have to be raised.  I am asking the Minister if we are really sincere about this.  The forum says we are and that the Minister is very committed. Some people are committed but I would not say they are very committed.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Senator Cassidy. We have seen opportunities in other countries but they were not novel ideas. I see jobs created in other countries which we could do here but we are not doing them.  When I ask why I am told it is because of the cost.  It costs a great deal to employ a man who is going home even with only £140, which is the minimum.  However, the most important thing is that that man is going home with money and is going to work on a Monday morning.</P>
    <P>I know there are supplementary grants and benefits.  We think that everything possible has been done to create more jobs but that is not so. Employers do not have the motivation to employ more people.  A company in Cork which once had 77 workers now has five; it is still there and is making a great deal of money.  Another company which employed 127 now employs 42; it is still there and it too is making money. What is happening here?  Are the opportunities there for these people to refuse to take on a worker but to make more money?  Where are we going?  Are we taking money from them in the wrong way?  Are they able to take money from us and make more profits without giving anything to us as a people?  I do not like that.</P>
    <P>I look at the ordinary employer who employs five people and says that he would love to employ another but it would cost him a further £40 or £60 a week which he cannot afford.  Then we <Col N="1348" /> have the person who is tormented by the idea that he has to pay such amounts of PRSI and PAYE that it does not pay him to employ somebody.  The Minister's speech and the forum report spoke about that, but we are not doing enough about it.</P>
    <P>The budget cannot sort it out in one fell swoop, and I understand that. However, we can say we are prepared to look at this in the long term.  We can tell employers that PRSI, which is about 19.2 per cent plus the 1 per cent levy, will be reduced over a three year period or we can tell them that over a five year period they will be paying 5 per cent less.  Why are we not even prepared to say that in the long term?</P>
    <P>I do not understand why any Government &mdash; and I am prepared to knock any Government, whether we are in Government or not, and I have done it &mdash; does not exploit the opportunities in the services area.  Senator Cassidy was right when he spoke about tourism.  Last Saturday was the proof of that.  People came from Britain without tickets for the match because they wanted to come to Ireland.  They did not come two years ago, but they have been coming over the last six months because of what has happened in the North.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, we in central Government and in these Houses seem to think that we know it all but we do not.  We should listen more to the people who know.  I am in what might be regarded as the lowest category of employer.  I am in the hot food business.  I am very proud of that and I do very well.  I employ many people and I would like to employ more.  However, it does not pay and there is no incentive to do so. This does not just apply to me because I do not need any more employees.  Many people say they do not require any more employees but we would like to take on two more and perhaps extend. However, to do so, there are many questions. There should be less Government intervention and that is what is being asked for in the USA.</P>
    <P>There are too many Government structures in regard to employment.  The <Col N="1349" /> Minister mentioned breaking it down to try to make it easier.  I ask her to urgently examine this and to break it down so that there is less Government intervention.  It does not help people on the outside who wish to be left alone. People must pay their taxes and everybody should be above board.  In the long term it pays to be above board and we should guard against creating a situation where the black economy helps such people.  I understand this point because I have spent much time examining it. There are still opportunities for people to say they will do it on the black economy. Many questions are asked of people who are legitimate and it does not help them.  They go grey and get old early.  They get nervous and lose their motivation.  I have seen this happen. They lose their incentive, although they have ideas.  I refer to the service area in particular.</P>
    <P>The position on the east coast of America is little different to that in Ireland.  The climate and opportunities are similar but everything there is relevant to a job.  This is not the case in Ireland.  I recall speaking to a person there who was a typical American and made a big deal of his job.  I will not say what he did, but if he was doing it here people would laugh.  They did not laugh at him there, and that is the point.  He was a specialist in his field, although I will not say what it was because it might not go down too well.  Opportunities are not given to people in Ireland.  This was demonstrated last weekend, although I do not want to put it all down to last weekend.  I do not see enough opportunities. I do not see Government leaving people alone if they are going about creating jobs, which is a first priority and must be so.</P>
    <P>I note spending in Government Departments and semi-State bodies.  I note the number of people in training and those on local employment schemes.  I motivated this idea in 1985 and pushed for social employment schemes for the long term unemployed when we were in Government.  I got it through, thanks to former Deputies <Col N="1350" /> Gemma Hussey and Barry Desmond. Unfortunately, there is now an impression that money should be divided and schemes created.  There is a massive number of schemes across the country and people are not on the unemployment register, although they are working for only the minimum amount.  I disagree with this situation.  I urge the Minister to revise the number of people on FÁS schemes.  Money spent in these areas is not being spent correctly.  The Minister knows it is the case that FÁS areas are not working out.  It may sound well in theory but it is not working in practice.</P>
    <P>I have a son 16 years old, the youngest of my seven children.  He is now in his last two years of school but is too young to complete his final examinations. A transition year has been established and he is out looking for work in local areas.  I made a telephone call and got him a job in a company for a couple of weeks as work experience.  Other boys in his class are also doing it with him.  Two of the four boys we got fixed up came back and said that those two weeks were worth more to them than an entire year in school.  I understand their point because I left school very early, probably too early.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole made a number of important points as regards education, particularly at primary level.  It is most important that we get the basics right at primary level for young people.  Subsequently, we should ask them what they want to do and consider whether they should be sitting at a desk or working with their hands.  Some people learn later than others.  I ask the Minister to examine this area.  We should not always give the impression that we can tell everybody what to do.  Many young people know what they want to do and all young people are very good at something. Irrespective of the child, they are excellent at something.  I have great faith in young people and in the educational system.  We are very lucky in comparison to other nations.  For example, Britain does not stand near us <Col N="1351" /> in terms of our education system and our young people.</P>
    <P>I get very sad when I think of our young people abroad.  I hate to think of them there and that we do not make more use of them here.  Unfortunately, in comparison to Ireland, the opportunities they have abroad are better. Unfortunately, the institutions in Ireland, in which we put so much faith, are not prepared to provide them with those opportunities.  They are prepared to make profits, rather than employ more.  I could name those institutions.</P>

      <P>I have a final few points. We could debate and discuss the way things could be done &mdash; and I will push it at my parliamentary party &mdash; but we must ensure that the Government gives priority to ensuring that more people are working.  It is a serious situation, particularly for young people.  There are families where fathers of 40 years old and boys up to 20 years old have never worked.  This is a fact.  There are fathers and children in the same family who have never worked and I do not like this situation.</P>

      <P>The Minister is in good humour this evening.  I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate and I welcome the Minister to the House.  This is a good subject to discuss and any member of a local authority who is in touch with the grassroots could speak for a full day on this topic. However, one does not have much confidence that one will achieve anything in one's contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has been involved with rural development and examining the regions for a number of years.  She knows the position and will not say anything that differs much from the figures which assess the difficulties.  I come from a rural area and I ask the Minister to make a stand.  She should stop setting <Col N="1352" /> up agencies and structures which there is no hope of financing.  It is a sheer waste of time.  No one should expect that the average man in the country, watching his television, will be enthusiastic about the establishment of a new agency.  His first question will be: &ldquo;What funding is available?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am member of the Donegal County Enterprise Partnership Board, about which even I was enthusiastic.  I have a report from its meeting last Monday which shows that seven projects were approved and 28 were turned down by an evaluation team appointed by the Minister of State's honourable Minister. We are told there will be very little funding available.  That county enterprise board was set up in a blaze of publicity but we are going nowhere with only £0.5 million for County Donegal, which has nearly 40 per cent unemployment. The average person is asking why so little when £4 million was given to the paper mills in Dublin a couple of years ago and millions were given to Irish Steel, TEAM Aer Lingus and Aer Lingus.  We bail out another one every year to any amount, £100 million perhaps. But here a a county enterprise board is launched and expected to deliver jobs.  There is a meeting between the various agencies and the county manager once a month and seven projects are approved and 28 are not deemed eligible.  The average person listening to the announcements of different agencies no longer takes much of it seriously.  He concludes that it is only politics and will deliver nothing.</P>
    <P>I am not a Minister and I am not going to be one, but most of those who are Ministers and who have responsibility are good people.  However, they come to accept that there is a certain pace for performance and they too become complacent.  The whole process becomes stuck.  We need a Minister who will tackle the problem of unemployment. I suggest that local authorities be given funding.  Van loads of money with armed guards are being sent around the country to pay benefits.  It is soul destroying and puts people in the position <Col N="1353" /> of never working.  Those who are working and paying 48 per cent tax watch this and those who are embarrassed to line up at the dole office one day are not embarrassed the next day. They are forced to join the dole queue.</P>
    <P>I would like to see a Minister with enough courage to say that there is a problem and that it is intended to solve it.  I propose that local authorities be funded and all the agencies be cut out &mdash; I refer to LEADER, which gets Interreg funding, the Interreg funding itself for the Border regions and the International Fund for Ireland, which has large amounts of funding.  The funding is not directed at the source and there is no better agency than the local authority, which is subject to local government audit.  The local authority is being starved of funding when it could provide jobs.</P>
    <P>In County Donegal we cannot take on people to cut the hedges in what is a tourist county, or to clean up footpaths or housing estates.  We have reached the stage &mdash; and it is the same for the whole of the west &mdash; where there is no funding to do necessary jobs; yet we see money being pumped down the drain.  I am not a union basher, but we see the arrogance of some of the unions having two or three votes to try to squeeze out another concession.  If we are serious about jobs then the best way jobs can be provided is through the local authorities. If one contacted any county manager and asked him what jobs he could provide if he were given £1 million or £5 million, he would be able to provide more jobs with that money than any agency.  The money would not be squandered; it would not go on consultants or reports; it would go to the source and take people off the dole and put them to work for local authorities.</P>
    <P>The social employment scheme is an utter waste of time.  It is soul destroying to put somebody on it for a week and then tell them they cannot be on the scheme the next week.  Is there anybody who realises what the problem is all about?  Is anyone in control at all?  One does not need to be a professor to see <Col N="1354" /> that the money could be well spent and could give a good return, and one could check on a daily basis where it is going.</P>
    <P>Because of lack of funding we have reached the stage in Donegal where we are importing £0.5 million worth of water from the North.  We have not got money to develop major lakes and water sources.  We are importing road materials &mdash; tarmac and what is called &ldquo;wet mix&rdquo; for levelling the roads.  We have about 20 factories closed down, such as Irish Picture Mouldings in Donegal town and GT Carpets in Killybegs. Apart from Gallaghers of Ardara, we are not baking a loaf of bread &mdash; we are importing it.  Pat the Baker is bringing it in by the lorry load.  As with many other counties we are not getting support for the structures that are in place. It is time for a Minister to take the problem of unemployment by the scruff of the neck.  I hope the Minister of State will do it.  I hope she will not run with the system and say that she had made strong recommendations and then blame somebody else for not accepting them.</P>

      <P>A lot of water has gone under the bridge since this debate started on 20 October 1994.  It has been an excellent debate and it has been primarily around the National Economic and Social Forum's report No. 4 on ending long term unemployment.  As Senator McGowan's contribution would show, it has ranged a lot wider than that report.  One thing that is central to the forum's report on long term unemployment <Col N="1355" /> is that it shows how it differs from short term unemployment.  It demonstrates clearly that a rising economic tide does not lift all boats and that we need to do something special if we are to bring people back in from the margins, people who are long term unemployed or those at risk of dropping over the edge from being short term to becoming long term unemployed with only a 20 per cent chance of ever getting a job.  We also need to engage in special action to intervene for those who are at high risk of becoming the long term unemployed of tomorrow, especially those about whom Senator O'Toole spoke, the early school leavers, the people who get little out of their primary education and as a result, drop out of the education system altogether or simply mark time.</P>
      <P>Looking at the points made in the forum report puts a new concentration on looking at the totality of the problem and looking at the small scale on which we have been able to date to address the problem of long term unemployment. We have agencies which provide social employment services and offer training, but they have not reached the hard core of the problem.  One of the reasons why they have not done this &mdash; and this was touched on by Senator Ormonde &mdash; is that they may not reach the unemployed. What the forum's report is talking about is a response to long term unemployment that starts with the needs, abilities and wishes of the long term unemployed themselves, rather than the need of the agencies.  It is not about turf wars or agencies falling over each other but about starting where the long term unemployed people are, evaluating what they need to provide a bridge back to the world of work and then building that bridge and putting the resources into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now have a unique opportunity to do this because we are in a period of economic boom.  We can either see the fruits of that boom go into areas like higher prices and see money go to those who are already comfortably off or we <Col N="1356" /> can use it to tackle this problem once and for all.  We have a once-off chance to do it now that our economy is going so well.  It is important and is a central part of the programme of the incoming Government, as indeed it was a central part of the programme of the outgoing Government, to put long term unemployment on centre stage.</P>
    <P>The report of the forum has not gathered dust.  A high level task force has been set up, as recommended by the forum itself, to turn the aspirations and ideas of the forum into practical action. That task force has just about finished its job.  It will be reporting to Government over the next few weeks and action will then be seen.</P>
    <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn wanted to know who was on the task force.  It was chaired by the Assistant Secretary in my office, Julie O'Neill, representing also the Departments of the Taoiseach, Enterprise and Employment, Social Welfare, Finance, Education, the Environment, FÁS, ADM and various people involved in community action to provide jobs, such as those from the Ballymun Job Centre, Tallaght Partnership and so on.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry wanted to know whether the operational programme on human resources will provide provision for child care in training centres.  One of the issues very much highlighted in the forum's report was the need to involve women in the fight against long term unemployment.  That operational programme provides money for child care, including the ringfencing of funds amounting to £7.7 million for employment and training courses for women returning to work, training for non-traditional work, management training, training of child care workers and managers, guidance and information initiatives ives for women and child care initiatives to be undertaken by FÁS and the Department of Education.  We see very much the involvement of women. Again, the new Government programme commits us to involving either partner in the household, irrespective of who is signing on, to be allowed to take <Col N="1357" /> part in community employment programmes.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly put great emphasis on the whole issue of guidance and counselling. Indeed, this was also raised by Senator Ormonde and other Senators. It is important, in looking at the status of the long term unemployed, to offer them whatever guidance or counselling that can be available to direct them to appropriate areas that are suitable for their skills, offer them a programme of compensating education opportunities, training, work experience, job placements, work opportunities or to do whatever is needed to bring a person who has lost hope in themselves, who may have left school early and does not have a good level of education or has obsolete skills, to a point where they are readily able to take part in the world of work and where employers are ready to take them on.</P>
    <P>There is another job to be done by a local employment service, which is to ask employers to look at the long term unemployed when they are recruiting. At the moment, we have evidence, in terms of the vacancies that come up on the job market, that about 30,000 jobs change hands every month.  Few of the vacancies which are capable of being filled by long term unemployed are, in fact, offered to them.  That is partly because the long term unemployed have given up hope or maybe need that little extra to help them compete on a level playing field for those jobs.  We also need to ask employers to play their part in recruiting from the long term unemployed register to ensure that people are given a chance to cross that bridge back into the world of work.</P>
    <P>Some good initiatives have been undertaken, such as the Contact Point Initiative in Coolock and the Ballymun Jobs Centre, where we have successfully been able to persuade local employers, through their involvement with local community groups, local representatives, statutory agencies and local trade unions in a local partnership to take on people who are employment ready from the long term unemployed pool and <Col N="1358" /> offer them work.  That has been successfully piloted in a number of areas.  We would like to see that kind of action taken nationwide.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle and Senator Roche both made comments on the redundancy payments area.  Are we selling jobs too cheaply?  Are we encouraging people to abandon jobs that will never be replaced?  That issue comes under my new area of responsibility in the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  I have asked the Department to study it to see how we can balance the rights of workers who lose their jobs to adequate compensation while ensuring that we are not selling jobs to cheaply in our society.</P>
    <P>Senator Lee asked if the CMRS pilot job opportunities programme was succeeding. It has recently met its target of 1,000 job places.  I gather it took some time to get it up and running, but it appears to be a successful initiative. This is being examined by the task force and is due for evaluation during this year as the initiative gets up and running.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole said that people who have left school early with no qualifications should now be regarded as virtually unemployable.  I do not agree with that and I do not think the forum agrees either.  We do not write off anybody who has lost their job.  We want to ensure that people who left school early or who currently have no skills that, if an employer wants, can compensate for the education they did not get at an earlier stage and be given a second chance and brought back into the system. Senator O'Toole had important points to make about the areas of innovation and innovationary work and how we produce the entrepreneurs of the future.  This is done not only by a narrow view of education but by fostering subjects like art and drama.  It is important to have people who are prepared to take risks.</P>
    <P>I profoundly disagreed with Senator Ross' contribution, but in a democratic assembly like this, it is his privilege to hold those views and it is important that <Col N="1359" /> he would put them.  Senator Ross was trying to shoot the messenger and demolish the idea of a forum rather than critically examine the ideas the forum had put on the table.  It is important to bring in the democratic politicians and involve them with the social partners and people who have been outside the traditional consultation process in the debate on unemployment.  I do not believe that by bringing people together, the ideas are <i>de facto</i> worthless and will not be implemented.  It is important to involve, consult and bring people in from the margins, to listen to what they have to say and to bring those ideas to the heart and the mainstream of Government thinking and to implement them.  I profoundly disagree with Senator Ross' views on the forum.</P>
    <P>The local employment service which the forum recommends is an important part of the solution but it is not the end. It is not enough to offer somebody counselling, training, education and work placement if, at the end of the day, there are not enough jobs to go round. Of course we have to move towards ensuring that this economy can produce as many jobs as possible for its level of economic activity and try to ensure it can increase the level of economic activity so that we can hope to provide work for all of our people.  Of course we have to do that but we also have to look &mdash; this is a point stressed in many different ways by people talking about local authority employment and social employment &mdash; at the scandal of people being offered incomes but not work at a time when there is so much work to be done in our society.</P>
    <P>Great changes have been made in the area of community employment.  The Government's programme promises that new and innovative approaches to matching the needs of people looking for work and undone work in our society will be explored, evaluated and taken a stage further.  We need to constantly evaluate, change and move on rather than fossilise.  Senator Lee made <Col N="1360" /> good points about not engaging in turf wars and not allowing the institutions to dominate our responses, which must always be geared to what we do for the long term unemployed themselves.</P>
    <P>The forum report also puts a great deal of emphasis on education.  It does not go into this in detail in terms of recommendations but it is absolutely critical.  The report last week from the ESRI showed that youngsters who leave school with no qualifications are five times more likely to be unemployed than those who leave school with leaving certificates.  The earlier we intervene in the education system the better &mdash; I agree heartily with what Senator O'Toole had to say on this.  We must ensure that we do not continue to create new generations of long term unemployed.</P>
    <P>The forum's report has been very important and exciting.  It is not gathering dust on Government shelves but has been actively worked on with a view to implementation.  Initially, it is unlikely to be implemented fully nationwide but its ideas will be refined and put in place so that we build up to what the forum wanted, which is a nationwide network of local employment centres providing real opportunities to break the cycle of long term unemployment and ensure that the rising tide will begin once more to lift the boats.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann, recognising the growth of drug abuse in society, calls on the Government to outline its strategy and policies to combat this growing problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1361" /> I welcome the Minister.  I have been reading some literature on this matter over the last few days.  When I think of the problem of drug abuse my automatic reaction, which is probably that of a large number of people, is that all drug abusers, and certainly drug pushers, should be locked up and the key thrown away.  To our cost we have to realise that there is no simple solution to the huge problems caused by the massive growth in drug abuse.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment specifically on the increase in drug abuse in Dublin. In the past probably the worst effect of disadvantage and deprivation was that a section of society felt itself isolated. Unfortunately, nowadays the effects are far more serious.  The worst effect can be death for people in that section of society.  Current estimates of the number of injecting drug users in the greater Dublin area put the figure as high as 7,000.  I have looked at other reports which dated from a few years ago, when the figure was about 2,000 to 4,000.  It has escalated very quickly and appears to be out of control.  The figure of 7,000, as the Acting Chairman would know, is enough to populate many an Irish town. Further estimates show that anything from 11 to 36 per cent of drug users carry the HIV virus.  If those statistics are correct, we can expect anything from 800 to 2,500 people in this group to die from AIDS in the coming years. Taking the most gloomy estimate, the current level of drug addiction in Dublin alone, where the heroin injection problem is largely concentrated, will probably kill roughly as many people as those killed in the conflict in Northern Ireland in the last 25 years.  Those figures point to the fact that we have a real crisis on our hands, which cannot be addressed in isolation by the Department of Justice, the Department of Health or the Department of Education. It needs the combined approach of all three Departments.  In the last 12 months I have been calling for such a debate, even from the Government side of the House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1362" /> One of the differences between the wave of addiction which affected many poor areas of Dublin city in the 1970s and the early 1980s and the current wave is that a lower age group is now experimenting with drugs.  A recent report showed that over 56 per cent of those who first used primary drugs were aged between 15 and 19 years.  Of that group a high proportion were using hallucinogens, such as ecstasy and, to a lesser extent, LSD.  The popularity of ecstasy, which is used extensively at discos and parties, certainly in Dublin and larger cities, combined with the fall in the price of heroin, has made the problem far worse.  Garda sources state that the price of heroin in the streets has halved in the past 15 years.  The effect of disadvantage and deprivation is now very serious and can mean death.</P>
    <P>A report entitled <i>Treated Drug Misusers in the Greater Dublin Area</i>, by Kathleen O'Higgins and Mary O'Brien, during the period 1992-3 shows there is a strong link between low social and economic status and rates of drug misuse. It further shows that eight out of ten clients were unemployed and over one third had left school before the official leaving age of 15 years.  It further highlights that treated clients who were living in deprived city areas rose from 28 per cent in 1992 to 31 per cent in 1993.  Around one third of those people came from the north inner city areas.</P>
    <P>Fr. Peter McVerry, when he recently called for improvements in the facilities available for treatment of drugs, speculated that 80 per cent of street crime in the Dublin area is drug related.  Even those of us who are lucky enough not to have been affected by drug abuse will probably experience the effects of it in other situations and circumstances.  The bulk of public meetings I attend and the representations I receive from constituents are related to the huge increase in crime and what seems to be the easy availability of drugs on the streets.  This would also be true of my colleagues in the Chamber and the Minister.  The increase in break-ins and the apparent inability of the Garda to cope <Col N="1363" /> adequately and give adequate levels of protection to the community are issues which are raised on a daily basis with all politicians.</P>
    <P>The position of the Garda trying to cope with the growth in crime and the increased drug abuse in society has been compared by somebody, who painted what I thought was a very vivid picture to me, to putting a stopper in a sink, turning on both taps, handing a garda a teaspoon and telling him to cope with the problem before the sink floods.  The Minister would have to agree that there is absolutely no way that an under-resourced Garda Síochána or health service could possibly deal with the problem. Unless we have an adequate number of Gardaí working in communities in this city and an adequate number of treatment centres for those presenting themselves for treatment programmes, there is no way we will get to grips with the problem.</P>
    <P>The powers of the Garda to make arrests are seriously hampered by the fact that unless they can prove a person was selling or receiving drugs they have little or no chance of gaining a conviction in court.  This is despite the fact that Garda units have undertaken surveillance work for months on end and have photographic proof, yet at the time of a raid the drugs were either thrown into a fire, conveniently kept lighting throughout the year, or were swallowed by the person about to be apprehended.  It appears that the laws currently in place do not assist the Garda in their efforts to apprehend drug pushers.  Special drug units are needed in every Garda station in urban areas.  From meetings that I have had with the local superintendent in my area, I know that not all gardaí are trained to deal with this problem.  It has been proven that the chances of success are much higher where there are specialised units.</P>
    <P>Another problem which needs to be tackled urgently is the inadequate number of detoxification and treatment centres for those who are trying to deal with their problem.  This is where the <Col N="1364" /> Department of Health's involvement comes in.  Resources need to be reallocated to help addicts.  <i>The Irish Times</i> recently reported that drug addicts seeking detoxification have to wait four to six weeks for treatment in Dublin, and may have to wait three months for admission to the drugs treatment unit at Beaumont Hospital.</P>
    <P>Statistically, it is possible &mdash; although I do not know how this is calculated &mdash; that the number of crimes an addict has to commit to feed his or her habit while awaiting treatment could be as high as 200.  This delay in receiving treatment tests the level of commitment of a person trying to give up drugs.  The drugs treatment services themselves admit that the present delays are grossly excessive and unnecessary.</P>
    <P>The effects of drug abuse are huge among the children of addicts.  As many as one in eight children of drug-addicted women in Dublin may have lost a mother to AIDS or another drug-related condition.  Unfortunately, drug-abusing mothers are usually in a relationship with an abusing male.  Children also suffer disruption because their mothers are in hospital, prison or a residential drug treatment facility.  Addicted mothers feel extremely isolated if they are HIV positive, because it has been shown that they fear being seen as unfit parents and are reluctant to seek help from official or voluntary bodies.</P>
    <P>Of the 186 drug-using women who attended the Anna Livia project in Dublin in 1992, 142 were mothers and between them they had 280 children.  To compound the difficulties of these families, it is extremely rare to find a woman drug user with a non drug-using family. The effects on the next generation &mdash; and in some cases the third generation &mdash; of children growing up in these circumstances is unbelievable.  We are certainly storing up conditions for the future which we will not be able to cope with.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to the voluntary and statutory agencies that are providing services.  They do an excellent job but are under-resourced and under-funded. <Col N="1365" /> Increased funding for them would produce great results in terms of cutting the cost of crime to the State.</P>
    <P>The central thrust of the document <i>Government Strategy to Prevent Drug Misuse</i>, of May 1991, was that there should be a reduction in supply and demand.  As far as reduction in supply goes, there have been extremely well publicised drug seizures by both the Customs authorities and the Garda.  Yet only small amounts are still involved in the seizures which are having only a marginal effect on the amount of drugs coming into the country.  The Department of Justice must play its role in ensuring adequate funding and resources for the Garda and Customs authorities to carry out this work.</P>
    <P>The document states that a reduction in demand for drugs can only be achieved through a three-tiered approach: education, the outreach treatment and the rehabilitation programmes. To date, our education programme does not seem to have addressed the problem.  In a week when the Minister for Education has announced mandatory sex education, it is worthy of note that we do not see the same urgency to provide a specific module in schools to deal with substance and drug abuse.  However, I would be optimistic and hopeful that we will see this fairly soon.</P>
    <P>School programmes can help, but the statistics in some of these reports show that many drug users are early school leavers.  Therefore, we must ensure that they are picked up through the outreach programme and treatment centres within communities.  Whenever it is suggested that a detoxification or treatment centre should be opened in a community it tends to create a lot of problems. However, while the medical and health aspects of drug misuse should not be underrated, the economic and social problems affecting drug abusers are also of major importance.  The arrival of the HIV and AIDS viruses has focused attention on the issues of harm minimisation and avoidance of the spread of AIDS, but some agencies feel this has <Col N="1366" /> diverted funding and attention away from drug prevention itself.  They feel that the Department of Health has abandoned efforts to prevent drug abuse.</P>
    <P>Clarification is needed concerning the relationship between drug prevention and harm minimisation, as well as the Department of Health's policy in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Senator.  I call on Senator Ann Ormonde to second the motion.  She has eight minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Miss Ormonde Miss Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I had expected a female, however I got a male.  I was not sure whether the Department of Health or the Department of Justice was responsible, but I am sure there is an overlap anyway.  I wish the Minister well in his new portfolio.</P>
      <P>I would like to second this fine motion by my colleague Senator McGennis.  She has said it all, so I am just here to highlight some of the main points again.  Anybody who believes that drugs are not freely available on the streets is kidding themselves.  Not alone are we into soft drugs but it is now taken for granted that hard drugs are part and parcel of the routine of anybody who is hanging around unemployed. There is no doubt that drug dealers are touting their wares on the streets of the inner city.  Much of our crime is drug related as addicts steal and commit assault in order to feed their habit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate our previous Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, who endeavoured to introduce legislation to try to combat the drug barons. When we were examining ways of dealing with the drug problem, I was conscious that we were very open to mainland Europe from where drugs could be quickly obtained.  Because it is a huge problem we have to be careful how the legislation, which I believe has been put in place, is implemented.  I would like to know the up to date position on that <Col N="1367" /> legislation, whether it is now beginning to be implemented and the effects it is having, or if it will have any effect.</P>
    <P>I was anxious to contribute to this debate because I work north of the inner city and am involved in my other role of counselling young people who take drugs.  I am very aware of the infrastructure that surrounds the drugs and the impact it is having on families and in their education of the young children. As Senator McGennis said, vulnerable young people from unemployed backgrounds seem to get caught.  Young people requiring remedial attention who lack home support are touted by drug barons and before they realise it, they are highly involved and it is harder to take them away from it.</P>
    <P>I will ask the Minister a few questions presently.  There has to be a powerful response at international, national and local levels to combat this huge problem. If we do not confront it, we will find ourselves in an equivalent situation to any of the American states we read about from time to time.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister consider the treatment facilities to be adequate?  If not, what policies need to be considered?  I realise it is early days yet but I want the Minister to be aware of the question. What is the status of drug education? Have we looked at areas of high risk and prevention?  This overlaps with the Department of Education.  At community level, resources are required to develop youth co-ordination and outreach centres.</P>
    <P>The home/school links in schools represent an attempt to ascertain where drugs are coming from and if young people are getting involved.  It is an attempt by the school to delve into the background and stall the development of the problem.  Education programmes for parents are also required, particularly in highly developed and populated areas where the problem exists.</P>
    <P>I ask again, are the treatment facilities adequate?  Are the education facilities adequate?  I do not believe they are. What research is done into the impact <Col N="1368" /> of this huge problem?  I know from personal dealings with it that we are in a danger zone because of high employment, the vulnerability of young people and their need for money.  Nothing will break that unless we break the cycle of unemployment and the causes of the problem of drug abuse.  This requires co-ordination between the Department of Health, the Department of Justice and the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>We must also involve the parents, the local community and employers.  The problem will not go away through talking about it, or if the Minister talks about it.  It will not go away if only the gardaí, who are doing a very good job, tackle it.  It has to be a combined force involving everybody.  In any area where parents got involved and led a campaign, the drugs were cleared out of that area.  We must actively go about it in that sense.  I ask the Minister to deliver a message to the other Departments to devise a combined policy and strategy to combat this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I also welcome this motion.  Under the Government strategy to prevent drug abuse, the health boards have been given the primary role in the development of preventative treatment and rehabilitation services in the field of drug misuse.  In the Dublin, Wicklow and Kildare area the Eastern Health Board, of which I am a member, has been given that responsibility.  Since 1992, the level of funding made available to the Eastern Health Board by the Department of Health has increased significantly to its current level of about £4 million per year.  I thank the former Minister for Health for the funds he made available to overcome this problem during his term of office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Preventative strategies aimed at breaking the cycle of substance misuse by young people, particularly from deprived areas, represent the main hope of preventing the spread of drug misuse for future generations.  A joint approach is currently in place between the Department of Education, the Department <Col N="1369" /> of Health, local schools, community drug teams established by the health boards and the network of community addiction counsellors and staff from the AIDS drugs co-ordination units.</P>
    <P>Preventative statistics aimed at giving young people and their parents more information on possible risks associated with illicit drug use and enabling young people to acquire the personal skill to say no when approached with a view to taking drugs and the provision of alternative amenities and activities to prevent boredom are also part of the preventative programme.</P>
    <P>The exact number of injecting drug users in the greater Dublin area is unknown but estimates have been made at around 5,000.  In 1991 the Health Research Board estimated that there were 2,000 drug takers in treatment and 64 per cent were injecting.  The Health Research Board statistics included those who were receiving counselling only among those defined as in treatment.</P>
    <P>Following the publication of the methadone treatment programme by the Department of Health in October 1994, health board addiction staff and the staff from the drug treatment centre have combined to establish a unified methadone treatment list.  There are currently 860 people on the list, of whom 666 are receiving methadone treatment from the satellite clinics and 200 are receiving the methadone treatment from general practitioners.</P>
    <P>The methadone treatment programmes are provided at two different levels.  The first is a low dosage methadone for those whose behaviour is most chaotic.  This is a first step to wean them away from drug addiction.  The second is a higher does methadone maintenance for those considered to be sufficiently stable combined with monitoring for other drug use.  The second stage gives them an opportunity to progress to detoxification and rehabilitation programmes. The detoxification programme and the provision of an adequate rehabilitation programme is the main goal for people who become <Col N="1370" /> stable and no longer wish to continue taking methadone and other drugs.  It is a great consolation to people who work in the field when they can achieve that state and they can win over a drug addict to a normal way of life.</P>
    <P>There are currently ten detoxification beds serving the greater Dublin area which are located in the Beaumont Hospital.  Provision of treatment services for drug addicts is controversial and difficult because the immediate reaction of most communities is that while they agree in principle that everyone should get treatment, no community believes that the service should be provided on its own doorstep.  I have experienced this problem in my own constituency and have, indeed, raised it here on the Adjournment.  I am sure Senator Manning will concur with what I said.</P>
    <P>Given the number of injecting drug users in the city it is apparent that there will have to be a considerable increase in the level of service provided.  Methadone treatment services are currently available to 660 injecting drug users only.  In order to develop the service further and to limit the spread of infection, especially HIV infection, to the community, the level of access to full specialised treatment for drug users must be increased.  This must also be done with the co-operation of the local communities.</P>
    <P>During 1994 the main expansion in the health boards' community based services has been in the areas of methadone treatment, needle exchange and welfare support.  Currently there are 426 people who are receiving methadone treatment.  An average of eight new applicants attend the clinics each month. The total monthly attendance for methadone treatment at clinics is approximately 7,000.  The very high number of return attendants confirms the effectiveness of the methadone programme in stabilising the behaviour of this group and passing on to the next stage of treatment.  Needle exchange continues to be the first weapon in the health services' fight against drug addiction. <Col N="1371" /> Attendance for needle exchange is a mechanism for keeping drug addicts in regular contact with the health services until they get a place on the methadone treatment programme.  Methadone treatment has been in place for two years and has had a stabilising effect on a majority of the community.  However, there is a need to establish more satellite clinics; there are only three in operation at present.  If we are to have such treatment for drug addicts, which has proved to be successful, then these satellite clinics must be extended both north and south of the river.</P>
    <P>At present a large number of addicts attend the small number of clinics and this causes problems in the local areas. As I said earlier, everyone wishes to see this problem treated, but no one wants to have it treated on their own doorstep. Nevertheless, the community has shown responsibility and it is prepared to accept that people who suffer from drug addiction in their own catchment areas can be treated there.  I ask the Minister to provide the necessary funds to the health board and to encourage it to establish more clinics so that each catchment area in the city will have its own system where it can treat people who suffer from drug addiction and who live in the neighbourhood.  I believe that is acceptable to the community.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the staff who run these clinics.  It is not a pleasant job to deal with drug addicts day after day, but clinical psychiatrists and doctors are committed to this work.  As I said earlier, they get their reward when they wean people off heroine and other drugs.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1372" /> Drug abuse in Dublin's inner city has now reached crisis and epidemic proportions and I have had two examples of this over the past month.  One of my staff was mugged at 2 o'clock in the afternoon at the back gate of our office. After her handbag was stolen, two young children told her they had seen who did it.  They mentioned the name of the person and said he lived on the third floor and that he was a drug addict &mdash;&ldquo;junkie&rdquo; was the word they used.  The Garda also said they knew who did it because it is a daily occurrence in that area by that particular person.  I suppose we have become used to it.</P>
    <P>One thing which shocked me in recent times was when a school principal from an inner city school rang me the week after Christmas because he was wondering how he would deal with an 11 year old child whom he knew was using heroin.  He eventually brought in the parents and in a soft way he brought his concerns to their attention.  He was promptly threatened with legal action, etc. for saying such things about their child.  They threatened him with the Garda, who arrived at the school.  The matter was sorted out because the Garda pointed out to the principal teacher that the child's parents were one of the major middle range dealers in that housing estate.  That is the type of thing which is happening in Dublin at present.</P>
    <P>This is a problem we must all face.  It is too easy to ask what the State, the Government or the Garda are doing about it.  It is a problem which is rooted in society and it cannot be dealt with in the supply area.  No attempts to stem the supply of drugs will solve the drugs problem.  The only effective way to deal with it is, in effect, to try to stem the demand for drugs.  It is a fact that every time state authorities anywhere in the world succeed in stopping the flow of a particular drug, then another drug takes its place.  This was seen in the early 1980s with the development of the so-called designer drugs.  When the authorities had finally stopped the flow of cocaine in large quantities from South <Col N="1373" /> America and heroin and other drugs from the Far East, the chemists produced the so-called designer drugs in their laboratories.</P>
    <P>It has now reached a stage that primary school children on the streets of Dublin are making a tidy living out of selling what they call ecstasy tablets. They can carry four or five of these in a matchbox and sell five of them for £10, £15 or £20 each.  They are doing the work of the drug godfathers and the people down the line.  The people who are selling them to feed their own habit or as a business to make money for themselves are now using young children to do it.  These drug landlords, barons and godfathers, who are running the scene, are almost uncatchable because they can use young children to carry and sell small amounts of drugs and if they are caught, there is little risk involved.</P>
    <P>Heroin is now freely available all the time in the city centre.  I do not understand why it has come back again.  Perhaps it goes in cycles, but there was a time in the late 1980s and early 1990s when we got control of it.  However, it is now moving back again.</P>
    <P>The only strategy to deal with the drugs epidemic is an education strategy. I am not sure how this could be done, but education should be used in its broadest sense to teach children how to say no and how to resist peer pressure and to prepare them for the time when they will receive their first invitation to involve themselves in substance abuse of any description.  One of the biggest problems we are facing and which teachers bring to my attention is the vocabulary of the street which changes so quickly.  This week it might be &ldquo;chasing the dragon&rdquo;, next week it might be &ldquo;H&rdquo; and the following week it might be whatever terminology they are using that week.  They will never use the word &ldquo;heroin&rdquo;.  Often the children who are using it are not aware of the drug they are using at a young age and they become addicted long before they can cope and deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1374" /> We must approach it in this way.  As a society we must ask if we can intervene in the home or in the school.  I am not saying it can be done in the schools because people can say we have a drugs education programme in schools in order to train children away from substance abuse.  The idea is technically a good one, but who will teach the teachers?  The vast majority of the teachers of Ireland will not be able to distinguish between heroin and talcum powder and long may that continue. The reality is that if we are to get people to deal with a particular issue, we must have experts in that area.</P>
    <P>In the early 1980s the then Government introduced a task force on drugs abuse and there was a fair amount of follow-up at that time.  I am not sure if this was the reason for it, but the use of heroin &mdash; and the statistics show this &mdash; dropped substantially in the late 1980s. Now it has gone back up again and we seem to have lost control of it.  In the early 1980s, during the organisation of a European conference on drugs abuse for young trade unionists in Strasbourg, there was a push throughout Europe at that time from the different governments to control this.  There was a lot of inter-agency work between Interpol, the Garda Síochána, constabularies and the different customs units.  I do not know the customs status in this area at present because of open Europe, but it seems that the flow of drugs is more free than it ever was.  Therefore, we must approach this in a twofold way.  We must maintain a tight control of supply; in other words, the police and other authorities should have as much resources as they need to deal with the supply.  We must deal with treatment, as outlined by the previous speaker.  We also need to examine the demand, which can only be done through a community education programme.</P>
    <P>Perhaps schools have something to offer there.  In the late 1970s it was recommended by Europe that every school should have a teacher who was an expert on drug abuse and misuse. That is a fine aspiration, which would <Col N="1375" /> undoubtedly be helpful and useful, but what concerns me is that the average parent whose child is abusing drugs is often unaware of what is happening in the early stages.  Similarly the average teacher would not know what was happening and might put it down to mood changes which happen as a result of normal teenage development.  Much education needs to be done and there are many places where we can intervene. This is an extraordinarily tricky and wide-ranging area.  I do not pretend to know all the answers and I await the Minister's statement with interest.</P>

      <P>Before calling the Minister I join with other Members who have congratulated him on his appointment and welcome him back to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Thank you.  I am grateful for the opportunity to participate in this debate and to outline the Government policy for dealing with the scourge of drug abuse.  I will first put the problem in an historical perspective.</P>
      <P>Drug abuse appeared as a problem initially in this country in the mid 1960s when evidence began to emerge of amphetamine abuse.  From there the problem began to develop and it intensified in the 1970s with cannabis and LSD.  In the early 1980s there was a swing towards the use of opiates such as heroin.  The developing pattern in terms of the type of drugs being misused was matched by a steady increase in the number of people, particularly young persons, known to be involved in drug taking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation today is that while there is no accurate figure available for the number of drug misusers in Ireland, the indications are that it continues to be a problem.  There is concern that the age at which people first begin to experiment with drugs is falling all the time. The most recent report from the Health Research Board indicated that in 1993 an estimated 2,573 people received <Col N="1376" /> treatment for drug abuse in the greater Dublin area.  The comparable figure for 1992 was 2,240.</P>
    <P>There were other interesting details in the report, such as: in 1993 the number of people presenting for treatment for the first time was 859, compared with 668 in 1992; as Senator McGennis said, 80 per cent of those who presented for treatment were unemployed; in 80 per cent of cases the drugs of abuse for which people sought treatment were opiates, that is, heroin and morphine sulphate tablets mainly; and six out of ten injected their primary drug of abuse, a fact which has serious implications for the spread of HIV in this country.  I will refer to this later, and all Senators who contributed thus far have stressed this fact.</P>
    <P>In so far as drugs of abuse are concerned, cannabis continues to be the major one.  It is responsible for the greatest number of seizures by the Garda Síochána and customs authorities in recent years.  There is also evidence of a marked increase in the abuse of ecstasy in the past three years, especially among teenagers.  The concern here is that this may become a &ldquo;gateway&rdquo; drug which leads users on to abuse of other, more addictive drugs.</P>
    <P>The major drugs of addiction are, as indicated in the Health Research Board report, heroin, morphine sulphate tablets and other opiates.  These are the drugs which also give rise to the greatest concern because of the anti-social behaviour of those who misuse them, as well as the risk of the spread of HIV / AIDS which arises from sharing contaminated needles.</P>
    <P>What I have attempted up to now is to paint a picture of the nature and extent of drug misuse.  I will now deal with how the problem is being tackled. At Government level, a task force of Ministers of State at the Department of Health, Department of Education, Department of Justice, Department of Environment, Department of Foreign Affairs and Department of Labour was established in 1983 to examine the growing drug problem at that time.  The <Col N="1377" /> task force was asked to pay particular attention to inner city areas which had experienced the brunt of drug misuse and its attendant problems.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of the task force were submitted to Government in August 1983 and covered law enforcement, education, health, community/ youth development and research. Directly arising out of these recommendations a series of legislative, educational and service measures were introduced which provided a framework for dealing with both the supply and demand aspects of the drug abuse problem.</P>
    <P>One of the key measures was the establishment of the National Co-ordinating Committee on Drug Abuse.  The committee was established to advise the Government on issues regarding prevention and treatment of drug misuse. Following widespread consultation by the national co-ordinating committee with organisations and experts from the statutory and voluntary sectors, the Government strategy to prevent drug misuse was published in 1991, based on the recommendations of the national co-ordinating committee.</P>
    <P>The strategy recognised that the problem of drug misuse is complex and difficult and one to which there are no easy or instant solutions.  It therefore proposed a multi-disciplinary approach requiring action in the areas of supply reduction, demand reduction and increased access to treatment and rehabilitation programmes, together with co-ordination mechanisms geared towards their effective implementation. The strategy was accepted by the Government.</P>
    <P>While it recognised the validity of a multiplicity of treatment and prevention programmes, the strategy recommended a drug-free lifestyle as the ideal.  It also recognised, however, that various drug treatment options are required to deal with the needs of individual drug misusers. Such options would include methadone maintenance, needle exchange, detoxification and rehabilitation. They could be provided by statutory <Col N="1378" /> agencies working in close co-operation with the voluntary sector.</P>
    <P>I was Minister for Justice when the committee was initiated in 1983.  I am back speaking in the Seanad 11 years later on the same issue.  This shows how problems do not go away but change their form and magnify, although the public has more understanding of the problem now.  Nonetheless, as Senators said, the problem remains, has worsened and needs to be addressed on a continuing basis.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the demand reduction strategy, which is primarily the responsibility of the Minister for Health.  Since 1991 the Department of Health has been overseeing the implementation of the recommendations in the strategy.  The publication in 1992 of the report of the National AIDS Strategy Committee has also had a major impact on policy in this area, given the close connection between HIV/AIDS and intravenous drug abuse.  At present 57 per cent of all known HIV positive cases in this country are drug abuse related and the emphasis has been on putting in place a comprehensive treatment network for drug misusers.</P>
    <P>Since 1992 special funding has been allocated each year to allow for the development of extensive prevention and treatment services by the Eastern Health Board, which, together with the drug treatment centre in Pearse Street and voluntary organisations, provides such services in the Dublin area where the majority of drug misusers reside. Senator Doyle referred to some of the EHB's work in this area.</P>
    <P>The ultimate objective of the treatment and rehabilitation programmes is a drug-free lifestyle.  It is acknowledged, however, that this is not an option for many drug misusers, at least in the initial stages of treatment, and consequently it has been necessary to introduce methadone maintenance programmes in community based satellite clinics as a means of stabilising the behaviour of drug misusers and preventing the spread of HIV through sharing contaminated needles.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1379" /> To date three satellite clinics have been established by the Eastern Health Board at Baggot Street, Ballyfermot and Amiens Street.  The clinics provide a range of primary services for drug misusers, including methadone maintenance, needle exchange, urinalysis, HIV testing, counselling and free condoms. They provide services for drug misusers within a defined catchment area.  At present a total of 420 drug misusers are on methadone maintenance programmes at the satellite clinics and a further 190 patients receive methadone at the drug treatment centre, Pearse Street.</P>
    <P>Because the demand for services at the satellite clinics has been so great a waiting list has built up and I regard it as an urgent priority to provide services for those on the waiting list.  As a first step the Eastern Health Board is arranging to open two of the satellite clinics for methadone maintenance in the afternoons.  It is hoped this will be done early in February and that up to 50 patients can be accommodated at each clinic.  In addition funding is being made available to the Eastern Health Board to enable it to open three additional clinics in Dublin in 1995 as part of the development of a comprehensive network of services.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the policy of treating drug misusers in their own community to the greatest extent possible, general practitioners are being encouraged to take on responsibility for the treatment, including the provision of methadone, of drug misusers.  At present about 240 patients are on methadone maintenance with general practitioners.  I know that there is a reluctance on the part of some general practitioners to become involved in this area and this is perhaps understandable. I feel, however, that the Protocol for the prescribing of methadone, which was recently circulated, provides a framework of support for general practitioners willing to become involved. Any practitioner who was so willing would be asked to take on a stabilised <Col N="1380" /> patient from a satellite clinic and continue with their treatment.  The services of the satellite clinic would continue to be available, where required, together with the right to refer the patient back should any problems develop.  The discharge of patients in this way from the satellite clinics would free up spaces for patients on the waiting list who currently receive no services.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the need to continue with the development of services in line with the recommendations of the National Co-ordinating Committee and to this end the Eastern Health Board will be concentrating on certain aspects of its services to ensure that they meet the needs of those who seek them.</P>
    <P>The availability of detoxification facilities is an essential part of the multifaceted approach which is required to deal with the problem of drug abuse. The ten bed unit in Beaumont Hospital has been under intense pressure and a waiting list has developed as a result. This problem will be addressed by the Eastern Health Board in the near future with the commissioning of a ten bed unit at Cherry Orchard Hospital.  It is hoped to have the unit available in the spring of this year.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, the Health Research Board noted in its report for 1993 that 80 per cent of those receiving treatment for drug abuse were unemployed.  The National Co-ordinating Committee identified the availability of rehabilitation facilities as a key element in reintegrating drug misusers into society.  The Eastern Health Board has been running a rehabilitation facility entitled the &ldquo;Soilse&rdquo; project which has achieved a high degree of success in equipping drug misusers with social and occupational skills.  It is intended to extend this programme in 1995 so as to cater for more drug misusers.</P>
    <P>Abuse of drugs is not, of course, confined to the greater Dublin area.  There is abuse of drugs outside of Dublin but it is on a much lesser scale and there is no evidence to suggest that intravenous drug misuse constitutes a serious problem. Each health board, however, <Col N="1381" /> closely monitors the situation in order to be in a position to deal quickly with problems as they arise.  The Southern Health Board, for example, recently submitted to my Department a five year strategy to deal with alcohol and drug abuse in its area.  This is under consideration and will be discussed with the board shortly.</P>
    <P>In keeping with the recommendations in the Government strategy, my Department places an emphasis on demand reduction through its education and prevention initiatives.  These are wide ranging in nature and would include the substance abuse prevention programme in second level schools entitled &ldquo;On My Own Two Feet&rdquo; which was developed jointly with the Department of Education, a pilot project on parent education, on alcohol, drugs and family communication, the co-ordination of European Drug Prevention Week in 1994, the development of resource materials on alcohol and solvent abuse, the organisation of community based training programmes for health and education professionals and the production of educational materials for use by both the public and professionals working in the field.</P>
    <P>I wish to move to the role of the Minister for Justice who has asked me to speak on her behalf and on behalf of her Department this evening.  The National Co-ordinating Committee in its recommendations stressed the need for a co-ordinated approach to tackle the drug abuse area involving demand reduction, control of supply and illegal trafficking. I have already outlined developments on the demand reduction side.  I would now like to deal with the question of supply and trafficking for which my colleague, the Minister for Justice, has primary responsibility and to set out in detail the approach taken by the Department of Justice and the gardaí.</P>
    <P>An essential component of our approach is the rigorous and unrelenting enforcement of the drug laws.  To this end, all Garda drug units are co-ordinated on a national basis through the National Drug Administration <Col N="1382" /> Office in Garda headquarters.  In Dublin, drug units have been established in each of the city's five Garda divisions and their activities are co-ordinated through the Central Drug Squad based in Harcourt Square.  This approach has enabled the Central Drugs Squad to monitor the activities of drug dealers all over the city and it has significantly enhanced the Garda intelligence gathering capability.</P>
    <P>Monthly meetings are held between all drugs units at which recent seizures and trends are discussed and future operations are planned.  This ensures maximum co-ordination and cohesion of the fight against drugs in the capital. The situation is continuously monitored and strategies adapted to meet changing circumstances.  Last September, for instance, a major Garda initiative was launched against drug dealing in the north inner city.  Searches were carried out in the flat complexes concerned and these resulted in arrests, the seizure of drugs and other evidence of drug dealing. This exercise was repeated over a number of weeks as dealers sought to change their tactics and their locations. The entire operation has been welcomed and supported by the law abiding residents of the area.  Over a period of one month, ten persons were arrested and charged for drug related offences and drugs with a street value of £500,000 were seized.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Seanad that the fight against drugs is not only being waged in the cities.  Rural areas have not been untouched by drugs and the gardaí are responding accordingly.  It is the experience of all of us in politics to hear various rumours emanating from rural areas about the prevalence of drugs and it is difficult at times to establish the truth of the rumours.  Senators will know what I am talking about in certain rural constituencies.  In this regard, I am informed by the Garda authorities that the problem of drug misuse in rural areas is primarily one of cannabis resin although some areas &mdash; mainly Border areas &mdash; have encountered a problem with ecstasy tablets from time to time.  I <Col N="1383" /> can assure the Seanad that the prevention and detection of drug related offences in rural areas, as elsewhere in the State, is treated with the highest priority by the Garda authorities.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there has been some public concern about the level of co-ordination of the various law enforcement agencies in the fight against drugs. In this regard, a senior official of the Department of Justice has completed a report on important aspects of law enforcement in relation to the drugs problem here.  The Minister for Justice is now considering this report and she will prepare proposals for Government based on the report.  The main task of the report is to identify the best arrangements for achieving a cohesive and co-ordinated response to the drug trafficking problem by the existing law enforcement agencies.  The proposals will be mainly concerned with this aspect.</P>
    <P>The report also examines the legal powers of members of the law enforcement agencies and the need for legislative changes to assist the law enforcement response.  Senator Ormonde asked specifically about the response of the gardaí and I will deal with it here.  The contribution in the health and education areas in developing strategies to reduce demand for drugs is also considered. The proposals to be prepared for Government will cover all these aspects.</P>
    <P>An important part of the fight against drugs is to target the ill-gotten gains of drug dealers and traffickers.  It is not enough to harass and hound the street corner pusher.  Those who sit back and profit from this evil trade must also be brought to account.  The Criminal Justice Act, 1994, contains provisions for the confiscation of the proceeds of crime and deals with money laundering by criminals, including drug traffickers. This Act represents a major initiative against the drug menace in this country. Specifically, the Act provides for (a) the seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of drug trafficking and other serious offences; (b) the creation of an offence of money laundering and the imposition <Col N="1384" /> of obligations on financial institutions to prevent and assist in the detection of money laundering and (c) measures to give effect to a number of international instruments on drug trafficking, money laundering and mutual assistance internationally in criminal matters.</P>
    <P>Senator Ormonde asked how effective is this legislation.  It is too early to say yet because it has not been in force for long enough to monitor it in a serious way.  However, it was the consensus in the Dáil and the Seanad that it would be effective legislation and that in this, as in many other areas of crime, the godfathers seem to relax in luxury while the pushers and the users face the cutting edge of the law.  This measure is particularly directed at those behind the scenes who are the major problem and who are also the major beneficiaries.</P>
    <P>There are also international aspects of law enforcement which are worth noting.  Intelligence based strategies are central in combating the importation of drugs and the closest international co-operation is an essential prerequisite if such strategies are to prove effective. The implications for policing which arose from the abolition of customs control and immigration control on 1 January 1993 were examined in detail.  EC Ministers, in agreeing to set up the Trevi Group in 1975, affirmed their common will to strengthen co-operation in the fight against organised international crime and terrorism.  Under the Irish Presidency, Trevi Ministers at their meeting in Dublin in June 1990, agreed a programme of action which sets out measures to be taken by member states to combat terrorism and organised crime, including drug trafficking.</P>
    <P>In accordance with this programme, member states were requested to study the need for a European drugs intelligence unit.  A special Trevi sub-group examined this matter, and at its meeting held in December 1991, the European Council decided that a Europol Drugs Unit should be established as soon as possible to act as a centralised exchange and co-ordination unit, especially for <Col N="1385" /> drug related information between member states.  The Europol Drugs Unit became operational on 31 January 1994 and it is expected that the unit, which has a liaison officer from the Garda, will be of great practical benefit in combating the international trafficking of drugs.  My Department, through its representation on international bodies, such as the Pompidou Group of the Council of Europe and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, keeps in touch with the developments at international level also.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I ask the House to accept that the Government takes in a most serious way its responsibilities in tackling drug abuse and I assure Members that it will continue to implement policy as recommended by the National Co-ordinating Committee in a determined and sustained manner.</P>
    <P>There is, however, no easy solution. Abroad, we have seen a wide range of measures adopted to confront the problem. Yet the drugs problem remains firmly rooted.  With the opening of borders under the European Union arrangements for the completion of the Internal Market, we have to remain vigilant about the trafficking of illicit drugs and, towards this end, we are developing the structures referred to in order to respond to the situation as it evolves and to prevent the supply of illicit drugs to the Irish market.</P>
    <P>Demand reduction through educational, treatment and rehabilitation programmes and services will continue to be developed, and the indications from the Eastern Health Board services are that there is a willingness among drug misusers to seek and avail of treatment for their addiction.  There is no room for complacency, however, and much remains to be done.  It is my priority to ensure that the health boards, and especially the Eastern Health Board, have the resources available to enable them to implement a comprehensive range of treatment and rehabilitation services designed to reduce the demand for illicit drugs.  In addition, the health promotion unit of <Col N="1386" /> my Department will continue to work with the Department of Education, the health boards and community groups to inform and educate the public, and especially young people, about the dangers of illicit drug use.</P>
    <P>I thank the Senators who have contributed to this debate and to those who will contribute later this evening.  With regard to anything Senators say, I will have officials of my Department examine the record to see if something new comes up of which they are not aware, or if a suggestion is made which is validly based &mdash; and I am sure many suggestions will be made which are validly based &mdash; I can also assure Senators that their views will be taken into account in the further development of policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and wish him well in the portfolio he has attained.  The Minister will have a hard act to follow, but I have no doubt he is well able to do so.  I congratulate Senator McGennis also for bringing the issue of drugs abuse in this country onto the floor of the House this evening.  It is an issue which she has raised time and again in the House, and I welcome the opportunity to speak on it.</P>
      <P>Drug abuse in society at present is not merely confined to Dublin or Cork.  It is not only an urban problem; it is also a rural problem and affects every large and small town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are drugs to be found everywhere. My own mind goes back a number of years and the concerns a friend of mine had for his son who had been working in Dublin.  He was addicted to heroin, had received treatment in Dublin and went home for a holiday.  When he was well enough to go back to his work in Dublin his father decided to drive him to Dublin.  On the way they stopped at a cafe to get something to eat and the young lad went out to the toilet. The father thought he had been gone for quite a while and he went out see where he was and found him slumped in the corner of a toilet.  He died that <Col N="1387" /> evening from an overdose of heroin.  To this day the father does not know if he met somebody there or if he had the drug on him, but even after the treatment and help he had received, he overdosed himself, or so it appears, and killed himself on his first movement back to Dublin.</P>
    <P>There are so many sad cases of what drugs are doing to families and society that it is an issue which we cannot close our eyes to.  If one goes to a hospital at the weekend, or visits a casualty ward or psychiatric ward, it becomes apparent that the number of people attending with drug problems is massive.  The cost, not only to society, to health boards and the Department, but also to parents is phenomenal.</P>
    <P>The authorities &mdash; the Garda, customs and hospital authorities who are facing up to this issue &mdash; must be complimented for the work they are doing. When one sees the number of treatment facilities which are available within the health boards, the Department and health boards must be complimented because there is much counselling undertaken for people who have addiction problems, not only with respect to drugs, but also to alcohol, smoking, gambling machines and so on.  These are matters which are being dealt with by the excellent counsellors and staff in our health boards.</P>
    <P>There are also residential programmes available, but that is one of the areas where there is not enough help.  In my own area of Sligo and Letterkenny, there are excellent prevention and treatment programmes, but there are no real residential areas available which means that if people do not wish to go into hospital they have nowhere else to go. In this respect, many people in Donegal go to Derry, to the Nortlands Centre, which deals with many of the problems they may have.</P>
    <P>Schools have a major role to play. The life skills programme was an excellent programme in which education was the way forward.  It is still the way forward and it is one at which we should <Col N="1388" /> keep working.  However, parents must be educated about the drugs scene.  Parents should look at themselves.  People going home tonight should note the number of pills in their houses, where children are being doped if they do not sleep.  It does not cost a pound of thought to throw them a tablet or a spoonful of medicine to quieten them. The first measure of support people in grief receive is a tablet or a vallium, which will probably end up doing more harm than good.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of unnecessary advice available.  There is a great deal of unnecessary medicine lying around houses; sometimes people do not even bother to lock it up and then we ask ourselves how did a young kid who overdosed get the drugs.  It may well have been the parents' fault.  We must also consider doctor's prescriptions.  I have gone into houses, through my work within the psychiatric service, and have seen tin boxes and biscuit tins full of tablets &mdash; pills of all sizes and shapes, and if a person has a problem it is easy enough to get something when they need it.</P>
    <P>If we look at society to ascertain who is taking drugs we find it is mostly young people between the ages of 15 and 35 years.  It appears that drugs are easily obtained at discos, dances, parties, etc. These appear to be the regular areas for drug distribution.  For example, the figures for the Pearse Street treatment centre in Dublin illustrate that over the last number of years approximately 1,500 people have been treated per year in this centre alone.  There is a major problem.</P>
    <P>In areas like Donegal drugs are also easily obtained, many of them from across the Border.  It is a case of the gardaí being vigilant, and in this respect I pay tribute to the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, for the work she undertook by giving extra support to the gardaí and customs in the Donegal area.</P>
    <P>The criminal justice legislation in respect of the confiscation of the proceeds from drugs was another area <Col N="1389" /> which was welcomed, and the legislation can only be good for society.  Help has been provided to the Garda and the customs authorities with regard to the catching and arresting of people, and many have ended up in jail, where they deserve to be.  As long as we keep tackling this problem we will get somewhere.</P>
    <P>It is seemingly difficult for parents to recognise early drug taking.  Very few parents realise that when their children are staying out late at night there may well be a problem.  They never seem to question why new friends have been made or from where they have come. The children may have lost interest in sports, they no longer have hobbies, their health deteriorates and so does their school work.  They do not appear to realise what is happening to their children until it is far too late.</P>
    <P>Where do we go from here?  At present, given the treatments that are available, people will generally go to their GP or their drug treatment unit where there is always professional help available.  The Revenue Commissioners and the Customs authorities are available and willing to educate people as to what should be done but the message does not appear to be getting through. The Government strategy to prevent drug misuse is a massive document but at the same time the Garda, the customs and the health services are seemingly not really working together.</P>
    <P>The Department should seriously look at setting up a drugs advisory service. In an area such as where I come from, Donegal, we should examine the needs there for intervention, draw up a plan for the services and then come up with clear strategies in relation to it. There are objectives in setting up the services.  First, define the services that exist in each area, define the needs for substance misuse services in the area, both the current need and the anticipated future need on the basis of what we have seen over the last number of years, and recommend aims and objectives for the immediate future.  They should also recommend future service <Col N="1390" /> developments over the next five years if possible.</P>
    <P>A local assessment of need is essential. In order to assess the need it is necessary to research the scale of problematic drug use within the area and evaluate the demand for drug related services.  Once these findings are evaluated a report could be prepared and presented recommending a drugs advisory service appropriate to the needs of the community.  The service would exist to provide a point of contact and information in relation to drugs services for clients' professionals, relatives and friends.  That kind of service is missing at the moment.</P>
    <P>We could provide an indirect service to clients through consultation, training and supervision, facilitate the early identification of drug problems and monitor the service's effectiveness in achieving this.  The service should be based in the community if that is the road we are going to go down.  Funding for the service should be available from the health boards and from the Department. Telephone contacts, up to date publicity and information is really important.  General practitioners in particular should be involved in the provision of a consultation service for professionals to provide a specialist information service in relation to drugs and to offer drug education.  The police force has to be involved.  It is a road we should go down.  We should provide a drugs advisory service at present because it is badly needed and at the moment the services do not seem to be co-ordinated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the motion put down would be more associated with the Department of Justice but I am confident that the Minister present will inform those Ministers I consider appropriate to the motion of my views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing we have to acknowledge &mdash; it has already been mentioned &mdash; is that drug abuse in Ireland has reached epidemic proportions.  The statistics available from the health boards throughout the country show <Col N="1391" /> only the tip of the iceberg.  You can go to any major town or indeed the larger cities in Ireland on a Saturday night and attend what we call a &ldquo;rave&rdquo; and see 200 or 300 people drinking glasses of water and taking ecstasy tablets.  These are not frightening figments of the imagination.  These are facts and this is happening in every large town in this country today.  It is time we acknowledged that we have an epidemic problem in Ireland and that we use all the resources of the State available to us to ensure that we counteract it.</P>
    <P>We called for a debate in the Seanad on numerous occasions over the last number of years to highlight the issues and I acknowledge the work of the last Minister for Justice in bringing forward the Criminal Justice (No. 3) Bill, 1993. However, it is not good enough to bring forward a Bill without supporting it and providing the necessary means to implement it.  The Garda are totally under resourced in this area.  They themselves would be the first to admit that they do not have the back up, the manpower or indeed the expertise to root out this problem.  There are more gardaí on a Saturday night checking people on a country cross roads for drink driving than there are checking night-clubs, bars and people who are dealing in drugs.</P>
    <P>We do not face up to the fact that we have a problem in this country, but we also have an advantage.  We have not gone as far down the road as our European friends and it is time that we learned from their mistakes.  They did not enforce the laws rapidly enough.  We have another great advantage which we should use to eliminate this problem, that is the fact that we are an island nation.  Every effort should be made to ensure that drug trafficking is eliminated in this country.  A number of years ago State solicitor Mr. Barry Galvin in Cork said that drug importation was at epidemic proportions in the Cork area and he was laughed at by the Government and the Garda.  Seizures last year <Col N="1392" /> along the west coast of Cork indicate that he was right.</P>
    <P>We have to take our head out of the sand and acknowledge that we have a problem.  The Garda have to be funded and more manpower must be brought in.  The fact that we now have peace in Northern Ireland should mean that resources heretofore used in subversive surveillance and involved in policing the criminal element should now be transferred to deal with the problem of drug abuse.  I also see a role for the Army in this.  We have a very long coastline and the Navy is just not able to provide the surveillance that is required to ensure that no drug trafficking occurs on our shores.  The Army will have to be used in a positive way in patrolling our coastline. They would only be required as a deterrent.  Their deployment would allow customs more time for detection and allow the Garda more time to implement the legislation that is already in place.  We depend too much on the Garda alone for this.  They have a large personnel, about 10,000 highly trained people.  I see no reason why they cannot be put on our shorelines to deter the importation of drugs.</P>
    <P>We now have a drug culture in Ireland among the young people and when I speak about young people I speak about children from 12 years of age.  Every Saturday night you will see people quite openly drinking water as a means to get a buzz after using an ecstasy tablet.  It is quite blatantly being done in every night-club in the city. That is something that the Garda cannot come to grips with because they just do not have the available surveillance and manpower.  As well as that, we have to educate people.  The young people today see a glossy image of the drug culture. I remember years ago in &ldquo;Miami Vice&rdquo; Crockett and Tubbs and other characters would kick in the doors of drug dealers.  The programme showed fancy night-clubs and yachts, boats and big cars and it has conjured up an image that drugs are attractive, drugs are a means of escapism.  We have to educate people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1393" /> I welcome the Minister for Education's announcement on sex education programmes in schools.  I genuinely believe that we will have to follow along the same lines in regard to drug abuse.  The same viewpoints that have been expressed by teachers in regard to sex education will have to be expressed in regard to the drugs situation as well, because there is no point in setting up programmes for treatment when drug abuse could be prevented. The big issue here is that we must put more resources into prevention.  I remember some years ago I spoke in a Macra na Feirme debate and I told people that I knew that several members of my class had indulged in the taking of drugs.  That was seven or eight years ago.  People refused to believe that drug abuse was that prevalent in our society.</P>
    <P>I can assure Members that today, right throughout the State, there are people who think that drugs are associated with inner city areas, deprived areas, high unemployment areas.  Drug abuse occurs right across the social spectrum. On the issue of the relationship between unemployment and drug abuse, there is no doubt about it, Christy Moore's song sums it up, vigilantes had to be set up.  I think the group was called Combined Parents Against Drug Pushers.  They set themselves up and called to drug pushers' doors and told the drug pushers that if they would not quit, they would have to move.  Unfortunately, the State put these people, who were trying to save their children from drug abuse, in jail.  Those people ended up in jail, because they were the easy option.</P>
    <P>We must explain right from the top that the pushers on the street are innocent victims just as much as drug abusers. The criminal justice legislation will have to be implemented in full.  We have the legislation but no resources to implement it.  I am pleading with the Minister to give the Garda the authority, the power and the resources to deal with this problem, to release them from the duties they are at present <Col N="1394" /> carrying out.  We could have the customs, the Navy and the Army patrolling our coastlines to ensure that there is no importation of drugs and allow the Garda to implement the full rigours of the law.</P>
    <P>We speak about supply and demand. While there is a demand of such magnitude, there will be an even greater supply. I am confident that the amount of drugs which have been seized by the Gardaí are a small proportion of what is coming into this country.  An ecstasy tablet cost £25 in Cork until last April. One can now buy one openly on the street for £12.50.  This shows that we are losing the battle against the importation of illegal drugs.  There is an over-supply at present and that is why they are so available to young people.</P>
    <P>We must realise that we have a drug problem and a drug culture and that education and the enforcement of the full rigours of the law on those importing drugs will go a long way to discouraging and ensuring that they are not freely available to young people and that it is not attractive for young people to use them.  I ask the Minister to convery that to the Minister for Justice because I had hoped she would be here today so that I could suggest that to her.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  The Gardaí and the Naval Service must be complimented for the tremendous and successful effort they have made in discovering the importation of drugs on the south-west coast in recent years.  It amazes me to hear people say that drugs are for sale and the price being paid for them.  What is being done about identifying those supplying them?  Surely some effort, or a better effort, should be made in that regard?  I listened to Senator Kelleher's good contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sometimes names are mentioned in towns.  I spoke out recently and said that not enough was being done on this question.  I believe there is a little discrimination here because names of well heeled people involved in the sale of drugs are being mentioned.  If they are <Col N="1395" /> involved, the law must be enforced against them.  We saw the impact the Road Traffic Act had because of the penalties which were being imposed.  I do not believe the penalties are severe enough in this area.  This is a serious problem in towns, villages and now rural areas.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Gardaí because there was a strategy to deal with this.  I wonder whether gardaí in small towns are trained to deal with this problem. That is something the Minister might take on board.  Recently I had experience of a young person who set up his own business as a haulier and he was doing well until he foolishly became involved with some dealers who asked him to bring in drugs.  I will not mention the area he is from but he is now behind bars, his business is gone and his family is devastated.  At least now we know this strategy is having an impact and people are being apprehended.</P>
    <P>I share the concern expressed in this motion that the spiralling levels of drug and substance abuse in its widest sense affect every community in the country, either directly or through related problems such as crime, vandalism, truancy or absenteeism.  The answer to the motion before the House is largely contained in <i>A Government of Renewal</i> which is committed to establishing a community drugs team incorporating counselling, medical treatment and rehabilitative support services.</P>
    <P>The Democratic Left has consistently argued for a preventative rather than a fire brigade approach to the problem of drug abuse and drug related crime.  In order to be effective, preventative measures must take place at the lowest possible level.  In this regard, I welcome the Government's community based approach which is reflected not only in the community drugs team, but also in the commitment to the extension of community policing.  The community is just one half of the equation, the other is jobs or, more accurately, the absence of jobs.  As pointed out by other speakers, 80 per cent of drug users seen at <Col N="1396" /> centres were unemployed.  That is a sad state of affairs.  The record shows that quite clearly.  Young people are vulnerable and it is sad that they have access to drugs.</P>
    <P>Figures provide further evidence of the incontrovertible link between unemployment, poverty and drug abuse.  Figures indicating ever increasing levels of crime, substance abuse and family breakdown are simply the cold statistics of social disintegration.  That disintegration has its roots in a system which in recent years has been prepared to tolerate nearly 300,000 on the live register and many more existing on the economic margins.</P>
    <P>It is no coincidence that the majority of drug users are drawn from the ranks of the unemployed and those unqualified. It is not a coincidence that 35 per cent of respondents in a recent survey cited curiosity, boredom or unemployment as reasons for taking drugs.  As a society we have consigned an entire generation to idleness.  Many of those who have been denied the opportunity to work have sought refuge in drugs. The proliferation in recent years of help lines and counselling services merely serves to mask the central problems of unemployment, poverty and disadvantage.</P>
    <P>Those living in Cork, Limerick and Dublin who are plagued by both drugs and drug related crime would be hard pressed to find a telephone box which has not been vandalised to call one of these hot lines.  We must look at areas where we have created ghettos with large numbers of unemployed people.</P>
    <P>Only those wearing political blinkers can now deny that economic deprivation and drug abuse are two sides of the same coin.  It is up to the Government to introduce and follow through on a package of measures aimed not only at sustainable job creation but also at raising the incomes of those without jobs by fully integrating the tax and social welfare systems and eliminating the poverty traps which have been a feature of recent years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1397" /> Fire brigade measures, such as detoxification and rehabilitative services, are undoubtedly necessary in the short term but in the long term the symptoms of social disintegration will continue to hit the headlines until its root causes, unemployment, poverty and disadvantage, are addressed.  The Government has already outlined many of its policies in this regard.  We now want these policies to be implemented.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate him on his reappointment.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator McGennis for raising this important subject this evening.  We all agree that the need for concerted action against the growing threat of drug misuse is now widely recognised not only in Ireland but in the international community.  The 1990s have been designated the United Nations decade against drug abuse.  As other Senators outlined, as well as suffering and death among drug addicts, drug abuse leads to increased levels of crime throughout society.</P>
      <P>It was estimated in 1992 that there were 40 million drug addicts worldwide, which is a huge figure.  Research has shown that there is no single cause of drug misuse or no one type of person who is likely to get involved in drug abuse.  Throughout the world drug abusers tend to be young people.  I was surprised to read that the majority of notified addicts are between 25 and 35 years of age.  I would have thought they would be older.  An increasing proportion are younger but maybe they do not become notified addicts until they are older.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The greatest fear for any parent must be that their child might become involved in drugs.  Any mother or father would feel that whatever else their child might become involved in or might do, at least they can reach them and help them.  However, once a child becomes a drug addict, one feels that they are beyond one's reach and that there is very little one can do to help them.  It <Col N="1398" /> must be a nightmare for any family to have a child involved with drugs.</P>
    <P>We know that drugs are available, as many Senators outlined, in our larger cities.  However, they are also available in towns and rural areas.  The Minister acknowledged that and said that the Garda were endeavouring to tackle the problem in rural areas.  Denying that the problem exists does nothing to help it and awareness is the first step in tackling it.</P>
    <P>I went to a lecture for parents in my children's school and I was absolutely horrified.  It was given by a member of the drugs squad.  He told us about the amount of drug abuse among young children and how freely available drugs are throughout the country.  It is absolutely frightening.  He showed us the various drugs, such as little transfers, which are taken.  Many parents and teachers find it extremely difficult to realise that children are on drugs.</P>
    <P>Drug addiction is found at all levels of society.  The ready availability of drugs, personality defects, poor home background, pressure from friends, poor relationships and lack of self-esteem, boredom and unemployment have all been found as factors which lead to drug abuse.  I welcome what the Minister said here about how the Government must direct its policy at the following main areas: education and prevention, which I think is number one; treatment and rehabilitation of drug addicts; co-operation with other countries in order to reduce supply from abroad; effective Customs and Garda enforcement and effective deterrents and domestic controls.</P>
    <P>As many Senators said, education is most important.  Publicity regarding prevention must be aimed mainly at young people.  It should be carried out in schools and by the local health boards. The dangers of children getting involved in drugs and the risk of AIDS must be highlighted to them.  Efforts to reduce the demand for drugs must be given a <Col N="1399" /> high priority.  Discouraging those who are not using drugs from so doing, as well as helping existing abusers to kick the habit, is most important.</P>
    <P>I welcome what the Minister said about how the Departments of Health, Education and Employment and Enterprise and the Garda must all be involved in the fight against drugs.  I was pleased to read in last Saturday's <i>Irish Independent</i> that the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, is bringing a plan before the Government shortly for the setting up of a super anti drugs umbrella group to spearhead the drive against big time traffickers, with financial aid from the European Union.</P>
    <P>Action to reduce demand for drugs includes health education aimed at the public, particularly young people.  We need an education and information campaign to discourage drug abuse.  It is vital that our young people are aware of the harmful effects of drugs and are given the knowledge, skills and attitudes necessary to resist the pressure which is on them to take drugs.  Schools and colleges must be encouraged to provide drug awareness education as part of their curriculum.  The dangers of heroin, the dangers of contracting and spreading HIV and AIDS through sharing injections and the risk of overdosing must be explained to young people.  We need publicity aimed primarily at young people and we have to use the media which young people use &mdash; television, radio, cinema and so on.</P>
    <P>In England and Wales the national curriculum now requires all primary and secondary teachers to educate pupils about the harmful effects of drug abuse. Similar steps have been taken in Northern Ireland.  We need a similar policy here.  The Minister outlined a pilot project entitled &ldquo;On My Own Two Feet&rdquo; which is being piloted by the Department of Health in conjunction with the Department of Education.  Is it proposed to extend that to all schools?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1400" /> In addition to education, the Government must give a commitment to improving and expanding drug treatment and rehabilitation centres.  I welcome the Minister's statement that the two satellite centres are going to open in the afternoons and that he has plans to open a further three in 1995 and a ten bed unit in Cherry Orchard Hospital. All of these must be welcomed as we have an estimated 7,000 heroin addicts in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that cannabis is the main problem in rural areas and that drug abusers in these areas do not tend to use intravenous drugs.  However, once children become involved with drugs it can lead on to harder drugs. Being aware of the potential dangers and difficulties and trying to prevent them is of major importance.</P>
    <P>Drug addiction is more than a physical and psychological problem.  Last September I read an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> where Fr. Cassin, who was involved in the Merchant's Quay programme which helps and advises drug addicts, explained how an addict would think.  He said that an addict would say &ldquo;Now that I have given up injecting and I am not robbing or borrowing, I am bored out of my tree&rdquo; and that with most addicts their whole lives are concentrated on getting the money to get their fix.  That uses up a huge amount of their energy and time and they need other avenues to engage their creativity. We have to follow on and provide training and other supports for them rather then leaving them to flounder when they come off the drug and are perhaps on methadone treatment.</P>
    <P>The spread of AIDS has increased our awareness of drugs.  Drug abusers are a major risk group for infection with HIV and AIDS through sharing needles, syringes and other injecting equipment.  As those infected can pass it on to other people, including their partners, and as mothers can pass it on to unborn children, it is essential that <Col N="1401" /> action be taken to curb the spread of the virus among drug users.  The risk of AIDS has made it even more urgent to reduce both the demand for and the supply of drugs and it must reinforce the Government's determination to tackle the problems.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, is strong enough to enable the Garda to tackle the proceeds of drugs crimes?  With regard to the initiative for GPs to get involved in prescribing methadone tablets, I know that the Protocol was issued last October or November but how successful has that been?  Are all GPs aware of this and what has been the response?  The Minister said that some of them were reluctant to get involved but I would like to know how successful it has been.</P>

      <P>I welcome the debate and congratulate Senator McGennis on bringing this very important issue before the House and giving us an opportunity to comment on it.  I also welcome the Minister of State and congratulate the Minister for Health who outlined to us the strategy and policies which the Government has initiated to control and combat this growing problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Findings show that not alone is there a serious problem of drug abuse in urban areas but that drugs are also readily available in rural areas.  The Minister referred to this during the course of his speech.  The research to which I will refer during the course of my presentation was conducted by the National Youth Council of Ireland in October 1994.  This research clearly kills the myth that the drugs problem is confined to urban areas.  It also shows that the popular myth that drug abuse is more a working class problem is just a myth &mdash; drugs do not recognise class barriers. The common bond between the young people interviewed in the survey was that most could get their hands on some <Col N="1402" /> drugs if they wanted to.  It did not matter where they lived, who they were or where they went to school.</P>
    <P>Young people today acquire information about drugs as they grow up. Some learn about drugs in school in a formal setting, some from talking to parents and some through the media. Drugs are prevalent, available and, in some cases, socially acceptable.  Young people know quite a lot about drugs &mdash; how available they are, where they are available &mdash; and usually have an idea about the cost and the side effects of individual substances.  They have a broad idea of the dangers of taking drugs, outside of the health problems to which I have already referred.  Young people consider cigarettes and alcohol to be in a very different category to illegal drugs.  Most young people do not consider cigarettes and alcohol as drugs, mainly because they are socially acceptable and easily available.  Initially, some people experiment with drugs from curiosity, particularly those who experiment with solvents, for example, sniffing glue, gases and petrol.  Others just do it for fun.  During the course of the survey, one person interviewed said: &ldquo;I just do it for the craic.  I took them out of curiosity at first and because I was bored. Now I take them because I like the feeling they give me.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Contrary to popular belief, young people are not being offered drugs by shady looking characters who hang around street corners.  They are far more likely to be offered drugs by friends and acquaintances.  The drug ecstasy has received the most media coverage.  It is usually produced in back street laboratories by amateur chemists. The tablet contains anything from heroin to toilet cleaner.  Ecstasy is no longer the most popular drug.  Heroin has picked up in popularity.  Young people start off by smoking it and when the habit becomes too much for them to afford, they start injecting it.  One person interviewed during the National <Col N="1403" /> Youth Council of Ireland survey said that if one is smoking heroin, it can cost up to £100 a day.  If they start injecting it, it comes down to approximately £40 a day.  The price of heroin on the streets in 1994 dropped dramatically.  A year before the price was around £40 for a quarter ounce.  It is now down to £20 a quarter ounce.  Young people are, therefore, finding heroin more accessible because it is cheaper.</P>
    <P>According to young people interviewed, school is a major drug supply point for many.  They say that parents and the Garda Síochána are not usually aware that drugs are so easily available. To put the matter in context, it was clear from the survey that the overwhelming majority, 78 per cent of young people questioned, did not use drugs.  However, bear in mind that this leaves 22 per cent, quite a high level, who used drugs. When those who did not use drugs were asked whether they would consider experimenting, almost one third answered that they would, while two thirds replied that they would not consider experimenting with drugs.  It is interesting to note that while almost 60 per cent of people interviewed had been offered drugs, only 12 per cent actually took drugs.</P>
    <P>The young people were also questioned as to why, in their opinion, young persons became involved with drugs.  A wide range of opinions were received. The overwhelming majority believed that peer pressure is the principle reason why young people become involved with drugs.  This fact in itself raises questions which must be addressed if society is to effectively increase awareness among young people about drugs.  It is also interesting to note that the frequency of the opinion that young people become involved in drugs from a sense of curiosity or a desire to experiment is quite high.</P>
    <P>The participants in the survey to which I refer were questioned as to <Col N="1404" /> whether they felt that young people were aware of the dangers of drug abuse.  The figures largely indicate that the respondents believed that young people were unaware of the dangers of drug misuse and also that there is insufficient information available to young people about drugs.  The young people were questioned as to whom they would go to for information or help if they had a problem with drugs.  A considerable number of young people felt they could confide in a wide range of people when it came to getting information about drugs and if they had a problem relating to drugs.  This is obvious from the high frequency of replies that mentioned doctors, teachers, friends or youth workers.  However, the fact that 12 per cent admitted in the survey that they did not know where to go for information is worrying.</P>
    <P>I thank the National Youth Council of Ireland.  I contacted them today for this research, which is not widely publicised. It is most interesting to have it on the record of the House and available to both the Departments of Health and Justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The picture painted by Senator Neville, the Minister and others is of a most depressing pattern in our society and not just in Ireland.  My observations will not be confined to the impact of this contamination on society in Ireland, but rather worldwide.  The growth of this infestation is quite frightening. For this reason, it is time, not just for Ireland but for the universal family of nations, to take a fresh approach to this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instead of reacting and trying to contain, prevent and police, we should take a new approach which ensures that the harvesting and supply of and profiteering from drugs will not be as it is now, exclusively in the hands of the criminal elements from start to finish. Perhaps because the fresh approach I suggest might be seen as somewhat risky <Col N="1405" /> and in some ways rather strange coming from me, I wish to make it clear that the best and perhaps the only guarantee to society is through families that have values, example to pass on to children, a sense of responsibility and a sense of reminding them of the difference between happiness and misery.  This is the best guarantee, but unfortunately there are families or units which do not have that sense of purpose.  There are some underprivileged in our society where the children do not get that direction. However, as Senator Neville pointed out, even those who come from secure homes are now at risk and this is why I wish to propound a new theme.</P>
    <P>As we turn into the new millennium, we are effectively looking at a drugs contaminated society worldwide.  We heard the evidence today and it is getting worse.  We can continue talking about it and trying to control it, but there is criminal exploitation from start to finish from those who sow, harvest and supply in places such as Colombia and many others to the supply lines across the world through Galicia in Spain and on through Europe.  Economies are controlled and undermined. States are controlled and undermined. Then we try to react to it in an inadequate way.  The people who organise this criminality are highly organised and ruthless, operating where they want, which is outside the law.  They are past masters at operating outside the law. We see the results with old people attacked in their homes by people craving a fix, young people contaminated and families undermined.  In some cases, such as Colombia, it is a characteristic feature of the economy.  They are, in truth, drug controlled and contaminated economies.</P>
    <P>The next stage is to control the supply lines to the major demand centres, which are, in particular, the congested and impoverished slums of the major cities.  I take the point that it is not now confined to the major cities, nor to those <Col N="1406" /> who are economically deprived; but they are the main targets and it spreads from there.  It corrupts everything in its path and contaminates even police forces as it makes its way from the supplier to the pitiful addict.  By controlling the supply, while at the same time ensuring ever increasing demand, these criminal drug barons, these contaminators of society, maintain the high price levels and the high profits and they live at a level which depends on the misery of others.  We complain and we try to react.</P>
    <P>Ireland cannot do this on its own, but it is time we recognised that the strategy of prevention rather than cure has failed.  The police are taking every action they can and still the problem grows.  Policing alone will not solve the problem.  Criminal control of all stages, right down to the ultimate misery of the pitiable and pitiful drug addict, is what we are looking at.  Are we going to break that control?  Will we and other states say that we are going to take some responsibility for regulating the supply to the pitiable and pitiful addicts?  It will be a matter of health rather than inadequate police reaction &mdash; I do not blame our police force; it does not matter how much they do, they cannot cope.</P>
    <P>Drug addicts will perpetrate the most savage and irrational acts to get what they require to feed their craving habit. We talk about the crime virus in our society which is a feature of our debates in recent years in Ireland and in other countries.  A friend of mine who served on a Californian drugs advisory board for a long time told me that he took the view that we must increase law enforcement measures to put them down and enforce the extra penalties, and I have supported that view in the House.  He reached the conclusion, and any research I have done since brings me to the conclusion, that it suits the criminal drug barons to operate outside the law. <Col N="1407" /> In this way they control and corrupt everything and everyone.</P>
    <P>In the days of the prohibition of alcohol we saw the control by the Mafia in Chicago and elsewhere because it was outside the law.  We see places, as I have mentioned, that are literally infested &mdash; Colombia, Galicia and now, unfortunately, some of our own communities.  It suits them so much to operate outside the law that sometimes they make anonymous subscriptions to those in the American legislatures in certain states who come out most hard line in treating them as criminals.  They know that the more that is said the safer they are in the prohibition shelter.</P>
    <P>For that reason, when we see what has happened, it is time that the states of Europe got together in a more realistic way.  We all have problems of addicts who need drugs.  We have addicts who crave drugs.  I welcome the start made in the South Eastern Health Board but it is not nearly enough.  If we want to take it out of their hands it is time that we say as a citizenry, on behalf of our children, our parents and the old people who will be attacked, that we are going to take responsibility in Europe and elsewhere, that we are going to arrange to have a supply regulated under licence through the agencies of the states to take this contamination out of our society.  That conclusion has been reached by people who have a lot more contact and experience of this problem than I could ever have.  It must now be regulated by law and by effective international co-operation, where the states will take responsibility rather than leave it to the criminal drug barons who are undermining our society.</P>
    <P>There are areas of this city involved which I will not mention &mdash; although if I did I am sure I would add nothing to the sum of knowledge of the police. Ecstasy is known as the &ldquo;gateway&rdquo; drug.  When young people lose their own sense of discipline in the best sense <Col N="1408" /> of the word &mdash; real happiness comes from having discipline about one's habits &mdash; and they concede to soft drugs or to ecstasy, they are then going through the gateway.  There are well known haunts in this city which conduct the rave parties, even in some hotels, in well known areas of this city, and young people who are not involved can tell parents of these places.  It is not good enough that we should stand back and watch people make profits in these places whether on the quays or the newly designated areas being developed under urban renewal programme.  That is a scandal.</P>
    <P>We need a new approach.  I encourage the Minister and the Government to force its European colleagues, the international community and the United Nations to agree from now on to take it on ourselves to regulate the control and distribution, and take it out of the hands of those who have contaminated our society.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister and I congratulate Senator McGennis and the other Fianna Fáil Senators for having brought this most serious of our social issues before the House.  The issue of in-patient beds under the control of the Eastern Health Board for the treatment of drug addiction, which Senator Doyle talked about, must be addressed urgently.  A total of ten beds &mdash; in fact it is usually only about seven beds &mdash; in Beaumont Hospital is utterly ridiculous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was on the Eastern Health Board when this proposal was brought up initially.  It took us years to get those beds in the hospital.  The Minister is now promising that shortly there will be another ten beds in the Cherry Orchard complex.  He says that they will be available in the spring of this year &mdash; the snowdrops will be coming up any moment so I hope the beds have been ordered and the staff are in position. Otherwise I may find myself in that <Col N="1409" /> great hospital in the sky in Tallaght before we get the ten bed unit.  It is appalling that there is a waiting list to get into hospital to be cured of drug addiction when one wants to get off drugs, or begin a cure, rather, because detoxification is also important.  I cannot stress how urgent this is.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the previous Minister for Justice, in her plans for the women's prison, was addressing the situation regarding detoxification units there. About 90 per cent of inmates in the women's prison are involved with drugs and are in prison because of petty crime, mainly shoplifting.  Without the facilities to get people detoxified while they are in prison we have no hope of getting them off drugs when they come out.  I hope that the present Minister for Justice will have this as part of her brief when she is looking at the plans for the women's prison.</P>

      <P>As you know, a Chathaoirligh, I have been requesting a debate on this issue since I was appointed to the Seanad.  It certainly was not tabled to obstruct, or indeed, to be mischievous to the new Government. I tabled this motion so the new Government would realise the serious problem which the people in Dublin in particular are facing.  There is a huge growth in drug abuse in every housing estate in Dublin.  I know that there was a drug pusher living for over two years in the estate which I lived in and during that period the Garda were unable to do anything about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The constituency that I represent is one of the fastest growing areas &mdash; I think the statistic has been quoted &mdash; in Europe for young people.  People in my area are very concerned and worried about the future.  As I stated in my contribution, I am also concerned about the future for this country unless we have a comprehensive strategy and approach <Col N="1410" /> to try to solve this problem.  As Senator O'Kennedy said, every country in the world has been trying to tackle this problem and has been unsuccessful, but we seem to have lagged seriously behind.  We seem to have made some inroads during the mid-1980s, but the problem with heroin abuse, ecstasy and other drugs is now way out of control.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply.  There were striking similarities in the points that I brought up and those in his reply and I certainly did not have sight of his speech.  I know he is indicating that he sees a need for a three tiered approach to this problem in terms of reduction of the supply and demand and the treatment available to those who are trying to get off the drug. However, in view of the fact that it has taken me two years to get this item on the agenda, there is now a need, as there have been numerous committee reports and monitoring groups, for this House to monitor whatever kind of progress is to be made in this area and to try to come up with positive suggestions for the future.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment.  I have no doubt that he will be a very effective Minister.  I would like to thank him for taking the time to come to the Seanad to answer this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conditions at University College Hospital, Galway, have now reached an intolerable situation.  The inadequacy of the casualty and x-ray departments, theatre facilities and the shortage of beds have led to a crisis situation arising <Col N="1411" /> at regular intervals.  For instance, 17 patients were detained in casualty overnight awaiting accommodation in the hospital last week.  This is now a normal feature of hospital procedure during periods of overcapacity.</P>
    <P>University College Hospital, which caters for counties Mayo, Galway and Roscommon, and indeed for patients from the wider western and north-western areas, was built in 1955 and has had no major extension or refurbishment since then.  It is not possible for a facility which was built 40 years ago to cater for today's modern medical requirements and the increased catchment area in the west.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments have refused to recognise the plight of University College Hospital, Galway.  My party, Fianna Fáil, must stand indicted for not giving priority to the hospital over the past five years.  I want to emphasise the point that I am not being political in regard to this problem; it is now far too serious.  Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party have failed so far.  Therefore, I want to be clear that I am not being political in this debate.  The Department of Health officials do not seem to appreciate the inadequacy of the hospital facilities and the urgency of proceeding with the proposed first stage of a development plan which has already been approved.  The plan, which has been in discussion for the past five years, involves the construction of a new casualty department, the expansion of x-ray and theatre facilities and the addition of 80 new beds.  Additional staff are required to operate existing equipment, which is under-utilised due to staff restrictions.</P>
    <P>I want a committment from the Minister this evening that the interim development plan which has been approved will be included in the 1995 work programme.  I would like the Minister to give the estimated cost of the work and if he would indicate to us when it is proposed to put the project to tender.  I am also anxious that the Minister would give us a committment on the planning of the major development plan <Col N="1412" /> for the hospital, which it is estimated will cost over £50 million.  This planning process, which will take a few years, should commence immediately.  University College Hospital has the distinction of having the highest bed occupancy in the country and the shortest turnover of patients, which indicates a very high level of efficiency.  However, we have major problems at this point in time.  It is for that reason that I have asked to raise this issue this evening.</P>
    <P>University College Hospital has no emergency theatre during daytime.  If there is an absolute emergency, a surgeon has to leave a theatre free for the emergency.  Other emergencies must wait until the elective list has been completed. This means that three to five emergency cases are dealt with each evening and late into the night.  Surgery on cases such as hand and facial injuries and cancer melanoma should be carried out once they are ready for theatre and should not have to wait for several hours before a theatre becomes free.  To cater for the workload of University College Hospital, a suite of ten new theatres should be made available.  The interim development plan provides only for two new theatres.  At present, theatre No. 3 has to be completely renovated and so, in effect, there is only one new theatre being provided for.  I want to emphasise that this is only an interim plan to deal with the emergency situation. A far larger development is needed for the long term.</P>
    <P>A major problem at present is the number of cancellations for elective surgery each day.  I am informed by consultants in the hospital that they calculate that surgery for up to 20 to 30 patients per day are now being cancelled. This is because there is not sufficient theatre and x-ray facilities or because consultants do not have the intensive care facilities for special care which is required after theatre.  Morale among the medical staff is now at an all time low.  They continually have the situation where operating lists are ready, special tests have been carried out, patients have been taken off drugs for <Col N="1413" /> their operations and all the preparations have been made for surgery but they have to be cancelled.  This leaves the medical staff frustrated and the duplication of work and time involved in rescheduling operations is causing much distress.</P>
    <P>In the past three to six months the situation has become more difficult and is now reaching the point of being impossible. I have been informed by a number of consultants that their patience is coming to an end.  They are concerned that patients are now becoming irritated by the number of cancellations and delays. It is clear that the community in Galway will not accept for much longer the crisis at University College Hospital.  For example, because of the smallness of the intensive care ward, a number of operations for ailments such as cancer of the stomach are continually being cancelled because there are no beds available in intensive care.  This makes patients feel that their lives are being threatened and they are in an extremely distressed state.</P>
    <P>The coronary care unit is far too small and inadequate.  One cardiologist located in the west is far from sufficient. Only one dermatologist serves the whole of the west, including the hospitals in Galway, Castlebar and Sligo.  There is a shortage of radiologists and consequently special x-ray equipment, which I mentioned earlier, costing £120,000, which is used to break down a stone in the kidney, can now only be used three hours each week.  Consequently, the two consultants in this area can only use this machine for an hour and a half each per week because there are no radiologists there to use it for the rest of the time.  Having this machine installed is a great waste of money.</P>
    <P>The casualty department is totally inadequate.  As I said earlier, patients must now stay in casualty awaiting beds almost every night; some 17 people were in casualty one night last week. The most recent development is that the ambulance trolley has to be left in casualty until a bed becomes available in the <Col N="1414" /> casualty unit while the ambulance waits outside until the trolley can be taken back out.  That is intolerable.  I wonder what would happen if we had a major disaster or catastrophe in Galway or the West given the situation in which the hospital is working at present.</P>
    <P>There is need for aftercare for geriatric patients who are not in a medical condition to be sent home.  Geriatric afterbeds must be opened immediately. I ask the Minister to take some initiative whereby some beds can be opened in Galway to deal with this urgent situation now.  We cannot wait until the plan I am asking to be put into place is completed, which will take a year to 18 months.  It is necessary that beds are opened immediately.  The feeling in the hospital is that unless beds are opened immediately in Galway, pending the construction of the interim development, the quality of health care will be seriously jeopardised.</P>
    <P>I now come to my final point, which is very important.  I welcome the appointment of Deputy Noonan as Minister for Health because he is a good man who will get things done.  However, I and many people in Galway were concerned recently after reading a recent interview with the Minister in <i>The Irish Medical Times,</i> in which he said the development of Limerick Regional Hospital would be completed during his term of office.  He mentioned that he would like to bring it up to the standard of Galway and Cork.  He should make sure he takes it to a higher standard than Galway.  I understand that this development is likely to cost £10 to £12 million.  While I wish Limerick the services it deserves, I am most anxious to hear from the Minister that Limerick will not get priority over Galway that the schedule of development which was in the Department will continue, that Galway will be given the top priority it had, that he will give a commitment that we can have this interim development which, I understand, will cost £4 to £5 <Col N="1415" /> million immediately, that we will get a commitment that it will start this year and that the planning for the major development can proceed, as it has been stopped for some time.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East)</i>: I also notice that the Senator realised immediately the way roles in this House change.  I accept he has to make a very strong case for University College Hospital, Galway, and I hope to respond in some manner to the demands he has identified.  It is also true that the Senator's party has been continuously in power for the last seven years.  While we have changed roles in the House, everything has not changed. We do not suffer from collective amnesia.  During that seven years there were three Fianna Fáil Ministers for Health and one Labour Minister for Health who was in partnership with Fianna Fáil in the last Government. That is worth putting on the record because people tend to forget these things.  I will treat demands made by the Senator on their merits but I do not accept any responsibility for the series of events which led to the circumstances he described.  The matter is my responsibility now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>University College Hospital, Galway, is the flagship hospital of the Western <Col N="1416" /> Health Board and provides an excellent hospital service to patients in the health board area.  I am aware that the hospital has been dealing exceptionally well with continuous pressure of demands for services. With a view to addressing the problems associated with these demands, the Western Health Board made a number of proposals to my Department for improvement of ward accommodation, additional theatres, improved accident and emergency services and additional X-ray requirements which it proposes to fund through sale of lands at Merlin Park which are surplus to its requirements.</P>
    <P>Following consideration of these proposals, a joint working party consisting of representatives of my Department and the Western Health Board was set up to examine the priority requirements of the hospital, to outline ways in which these requirements can be financed and to ensure that the developments proposed for the short and medium term will not jeopardise the long term development plans for the hospital.</P>
    <P>The proposals made by the working party were approved in principle by my Department in August last and have since been examined and clarified by the UCHG project team.  I understand that a draft planning brief is now being prepared.  It is expected that this will be agreed by the project team and submitted to my Department soon for formal approval, accompanied by a request for approval to appointment of a design team for the project.  The overall scope of the work proposed includes extensions to existing departments at UCHG as follows: four separate units of ward accommodation of 13-14 beds each, two additional X-ray rooms and ancillary accommodation, two additional operating theatres with ancillary accommodation and, in accident and emergency, extensions and alterations including observation beds.</P>
    <P>Subject to satisfactory progress it is expected that the design team selected <Col N="1417" /> could have the final planning documentation completed towards the end of the year.  I am glad to inform Senators that I hope to allocate funding in my Department's capital programme to meet the planning costs to be incurred for this project in 1995 which, I think, is the commitment the Senator was looking for tonight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his answer and I accept that the reply would probably not have been any different form the previous Government. It is very disappointing that no work will take place in 1995 and that we will still go through a planning stage.  I again ask the Minister in his new capacity to look at the urgency of the situation in Galway with a view to moving it forward so that, at least, planning can be completed and work commenced before the end of 1995.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>My motion for the Adjournment asks the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to include the submission by <Col N="1418" /> West Limerick Resources under LEADER II funding.</P>
    <P>West Limerick is a natural, unspoiled, rural area of approximately 520 square miles with a population of 52,000.  It is bounded on the north by the Shannon Estuary and on the south by the Mullaghareirk Mountains.  In general farm holdings are small, around 20 to 50 acres, with an average milk quota for all West Limerick of about 18,000 gallons of milk, dairying being the main occupation of farmers.  This has resulted in low incomes and severe under-employment. Tourism is under-developed in West Limerick with the area generally viewed as a &ldquo;passed through&rdquo; route with an insufficient base west of Adare village.  The 1986-91 census period showed an overall decline in population of 2,500 in the smaller towns and villages. This has resulted in village dereliction and a decline of parish structures.</P>
    <P>West Limerick Resources was incorporated as a company in 1993 and originated as the West Limerick development project in 1991.  The organisation has identified an area of particular problem between the N21 road and the Mullaghareirk Mountains and between the N21 and N69 routes.  The small villages and parishes of this area are suffering particular social deprivation.  Soils are poor for conventional farming.  Milk production has declined greatly in these areas and afforestation is proceeding in a rampant and often haphazard manner. The consequences are areas of increased rural isolation, with some homes now being practically surrounded by blocks of woodland.</P>
    <P>The programme proposes to maximise the existing tourism product and further develop the west Limerick tourism infrastructure to achieve maximum economic development through extensive marketing and pro-active innovation strategies in all areas of tourism. It is proposed to create a cultural environment conducive to the growth of existing and new business enterprise <Col N="1419" /> and entrepreneurship in west Limerick. These endeavours will contribute towards creating new employment in all sectors, improving local skills, developing local businesses and expanding the local community.  The programme will stabilise and maintain the rural sector and will ensure the long term viability of rural communities in a rapidly changing agricultural sector to combat under-employment and exploit the natural advantage of the estuary and rivers in west Limerick.</P>
    <P>The programme aims to enhance the awareness of the heritage and culture of the area by focusing on historical sites, buildings, traditional music and dance, the performing and visual arts, collection of traditional folklore and landscape heritage.  An important aspect of the plan is to improve the physical structure and services and so create an environment to address the stagnation of growth in towns and villages and reverse the loss of population in rural areas.  The programme, when implemented, aims to initiate transnational linkages exploiting existing twinning arrangements in west Limerick with areas of other EU member states.  It will also support and participate in regional transnational initiatives in co-operation with Shannon Development.</P>
    <P>With its application for LEADER II funding, West Limerick Resources submitted detailed strategies which it aims to bring into effect during the next four years, the objectives of which are set out.  The principal objectives of the programmes set out are to maintain and strengthen the community fabric in the area, to improve the quality of life, to diversify the local economy so as to provide greater employment opportunity, and to provide income, thus creating the basis for a viable self-sustaining community with strong population generation. They also seek to encourage local initiatives and urge communities in different towns, villages and areas to <Col N="1420" /> improve and develop their own areas, to act as a co-ordinating focus for the various initiatives at local level as well as for possible future developments in west Limerick, and to act in a facilitating role to provide much needed access to economic and social development of a material and guidance nature.</P>
    <P>The total estimated cost of the proposed measure is £6.586 million, with £2.117 million coming from private sources, £761.500 coming from public sources such as county enterprise board schemes, Shannon Development schemes, county council village renewal schemes and so on.  The proposed contribution from LEADER is $3.707 million. The measure will create the following jobs: 160 full-time jobs, 200 part-time jobs, 130 indirect jobs and 200 temporary jobs during construction &mdash; a total in all of 690 jobs.  I would ask the Minister to consider favourably this vital programme under LEADER II which will reverse the decline in the area in which I live.</P>

I served my apprenticeship in the Seanad and spent some enjoyable years here in the company of Senators Kiely and Fallon.  I have great respect for this House and its Members.  At times I feel that you do not get the recognition, attention and credit for the important business that is transacted here.  I hope the Seanad will be elevated and recognised for its importance.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator Neville for raising this matter.  I should point out that over the past two weeks both Deputy Michael Finucane and Senator Kelly requested me to meet with this group and I hope to meet with them as soon as possible.  I recognise that Senator Rory Kiely also expressed his personal interest in this submission to me over the past few weeks.  Collectively, the representatives of west Limerick are very interested and supportive of the submission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset I would like to assure Senator Neville of my commitment to the LEADER programme and my recognition of the major contribution which the programme has made in rural Ireland.  I am well aware of the problems of rural areas generally.  In recent times, both here and throughout Europe, the rural areas have been marked by a continuing decline in the importance of agriculture in the rural economy and in the numbers employed <Col N="1422" /> there, depopulation of many rural areas and fragmentation of the rural economy.</P>
    <P>As this House knows, the last few years have seen unprecedented changes in the political and economic landscape of Europe.  Here and in other parts of the EU where agriculture plays a vital economic role, the reform of the CAP has had a marked impact on our rural areas and their capacity for development. The new GATT agreement, bringing as it does increased competition, will be a further contribution to economic change.  The enlargement of the EU on 1 January last and the virtual certainty of further enlargement in time, provide not only another source of market competition but increased demand for the available resources to implement structural and other EU policies.</P>
    <P>In the past rural development policy was virtually synonymous with agricultural policy.  However, against the background I have painted, the task of the EU and national governments is to devise and implement programmes that enable the rural community to thrive and prosper.  Significant progress has been made.  In the last round of Structural Funds, my Department implemented an operational programme for rural development which, among other things, contained measures for encouraging farm diversification, agri-tourism and the promotion of small and community enterprises.  There was also, of course, the LEADER I programme under which 16 local groups were aided to implement business plans devised by them and whose areas covered about half the country.  Some £35 million of public funding, including £21 million from the EU, has been used to good effect over the past three years or so by these groups, coupled with a similar amount in private investment.</P>
    <P>The independent evaluation of the programme indicated that LEADER had been successful in terms of achievement of its objectives, the enormous <Col N="1423" /> commitment of board members, support structures and local communities, the dedication and enthusiasm of its management, the positive and constructive relationship between the groups and my Department and the support and participation of the State agencies and local authorities.</P>
    <P>In the new round of Structural Funds now under way, my Department's operational programme for agriculture, rural development and forestry contains further measures in support of farm diversification.  Rural development will of course also benefit significantly from other mainstream operational programmes, including those relating to tourism, industry, economic infrastructure and local urban and rural development.</P>
    <P>The LEADER programme will continue to play a central role in Government's rural development policy and substantially increased funding will be available for the new LEADER round. The EU has already committed funding of £54 million and this will be topped <Col N="1424" /> up with a significant national Exchequer contribution.  We are well advanced in our preparations.</P>
    <P>The operational programme for the implementation of LEADER II throughout the country has been submitted to the European Commission for approval and negotiations are well advanced.  In the meantime with the assistance of independent consultants I am evaluating the 48 business plans of the applicant groups including the application from West Limerick Resources Limited.  I hope to be in a position to make announcements about the successful groups in the next six to eight weeks.</P>
    <P>I thank both Senator Neville and Senator Kiely for raising this matter tonight and presenting the argument very forcibly and constructively.  I am confident that a very effective and productive LEADER programme will be put in place in west Limerick.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 26 January 1995.</P>
