      <P>I have received notice from Senator Maloney that, on the Adjournment of the House today, he wishes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to make funding available as a matter of urgency to Donegal County Council in 1995 for the upgrading of the fire stations in Milford, Buncrana and Letterkenny.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Enright on the following matter:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he will register the births of persons (details supplied) in the Foreign Births Register.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Wall on the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to outline the action she intends to take on foot of the report on the code of practice for safety at sports arenas 1991 and the concern of all sporting organisations at this inaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1590" /> I have also received notice from Senator Kelly of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to examine the possibility of transferring the Garda responsibility for Croom and adjoining areas (County Limerick) from Askeaton to Limerick city.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Roche on the following matter:</P>
    <P>Recognising the widescale concern that exists throughout the country, but in particular, on the east coast at the ongoing operations of British Nuclear Fuels at Windscale, Sellafield, the need for the Government to publicly support, fund and seek to join in the further legal actions against BNFL's THORP plant at Sellafield.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Farrelly on the following matter:</P>
    <P>To ask the Minister for the Environment when he intends to allocate funds for the provision of a new fire station at Kells, County Meath.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senators Maloney's and Enright's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business as announced is agreed to.  In the light of last week's High Court decision, perhaps the Leader would find time for the House to discuss its concerns in relation to Sellafield and THORP some time after Easter.  The Leader is aware of the <Col N="1591" /> desire of the House to discuss the banking system and banks.  It is appropriate to raise this today given the statement in AIB's annual report in relation to salaries and wages.  It is difficult for customers and small business people to understand the wages being paid to the five executives.  Not too many people get a lottery cheque each week but they seem to have arranged that.  It would be appropriate to debate the banking system after Easter.</P>

      <P>The White Paper on education will be published in the next fortnight or three weeks.  I would like a commitment that we will debate the White Paper, which has political and educational implications at every level, in the first week of May because this House could do it more justice than most places.</P>

      <P>A matter I raised last week and the week before, but to which I did not get a reply, relates to the publication of the report of the expert committee on hepatitis C by the Minister for Health.  The Minister has had the report for almost two months.  I met with some members of Positive Action last week and they are concerned about the delay in publishing the report.  I ask the Leader if it would be possible for the Minister for Health to come to the House to debate issues in the health area, particularly in relation to the VHI. the difficulty with the independent hospitals and GPs soon after Easter.</P>

      <P>Could a debate be initiated on the aftermath of the peace process in Northern Ireland?  There is much talk about gardaí being removed from the Border counties.  In Donegal we have special concerns because of the recent drugs finds off the Cork coast and in Dublin port last week.  The northwest coastline is very vulnerable and we are concerned that gardaí should remain <Col N="1592" /> in the county at current strength.  Can we have a debate on this shortly?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's request for a discussion on the White Paper on education.  One aspect of it which is of great concern to schools is the new leaving certificate applied programme.  Principals of various schools are concerned about this new pilot scheme.  They are trying to organise their timetables but, as yet, they do not know when it will come on stream, what is happening or what kind of schools will be selected.  That programme should come on stream very quickly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to a report in one of the Sunday newspapers which I felt had not been properly researched and reflected badly on the former Government Whip in this House.  We are aware of the commitment given by the Government Whip over the last two years.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges should put this matter on the agenda because such reports should be balanced and should take into consideration Members, such as the Leader and the Whips, who are given the responsibility of running the House.  The public must be concerned by such a report which reflects badly on Members.  Since that paper is published once a week, would it be appropriate that the wages of the Journalist concerned be divided by 52 as he attempted to do with the sitting days of Seanad Éireann?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>We should have a debate on Foreign Affairs in view of what is happening in Burundi.  The situation there is on the boil and we are getting conflicting reports from various aid organisations and the Government out there, as well as the UN and the EU. We also need an urgent debate on what is happening in Bosnia-Herzegovina where a war of attrition is going on. <Col N="1593" /> Europe is doing absolutely nothing, apart from making a statement on the odd occasion which achieves nothing.  A couple of weeks ago when Kuwait was threatened with another invasion, the United Nations was able to get 50,000 troops together within 12 hours to make certain that invasion did not take place. The United Nations and the EU have done nothing about Rwanda, Burundi or the central European states.  We must have an urgent debate on those matters.</P>
      <P>I also want to mention the banks. Before Christmas I requested a debate on the banks.  Companies, such as AIB or any other bank, should not tell us how to manage our businesses and then go over the top with the salaries they give themselves.  This is a matter of concern. However, on the same day they gave concessions to farmers in terms of over-production of milk and said they would give them preferential treatment &mdash; 2.5 per cent less than AA rates.</P>

      <P>Senator Lanigan, you are making a speech.  You have asked for a debate on the banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Leader arrange such a debate?  I suggest to AIB and the other banks that the proper interest rate for all customers should be 2.5 per cent less than the AA preferential rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with all the remarks made by Senator Finneran with possibly one exception.  I would not dignify the article by referring it to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. This House, of all the institutions of State, has consistently invited the press to observe and report on our deliberations and I am sure that one of the organisations that did not take up that invitation was the <i>Sunday Tribune.</i> Yet it published an article which is a most disgraceful piece of journalism in so far that it is so inaccurate as to be laughable.  The photograph of Tom Raftery, a distinguished former Member of <Col N="1594" /> this House, was published and it was said that he is a sitting Member.  This shows how ill-researched that article was.  Fulsome tribute was paid to the former Leader of the House and the Chief Whip for the way they kept this House running; it is no easy job.  The press and public ought to know the difficulties that Leaders and Chief Whips have trying to ensure that this House gets proper attention, irrespective of the Government in office.  This article is disgraceful. I would concur with every word of Senator Finneran, but I would not dignify it by reporting it to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  It is a silly piece of journalism and the journalists involved might grow up at some stage.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Wright's statements on the banks, with this difference.  There have been many discussions in this House on a number of issues but unless we have a structured and focused discussion on the banking system, nothing concrete will happen.  I strongly suggest that the Leader convene a meeting of the Whips, decide on a debate on banking and structure it so that each Senator would make their contribution in a focused way.  When we are dealing with an institution that touches everybody's life, for good or for ill, a focused debate is needed.  I ask the Leader to convene such a meeting of the Whips.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with what was said about the article in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> but it should not surprise anybody. When I was involved in the committee of the Peace Train some years ago, a leading article in that newspaper chided me for daring to say I was an elected public representative and it analysed the methods of election to the Seanad.  The whole article was entirely inaccurate.  I sent a letter in reply, faxed it, had it delivered by courier and hand delivered it to the newspaper.  Whatever about Vincent Browne's much vaunted right of reply, not a titter of what I had <Col N="1595" /> to say &mdash; because it made mincemeat out of him intellectually &mdash; ever appeared in the paper.  I cannot recommend that Senator Wright, or anybody else, use the right of reply in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> because I gather that it is operated at the discretion of its editor.</P>
      <P>I would be very happy to support a call for a debate on the banking system; it is long overdue.  As far as I am concerned, banks are simply shops that sell money and they should be regulated in the same way and not be treated with any greater respect that any other shop or group of shopkeepers.  It is very offensive that senior bank executives should pay themselves as an increase multiples of what most ordinary decent working people can expect for an annual income.</P>
      <P>Is it possible to have a debate on the consequences for this country of the latest debacle in the beef industry, namely, the fine of £75 million because of the activities in our beef industry in previous times?  This seems to be another horrible example of punishing the victim. Why should the Irish taxpayer have to pay for the wrongdoings of the beef industry, particularly when, I understand, that one of the companies principally involved is currently suing the State for £200 million?  We are being got at in every possible way.  As public representatives, we have a responsibility to act as a watchdog in the interests of the public.  I do not see why the taxpayer should be made the victim in this case and I hope there can be a debate on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise three specific items, one of which concerns banking. I support the suggestions made by previous Senators, particularly Senator Magner, for the need to have a structured debate on banking.  I would like to discuss bank charges, making them transparent and itemising them on accounts.  Many people who have bank <Col N="1596" /> accounts are being ripped off in that regard.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to possibly make time to discuss the Western European Union, our preparation for the 1996 intergovernmental conference and the long term implications for Ireland's neutrality.  A debate on that set of issues in the Seanad would be ideal as a way of opening the wider debate among the public.  Preparations for the intergovernmental conference are well under way in the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The Government has decided on certain lines of action.  A public debate would be important because we will end up with a referendum where people will take extreme views which could be damaging and inimical to the interests of the State.</P>
      <P>I would also like a debate, as early as possible after we resume, on the implications of what I regard as an extraordinary Government decision on the collection of service charges.  Service charges are a form of taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was mentioned last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>It was but I ask that we examine and discuss its implications, particularly in so far as it relates to the discretionary funding of local authorities. If the Leader wanted to extend it to a general debate on the financing of local authorities, I do not think there would be any objection from any side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on banking and bank charges. The people concerned have given themselves massive increases while the majority of those who work for them are full-time temporaries.  Focusing the debate will give real meaning to what Members say and I welcome that.  I also support Senator Norris's call for a debate on the proposed beef fines.  I do not believe anybody in this House, or, <Col N="1597" /> indeed, the majority of people in this country, wants the taxpayer to be levied with a bill in which they did not have any act or part.  Having listened to the comments locally over the last few days, I believe it would be horrendous if this was the case.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate here when we resume because it would be worthwhile and we would get the views of many Members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House if it would be possible for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to make a statement here on the future prospects of Shannon Aerospace. The Leader will be aware that Shannon Aerospace is a recently established company and over 700 jobs are now at risk.  This was a joint venture between Lufthansa, Swiss Air and Guinness Peat Aviation in which Shannon Free Airport Development Company invested in excess of £20 million.  It now looks as if the future of the company is threatened and there is a likelihood that jobs will be lost there.  There is an urgency about this as decisions will be made before the end of this month.  May we have an opportunity to hear the views of the Minister and discuss this serious problem? If the company closes down, a large number of jobs will be lost and this will have a major impact on the local area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Every now and then there are urgent calls for a debate on currency. This usually occurs when there is a crisis in the currency market.  We should have a debate on currency when there is not a crisis.  It appears that there is not a crisis at the moment &mdash; fingers crossed.  Some weeks ago, there were calls for such a debate and I suggested that was the wrong time.  I now suggest that the Leader of the House consider the possibility of a debate on currency when there is not a crisis and when there is less danger to the volatility of <Col N="1598" /> the currency from things that may be said here.</P>
      <P>I was delighted to hear Senator Norris refer to bankers as just shopkeepers.  I am sure he meant it as a compliment. We are due to discuss the Consumer Credit Bill in this House shortly.  That is when we will have the opportunity to speak about banking.  If the Bill is not discussed in the immediate future, we could have an opportunity to speak about banking on a different occasion. To the best of my knowledge, the Consumer Credit Bill will provide the perfect opportunity to discuss many issues, including bank charges and how they will be examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader if it would be possible to have a debate on Burundi in the near future.  Over 400 people were massacred there in the last few days.  Tanzania has closed its borders having already accepted over 700,000 refugees.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State are anxious about this matter, but we should arrange a debate on how best we could be of assistance, whether at UN or governmental level.</P>
      <P>I am pleased about the call for a debate on banking.  I agree with Senator Magner that a structured debate should be arranged by the Whips.  I do not want a debate where Senators make contributions off the top of their heads.  Time and care are needed when preparing for this debate.  There are many problems with the banks with regard to charges, etc.  However, it is important that we try to be constructive and it would be most desirable to hold the debate as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Lower House put a number of good reforms in place recently.  There was also a good debate in this House on reform of the Seanad.  In view of impending difficulties, there should be a debate on the Presidency, not on the President herself. <Col N="1599" /> This is a democracy and we should be free to debate this matter in view of the various implications of the expanding role of the Presidency.</P>

      <P>I may be out of order but I thank Senators for their comments on the article in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> in so far as they referred to me.  I resent the implication in the article that I was indifferent or negligent in relation to my Seanad duties.  I intend to respond to it but, in view of Senator Norris's experience, I may by wasting my time.  Nevertheless, I will have a go.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to Senator Wright's point, there will be a debate on Sellafield soon after Easter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Senators asked for a debate on banking.  Eyebrows were raised when the rate of emolument to top people in AIB was announced.  I take Senator Magner's and Senator <Col N="1600" /> Roche's point that this debate should be structured.  I will call a meeting of the leaders of the different groups, or their nominees, before the end of this week to arrange a structure for the debate.</P>
    <P>With regard to the matter raised by Senator O'Toole, I have a commitment from the Minister for Education that as soon as the White Paper is published, she will begin an open and comprehensive debate in the House; I expect that will be in the first week of May.</P>
    <P>I spoke to the Minister for Health about the matter raised by Senator Honan.  He will come into the House shortly after Easter but there are legal difficulties which he must sort out first. However, he is aware of the concern expressed by the Senator.  He will come into the House to make a comprehensive statement on this matter and, I hope, other health issues soon after Easter.</P>
    <P>Senator Maloney raised Border issues.  This ties in with a point made by a number of Senators last week about cross-Border initiatives.  I spoke to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and he will come into the House after Easter to discuss this and related issues.</P>
    <P>Senator Ormonde made a point about education which I have already covered. Senator Finneran raised the issue of the article in the newspaper last Sunday. I agree that it was an extraordinarily badly researched and ill-informed article which showed no understanding at all of the practical workings of the House.  It was unfair in particular to the then Government Chief Whip.  Government Leader and Leas-Chathaoirleach. I, in common with Senator Norris, would not dignify it by referring it to Committee on Procedure and Privileges. The journalist did not do his reputation any good with an article which was superficial and uninformed.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan, Senator Enright and Senator Roche mentioned foreign affairs.  I said on a number of occasions that it is not possible to have a series of <Col N="1601" /> separate debates on this issue.  I propose to call together the ten Seanad members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs to see if we can set up a foreign affairs forum which would meet here at regular intervals to discuss a range of foreign affairs issues in a way that does not replicate what the joint committee is doing but which gives Members an opportunity to raise matters of concern. I will call a meeting shortly of the ten members of the joint committee to ensure we do not replicate what they are doing.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris and Senator Farrelly raised the issue of the beef fines.  We would all like to discuss this matter and have further information on it.  I am not sure how best to do that but I will try to find a means to explore that issue.</P>
    <P>Senator Roche raised the question of service charges.  It is probably not best to discuss them in isolation but a discussion of local government finance is of concern to all and we may have that after Easter.</P>
    <P>I share Senator Daly's sense of urgency about Shannon Aerospace and I will contact the Minister after the Order of Business to see if we can arrange a discussion.  I suspect negotiations are at a delicate stage at present but I will inform the Senator of the outcome.</P>
    <P>Senator Lydon raised the issue of the Presidency and it was ruled out of order. Senators are aware there will be a major review of the Constitution soon and it will first involve experts and then Members of the Oireachtas.  It will allow Members to put forward their views about the functioning of and possible changes in the Presidency.</P>

      <P>My amendment asked for the rates to be brought into line with the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare.  I know the issue has been debated <i>ad nauseam</i>, as it was described by the Social Affairs Committee.  I had hoped, in view of the Minister's statements at his party's recent conference, that the social welfare increases were inadequate, that there would have been a Government amendment to this section calling for greater increases to be provided.  We believe that any social welfare increases which are not at least in accordance with inflation are totally unacceptable. That is why I tabled an amendment, which has been ruled out of order.  I ask the Minister even at this late stage to suggest to his colleagues that a 2.5 per cent increase is totally inadequate.</P>
      <P>It has been pointed out already &mdash; and we will point it out in subsequent amendments &mdash; that although child benefit and other increases are welcome, only those who receive them will benefit.  All other recipients will receive increases of only 2.5 per cent.  I will be asking the Minister for clarification on other sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to a parliamentary question by Deputy Joe Walsh in January 1995 the Minister said the estimated cost of <Col N="1603" /> increasing social welfare personal rates to the levels recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare would be about £60 million this year and £136 million in a full year.  These rates would not provide the necessities of life for the unfortunate people concerned.  In good economic times there is a possibility that they could be given substantial increases to bring their payments into line with those recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, my amendment has been ruled out of order and there is no corresponding Government amendment. We will air this issue throughout the debate on the Bill.  We will not support this section as we find these increases paltry.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister. I have always felt that we should not be afraid of using another term in place of &ldquo;social welfare&rdquo;.  A report will be issued by the special committee on taxation and social welfare.  The Minister should consider not only changing the structure of the social welfare system but of using another term in place of &ldquo;welfare&rdquo;.  We should refer to &ldquo;social services&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;social welfare&rdquo; and not apologise for doing so.  We have been using the word &ldquo;welfare&rdquo; for too long.  We should be more customer friendly.  We use the word &ldquo;welfare&rdquo; in relation to 800,000 adults and 600,000 children.  I do not like this word and we should not be afraid to change it.</P>

      <P>Perhaps you will. I refer to the comments of Senator Kelleher about the general increase in social welfare.  The Senator is right; I said at the weekend conference of my party, Democratic Left, that our general social welfare payments are grossly inadequate.  I also said that some weeks earlier during Question Time in the Dáil when the Senator's party's spokesperson asked me about the Commission on Social Welfare's recommendations.  I also said it very vociferously when I was in Opposition and I will maintain that position until such time as I think our payments are sufficient to help people to keep body and soul together, and not to just survive but in a way which gives them dignity.</P>
      <P>The Commission on Social Welfare published its report in 1985 in which it made around 60 recommendations on a range of aspects of the social welfare code and how we deliver it.  It particularly addressed the question of poverty and made a number of recommendations in relation to our levels of social welfare.  It estimated in 1985 that, on the basis of the personal rate of social welfare, an income of between £50 and £60 a week would be just about adequate to help people survive.</P>
      <P>In addition, it regarded a number of the social welfare payments as so far behind that target level that it recommended, as a matter of priority, that all rates should be immediately increased to £45 per week.  It took Governments from then until last year to reach the priority rate, not the main recommended rate.  In updated financial terms, the weekly rate was £45 in 1985 and about £59 last year.  The commission felt that those priority rates should have been implemented within about 12 months but it took more than eight years to reach that target.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, the commission's other main recommendation was a weekly rate of between £50 and £60.  It pointed out that it had no absolute criteria by <Col N="1605" /> which poverty or the level at which a payment would be adequate could be measured because of the wide range of circumstances in which people find themselves; whether they are living in a local authority house or in private rented accommodation, alone, with an elderly parent, with children, as single or widowed parents.  It also identified other factors which relate to poverty, such as the standards of housing, education and training.  These all contributed to the assessment of poverty.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point the Senator made about the actual level of social welfare payments, the commission recommended between £50 and £60 a week.  In today's money terms that would be approximately £66 to £79 per week.  Increasing all our social welfare payments, across the board, to the lower range of that figure &mdash; £66 per week &mdash; would cost approximately £140 million a year.  If we were to aim for the higher range of £79 per week &mdash; and I do not think anybody would argue that £79 is a princely sum, it would still be barely adequate &mdash; would mean finding an extra £700 million a year.  Therefore, it involves a significant amount of money.</P>
    <P>When spokespersons for Fianna Fáil addressed this issue in the Dáil, they argued that the Government was spending and borrowing too much and that it had a budget deficit.  It cannot be argued, on the one hand, that we should spend between an extra £140 million and £700 million and, on the other hand, that too much money is being spent or borrowed or that there should not be a budget deficit.  Fianna Fáil must make up its mind as to what it wants.  Does it want additional spending on social welfare or not?</P>
    <P>A comparison of the increase in the provision for social welfare which I negotiated in the budget with the increase negotiated last year by the then Fianna Fáil Minister for Social Welfare demonstrates that there is an increase of 35 per cent this year.  I negotiated in excess of an extra £90 million for this year alone, or an increase of £212 million in a full year.  In addition, I negotiated <Col N="1606" /> a further £200 million to pay the equality arrears to the 70,000 women who had been denied their rights since 1979.  It is, therefore, unreasonable for Fianna Fáil to complain, on the one hand, that we are spending too much money and, on the other hand, that we are not spending enough.  The two ends cannot be argued against the middle in this way while retaining any kind of credibility.</P>
    <P>Of the sum of £212 million in a full year which I negotiated, I applied £103 million to child benefit.  The Senator argued correctly that child benefit is fine for those with children.  It is directed specifically towards families with children, because that is where the greatest threat and risk of poverty exists in our society and all academic and expert research proves this.  Time after time reports have been produced which indicate that if poverty is to be tackled in a fundamental way in Irish society, substantial resources must be directed to families with children, and we have done this in the budget.</P>
    <P>The Senator makes the point wrongly &mdash; perhaps because he has not read the detail of the budget &mdash; that apart from those who get child benefit, everybody else must settle for an increase of 2.5 per cent.  The predicted rate of inflation is 2.5 per cent and the increase, therefore, protects people's income in that respect. I have not made any case that the increase is sufficient.  If welfare payments were to be increased to the level which I believe is desirable &mdash; which is the top range recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare &mdash; the rate of increase would be 33 per cent, not 3 per cent, the amount proposed by the Leader of the Opposition in the Dáil.  The difference between an increase of 2.5 per cent and 3 per cent would amount to an extra 30p per week so there is no valid argument in this proposal.</P>
    <P>To say that all those not in receipt of child benefit must settle for an increase of 2.5 per cent is incorrect.  Every young person living at home who qualities for unemployment assistance will now get a <Col N="1607" /> minimum of £25 per week.  This is a major move forward in terms of keeping families together.  Under previous budgets the payment amounted to £10 per week and much concern was expressed at the fact that young people were driven out of their homes because they were assessed to receive such small amounts of money when they applied for unemployment assistance.  The extra funding represents an increase of 150 per cent, not 2.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>The students' summer job scheme has been increased by 11 per cent &mdash; from £540 to £600.  Students may also complete their jobs in six weeks, if they wish, and still earn money in a job, if they have one, for the remaining time without any obligation to remain idle.  In addition, any student who can show that their parents are dependent on social welfare may get an additional bonus of £200 on top of the £600.  This is another example which shows that not only those who have dependent children will benefit.</P>
    <P>There are other examples of social welfare payments, such as the carer's allowance and certain categories of old age pension payments, which have also been increased.  In addition, free travel has been extended to Northern Ireland and coloured television licences have also been extended to those who previously only qualified for black and white television licences.  If one honestly assessed the range of other improvements in this budget one would say this was a good social welfare budget.  To concentrate on the general increase of 2.5 per cent is a distortion of what we have done this year to seriously tackle poverty.</P>
    <P>As regards the term &ldquo;welfare&rdquo;, I have the same reservations about it but I have not found an alternative phrase. Perhaps we could call the Department of Social Welfare the Department of Social Affairs, but we could not use that as a title for payments.  I am not averse to finding a more user friendly phrase in terms of how we define what we are doing.</P>

      <P>It is stimulating to hear the Minister for Social Welfare mention budget discipline and financial responsibility and justify the meagre increases in the Social Welfare Bill, 1995; he said he had not made a case that it was sufficient.  It is inconsistent and hypocritical to attempt to justify those meagre increases and to mention budget discipline and financial regulations in the lecture I have just heard. If he does not make the case that it is sufficient, is he implying that his partners of the left in Government, the Labour Party, frustrated him in his attempt as Minister for Social Welfare to provide what is sufficient?</P>
      <P>Far from making the case that it is sufficient, I understand that at his weekend conference he almost apologised for the fact that he was not in a position to provide what was sufficient.  One of the commentators covering that conference summarised it well when she said that nothing short of a bid by Fine Gael to abolish old age pensioners would prise the Democratic Left away from power. That party has a distorted representation in Government, with four of its six members in power.  It is clear they have their priorities right in terms of security of employment and the benefits they intend to apply and the targets are the members of the Democratic Left in Government.</P>

      <P>I will speak to the section but it was the Minister who spoke in terms of the financial realities and disciplines within which the Government must operate and I am entitled to address it on the same basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to contrast the miserable approach of the Labour Party and Democratic Left &mdash; both are equally culpable &mdash; and what they are doing in Government with what they demanded consistently, loudly and aggressively when they were in opposition.  I was a member of the Fianna Fáil Government in 1987 which cut back the current public <Col N="1609" /> expenditure increase to 4 per cent.  It was a huge reduction on the pattern of public expenditure in previous years. Day in and day out this Minister and his colleague in Government, the Tánaiste, attacked us consistently for what they saw was our heartless, unpitying approach to the needs of those whom we were primarily charged to protect, namely, the less well off and those on social welfare.  Those debates in the Dáil are on the Official Record.</P>
    <P>It is unthinkable and the essence of hypocrisy to hear the Minister now.  He is the Deputy who daily attacked the Fianna Fáil Government which established the basis for the regulation of this economy.  Lest it be thought that I am not according due credit to another party, the attitude of Fine Gael under its then leader, Deputy Alan Dukes, was helpful and played no small part in bringing about the total revamping and restructuring of our economy.  This Government, in which this Minister serves as Minister for Social Welfare, can now reap the benefit of a healthy economy.  However, what is the Government doing?</P>
    <P>In that particular budget there was a 4 per cent increase in public expenditure. We stayed well within the 4 per cent limit, as the outturn from 1987 clearly shows.  With that level of increase in public expenditure the Fianna Fáil Government was able to provide an increase of at least 3 per cent across the board in social welfare.  Those are the facts.  As the old Latin maxim says <i>res ipsa loquitur</i>, the facts speak for themselves.  The Irish have another way of putting it: beart de réir do bhriathar or action to match one's words. However, in this case we have heard the words but the action is entirely inconsistent and hypocritical.  The 8 per cent increase in public expenditure proposed by the Government gives the wrong signal to potential investors in this economy. That can be seen already in terms of pressure on interest rates and speculation <Col N="1610" /> on our currency.  It will be, unfortunately, a continuing feature&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;as long as the parties of the left are there with their programmes for spending and not targeting such spending on those who need it.</P>
      <P>I make the confident prediction &mdash; and I welcome being tested by events &mdash; that inflation will not remain at the projected increase of 2.5 per cent which the Minister for Social Welfare suggests will be the pattern this year.  He says that the social welfare classes are receiving a 2.5 per cent increase in line with inflation.  However, that inflation rate will increase during the year.  Any economist will tell you that there is no possibility of inflation staying within 2.5 per cent this year having regard to the clear signals given by the Government from day one.  Initially the Government intended to increase public expenditure by 6 per cent; now, through what is called creative accountancy, it has come closer to 8 per cent.</P>
      <P>The Government somehow expects a miracle, that inflation will remain at 2.5 per cent.  Perhaps the Minister will learn another lesson in reality; it is one thing to make a statement, another to see how others react to it.  The investing public do not have confidence in this Government and we will see that in a drain in resources and increases in interest rates and inflation.  The Minister says there will be a social welfare increase of 2.5 per cent; I bet my future against his that there will be much higher expenses to offset that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He may feel the increases are not sufficient. There is no Democratic Left representative in my constituency &mdash; and on this basis it is even more unlikely that there will be &mdash; but there is a Labour representative.  It is probably the same in every constituency but if the Minister has not heard it from other sources, let me tell him the old, the sick, the unemployed, the people dependent on social welfare and those past child <Col N="1611" /> bearing age who do not gain from increases in child benefit &mdash; those dependent on what they receive &mdash; feel totally deprived and rejected.  This has been done by a Minister who waited years to get into Government so that he could correct the anomalies.</P>
    <P>While taking tough decisions on current expenditure and being harangued in Dáil Éireann daily, it is extraordinary that &mdash; with the discipline and support of Fine Gael &mdash; we provided increases in social welfare which were ahead of inflation.  The outturn for the years involved demonstrated this and we maintained that pattern.  Now, the first chance this Minister gets, he does the opposite and his Labour cohorts fall in line.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister implying that Fine Gael does not agree that what he is doing is sufficient, but he would have done it himself if he could?  He should learn that Government is about collective responsibility.  No one should say he wants to give more or that he is not making the case that what he is providing is sufficient, that he is bringing in something which is insufficient.  The Minister is no longer in Opposition. That is an extraordinary example of Government responsibility.  It is hypocritical in terms of today's reality and of the demands the left wing parties, Labour and Democratic Left, have made through the years.</P>
    <P>The Minister said it is not consistent for Fianna Fáil to say expenditure must be increased in this sector while arguing against the overall increase.  I made this case while in Government and I do it again in Opposition.  We are not saying expenditure should be increased across the board, far from it.  I spoke against the 6 per cent overall increase when it was first announced and I feel more strongly about the 8 per cent increase.</P>
    <P>My colleagues in Fine Gael will recall the growth in administration under this Government.  When we were in Government with Labour, now partners of the Minister, we abolished two agencies, the IDA and CTT and replaced them with <Col N="1612" /> four.  That was a huge increase in administration but a reduction in what was provided to those most in need.  Is that the kind of social justice we want to see?</P>
    <P>I spoke against that when we were in partnership with Labour; imagine how I feel now when I watch that party and the Democratic Left; there is not much democracy or left wing policy when they behave in this fashion.  Now there is a growth of agencies so that people do not know where to turn to when they wish to stimulate employment.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to square the concern to reduce public expenditure with the Government's readiness and determination to increase it to accommodate the extra Members which it insisted it needed.  The Government should try telling the old age pensioners, the unemployed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is misleading and wrong; the inflation that will follow the general increase in public expenditure will exceed 2.5 per cent and the pensioners, the sick, the unemployed and the disabled will carry the burden.  If the Government wants to ensure that the miserable increases they are applying are in line with inflation and if the Minister feels that the increases are not sufficient, we can offer him the opportunity now, by way of consensus, to provide sufficient increases; he will not meet any objection from us.  If he comes before us and says he will have to reduce some of the agencies, that he will have to abolish <Col N="1615" /> two Ministries he created with all the accompanying costs so that his party could be in the comfortable position where 66 per cent of its Deputies are Ministers, he will receive enthusiastic agreement.</P>

      <P>I contributed at length on Second Stage and I would like to contribute on Committee Stage.  If some of the Members across the floor are getting hot under the collar because some of the things being said are not to their liking, that is too bad.  The public is furious with the 2.5 per cent increase provided in this Bill.  People realise that on <Col N="1616" /> this occasion this Government had the benefit of a financial situation that has not prevailed for over 25 years, yet the best they could offer our pensioners and those on long-term social welfare payments, was 2.5 per cent.</P>
      <P>I agree wholeheartedly with Senator O'Kennedy when he says that those increases will be very much out of line by the end of 1995.  All the economic pundits will tell the Minister that the position in regard to inflation will deteriorate during the second half of this year.  They believe that, to some extent at least, the public finances are going out of control.  Confidence will be lost in the market and in the finances of this country and that will be reflected in an increase in inflation.  The 2.5 per cent that has been offered &mdash; all that will be available now because the Minister does not seem to be going to change his mind &mdash; will fall far short of what will be necessary to meet the cost of living increases which will be imposed on the poorer section of our people in 1995 and 1996.</P>
      <P>It was announced some months ago, on the formation of the Government, that public expenditure would be 6 per cent of GNP.  It is now well known that that figure is way out of line and that it could now be as high as 8 or 9 per cent; it is probably on a rollercoaster and we do not know where it will stop.  There is also the question of where the money for the payment of the equality award is to come from.  While we want to see the award paid, that has not yet been spelt out in detail and people are very worried about what the fallout might be. Are we to raid the pocket books of local authorities?  If that is so then we are robbing Peter to pay Paul; a further clear statement on where that money is to come from is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of Government policies the Department of Social Welfare will have to meet the expenditure when a further 7,000 people will be thrown onto the unemployment register as a result of the cutback in the community employment schemes &mdash; from 42,000 to 35,000 by the end of the year.  All in all the Government's <Col N="1617" /> approach to social welfare recipients will show it in a very bad light when the chickens come home to roost.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  He has created his own piece of history; he is the first Minister from his party and I wish him well.  I compliment him for providing that every young person living at home who qualifies for unemployment assistance will now get a minimum of £25 per week. That is very welcome.  Where the members of the family had to move out, this placed an extra burden on households and the only people who benefited were property developers.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister to look at a specific problem in relation to a person who owned a public house, and it closed two years ago.  He is not entitled to social welfare because the Department is including the public house in its assessment of his income.  The Minister might have a look at this.  I do not think the Department should take his ownership of the public house into consideration when assessing him for social welfare especially as it is in a very isolated rural area.</P>

      <P>I wish to clarify one point.  Senator O'Kennedy made a very <Col N="1618" /> valid point in regard to the currency crisis.  Could somebody please tell me what the inflation rate was during the currency crisis between 1992 and 1993? That crisis was of the then Government's making and cost the ordinary people, not the moneymakers, more than £800 million.  Had the currency crisis anything to do with the increase in inflation?  Did inflation go above 3 per cent, for instance, even though we experienced a massive currency crisis that cost many people and businesses a lot of money?</P>
      <P>I would appreciate it if the Opposition looked at the Bill to see if there is anything wrong with it, apart from the increases.  I agree with the Minister that 2.5 per cent is not enough.  The 1985 report stated that the minimum amount should be £60 for a person living alone, but the Minister informed us today that that figure should be £66; I believe it should be higher, probably £70.  Why did we not see bigger increases between 1985 and 1994?</P>

      <P>The Opposition did that and made no apologies to anyone. Opposition Senators, like lords of the manor, stood up today and spoke on behalf of the less well off in society.  For years they said that &ldquo;people are not having children anymore&rdquo; and there was no need for child benefit.  The Opposition then removed child benefit from the mother.  I told Deputy Woods, <Col N="1619" /> the former Minister for Social Welfare, that because of pressure in this and in the other House, there has been an increase in child benefit which will go directly to the mother.</P>

      <P>We are dealing with payments and increases.  If the Opposition Senators were so concerned about section 3, why did they not see the discrepancy in it?  Why will some be paid on the 8th, while others will not be paid until the 15th?  The Opposition did not notice that, although it did the same thing last year when in power.  I see no reason there should be a difference of nine days between one payment and another.  Opposition Senators are more interested in arguing about the 2.5 per cent increase.  If the Opposition was effective, it would have seen the discrepancy. It is terrible that a Senator from the Government side must question the Opposition in this regard.  I ask the Minister why those on unemployment benefit will be paid on the 8th, while others will not be paid until the 15th?</P>

There is no difference between disability benefits and invalidity pensions so why do those in receipt of either not receive equal payments?  I ask that increases be paid on the same date and if not, they should be paid back money.</P>

      <P>I live in an adjoining constituency to the Minister.  He represents Finglas while I represent Blanchardstown &mdash; constituencies which have many similarities.  A large area of my constituency has an unemployment rate of up to 60 per cent, a statistic similar to the Minister's constituency.  A large number of these people live in local authority dwellings in Dublin Corporation or Fingal County Council areas and are subject to differential rents schemes.</P>
      <P>Leaving aside the points capably made by my colleagues &mdash; this is not political points scoring &mdash; I meet people who do not know who is in Government. They see us as politicians and tar us all with the one brush.  Old age pensioners have said they got an increase of £1.80 and that we should be ashamed of ourselves.  Let us not kid ourselves. People in receipt of social welfare benefits do not draw distinctions; they do not care who is in Government.  They just know they have been treated badly by politicians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister knows that his constituents, old age pensioners in receipt of the £1.80 increase and those in receipt of the 2.5 per cent increase in social assistance, <Col N="1621" /> will be less well off than last year because there will be an increase in their differential rent.  As Senator O'Kennedy said, the rate of inflation will be more than 2.5 per cent.  Senator Cregan can criticise the increases we gave, but last year they were in excess of 3 per cent which was above the rate of inflation.</P>
    <P>I will not project what inflation rates will be, but those who are more enlightened than I in this regard have told us that inflation rates are about to increase and I believe them, the ESRI and other economic reports.  We base our financial documents on those projections and predictions.  If economists say inflation will be below 2.5 per cent or substantially higher, I believe them.</P>
    <P>While recognising the positive aspects of this Bill, I ask the Minister how he can defend the 2.5 per cent increase&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">

There is no Democratic Left candidate in my constituency.  I believe it is the only one in which The Workers' Party decided not to join the ranks of the Democratic Left and it is highly unlikely that that constituency will ever see a Democratic Left TD.</P>

      <P>The Senator may or may not know that for every 1 per cent increase in the general rate you are talking about a £14 million increase across the board.  Perhaps the Senator would identify the number of Departments &mdash; not the number of agencies or Ministers of State; after all, he is talking about thousands of pounds &mdash; that he wants abolished.  Does he want to see the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry or the Department of Enterprise and Employment abolished because we are really talking about big money?</P>
      <P>I would remind the Senator that his party leader in the Dáil said that if Fianna Fáil had been in office it would have provided a 3 per cent increase.  The difference between what I provided and what the Leader of Fianna Fáil was proposing is 30p a week, so we are not arguing about seriously attacking the question of poverty.  This silly ping-pong argument, saying that you are right and you are wrong, ignores the fact that more than half the money for social welfare in this budget went towards tackling child poverty in a serious way. Unfortunately, previous budgets have attempted to do this superficially by spreading X millions of pounds like a thin layer of margarine across the whole social welfare spectrum.  In a full year £103 million will be spent in addition to child benefit, which will help 650,000 families and 1,332,000 children.  You are talking about dealing seriously with the question of child poverty.</P>

      <P>Of course, the argument is made that this will leave the unemployed, the sick and old age pensioners on 2.5 per cent, but that is wrong because you are misreading the situation. Some 6,365 old age pensioners are caring for 10,216 children.  Some 32,000 people on disability benefit, invalidity pension, injury benefit, interim disability benefit, disablement benefit and death benefit pensions are caring for 67,000 children.  The sick and the old <Col N="1624" /> have not been left out as a result of concentrating on child benefit.</P>
      <P>A total of 79,000 widows, deserted wives and lone parents are caring for 155,000 children, and 94,728 unemployed people are caring for 237,000 children.  Therefore, it is inaccurate to generalise and say that the old, sick and unemployed have been left out by concentrating resources on child benefit. Clearly, it is not true.  I am quite prepared to argue the point &mdash; as I have made clear here, in the Dáil and at my own party conference &mdash; that, of course, social welfare payments are grossly inadequate.</P>

      <P>Grossly inadequate. Ten years ago, a report from the Commission on Social Welfare recommended that we should pay a minimum of £66 a week in today's terms.  In fact, they believed that it should be as much as £79 a week.  However, the stark reality is that to reach the higher level of £79 a week in one year would cost £700 million on top of the £212 million that I have applied this year.  If you can tell me where I will find that £700 million I will more than gladly apply it across the board in social welfare payments. It is annoying to have Fianna Fáil Senators claiming that we are spending too much money and at the same time saying that we are not spending enough.</P>
      <P>I would remind Senator O'Kennedy that the money for the equality payments for married women, who have been denied their rights since 1979, will be paid out this year to the tune of £200 million, with an additional £60 million over the following 18 months.  Had Fianna Fáil administrations, who have been in charge of social welfare since 1987, paid the money when it was due, it would have only cost this State&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Minister for Social Welfare at the time, Barry Desmond &mdash; he is now one of the five auditors of the European Union &mdash; introduced equality legislation which, instead of levelling women's entitlements up to the level of men, levelled men's down to the level that women occupied.  Because of the public furore about that and the loss of income to families that Administration were forced to introduce what it referred to as a transitional payment &mdash; it averaged up to £40 a week and that was paid to certain categories.  In the meantime, the fact was that women were still being denied what men had been paid for.</P>

I warned the then Minister for Social Welfare that the way the legislation was being introduced would result in years of litigation from women who were being denied their rights and that is exactly what happened.

Each Administration, including every Fianna Fáil Administration since then, resisted those claims for equality &mdash; the Fianna Fáil minority Administration in 1987, the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Administration in 1989 and the Labour-Fianna Fáil Administration in 1992-94.</P>

      <P>The party opposite has attempted to create scare stories about the £200 million.  We are paying women what we are obliged to pay them as of right.  They are attempting to frighten people who have local authority mortgages by pretending &mdash; and they know better because they have all been briefed on it &mdash; that this will, in some way, affect the mortgages held by people with county council loans.  They know well that is not the case.  They know well that there will be no change whatsoever in the relationship between the person who holds the loan from the local authority and the local authority itself.  The only change will be that the local authority, instead of paying the money they collect from their mortgage holders to the Department of Finance, will pay it to the agency which buys the portion of the local loans fund which we sell to them. It is time Senators stopped playacting and trying to create scares.  The people are beginning to see through it.</P>

Those Senators &mdash; certainly the former Minister, Senator O'Kennedy &mdash; know that the inflation figures on which budgets are based are provided by the Department of Finance and are debated with the Central Bank. The Department of Social Welfare has no control over the projected inflation rate provided for all Departments by the Department of Finance.  That Department has an important responsibility to ensure that the State's <Col N="1636" /> resources and the taxpayers' money are properly spent and accounted for and that, in so far as we can, we neither over nor under-predict inflation or public expenditure and, therefore, we all accept those figures.

      <Col N="1637" /> It is a rather silly argument because it ignores all the other increases in the social welfare budget.  It also ignores the significant fact that this year the payments will be made six weeks earlier than normal.  In every budget Fianna Fáil introduced since 1987 they pushed the date of payment further towards the middle of the year until it was paid at the end of July.  I have brought it back six weeks and made a commitment that it will be brought back further next year. If the Senators calculate that extra six weeks payment increase this year they will find &mdash; if they want to stick to statistics &mdash; that it works out at approximately 3 per cent for this year.  It is a rather silly argument and, as I said in the Dáil having listened for days to Fianna Fáil's spokespersons on Social Welfare, I still have not heard a single new idea&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If we calculate the general increase with the child benefit increase for those families, we will find that the average increase is much more and ranges as high as 7.8 per cent in some cases, depending on family size.  That is a serious way of dealing with poverty, not the superficial way it has been dealt with in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has not been a social welfare budget introduced by Fianna Fáil since 1987 that has not included social welfare <Col N="1638" /> cuts.  When increases were given in social welfare in any year, it was not by getting extra money from the Exchequer but rather by cutting some other unfortunate's social welfare.  The most notorious cuts were the dirty dozen introduced by Deputy McCreevy when he was Minister for Social Welfare for nine months.  He did more damage to social welfare in those nine months than Fianna Fáil did in the previous seven years.</P>

      <P>These are the rates and an increase of £1 in orphans allowance is derisory.  A £1.50 increase in the old age non-contributory pension, a £1.80 increase in old age contributory pension and an increase of £1.50 in unemployment assistance are a scandal. This is particularly so since the Minister said that there are approximately 265 old age pensioners with children.  The Minister may give me the precise figure again, but he said we were misreading <Col N="1640" /> the situation when we examined these figures which were supplied by him.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned a certain number of old age pensioners with children who will receive increased rates due to the increases in child benefit. However, that is a gross misrepresentation of the position.  According to the laws of nature, the fact is that most old age pensioners do not have dependent children.  Most of those who will receive the benefit of these paltry increases will have nothing else to look to except those paltry increases.  If the Minister quotes children and child benefits in respect of old age pensioners, he is distorting reality and attempting to mislead the people.  The people will not be misled.</P>
      <P>The Minister said it is inaccurate to generalise.  As I read it, by introducing these other relevants into the old age pensioners' entitlements or increases, the Minister is generalising.  I ask him to tell me how many old age pensioners will gain from the increases in child benefit one way or another?  What proportion of old age pensioners will gain? As I see it, the vast bulk of old age pensioners will not benefit other than from these miserable increases.</P>

      <P>I am obliged to the Minister.  He has indicated in respect of old age pensioners that his reference to those who will gain from child benefit increases and other matters is confined to 6,365 from a total of 256,000.  Of those entitled to old age pensions, 2.5 per cent will probably be entitled to some other social welfare benefit.  If the Minister is going to rely on that as a justification for what he is doing to the other 97.5 per cent, then let it stand as his justification.  It is a disgrace.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I tabled an amendment, which was ruled out of order, to bring to the attention of the Minister and the Government that a 2.5 per cent increase is totally insufficient.  The personal rate of unemployment assistance has been increased from £58.90 to £60.40 a week. Those in receipt of this over a long period and those receiving pre-retirement allowances are even more harshly treated.  The payment for a married couple with two children has increased from £124 to £126.40 a week, an increase of £2.40.  I do not know how a family of four can make ends meet on this amount.  A married couple with two children in receipt of an old age non-contributory pension or a blind pension will receive £126.40 per week.</P>
      <P>The personal rate of the carer's allowance was only increased by £1.50.  The Minister mentioned this allowance when speaking on section 3.  I have no difficulty in welcoming payments which encourage people to take care of the elderly in their homes.  We have discussed this on many occasions.  To claim that an increase of £1.50 a week is a major step in the right direction is very disingenuous.  The payment to a family with two children will increase from £87.40 to £88.90 a week.  These increases are miserly.</P>
      <P>The Minister has an opportunity in this Bill to deal with these issues. Department of Social Welfare figures show that 196,000 people are in receipt of unemployment assistance and 62,841 people qualify for child benefit.  Almost 130,000 will not benefit from increases in child benefit.  When speaking on section 3, the Minister stated that 6,000 people receiving old age pensions will benefit from increases in child benefit &mdash; this is out of a total of 200,000 people.  Only 2.5 per cent of those receiving old age contributory pensions will benefit from this.  This is the same percentage increase they will receive. This budget can be described as the budget of the 2.5 per cent increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1647" /> Senator Cregan was very excited earlier.  Speeches were made in the past about champagne being cracked open. It would be no harm if some champagne was cracked open for some of the Senators on the other side and, in particular, for the Minister, who for many years advocated major increases.  The Minister stated that he would like payments to be increased to the maximum recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  He said that this would mean increases of 35 per cent.  We will never get to this position if we keep increasing payments by less than the rate of inflation.  The Minister should take this into account and should not be so disingenuous to suggest that child benefit and the equality payments will resolve every problem.  The vast majority of recipients will receive only 2.5 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the equality payments which kept the Senator out of the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is very lucky I was kept out of the Dáil.  The Minister is taking solace from the fact that Fianna Fáil was tarnished for not implementing the equality directive.  He gave us a history lesson in regard to section 3 for which we are all grateful but which was not relevant to it.  We will probably hear the same thing again because this is the only benefit which I can see in this budget where the Minister can put his hand on his heart and say that this is what he did.  I admire the Minister for sticking up for his colleagues on that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the 2.5 per cent increase has to be highlighted time and again because every Member from an area with high unemployment or dependency on social welfare will know that people are very concerned about that provision, although it has not been implemented yet.  The Minister can talk about the rent allowances going to local authority rents, but every time there is <Col N="1648" /> an increase the local authorities snipe at it.  However, they will be worse off this time next year.  This is not a personal attack on the Minister, but I hope for the good of the vast majority of social welfare recipients that there will be a change of thinking in the Department of Social Welfare or at Cabinet level.  To date, it has been very disappointing.  As I stated, almost 200,000 people are in receipt of unemployment assistance, only 62,000 of whom qualify for child benefit.  Therefore, 130,000 will qualify for nothing else other than the 2.5 per cent increase.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>A minimal number of people might get a token gesture in other areas.  I invite the Minister to inform me how many people out of the total of almost 200,000 who are in receipt of unemployment assistance will benefit from other increases in the Social Welfare Bill.  I tabled the amendment to this section in order to highlight the inadequacies of the increases.</P>
      <P>In his last reply the Minister mentioned the summer jobs scheme, which members of his own party, which is part of the current Government, called slave labour and that it was an insult&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to expect people to work for the paltry sums which were being offered.  The Minister said today that over 9,000 students availed of the summer jobs scheme last year.  I am glad that he is continuing the good efforts which the former Minister, Deputy Woods, made last year and is encouraging this scheme.  However, the speeches in the Dáil would suggest otherwise and that he has made another major U-turn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could quote all of the part of the explanatory memorandum which relates to section 4.  I have yet to find a part of this which I do not oppose because none of the payments is increased by more than 2.5 per cent.  The Minister seemed <Col N="1649" /> to disagree with me when I suggested that earlier and I would like him to point out to me where there is an increase greater than 2.5 per cent.  The explanatory memorandum states &ldquo;Section 4 provides for an increase of 2.5 per cent generally in the weekly personal and adult dependant rates of social assistance payments&rdquo; and has a table which &ldquo;shows the effects of the increases on the principal rates of social assistance payments&rdquo;.  There is not a great deal more to the section.  The implementation dates of the payments have been brought forward, which must be welcomed.  However, the Minister is obviously planning a very short term&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are to boast about and take credit for the bringing forward of the payment increases, we must ask that if there is another 2.5 per cent increase in 12 months time will the Minister bring it forward another six weeks?  In effect, the people will not gain if the Minister is planning such a long term strategy unless he also increases the rates above basic inflation. If he brings it forward by 12 weeks but the increase is still less than basic inflation rates, people will not benefit. The Minister should look at this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will oppose vehemently all Stages of this Bill until the Minister acknowledges <Col N="1650" /> in this House that an increase of 2.5 per cent in social welfare payments is unacceptable to the vast majority of those who are dependent on social welfare, as he did last week when he was speaking to his party faithful.  To date, he has not said that in this House and I invite him to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

As was pointed out under section 3, only 2.5 per cent of those on old age pension will benefit from any other scheme which the Minister has announced or has increased, such as free colour televisions or child benefit.  This Bill will get an easy passage through this House if the Minister acknowledges that the increase of 2.5 per cent is a derisory sum and makes provisions to increase it.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, because of the structure of our social welfare system young people were subject to means testing and had to leave the family home and live in shoe boxes in order to qualify for a miserly benefit.  The State was giving benefits to the landlords who provided those shoe boxes. Up to now, in the region of 20 to 25 per cent of the total supplement of £48 million was paid to people who had to leave home, because otherwise they would get no assistance.  We are increasing this allowance from £10 to £25, irrespective of how much income is coming into the family home, which is a big change.  I am not denying that different amounts come into different homes, but at least we are recognising people as individuals.</P>
      <P>I hope that the savings from the supplements which will not be paid this year will be put towards the social welfare benefits which will be paid next year.  The savings will contribute towards next year's payments and I congratulate the Minister on that part of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A married couple on short duration unemployment assistance with two children will receive £124.30.  It is not the greatest amount in the world, but in addition to the increase of 2.5 per cent, it amounts to £4 extra per week for each child.  This increase goes some way to addressing the recommendation of the report of the Commission on Social Welfare, a report which has been in existence since 1985.  At that time the report recommended that nobody should have less than £60 per week on which to live.  This caused some surprise and the question was asked then if it was possible that a person needed £60 per week on which to live?  The Minister has advised the House that in today's figures the amount should be in the <Col N="1652" /> range between £66 and £79 per week, which is an average of £72.  To provide this weekly amount to those on social welfare would cost an additional £140 million in a year.  Where would we get this sum?</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the present amounts which we provide are not sufficient and I will always argue for increases until conditions have improved to a satisfactory level.  It must be recognised, however, that benefits have been increasing and conditions improving steadily over the years, especially in respect of people with children.  This point has not been made across the floor of the House today, and it has not been made for years, even when Fianna Fáil was in Government.</P>
    <P>The personal rate of unemployment assistance is increased from £61 per week to £62.50 per week and the old age contributory pension is £72.80 per week, whereas the old age non-contributory pension &mdash; paid to those who were not covered by benefits &mdash; is £10 per week less.  Why should there be this difference and why do we demean the latter kind of recipient?  I have long advocated that benefits relevant to one group should be applicable to other similar groups.</P>
    <P>With regard to the issue of equality payments, I congratulate the women who had to seek redress at the High Court and the European Court.  I predicted some years ago that this would happen.  It is a shame on this nation that if this issue had been resolved at the outset and we had granted these women their equal rights it would have cost approximately £18 million, whereas it is now going to cost £200 million this year and £60 million next year, in addition to the payments already made by the then Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods.  This amounts to approximately £300 million and can only be described as bad management.</P>
    <P>Should we not recognise that people should receive equal payments in terms of social welfare entitlements?  We spend approximately £4 billion per year on social welfare.  Given this, will the committee which is considering the <Col N="1653" /> social welfare and tax systems at present be able to define, in a simplified way, the amount of benefit to which each person is entitled as at present, because much administrative time is devoted to deciding on the distribution of different benefits?</P>
    <P>While in no circumstances should a State pension be recognised as taxable, any additional pensions should be subject to taxation.  People are still below the poverty line if they are receiving payments of £61 per week when the Minister admits that they should receive between £66 and £79 per week, averaging £72 per week.  Such people, together with those on the poverty line, can still be subject to personal taxation.  This should never be allowed and a Social Services Bill &mdash; which is the title I would prefer for this Bill &mdash; should not allow circumstances to arise where personal taxation can be applied.  In addition, no benefits which derive from PRSI contributions, which an individual may have made over 30 to 40 years, should be subject to taxation &mdash; whatever about taxing other entitlements &mdash; because the income derived will be below the limits provided in tax free allowances.</P>
    <P>Why should those who are in the non-contributory net and who are on their uppers &mdash; for example, a self-employed person whose business has folded or a small farmer who did not contribute to benefits &mdash; be entitled to £10 per week less than the person who has made contributions? This is unfair.  The same amount should be paid to both categories and also to those who are 79 years of age and 80 years of age.</P>
    <P>To judge from the content of the Bill and from remarks made by the Minister and the Minister of State to the House, changes are taking place which will be for the better.  Hopefully, there will be more improvements as there are deficiencies which must be addressed. For example, the level of benefits are still too low.  In addition, the administration and distribution of the benefits is too cumbersome.  The Bill contains too many definitions.  For example, what <Col N="1654" /> is the difference between disability and invalidity pension?</P>
    <P>I know a person who is very sick at present, and whom I wish the best, who was entitled to benefits up to 1992. However, she is no longer in receipt of them because her credits were exhausted in 1991-92.  She is not entitled to invalidity pension.  She worked for 18 years up until 1989 after which she was unable to do so because of her illness. She is now receiving supplementary benefit and I had to advise her today that she was not entitled to invalidity pension, even though she will never work again.  It is most unfair, but she is not entitled to benefits because she has been idle for the past three years.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to clarify the points I have raised as they are important to people in need of social welfare payments but who are not aware of their benefits.  Many people are able to maximise their benefits, but there are others who find it difficult to do so, or prefer not to from a sense of dignity or pride.</P>
    <P>There should be no distinction in the benefits allowable to those who have made contributions and those who have not.  This is the purpose of our taxation and social welfare systems and both codes should be harmonised.  Hopefully, the forthcoming report on this issue will recommend that people make one payment, with equality in benefits for all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>This section makes provision for increases for what would probably be regarded as the least well off sections of the community.  They include people who are long term unemployed, who receive widow's non-contributory pensions, the carer's allowance and unemployment assistance, those generally regarded as the hardest hit.  It was expected that the Minister would find a mechanism by which he could work towards the increases recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare to deal with these matters.  We had a long discussion some time ago about a report on the long term unemployed, the poverty traps created for them and the necessity to deal urgently <Col N="1655" /> with this category.  It covered many areas, including the provision of employment.  It is regrettable that the Minister has not availed of the opportunity under this section to make special provision for the categories mentioned by the previous speaker who are severely hit and are not protected by insurance cover.  In an effort to come to grips with the problem which the Minister faces in trying to meet the commission guidelines, perhaps he might single out these categories of people for special attention and make a decent payment to them.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to score cheap political points.  The Minister and his party have a commitment to the less well off sections of the community.  I am sure he is fully aware that a sizeable number of people are gravely dissatisfied with his response to the long term unemployed and the least well off sections of the community.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister could explain why it was necessary to have four different implementation dates &mdash; 7 June and 12 June for supplementary welfare payments and 15 and 16 June for deserted wives allowances.  What is the purpose of the four different dates?  Why could they not be payable from 7 June, the earlier date?  We are endeavouring to remove inequalities, but we are creating further inequalities.  Why is it not possible to organise a system which would make one weekly payment instead of having four different dates which confuses everyone?</P>
      <P>I am further confused about equality payments to widows.  The payment of equality funds to those who have waited a long time for them has created further inequalities when the purpose of the exercise should be to try to remove inequalities.  For example, a widow who gets only half the disability benefit payment will be further discriminated against because of the equality payments, although they are welcome.  How can this be eliminated?</P>

      <P>The Minister made a big political issue of the fact that he endeavoured to eliminate discrimination in the area of payments, but this is blatant discrimination. If he wants to eliminate it, he should show us how he proposes to do so.</P>
      <P>I am still not clear if the Minister can explain the reason for the four different dates for payments, which are confusing. Rather than further discriminating against the long term unemployed and the people who are regarded by everyone as the least well off in our community, perhaps he could explain the four different dates for these payments.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister if he proposes to means test some of these allowances which have not been means tested before.  The money the Minister is providing for child benefit payments is inadequate.  Does he propose to curtail these payments under certain regulations because, if so, we need to know what he is proposing?  Is there any provision to ease means testing for non-contributory blind pensions?  As most Members are aware, income is strictly measured at present.  The Department of Social Welfare devised a new name for means testing a few years ago, income testing.  The Minister will be aware that non-contributory pensions, non-contributory blind pensions, lone parents allowances, orphans allowances, etc. are severely income tested.  There is no provision in this Bill to ease this situation for those people who are the least well off in our community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister proposing to change the pre-retirement age limit because it is not clear in the Bill if it is proposed to reduce it?  Perhaps the Minister could clarify this because the pre-retirement age level has declined, but this Bill does not propose to change that.  There are some changes in the age limit between 65 and 66, but it is not clear from the section if the Minister proposes to lower the age limit threshold for qualification for non-contributory pensions.  It was intended to steadily reduce the age limit over a period of time, but that has stopped in the past few years.  We <Col N="1658" /> expected a more revolutionary move from the Democratic Left Minister for Social Welfare as regards these payments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a welcome development.  My query relates to a member of the family who is living with a disabled person or couple.  If that member is in receipt of either FÁS or social welfare payments, or the £25 payment as a member of the family, can that preclude the disabled person from availing of free fuel, free TV licence, free ESB and free telephone?  I hope a payment to a member of the family would not preclude the disabled person from availing of such benefits.</P>
      <P>I also ask the Minister to broaden the carer's allowance scheme.  Great savings for the economy can be made through the carer's allowance.  It now costs about £700 per week to keep a person in hospital.  The carer's allowance is a great benefit to those looking after people at home.  Carers are providing a great service to the community.  I ask the Minister to examine all aspects of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the changes the Minister has made in the carer's allowance.  However, I wish to draw his attention to a number of anomalies in the scheme which I noticed when dealing with constituents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week, for example, a lady telephoned me to explain her position.  She had been caring for an elderly brother and was stricken with cancer.  Her daughter has decided to leave her job and come home to care for her mother. This woman does not have a qualifying payment, although the Minister would agree that she qualifies in every other respect.  She is 63 and has a widow's pension.  As a result, her daughter will <Col N="1660" /> not receive the carer's allowance even though she would qualify for it under the means test.  In fact, her daughter has no income at this stage.</P>
    <P>We have encountered a substantial number of such cases &mdash; and I am sure the Minister is aware of them &mdash; in the past few months.  I have not asked the lady yet whether her pension is contributory or non-contributory.  I believe I should advise such people to try to switch payments and to apply for the disabled person's maintenance allowance from the health board.  That is a qualifying payment whereas a widow's pension is not.  However, if somebody is in receipt of a contributory pension I would be loath to suggest that they should give up the pension and all it entails in order to secure the disabled person's maintenance allowance.  First, the person would lose money and, second, the person would lose benefit over time.  This is an aspect of the carer's allowance that is difficult to fathom and I am sure the Minister has been trying to figure out how to deal with it. Perhaps he will tell us he has sorted out the problem when he replies.</P>
    <P>The carer's allowance is wonderful.  It removes a burden from the State and once again strengthens the extended family.  A person who is already on social welfare assistance and is caring for somebody who obviously needs full-time care and attention does not benefit from the carer's allowance either, even though the means test has been improved dramatically.  The improvement in the means test will assist people who are better off rather than those on social welfare assistance.  Could the Minister look at that problem and suggest, perhaps in time for the next budget, that a bonus be paid to a person on unemployment assistance who is giving full-time care and attention to a person who is obviously in need of such care?  It would be a recognition of the caring nature of the work.  The fact that a person is available 24 hours a day &mdash; which is what is involved in full-time care and attention &mdash; should be recognised in some way particularly in view <Col N="1661" /> of the enormous saving to the State and the improvement in the quality of life of the person who is being cared for.  I look forward to the Minister's response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise one matter regarding the carer's allowance.  I am delighted that the allowance has been increased and that changes have been made in the scheme.  The Department of Health intends to examine and review the home help scheme which is run by the health boards.  I hope there can be links between the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Health in relation to the home help scheme and the carer's allowance.</P>
      <P>In many cases the family or near relatives cannot provide home help under the home help scheme because they are relatives.  I hope it might be possible for the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Health to examine this.  A change would be of benefit to the overall care of the person involved. It is often the case that a carer would like free time but the person being cared for would prefer a relative to be the home help.  That creates problems because the home help must be somebody other than a relative.</P>
      <P>I am aware of one case where a home help was willing to look after a 93 year old person.  However, the home help was a relative and was refused for that reason.  The person has now gone into hospital and that is costing the State more money.  The woman could not care for the old person because her husband was unemployed and in receipt of assistance. The small jobs being carried out by the woman were generating finance for her home and were of assistance to her and her husband.  Perhaps in their deliberations the Department and the health boards could look at linking the home help and the carer's allowance so that discrimination against relations acting in the capacity of a home help could be eliminated.</P>

      <P>A serious point was raised about differential rents and <Col N="1663" /> there have been problems in this area over the years; I raised this in the House in the past.  When social welfare payments are increased, local authorities think this is up for grabs and increase their rents accordingly.</P>
      <P>In the housing provided by Dublin Corporation &mdash; which covers Blanchardstown and my area, Finglas, among other areas &mdash; the local authority has agreed that no more than 15 per cent of the social welfare increase will be taken back in a rent increase.  Compared with the massive clawback which occurred last year, old age pensioners who are Dublin Corporation tenants will be far better off as a result of this year's increase than they were last year because the corporation has taken the humane view that only 15 per cent of the increase will be clawed back.</P>
      <P>I encourage Senators who are members of local authorities to contact Dublin Corporation, or councillors from their party on the corporation, to find out how that local authority has persuaded the city manager to accept this decision.  If that practice spread throughout the country it would be a major step forward for social welfare recipients.  It does not just apply to people receiving pensions.</P>
      <P>There is no point rehashing the arguments. If a young person living at home applies for unemployment assistance and is assessed on their parents' income, the minimum payment he or she will receive is £25.  That is a major step forward in helping young people to stay with their parents because many of them do not want to leave home.</P>

      <P>Another point which has been missed in the concentration on one aspect of this budget is that I have moved to ensure adults who live at home with brothers and sisters will be assessed on their own means and not on those of their siblings.  In many families, parents have died or a brother or sister may live with a married sibling. In the past, they were assessed on the means of the relative with whom they lived.  Now they will only be assessed on their own means.  Again, this provides independence.</P>
      <P>I know of one man, aged 45, who received £12 per week unemployment assistance because he was assessed on his sister's income &mdash; she and her husband always worked.  That will no longer apply; he will receive full unemployment assistance.  This is a major step forward.  I do not suggest it is revolutionary, as Senator Daly said I did.</P>

      <P>When I met the Union of Students in Ireland this year I guaranteed that, so long as I was Minister for Social Welfare, no &ldquo;workfare&rdquo; scheme would be introduced; that I would seek to have the summer jobs scheme as voluntary as conceivably possible; and to improve it to make it beneficial to students, especially those whose parents are entirely dependent on social welfare.</P>
      <P>I have increased the basic rate of payment to £600 and removed the threshold &mdash; one had to qualify for at least £16 in unemployment assistance before getting a place in the summer jobs scheme. Now, if a person qualifies, even if only by 50 pence per week, he or she will qualify for the summer jobs scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition there are strict rules. Senator Kelleher said it was slave labour but I have made it obligatory that sponsors should not expect anyone participating to work more that 35 hours per week; they must not oblige a participant to engage in dangerous work; and, where feasible, the sponsor must enable the participant to complete the job in six weeks.  The student will still get £600 and be free for the rest of the summer <Col N="1666" /> to travel or to get another job.  Even if they spread it over the full period of their summer holidays, they are free to take up a part-time job without any restriction, if it is available.  In addition to that, any student whose parents depend entirely on social welfare gets an additional £1 per hour.  I raised the rate to £3 per hour this year and those students whose parents are dependent on social welfare will get £4 per hour. That is not an ungenerous rate of pay. Many people in ordinary employment would be very pleased to earn £4 per hour.  Many young people working in various fast food outlets around the country take home a lot less than £3 per hour and are taxed on it.  This £3 per hour is not taxed and they do not have to pay PRSI on it.</P>

      <P>I have moved to improve that scheme substantially.  It is now largely voluntary in that students, once they can find a sponsor who is willing to allow them to work for just six weeks, is free for the rest of the summer and gets that money into their hand.  I have made a special arrangement for students who will be gaining the extra £1 per hour, which, given that the scheme provides for 200 hours work, is an extra £200.  This £200 will not be paid through the sponsor, because I do not want two young people who are working on the same job to get different rates.  That additional money will be paid at the end of the scheme just before the student returns to college, when £200 would be very useful to them to buy books or to put a deposit on a flat or for whatever they might need.  I have made significant progress in improving that scheme.</P>
      <P>The question of why particular people are not entitled to invalidity pension was raised.  One of the anomalies in our system at the moment is that we have unemployment benefit, which is based on contributions, and unemployment assistance, which is based on means testing. We have a disability benefit, or sickness benefit as it is more commonly called, for those who have contributions but we have no disability assistance scheme.  The Department is taking in charge the disabled persons' maintenance allowance from the Department of Health.  It is scheduled to happen around the middle of this year.  As soon as the Department of Social Welfare has it within its system, we will be looking at how we can create a sickness assistance scheme so that people who are in the situation that Senators have mentioned, and who may not qualify because of lack of contributions, would still be able to qualify on the basis of means for assistance when they are sick from work or disabled.  Our consideration of it is at a relatively early stage but it will be seen when it is introduced as the kind of revolutionary step that Senator Daly expects from Proinsias De Rossa, the Leader of the Democratic Left.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Senators who have raised specific questions in relation to persons who have been disallowed invalidity pension or carer's allowance to let me have the details, because it is not possible to respond without knowing the full circumstances of each case.  The position at the moment is that the carer of a person of pensionable age who is in receipt of a social welfare payment will qualify for the carer's allowance.  If they are under pension age, however, the carer will not.</P>
      <P>When the former Minister, Deputy Woods, introduced the carer's allowance I praised him for having done so, because we had all been demanding such a payment for some time.  It is unfortunate that at the time, and even up to now, resources have not been available to develop it in the way that it should be developed.  We have to address the fact that our population is growing older, not just as Senators or Deputies, but as a society.  The population is greying, like myself.  We need to find ways to ensure that people at a certain age, simply because they have some infirmity or other, do not automatically end up in a nursing home or hospital.  This year I have extended the categories of person who are entitled to carer's allowance by including the carers of people with occupational pensions, which is a significant step.  It is not a huge step and it is not hugely costly, but it is a recognition that people in receipt of occupational pensions, which are often no more than social welfare pensions, and in some cases less, need care as well as people in receipt of social welfare pensions.  In addition to that I have increased the income disregard of the spouse of the carer from £100 to £150.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also provided for a companion pass for the person who is being cared for.  The important aspect of the companion pass is that it is not confined to use by the carer.  The companion pass will go to the person who is being cared <Col N="1669" /> for, who has it for free travel.  Any person who accompanies the cared for person on public transport can avail of that companion pass.  The carer will be freed from having to go everywhere with the person they are caring for.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the fact that we need to avoid creating a virtual enslavement, where a young woman or man, because he or she cares for their elderly relative, ends up being trapped in that position of care 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  The importance of the availability of respite care and home help which Senators have raised needs to be addressed.  As I understand it, an agency was established some time ago &mdash; I am recalling from memory &mdash; to look at the integration of social services.  It is not making a lot of progress and I will be examining this as soon as I get time to draw breath in the Department of Social Welfare.</P>

      <P>I feel strongly about the carer's allowance and the whole area of care for people who, by and large, want to stay at home.  They do not want to be shunted off to homes and hospitals.  It is to the credit of Irish society that there are still sons and daughters and nieces and nephews who are prepared to give that kind of care to people.  We should examine the possibility of providing an additional bonus where people are unemployed.  I cannot give any undertakings in that regard but I am prepared to look at all those areas. I am interested in making progress in this area.  The means test has to be looked at.  It is far too stringent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that it should.  We are transferring the disabled persons' maintenance allowance to the Department of Social Welfare. We are looking at various other <Col N="1670" /> aspects, for instance, of rationalising the supplementary welfare allowance.  I am not sure it would make sense for the Department of Health to become involved in payments to carers as distinct from the provision of care.  There must be rationalisation of what each agency delivers, but there should be integration in terms of how they work together.</P>
      <P>One of the first things I did in the Department of Social Welfare was to look at areas where we were doing things which the Department of Health was doing.  For example, I transferred the respite care allowance, which was being provided by my Department, to the Department of Health because I believed it was more appropriate that it should deal with that area.  I am not in the business of protecting turf.  I want to ensure that the best service is delivered by each Department.</P>
      <P>The increases provided for in the budget, including child benefit, etc., do not affect the entitlement to secondary benefits, although I will double check that.  On the question of means testing allowances, Senator Daly will know assistance payments are means tested, but benefits are not.  When Deputy McCreevy occupied this position he introduced a number of income related provisions for benefit, specifically maternity benefit, and he reduced occupational injuries benefit below the recommended rate of the Commission on Social Welfare.  He made a number of other unfortunate changes.  It is taking some time to recover ground, but progress is being made.</P>

      <P>Wait and see. The requirement to prove desertion by a woman or, in some cases, a man has been abolished.  When a spouse walked out of the home for whatever reason, a <Col N="1671" /> woman had to prove that she was deserted to qualify for a payment.  I believe that demeaned the person concerned. A new uniform lone parents allowance is to be introduced, which will provide support for the parent caring for the children.  This will not require proof of desertion; it will simply require proof that the person is not cohabiting, is a lone parent, has a certain number of children and his or her income is within a certain range, depending on the number of children.  It will be income related and one will not have to prove desertion. It will only be necessary to show that one's income is within certain bounds and one has certain number children.  That is a major step forward in the social welfare code, but it has not been adverted to by the Opposition parties.</P>

      <P>For example, the tapering of the adult dependants allowance has not yet been discovered by the Opposition, which again is a major step forward.  Currently, if one goes to work and earns more than £60 per week, one's adult dependants allowance is taken away.  The Bill provides that one's adult dependants allowance will only decline proportionately, depending on one's earnings.  There is a range of other provisions in the Bill which is ground breaking.</P>
      <P>A number of points were made in relation to the difference in the dates of payments.  The most important thing about the dates is that payments will be made six weeks earlier than last year and will be earlier still next year.

      <P>If, for example, Fianna Fáil was in office and did the same as last year by providing an across the board increase of 3 per cent from the normal date in late July and ignored the real issue of poverty, the amount of money a person would receive would be the same as what they will receive as a result of the 2.5 increase paid from early June.  That is a mathematical fact which cannot be disputed.  It is wrong to say that it is a disadvantage for money to be paid earlier.  I understand that is what Senator Kelleher said, but if I misrepresented him I stand corrected.</P>

      <P>Social welfare increases are to be paid six weeks earlier than when Fianna Fáil, who pushed them back to the end of July, paid them. That is now being reversed.  We were told why there is a difference between the unemployment benefit rates and the assistance rates.  The Commission on Social Welfare recommended a 10 per cent differential, although in some cases the differential is much higher.  While I regard basic rates of social welfare to be inadequate, the reason for the difference is that it is felt that people who contribute to the social insurance fund should receive a higher payment than those who do not qualify either because they do not have sufficient contributions or they have no contributions.  In other <Col N="1674" /> words, it is an incentive to pay into the social insurance fund on the basis that it will benefit people when they apply to qualify for disability or unemployment benefit or a contributory pension.  That is a fair way of looking at the system.</P>
      <P>A point was made about the pre-retirement age limit.  There is nothing in the Bill about the pre-retirement age because it is not proposed to change it and, to my knowledge, it has not been changed for some time.  While some people welcome the fact that when they reach a certain age they no longer have to prove that they are searching for work that is not there, many others will not be interested in pre-retirement because they feel they are on the scrap heap at what is a very young age.  If I was unemployed I would probably qualify for pre-retirement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I especially welcome the changes made with regard to child benefit in this Bill.  As I said last Thursday, the ESRI report published last year showed that one of the best ways of tackling poverty in families with children was to increase the child benefit.  I did not speak on the two sections before this.  While the 2.5 per cent general increase is not an acceptably high enough figure to any Members, one must accept that we have limited resources and huge demands and that with such a large proportion of the population depending on social welfare these limited resources must be targeted. We must try to reduce the number of people depending on social welfare and any changes that the Minister can introduce to do this would be particularly welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the view that the allocation of child dependant allowances in our social welfare system does create inequities between families on social welfare and those supported by low income.  My party would like to promote the development, at the highest possible rates, of the child benefit system.  I was not in the House when the Minister replied to my question &mdash; I had to go to the Joint Committee on Women's Rights &mdash; concerning what the child benefit supplement would involve.  I <Col N="1677" /> would be concerned that it might make it more difficult to move from unemployment to employment and create more poverty traps.  Bringing child benefit to the highest possible level, allied to the maintenance of the real value of social welfare benefits, would represent a responsible attempt to combine the concern of everybody to promote employment growth with an effective strategy to secure the income position of those people who find themselves on social welfare.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 5 and compliment both the Minister and the Minister of State on it.  I would be happy if the Minister could address my reservation on the child benefit supplement scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Senator Cregan will inform the Minister of my thanks.  I thank the Minister for acknowledging the fact that this was initially introduced by his predecessor, Deputy Woods, in setting up the child benefit review committee which recommended substantial increases in child benefit.  I am glad the new Minister has accepted the broad thrust of this review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the child benefit is substantial, to suggest that it addresses poverty loses sight of the fact that tens of thousands of people are on extremely low rates of main benefit and assistance and therefore do not qualify to any great extent under the child benefit scheme.  It is important to reiterate &mdash; for fear that it would go unnoticed in this House &mdash; that we are stringently opposing the 2.5 increase in basic social welfare payments. Of the 180,000 people in receipt of old age contributory and non-contributory <Col N="1678" /> pensions, only about 2,000 have qualifying child dependants.  There are about 62,000 people on unemployment benefit but only 26,000 qualify for child benefit, while out of the 196,000 who qualify for unemployment assistance only 62,000 have child dependants. Less than one third of the almost 200,000 people on unemployment assistance will qualify for child benefit.</P>
    <P>Overall, I welcome this section.  I had to use it to voice our opposition to the increase in social welfare payments. There is just one point I would like clarified but unfortunately the Minister is not here.  Last year he made a statement and it is important that we read it into the record.  He said:</P>
    <P>Any enhanced child benefit would be paid universally and those in the tax net with substantial incomes would repay&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mr. R. Kiely)</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Senator to give us the source of the quote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>My apologies.  It is from the Select Committee on Social Affairs. S.2 No. 1, 9 March 1994.  It states:</P>
      <P>An enhanced child benefit would be paid universally and those in the tax net with substantial incomes would repay some of it through the tax system.  The payment would be accountable for tax purposes...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That quote is from the Minister, then Deputy De Rossa.  Could we have some clarification on this issue?  The child benefit is welcome, but I have some fears about taxing it or clawing it back. A household where one person is working would be means tested and taxed and the child benefit could be clawed back on the income of the person who is working.  It is important to clarify that matter.  It does not relate to this section, but I would like the views of the Minister. I ask him to convey the seriousness of this issue to the Cabinet.  Many unemployed people are maintaining children at home while the person out working is <Col N="1679" /> not be contributing their fair share.  This is acknowledged across the board and causes much social deprivation and poverty among children.  The essence of child benefit is to transfer it to the child and ensure they are kept off the poverty line.</P>
    <P>Overall I welcome this section.  The review committee set up by Deputy Woods when he was Minister for Social Welfare recommended substantial increases in child benefit and this has come about.  This is the only section in the Social Welfare Bill which I can safely say I welcome.  Unfortunately, the Minister is not here to hear this, because until now we have been stringently opposing the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I thank him for the increase in child benefit, because I am sure he had a substantial input into the improvements contained in the Bill.  Child benefit is a good way of addressing poverty.  It is a way of paying a benefit without risking other benefits, such as fuel allowance, which people lose once they go beyond a certain income limit.  I also welcome the fact that it is being extended to children up to the age of 18.  However, I have already had complaints from people who have lost out because their children have gone beyond 18, but at least it will benefit people in the future.  I want some clarification on one matter which may have changed already.  Is child benefit now payable to either a man or woman?  Is it payable to a father if he is the sole minder of the children?</P>

      <P>Section 5 proves the general principle of change in the Bill by putting more into child benefit.  Like the <Col N="1680" /> previous speakers, I welcome the section.  This is a Bill of change which presents us with opportunity.  It is a sad reflection on us that the Bill now involves a sum of £4 billion a year.</P>
      <P>The benefits are now going directly to children through the mother, which is an excellent idea.  The payment date has been brought forward by six weeks this year and the Minister hopes to bring it nearer to the budget next year.  It is a better increase generally for the people in receipt of the benefit and I really welcome this section.</P>

I am also pleased with the changes which allow for the payment of benefit to members of the Defence Forces and civil servants who are serving overseas.  That is a welcome addition to this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Members who correctly identified the purpose of this section.  The proposal was to specifically target families in a way that would not be trapped by any other system, including taxation of benefits.  This is not a criticism of anybody, but simply increasing general payments would not have been of any great benefit to people who might be taxed on the benefits at a later stage.  Payments to the family unit by way of child benefit was a means of targeting the most vulnerable sector and making the payment directly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This area has attracted the most favourable comment in any discussions that have taken place because it is generally agreed that child benefit is usually put to very good use.  It has been accepted, following examination, that women in the household invariably put child benefit to the most important use. Money is always put aside for special purposes and is never squandered or wasted.  It was in recognition of this fact that it was decided that this was one of the most appropriate ways of giving an <Col N="1681" /> increase to a family which was dependent on social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>Senators Honan and McGennis correctly identified the strategy employed. Senator Kelleher was identifying another strategy, about which I would not be as positive.  I am sorry that Opposition parties tend to spend a lot of time on the most negative aspects of any situation or budget, but that is the way things work.  The point Senator Kelleher made about the alleged small increase of 2.5 per cent in general social welfare payments has to be looked at in light of the fact that the payment date for all payments is being brought forward by six weeks.  The effect of that is to increase the 2.5 per cent, which has been referred to so disparagingly, to over 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>The next point we must examine is the optimum level of an increase at a particular time.  On Second Stage I mentioned that the Leader of the Opposition in the other House identified 3 per cent, given inflation rates and so on, as being about the right amount.  While everybody agrees that it would be nice to give a bigger increase, the fact remains that there are many people dependent on social welfare and the budget is now in the £4 billion bracket, which is a considerable payment.</P>
    <P>It also means that the Department of Social Welfare is responsible for the weekly running costs of a very large number of households in the country. There is a huge responsibility on the Department, the Minister and the Government to ensure that sufficient resources are available to meet requirements to the end of the year.  If a greater increase had been given it would not have been possible to increase child benefit as the money would have had to be taken from somewhere else.  This would have been a wrong strategy.  The strategy which has been employed is absolutely correct.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelleher implied that the Government parties, either individually or collectively, have a secret wish to impose taxation on child benefit.  The <Col N="1682" /> source of this unfortunate reference escapes me.</P>

This includes an exemption from PRSI on the first £50 of weekly earnings and an increase in the income threshold below which the lower rate of 9 per cent PRSI contribution applies.  This is an acknowledgement that the rates of PRSI applicable to employers are a disincentive to employment.  Does the Minister accept that PRSI is a form of double taxation? I contend that it is much more a form of double taxation than the local government service charges.

I am now in Opposition, but we pushed from the Government side of the House for major movement in this area.  This was acknowledged in the previous Social Welfare Bill and the 1994 budget.  It is also acknowledged in this Bill.  I plead with the Minister to ensure continual movement in this area as it militates against employment, specifically in the lower sectors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to broaden the question of PRSI payments, which is relevant to sections 6 to 10, inclusive. The Minister emphasised the report which will be forthcoming on the review of the tax and social welfare systems. We must recognise the need to create an atmosphere of initiative and give incentives to people who wish to employ others.  This is particularly so for those on the border line who are not working or who do not want to work because of the amounts they would earn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no reason why there cannot be only one payment.  I do not see the logic in saying that no more PRSI contributions should be taken after £21,500. We should not consider the idea of taking the same amount of PRSI from a person who is earning less than £80. People who are working should make just one payment, which would include <Col N="1686" /> tax.  If a person is working as a general operative and earning in the region of £8,000-£9,000 a year gross, or £180 a week, they should not be put in the position of considering that they would be better off not working.  That has been going on for far too long.  We have all heard it from many people.</P>
    <P>I hope the review that is coming up will give consideration to the amount stopped from a person's earnings.  For example, if one is paying 25 per cent tax and earning £160 per week, the PRSI would total almost 20 per cent again between employee and employer, making a total of 45 per cent of the gross amount.  Why can we not have a system whereby out of, say, £10,000 earned there would be an allowance of £5,000 and 40 per cent of the remainder will be stopped?  Everybody should get the same benefits under such a system.</P>
    <P>We argued earlier about people who ran out of contributions, having worked for some years.  That is unfair.  I hope this will be considered in the future.  The system should entice people to work. People want to work but we should not create a system whereby people do not want to work because they would be better off not working.</P>

      <P>The points made by the Senators are valid.  Generally speaking, people have been of the opinion for several years that any charge or levy which is seen as an impediment to employment is counterproductive.  That is true. I note Senator Kelleher requested that further indication be given as to reductions in subsequent years.  It is the Government's policy to try to bring about a situation whereby people are encouraged back into the workforce by the removal of barriers which have been seen to have developed there over a number of years.  The reason it has happened is that, unfortunately, one does not have a total review of the financial Acts in any given year at budget time; one does not have a total review and reconstruction of the Social Welfare Acts either.  One has a series of amendments built up over the years.  The result <Col N="1687" /> is that in some ways they have created problems.</P>
      <P>For the information of the House I will give an indication of the costs.  The weekly disregard of £50 in classes A and H in 1995 will cost £60 million.  In a full year it will cost £100 million.  This emphasises the considerable expenditure already undertaken.  It may seem small to some, but it is quite a considerable measure.  The impact might not necessarily be seen immediately, but as time goes on it will be.  The weekly disregard of £10 &mdash; an annual disregard of £520 &mdash; for the self-employed and reduced minimum self-employed contribution of £230 will cost £2.5 million in the remainder of 1995 and £4 million in a full year.  The increase in the threshold for the reduced 9 per cent employers contribution to £231 per week in the rest of 1995 will cost £28 million and £46 million in a full year.  The increase in the threshold for exemption from levies to £178 per week for those on lower incomes &mdash; £9,250 per annum &mdash; will cost £1.9 million in 1995 and £3.3 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>The total cost of those measures in 1995 is £92.6 million and in a full year £154 million.  I emphasise their importance in the total social welfare budget. A couple of years ago such measures would be seen as a major initiative in the total national finances, let alone in the social welfare budget.  These initiatives have been taken in the social welfare budget and will have a positive effect.  It might not be obvious for the first couple of months, but as the year progresses the intentions will become more obvious and beneficial.  I am sure Members will have found there is quite an amount of interest in those proposals. They will be seen to be progressive and constructive and beneficial to the economy and to those for whom they are intended.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been the practice over the years, for which there are a variety of reasons, that a social welfare Bill builds on previous ones and does not fundamentally revise previous legislation. This applies not only to social welfare Bills but also to other legislation pertaining to financial matters.  The difficulty arises when a fundamental review is required.  Such a review is a major issue at any juncture.  The points made are noted and when such a review is undertaken it will be made available to the Houses of the Oireachtas.

      <P>In page 6, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;12.&mdash;Progress on the implementation of the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare will be reviewed by the Minister and a report will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>To be fair to the Minister, we added to the confusion earlier.  We were speaking about this amendment.</P>
      <P>The Minister already gave a commitment and an indication of where he was coming from in relation to the implementation of the system and improvements to it.  Rather than having the commission's report sit on the shelves like many other reports and not do anything about it, it is vital that we introduce improvements in social welfare and I know we are doing this.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated how much it would cost this year to implement the proposals in Senator Kelleher's earlier amendments, which were ruled out of order.  We accept this.  When Fianna Fáil was in Government, we were not in a position to immediately implement the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>It is important that we should monitor how we are trying to achieve those objectives.  The Minister should not have any problem with this amendment. It simply proposes that he should make a progress report on how his Department is implementing the commission's recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Senator's positive response.  One always tries to be helpful in situations like this. A number of the commission's priority <Col N="1691" /> recommendations have been implemented.  The Government and the Minister do not have to take on board further enhanced proposals.  The Government is already tackling this.  It is part of the Government's policy and it is proceeding along that road.  I mean no disrespect to the House but the Government's intention is to meet the guidelines set out in the report.</P>
      <P>Reviews, if and when they take place, will be undertaken against the backdrop of guidelines laid down on public expenditure, inflation and so on.  This is commonplace. There is no need to do other than proceed along the lines laid down in the <i>A Government of Renewal</i> programme, which contains a commitment to commission the ESRI to review rates and recommend new ones in light of improvements in social welfare and other changes since the report of the Commission on Social Welfare was first published and changes agreed in the Government's programme itself.  The initial discussion between the ESRI and officials in my Department has commenced for the purpose of drafting the terms of reference for this review.</P>
      <P>This work is ongoing and there is no benefit in having a major confrontation about it.  We agree in principle with the thrust of what Senator McGennis is saying. Government policy is actually ahead of her very constructive proposal. Restating what is already Government policy will not make any difference one way or the other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister has said.  In the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>, which preceded the <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, the previous Government also gave an indication that this was the direction in which we were going.  This amendment is very constructive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission on the Status of Women stated that there should be a committee to monitor the implementation of its report.  We should also monitor the implementation of the Commission on Social Welfare's report. <Col N="1692" /> I accept that the Government, like the previous one, is moving along these lines and there is nothing wrong with highlighting this fact by issuing a progress report each year on the implementation of the commission's proposals. This would be a positive way for this Government and the next Fianna Fáil one to show how the recommendations are being implemented.</P>
    <P>This amendment will not change the status of the Bill in any way.  It is very positive and could be appended to the Bill.  It would give effect to reports on the implementation of the commission's recommendations.  There should be implementing committees or, at the very least, annual reports to show how the recommendations of the reports of commissions are being implemented.  I am glad the Minister accepts the spirit of this amendment.  If he inserts it in the legislation we will all be happy.</P>

      <P>I do not think it would be of any benefit to the Bill to incorporate the amendment.  A structure is already available which is likely to be the most appropriate way to evaluate the ESRI's review.  This structure is the Dáil Select Committee on Social Affairs, which has specific and special responsibilities in this area.  It has the time and energy to target this aspect of social welfare and social legislation generally.  This would be the appropriate place to deal with this rather than attempting to do so through an amendment to the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>As I only have a copy of the Bill as it was initiated, I may be out of order and I am open to clarification by the Minister.  The amendment which Senator Kelleher tabled on this section was in regard to adoptive leave and benefit.  The Minister went to great lengths earlier to talk about how he abhorred inequality; he almost claimed to be personally sending out the cheques in the post to the 70,000 women who have been paid.</P>
      <P>I support any efforts to wipe out inequalities in our system.  Dates have been specified for the payment of child benefit, unemployment assistance and so on.  The Adoptive Leave Bill was initiated in this House in 1993.  It only came into law this year, which was a very long gestation period for any Bill. This appears to be the only benefit for which the Minister is not committed to a specific date.</P>
      <P>The Minister appears to be saying that a commitment has been given, because the Bill has been passed in both Houses, to pay maternity leave to adopting parents but that it will be done sometime.  The final line of section 11 states: &ldquo;This section shall come into operation on such day as the Minister may appoint by order&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke about equality for all within the social welfare system, although there are different payment dates.  I acknowledge the fact that social welfare payments are being brought forward by six weeks.  We have already said on this side of the House that we welcome that and we know that it is an additional burden on the Exchequer.  In section 3 the Minister specified the dates on which he intends to pay the various allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 11 was referred to quite some time ago in this House when the Minister for Equality and Law Reform referred to the fact that the Minister for Social Welfare had included this in his <Col N="1694" /> Bill.  The conditions probably mirror the conditions which are laid down in the Adoptive Leave Act itself.  However, the final line of section 11 gives no equality to parents of adopted children. I received correspondence from people when the Bill was initiated in 1993 whose children are now running around and there is no chance that they will now qualify for adoptive leave. Although we have enshrined this right in this Social Welfare Bill, as we enshrined it in the Adoptive Leave Act, we are not saying when we will do it. That is totally unacceptable as stated policy in a Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, we did not specify a date in our amendment which tried to specify when and how much leave could be taken.  We tried to make that amendment to the Act itself and we may table such an amendment on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister made great play about achieving this equality, as the Minister of State's colleagues will tell him, and how great he was in ensuring that everybody got their entitlements, even if they had been deprived of them by previous Governments, including ones led by Fine Gael.  If he was to make such a play about how wonderful he was in giving people their entitlements, the very least he could have done would be to acknowledge the spirit of the Adoptive Leave Act, which was welcomed by the Minister of State's party when it was in Opposition.  We were in Opposition by the time that it was enacted and we stayed the same ground and made no attempts to amend it just for the sake of it.</P>
    <P>While I acknowledged the Minister of State's input into the increase in child benefit, I will pin this one on the Minister because he claims to be the Minister for equality in terms of social welfare.  I want the Minister to insert into section 11 that this section shall come into operation on 7 June 1995, as prescribed by the earliest payment date in section 3.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senator for being constructive and supportive of the Minister and the Government, which is <Col N="1695" /> to be encouraged, although I do not necessarily agree with everything she said.  I think that the Minister rightly identified the need to comply with both domestic and EU equality legislation.  I watched the debate on the monitor and he correctly pointed out the danger of postponing such payments, as happened in another instance.  He quite rightly pointed out the necessity to respond positively and quickly rather than to defer any such payments which would result in far greater amounts of money having to be made available from the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>In relation to this item, I am sure that the Senator will be quite happy to know that a number of regulations will be made under the provisions of section 11. The Minister will make those regulations immediately the Bill is passed into law, so there is no need for a specific date.  The sooner that this Social Welfare Bill, including section 11, is passed into law, the sooner the provisions to which the Senator referred will be operational.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I find the Minister of State much easier to work with than the Minister, which makes it very difficult for me to put him under pressure. However, I cannot accept the regulations because section 4 of the Bill specifically states in relation to the various payments that:</P>
      <P>This section shall come into operation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  in so far as it relates to unemployment assistance on the 7th day of June, 1995.</P>
      <P>(b)  ...on the 12th day of June, 1995.</P>
      <P>(c)  ...on the 15th day of June, 1995, and</P>
      <P>(d)  ...on the 16th day of June, 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could accept what the Minister is saying if he said that this section will come into operation, as with the other <Col N="1696" /> sections of the Bill, by way of regulation. However, that is not the position in relation to all of the other entitlements. When we enshrined the adoptive leave legislation we tried to show that people adopting children are equal to those in receipt of maternity benefit.  I genuinely do not accept that these people should be treated differently. The date for the implementation of this section should be written into law.</P>
    <P>With all due respect to the Minister, I do not want him to bring in regulations. In order to treat this section of society with the same kind of respect and equality to which other sections are entitled, he should have put in the date. I would suggest 7 June 1995, but I am quite willing to accept 16 June 1995.  I will table an amendment on Report Stage which I ask the Minister to accept.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister agrees with me that this is not the right way and it does not send out the right message.  We had a very emotional and positive debate in this House when we decided to give people this entitlement.  Let us not say now that they will be dealt with differently to any other section of society. The Minister should accept the spirit of what I am saying and accept an amendment to insert a date.</P>

      <P>The Social Welfare Acts provide for a wide variety of offences, and prosecutions are considered in the case of employers who fail to carry out their statutory obligations and people who fraudulently receive social welfare payments.  Conviction for an offence may have severe consequences for the individual concerned and for this reason discretion is exercised in determining which cases warrant prosecution.</P>
      <P>The decision to prosecute is taken on the basis of the circumstances of the case, the nature of the alleged offence, the availability of evidence and the circumstances of the person concerned. The criteria applied in determining whether prosecutions should be taken include the duration of the offence, whether the individual or employer is a persistent offender, the amount of money involved, the incidence of fraud in a specific firm, industry or area and the existence of collusion between employers and employees to the fraud.</P>
      <P>Prosecution involves gathering a large body of documentary evidence for each case.  Only the most serious cases are pursued with the view to prosecution. The maximum penalties at present for cases heard summarily is a fine not exceeding £1,000 or a term of imprisonment not exceeding one year, or both such fine and imprisonment.  The maximum penalty for cases heard on indictment is a fine not exceeding £10,000 or a term of imprisonment not exceeding three years, or both such fine and imprisonment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Social welfare cases are generally prosecuted summarily as the penalties which may be imposed by the District Court are seen as adequately reflecting the seriousness of the offence.  Ultimately, the penalty to be imposed in any case is a matter for the courts to determine. Generally, the courts tend to impose fines below £200, and a maximum fine of £1,000 has been imposed only on very rare occasions.  In these circumstances I see no point in increasing the maximum fines and, in any event, I am satisfied that the existing <Col N="1698" /> penalties provided for in the Social Welfare Acts represent an adequate deterrent.  Consequently, I oppose the amendment proposed by the Senator.</P>

      <P>Regarding those who inadvertently end up on the wrong side of the law on social welfare, there are a number of cases where people continue to receive family income supplement in ignorance &mdash; for example, spouses may take up part time or temporary work and may not inform or may not be aware that they must inform the Department of Social Welfare.  In circumstances where people may not be <i>au fait</i> with regulations and may not be in a position to comprehend all of their consequences, the Department or the Minister should be conscious of this situation and be lenient, because in such cases punishment, such as penalties or pay backs, can inflict terrible hardship on a family situation if there are children involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Those who are liable, or who are likely to be prosecuted in such situations, are people who are often not in good circumstances, and the Senator makes a valid point in this regard.  The Department has a dual role.  In the first instance it must protect the Exchequer and ensure that payments are made to those who are eligible and that there are no abuses.  Secondly, and at the same time, where abuses inadvertently or otherwise take place, it is essential that no undue hardship is created as a result of measures which are in place to protect the State.  At the same time there must be recognition that abuses are certainly not to be encouraged and there must be some form of retribution for those who have abused the system to ensure that the State's finances are protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, from my own experience of dealing with the Department over the years &mdash; and I am sure this is the experience <Col N="1699" /> of other Members also &mdash; it has always been amenable to attempting to ensure that where something has gone wrong serious hardship would not be imposed on a vulnerable group of people or a vulnerable person or persons in society.</P>

      <P>The Minister will have to address the community employment schemes later in the year because by the end of the year there will be a reduction of approximately 7,000 in the number of people on these schemes.  This will be a blow to many people who found the opportunity to leave unemployment by <Col N="1700" /> participating in social employment schemes, or community employment schemes as they are now termed.</P>
      <P>This is retrograde step.  I deal with offices in Athlone and Roscommon where community groups, tidy towns groups and development groups have extensively availed of the schemes. There was a quota in the Roscommon office of 840 people for 1994, but for 1995 this has been reduced to 540, representing a cut of 300 from last year.  It is a severe blow for those in the county who wished to get out of unemployment and become involved in productive work, both for themselves and their families.</P>
      <P>Participation in these schemes averted tensions in many households where there were a number of people unemployed.  In such circumstances the atmosphere of households can deteriorate and it is an established fact that unemployment brings its own problems, such as alcohol abuse and so on.</P>
      <P>The reduction in these schemes is, therefore, a major blow.  If the county which I come from has a cut back of just over 300 places, then the situation in other counties is similar.  I am advised that on a national basis, 35,000 people will participate in these schemes by the end of the year, whereas the figure was 42,000 last year.</P>
      <P>I attended a meeting in Brussels last week and &mdash; other people on the delegation can vouch for this &mdash; we were taken aback when a senior official of the European Commission said that it took a meeting in Brussels to bring together the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  That is disturbing.  There should be ongoing contact between the two Departments about how to deal with the problem of unemployment. Many people on the delegation questioned the official in order to establish if that was the case.  He was adamant as he had recently experienced this situation. It is terrible if one hand does not know what the other is doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Departments must liaise with each other.  There is something seriously <Col N="1701" /> wrong if the Department of Enterprise and Employment is working on its own without consulting the Department of Social Welfare.  This situation should be rectified.  Discussions should take place between the two Departments, particularly in relation to community employment schemes.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look again at the proposal to reduce the number of people on community employment schemes.  These are excellent schemes which provide an outlet for people who wish to be employed instead of being on social welfare.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">

      <P>I support Senator Finneran.  The Minister referred to the third level students scheme and said he would not introduce &ldquo;workfare&rdquo; under any circumstances.  We are not asking him to do that.  There is no need to change the name of the scheme because it does not matter what it is called.  We are talking about unemployed people who are anxious to contribute to the community because they do not like sitting at home every day.</P>
      <P>The number of these excellent schemes is decreasing because of trade union problems.  The Minister may change the name of the scheme, but it will make no difference unless he can resolve the problems which local authorities are experiencing in trying to establish these community employment projects in their areas.  There are no social employment schemes in some local authorities outside Dublin because the unions have vetoed them.  These are excellent schemes which contribute greatly to the community because they give respect to those involved.  It means nothing to change the name of the scheme.  The Minister &mdash; it may not be this Minister because it may not be a social welfare problem but a labour one &mdash; must solve this conflict with the unions which are insisting that there should be permanent jobs in the areas where social employment schemes &mdash; now called community employment schemes &mdash; are established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible for local authorities <Col N="1702" /> to employ additional staff, given their financial positions.  In addition to works being carried out by permanent staff, these schemes allow other works to be done which would not be done by the staff currently employed by local authorities. They are not a threat to people in permanent employment in local authorities, but an addition to the work they do.  I ask the Minister to address this issue.</P>
    <P>Fingal County Council has had little success in this regard.  Community employment schemes have not been established in some other local authorities because, as I have said, the unions have vetoed them.  The Minister said he would not have &ldquo;workfare&rdquo;. That is a negative approach to this issue. The schemes would be more successful if he viewed them as an opportunity rather than as an obligation to work.</P>

      <P>The points made by the two Senators have been made for many years in relation to employment schemes and local authorities.  Anyone who has been a member of a local authority has had first hand experience of this situation.  It is not true that there is a reduction in the total number of people whose employment is being provided through schemes.  A large number of schemes are operated by several Departments, including the Department of Enterprise and Employment and the Department of Social Welfare.  The purpose of the exercise is to encourage people away from unemployment and into the workforce by positive inducements. This has been a success because approximately 40,000 people benefited from schemes last year.  I note the points made in relation to a possible reduction, but that does not take into account the other schemes coming on stream which will offset any negative aspects which may arise as a result of difficulties experienced by local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities should ensure &mdash; I was a member of a local authority until recently and I know this may be difficult &mdash; that the works to which schemes apply do not duplicate those done by <Col N="1703" /> them.  Difficulties have arisen in this area in the past.  Having examined this situation closely, I understand the problems faced by both sides.  The local authority will do its utmost to carry out the maximum amount of work under a scheme heading which it feels can be done within the confines of the scheme. On the other hand, the unions may see, by virtue of the type of scheme identified, permanent jobs being replaced by jobs under the scheme.  A lot depends on co-operation between the local authorities and the unions in a particular area.  The exercise will benefit the country and the environment and I hope the maximum amount of co-operation can be achieved.</P>

      <P>This section appears to be extremely hard on the self-employed because it states that in order to qualify for an old age contributory pension one may only take into account the previous year's contributions.  Was it not the case that if one had a certain number of stamps, one always qualified for a contributory pension?  Does this section change that by stating that unless one has the correct contributions in a preceding year, one will not get a contributory pension?</P>

      <P>I would have supported Senator Kelleher's amendment, but it was ruled out of order.  There is an anomaly in this area.  At present self-employed people who started to contribute <Col N="1704" /> when they were over 56 years of age do not qualify for a pension and they get a certain percentage of their contributions back.  I would prefer if they had a <i>pro rata</i> pension, as Senator Kelleher proposed.  I have had representations from people who paid for stamps for a year or two years in the past and do not even qualify for the repayment of a portion of their contributions.  That anomaly should be addressed.  Those who have never paid anything and started contributing over the age of 56 get back a portion of their contributions but those who made contributions to social welfare perhaps a number of years earlier, are not repaid any of their contributions they make from age 56 because they paid social insurance contributions &mdash; stamps &mdash; for a year or two.  I would prefer if the spirit of Senator Kelleher's amendment providing for a <i>pro rata</i> pension could be accepted.</P>

      <P>I was a member of the Opposition when this was introduced in 1988 by the then Minister.  Deputy Woods.  I understand the point being made.  If we are trying to get more self-employed people into the PRSI system we should create an opportunity for them to join it.  We could add, for example, voluntary contributions.  Can self-employed people make additional voluntary contributions?  If so, is the <Col N="1705" /> Minister prepared to consider voluntary contributions added before the age of 56?  Could this be backdated?  I agree in principle with Senator Kelleher.  Information on additional voluntary contributions by the self-employed should be forthcoming.  I do not know if it was included in the booklet produced two years ago.  These people should be informed of their benefits.  The more self-employed people there are in the system before they reach the age of 56, the better it will be for them in the long term in terms of State benefits.</P>

      <P>Everybody readily admits that there is a number of anomalies in the system.  I was a member of the Opposition in 1988 when the scheme was introduced.  It was identified then that problems would arise at a later stage.  However, several of these matters have been referred to by the pension board's report on <i>pro rata</i> pensions in general.</P>
      <P>Contributions made by people prior to 1953 are not taken into account as a result of the Social Welfare Act which determined the present system of contributory pensions.  Some people have the average of 20 contributions required to qualify for the minimum contributory pension, which is approximately 85 per cent of the maximum but there are people who have 19 &mdash; one less &mdash; who do not qualify for a contributory pension. A combination of the 19 can be made up of those who were over 56 in 1988 who, despite adding self-contributions and previous contributions they may have had in employment, are still short and find themselves with no pension. There is a number of anomalies.  A review of the implications in that area is taking place in the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible to accept an amendment which would have financial implications for the Exchequer.  The financial consequences of the proposed amendment would be great, perhaps £300 million to £400 million.  That is a substantial <Col N="1706" /> figure.  This problem can only be resolved on a gradual basis over a number of years.  Ultimately, it must be tackled.  However, it is also a problem that will disappear by itself ultimately. Over a period of years the problem will decrease.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;are doing very well at present.  If the pension board report was implemented those pensioners would suffer a dramatic reduction in their pensions.  This is a problem and it is not a simple one.  This problem should have been envisaged several years ago. It should have been provided for in 1988 but it was not.  The debate will arise as to whether it is more beneficial for the individual to get back part of their contributions. Indications were given that, under the 1988 Act, people in that category would be entitled to some of their contributions.  I am not certain that is such a great idea from their point of view.  Changes might take place in the future which ultimately might be beneficial to people who are disadvantaged now.  It might be beneficial to them today to get their contributions back, although it could have a negative effect on the Department's social welfare fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of people who have made considerable contributions to contributory pensions over a long number of years are obviously disadvantaged by <Col N="1707" /> virtue of the fact that they do not now qualify for a pension.  It is particularly worrying for individuals who see that missing one contribution means they find themselves with no pension.  The ideal solution was to introduce a pro rata system a few years ago.  That was not done and, unfortunately, we now have people with the minimum 20 contributions receiving an 85 per cent pension while those with one less receive no pension.  The financial implications of a change in the system for those with limited contributions at present are huge as are the financial implications for the Exchequer because opening the system to everybody would mean not interfering with those who have the minimum contributions now and who qualify for the 85 per cent pension.</P>

      <P>The Minister is inclined to blame the Minister of 1988 for not introducing a scheme for <i>pro rata</i> pensions; at least he introduced the scheme. Is it not now appropriate that the present Minister for Social Welfare amend the legislation so that a <i>pro rata</i> pension would be paid?  There is no point harking back to 1988.  The Minister at that time gave self-employed people an opportunity to receive a pension. Unfortunately, people who were 56 years of age will not qualify.  All they will receive is the return of their contributions. Is it not timely for the present Minister for Social Welfare to amend the scheme through legislation so that a <i>pro rata</i> pension will be made available to these people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said at the outset, a review is taking place within the Department of the implications and consequences of not making this provision at an earlier date.  The Minister and I have requested this review.  We have no wish to exacerbate the position or create a divisive public debate, but there are serious financial implications. <Col N="1708" /> We will endeavour to deal with the problem to the satisfaction of those disadvantaged at present.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to accept the amendment. It would result in serious breaches of financial guidelines.  It could militate against those who are contributors at present and may remain so for the foreseeable future, younger people.  In time we will have to face this problem against the backdrop of the changing age profile of our population; it may not be possible for younger people to finance that proposal.</P>
      <P>I attended an informal conference of European Social Affairs Ministers at which this question was examined.  All European countries have difficulties in collecting contributions adequate to meet social welfare pension requirements, while keeping those contributions pitched low enough not to become a deterrent to employment.  We recognise the difficulties, which will have to be tackled at some stage.  The Minister and I are anxious to do so, but we cannot in the short term for the reasons I gave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is being fair.  It is not a happy outcome for those involved, but for the future we must consider those over 56 who do not have benefits.  We have to recognise that if they do not receive a <i>pro rata</i> increase the State will have to provide for it in another way.  It is only when people reach a certain age that they realise they have to provide themselves with a pension. Young people in particular do not recognise this.  Unfortunately, many people are caught in this dilemma, but we should make no apologies for looking after the less well off over the age of 56.  Benefits should be given to those who do not get them at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Booklets and information on pensions should be made available to younger working people.  In the future there will be EU legislation laying down what social welfare and social services <Col N="1709" /> provisions we can make, how pensions will adapt, what people should do for themselves and what provisions should be taxed.  The Minister has admitted this should be examined.</P>
    <P>I am sorry for the people involved.  It is sad that a 20 year old gets all the benefits but a 19 year old gets none. That should not happen.  We should be planning from the age of 15 on and they should get a contribution accordingly.  I am prepared to agree to the section, but we should think about the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>All of us are concerned about individuals who come to us who are not eligible for pensions.  On Second Stage I said there were many problems, including those mentioned by the Minister. It is estimated that in 25 years time the number of people over 66 in Ireland will have increased by over 50 per cent. Given the decline in the birth rate, the number working to support those on pensions will be greatly diminished.</P>
      <P>It was said last week that 1.4 million people depend on social welfare.  That includes pensioners &mdash; we tend to think only the unemployed on the live register are depending on the State, but the number is huge.  There are no easy options and the resources available to the State must be shared.  The Government will be faced with difficult choices, involving the distribution of money between younger and older people.</P>
      <P>As legislators, we should promote private social security provisions. People should be aware they may have to provide pensions for themselves.  This should be discussed more in this House. I hope the Minister can come to us during the year to debate these other issues, which are relevant to the future of this society and could be discussed in greater detail, separate from the Social Welfare Bill.</P>

      <P>On the question of social welfare for the self-employed, people who have worked all their lives <Col N="1710" /> as tradesmen and have an excellent record of contributions paid to the State have found they cannot get employment unless they produce a C2 certificate for the contractor.  When they work under a C2 they are in a different category. Consequently, if such a person becomes ill or unemployed after 12 months or so, they are in trouble.  I ask the Department to examine this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the point raised by Senator Sherlock.  The same issue arises for share fishermen.  All of us in public life have come across cases where a long period on C2 certificates has caused problems for people in later years.  People have not been sufficiently aware that at some stage they will depend on a pension, if they are lucky enough to live to that age.  Unfortunately, younger people have not given enough thought to that, which will create problems.</P>
      <P>There are other anomalies about contributions. At present people may have made up to 24 contributions per year between starting work and retiring, but part of that contribution period may have been before 1953.  This is where the anomaly really arises.  A person with 20 average contributions since 1953 actually qualifies for approximately 85 per cent of a pension while the person with several contributions more on average over their working life qualifies for no pension at all.  A considerable number of people are caught by that anomaly.</P>
      <P>The whole question of the social welfare fund, the pensions fund and provision for the future was adequately put by Senator Honan.  We all have to look at the implications for the future in that regard and we should do it now; it should have been done before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although Senator Kelleher saw it otherwise, I was not being politically critical when I mentioned 1988.  In my personal opinion, the private sector should have been used to a greater <Col N="1711" /> extent in 1988.  Senators should remember that we are dealing with a situation where there is an ongoing guaranteed cash flow which can be utilised to good effect by the Department of Social Welfare in making provision for the future. We need to look at that in the context of any review which takes place.</P>
    <P>I note the point made about private enterprise and about provision being made entirely through that area.  I am not so sure that is the ideal situation either, because there are difficulties no matter which way is chosen.  A combination of the public and the private sector may well have to be utilised at some stage in the future in order to meet future requirements.  We had a small profit last year of about £50 million on the social welfare fund.  While £50 million is insignificant in the context of total social welfare expenditure and total social welfare needs in the future, it is still a significant figure in itself, and to what extent that will be repeated in subsequent years remains to be seen.</P>
    <P>All options must be examined.  This area is being examined in the Department at the moment.  There are two bottom lines.  The State has to protect any money that it may invest in a way which will be beneficial to pensioners at a later stage.  The State's resources and investment must be protected.  Likewise, the people who reach retirement age also need to be protected and the State has a duty to protect their interests in that situation.  Hopefully, we will achieve something in the course of the review that is taking place.  That is the objective. Whether we are successful or not will remain to be seen.</P>

      <P>Section 22 involves certain situations that are allowed to prevail if somebody is in prison.  I have a question for the Minister.  What is the authority of a chief executive officer of a health board to interfere with the benefits or payments due to people who are legally in custody in psychiatric hospitals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The existing provisions governing payments to people while absent from the State or in prison vary from area to area.  Generally speaking, the chief executive officers have a dual role in the sense that they have a responsibility to the individuals themselves and their families and they also have a responsibility to their boards which must operate within given financial constraints.  Having spent a considerable number of years as a member of one of those boards I have, as I am sure have all Members, had the experience in the past of seeing regulations applied by chief executive officers of health boards which in one instance may be desirable, acceptable and beneficial, depending on one's standpoint, but which may be seen as negative, disruptive <Col N="1713" /> and obstructive from a different angle.  The reality of the situation is that the chief executive officers have a dual responsibility and they have operated within those constraints to the best of their ability.  I suspect the Senator is talking about individual cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I did not make myself clear.  I am asking whether the chief executive officer of a health board has the authority to confiscate a large portion, in some cases up to 90 per cent, of the payment made to a patient under the Social Welfare Acts, even though that person is there for treatment and may at a later stage leave that hospital. Does the chief executive officer have that right, even though the patient is entitled to the payment by contribution? I do not want to confuse this with people who may be in geriatric hospitals.  I am talking about people who are incarcerated under the Mental Treatment Act, 1945.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, he has.  It would appear that an individual case inspired the question.  There is nothing wrong with the question.  The chief executive officer has powers under the Act.  I cannot recall them exactly from memory but we can make them available to the Senator.  Over the years this situation has come up on a number of occasions and, depending on the vantage point of the individual asking the question, it can be seen as being necessary and very important that the interests of the board be kept to the fore by ensuring that provision is made for the patient's upkeep.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note the point raised that this might not necessarily be a voluntary situation. It would not be a voluntary situation under that particular Act in any event. Provision is made for the patient's upkeep, and resources are deducted at source for that provision.  There has been contention and argument about that over the years, and not only in relation to the Mental Health Act but in relation to hospitals generally.  The provision is there and this is permissible. Generally speaking, it is also provided <Col N="1714" /> for that the individual patient will have a certain amount of pocket money, for want of a better word, made available to them.  Again, that has been the subject of considerable contention over the years.  The answer might not be what the Senator has in mind.</P>
    <P>It would appear from my experience on a health board that, when this issue was discussed on numerous occasions, the answer is yes and that generally speaking this is provided for.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>A question has been raised in regard to psychiatric patients. There may be a need for the Department of Social Welfare to check with health boards to see if regulations exist. Such regulations existed some years ago and health boards had no hesitation in giving copies of them showing how deductions were made and what percentage was put by for patients.  Now there is a question as to whether in some instances anything is put by for patients or whether they get a weekly allowance.  This may be attributable to the financial constraints.  It is a social welfare pension payable to a person and there is a need to see if regulations are in force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the section which states that in certain circumstances a person who is outside the State or in prison should lose a benefit. However, we are talking about members of the community who have not committed a crime and who are legally held in custody under the 1945 Mental Treatment Act.  They are held in some cases against their will and their money is being taken from them.  I always found this to be obnoxious.  It is inappropriate that the chief executive officer has the power and authority to confiscate a person's contributory disability benefit or contributory invalidity pension while they were committed to a psychiatric hospital for treatment.  I suggest <Col N="1715" /> that this should be further investigated.</P>
      <P>These people are not in hospital because they have committed a crime, but because society felt they needed compulsory treatment.  However, society has overstepped the mark by giving the people to whose care they are entrusted the authority to remove up to perhaps 80 or 90 per cent of their weekly payments.  I was a member of a health board for many years and I worked for the Dublin health authority for some years before that.  I hold strong views on this and I have challenged chief executive officers and administrators of hospitals on this matter.</P>
      <P>The law is unclear in this regard, although I note the Minister's statement that the chief executive officer has the power to remove a portion of a person's social welfare payment, but he must leave some comfort payment.  The pension of a person who is committed to a psychiatric hospital as a result of the 1945 Act should not be removed against their will.  That is what is happening in psychiatric hospitals if what the Minister said is correct.  If that is the case, the matter should be further investigated and there should be a change in the law. The regulations governing this activity should be brought to the attention of every member of a health board.  To give the authority to a chief executive officer of a health board to remove the pension of a person incarcerated in a hospital against their will is going too far.  I ask the Minister to look into that and make the necessary changes.</P>

      <P>I understand the points raised by Senator Finneran.  As I said.  it is an area which has caused some animated debate at health board meetings. This section refers to that general area. From my recollection, it is something which developed over a period of time. Regulations exist whereby those deductions may be made.  They are also <Col N="1716" /> made from a number of other institutions of a similar nature, not necessarily psychiatric ones.</P>

      <P>That is true.  The pocket money to which I referred is supposed to be made available.  I understand that it is made available or is retained for the patient for whatever length of time is required.  I will endeavour to identify the precise regulations or legislation and I will make it available to Senator Finneran. A person can also be incarcerated in another institution where similar deductions may be made.</P>
      <P>While I take on board the points made, I point out that I have sat in on health board debates where the opposite view was put forward, which I felt was incorrect.  I agree with the view expressed by Senator Finneran.  If pocket money is provided, it will resolve part of the difficulty.  I cannot give the answer the Senator might like, but I will bring the matter to the attention of the Department and I will inform him of the precise regulations under which that procedure operates.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 15, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>24.  No levy pursuant to the Health Contributions Act, 1979, or the Youth Employment Agency Act, 1981, shall be payable by any married woman in respect of any payment to her of arrears of social welfare payments arising by virtue of the failure by the State to <Col N="1717" /> implement EC employment equality legislation.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The amendment is to ensure that none of the equality payments to be made to the women under the equality legislation will be liable for either the youth employment or the health contribution levy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Honan's amendment.  I do not believe the Minister will have any problem with it, given the tone of his contribution earlier and his commitment to the 70,000 women who hope to get the bulk of their arrears this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The element of social welfare contributions paid since 1970 in respect of death grants need to be reviewed.  If this means increasing the contributions so as to increase the grant, that should be done, because the current grant is so small that it is irrelevant. People expecting to receive an adequate grant from the Department of Social Welfare find that they are getting £100 to cover something that costs between £1,200 and £1,300 in some instances.  If it means that a greater percentage of the contribution should go towards a death grant it would be worthwhile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a positive suggestion. While I cannot accept it in the context <Col N="1718" /> of this Bill, it is something that bears consideration.  That will be done when and if it is possible.  I take the Senator's point that when the death grant was first introduced the cost of funeral expenses was considerably less than it is today; also, in different parts of the country these costs vary considerably. In view of those factors it would be no harm to focus our attention on that aspect.  There is merit in looking at a number of other once-off payments like that where a nominal increase would be greatly appreciated but there would not be a dramatic impact on the Exchequer.  Many of the proposals which have been genuinely put forward would have huge financial implications, whereas suggestions like this one, which do not have such a dramatic financial impact, can be looked at in the context of future proposals.</P>

      <P>In sections 24 and 25, neither the health nor employment levies apply to maintenance payments.  I welcome section 24 (c) and section 25 (c).  It is my understanding, although I may be wrong, that maintenance payments would still be liable to the 5.5 per cent PRSI rate.  Is that correct?  Maintenance payments are made from income that is already liable to PRSI contributions, so are these payments subject to two PRSI deductions at the basic level?</P>
      <P>I accept that health and employment contributions are not subject to those but they are still subject to the basic 5.5. per cent PRSI level.  That is not acceptable because whoever received the payments would be passing them on as maintenance payments and would already have paid PRSI on the income.</P>

      <P>No, it is not unfair, because no provision is made in the <Col N="1720" /> Exchequer to pay it.  My amendment has not been accepted because it involves a potential charge upon the public revenue, but if provision had been made in the Estimates for the Department of Social Welfare to pay this, it could have been accepted.  There is obviously no provision to pay it this year.</P>

      <P>I cannot believe that is the way the Minister for Social Welfare is approaching one section of society.  I tabled this amendment because I had fears.  Every other payment is dated and notated in section 3, but this one is not.  The Minister said it would be done by way of regulation, but there would still need to be provision in the Estimates to pay it if it is to be done by regulation during the current financial year.  Therefore, I can only glean from this that people who are expecting receipt of adoptive leave benefit will not get it despite the fact that that Bill was initiated in this House almost three years ago.</P>

      <P>As a signatory to the amendment, I am also disappointed. Implementing legislation is all very fine, but we have to give financial effect to it. When does the Minister envisage that financial measures will be taken to put into effect what has already been discussed in legislation that went through this House a long time ago?  Our fears have been confirmed by the fact that this amendment has been ruled out of <Col N="1721" /> order as a potential charge on the public revenue.  It should have been included in the Bill in the first place.  I would like to have heard a firm commitment, but unfortunately it is too late.  The Social Welfare Bill will be passed with the support of certain Senators who spoke out loudly against it last year.  The Bill fails to provide finance for legislation that we all welcomed in the House.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Matters. - Donegal Fire Stations.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter on the Adjournment relates to the fire service in Donegal which is operated by Donegal County Council.  At present there are three problem areas which I shall list in order of priority as outlined by Donegal County Council to the Department of the Environment.  The first priority case is Milford; the second is Buncrana and the third relates to the regional headquarters planned for Letterkenny.</P>
      <P>At this stage, Milford appears to be a major problem and, as it stands, is a disaster just waiting to happen.  The Milford fire station covers two peninsulas, Fanad and Rosguill.  In addition to Milford, there are two major population centres in this area, Rathmelton and Rathmullen.  Approximately 20,000-30,000 people live in this area and a large number of tourists visit it.</P>
      <P>The station in Milford dealt with over 50 emergency calls last year.  It is operated by voluntary staff and the tender is housed in an old bread van shed at present.  The problem in Milford is that there is no fire station as such and the staff operate from an old shed which, unfortunately, is located at the back entrances to two pubs and at the front entrances to three pubs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1726" /> One can gather from this that parking in Milford is a problem.  If there is an event on in the town, there is a crazy position of cars being parked outside and behind the fire station.  A car recently had to be lifted to allow the fire tender out to attend a fire.  There are no toilet facilities in this so-called fire station and there is no water supply inside it.  There is one tap outside for cleaning equipment, but the only water inside is that in the tender.</P>
    <P>Buncrana is the second largest town in County Donegal.  It is home to the Fruit of the Loom textile company, which currently has plans with the Department and is awaiting design approval.  In addition to Fruit of the Loom, the Clubman Omega shirt factory is located there.  It is a major industrial town and a major holiday resort. Given these facts a disaster is waiting to happen there.</P>
    <P>The station is manned by volunteers who work under extremely harsh conditions. They live in dread of a major fire in the town.  Their appliances are completely inadequate for what might be required.  Buncrana is the gateway to the Inishowen Peninsula and it is an area with a very high population.  If anything goes wrong, the fire station and staff are not properly equipped to cope.</P>
    <P>A new headquarters in Letterkenny has been planned for some time.  The first design submitted was considered too expensive.  It was returned and a new design, which would be less costly, was requested.  The fire station in Letterkenny is now located in a built up area.  When it was first built, this was not a problem but it is now in the centre of the town rather than on the outskirts and problems are caused by cars being parked in the vicinity.</P>
    <P>The station is located between the employment exchange, the county museum and directly across the road from it is one of the major pubs in the town.  On a regular basis it is not surprising to see the station's entrances at the <Col N="1727" /> front and side blocked by cars.  There is a major problem in Letterkenny and something must be done about it.  The new headquarters must be built.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to find money in 1995 to deal with these matters.  I emphasise the urgency of the situation in Milford; the situation is extremely dangerous.  It is not right that in 1995 we should sit back and wait for a disaster to happen and for lives to be lost because money has not been put into the fire services in County Donegal.  This money is urgently required and I ask the Minister to give this matter urgent consideration.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to advise the Senator and the House of the position concerning the three fire stations about which Donegal County Council has been in contact with my Department.</P>
      <P>The Milford proposal is the most advanced.  Contract documentation prepared by the county council is currently with my Department.  The question of issuing approval to invite tenders for the scheme is being considered in the light of the various demands on the capital allocation of £4.5 million available for the fire service in 1995.  A decision will be made as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>In the case of the proposals for new fire stations in Buncrana and Letterkenny, my Department's information is that Donegal County Council is developing proposals for both schemes to conform with the price limits for fire station projects of the size and type appropriate to these locations.  When detailed proposals are forwarded by the council they will be examined in my Department in the usual way.  However, it is unlikely that the question of providing funding for the schemes will arise in 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1728" /> The Government values very highly the work of the fire service and it is fully aware of the importance of providing up-to-date facilities, equipment and training.  Since 1981, £76.5 million has been invested in the provision of 80 new fire stations, the purchase of over 270 new fire appliances and other fire fighting equipment and the development of a new regional computer-based mobilisation and call-out system.</P>
    <P>In addition, the fire services council has provided 145 training courses, at home and abroad, for a total of approximately 2,700 participants in the last 11 years.  The benefits of this investment have been well spread throughout the country.  In the case of County Donegal, 17 new fire appliances have been bought during the period, at a total cost of £1.8 million.  I assure the House that the council's proposal for a new fire station at Milford will receive full and careful consideration in the allocation of the fire service capital provision for 1995.</P>

      <P>My purpose in raising this matter on the Adjournment is to seek to obtain citizenship through foreign births registration for three brothers, all of whom were born in South Africa.  These three people are being unfairly denied Irish citizenship.</P>
      <P>Their father, who lives in South Africa, has a current Irish passport.  He commenced inquires in 1984 to obtain the necessary information which would enable him to apply for Irish passports for his three sons.  He contacted the Registrar of Births and the parish priest of the parish where he believed his grandmother was born.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>His grandmother was born in 1860. However, as the Minister is probably aware, civil registration of births did not commence in Ireland until 1 January 1864.  As a result, there was no civil record of her birth.  The father also received a negative reply from the parish <Col N="1729" /> priest, who said the birth could not be traced.  This occurred during the period 1984-86.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is aware, the law on Irish citizenship is governed by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts, 1956 and 1986.  The 1986 Act restricted the eligibility to registered great-grand-children of a person born in Ireland. There was also a six months transitional period, which ended on 31 December 1986.  This six months period gave people who would qualify time to prepare the necessary documentation. However, we were unable to trace the birth certificate at that time.</P>
    <P>The father of the three applicants continued his search and his grandmother's birth was eventually traced. However, this happened after 1986.  In 1990, the father, who has an Irish passport, lodged an appeal to have his three sons granted Irish citizenship but the Department of Foreign Affairs rejected his application.  Despite a number of appeals since to many Ministers of different views the application has continued to be refused.</P>
    <P>The people from my constituency who approached me about this matter feel aggrieved that their relations are being deprived of their passports.  We are talking about three men who are descendants of Irish people.  They have Irish blood in their veins.  They have an attachment to and an affinity with this country and they want Irish citizenship. They are people of modest means and do not have the funds which would enable them to come in under the rules governing the granting of citizenship through investment in Ireland.  They do not want citizenship on the basis of a cheque book, rather as of right.  This is a genuine case, which does not require a red tape response but one which is based on understanding, common sense and, above all, fair play.</P>

      <P>I have every sympathy with the person in question.  His grandmother was born in Ireland.  He has acquired Irish citizenship on that basis in accordance with the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, and he is anxious that his children also have that option.  Under the 1956 Act it was possible for great-grand-children of persons born in Ireland to be registered as Irish citizens in the foreign births register at the Department of Foreign Affairs provided one of their parents was already registered and the great-grandchildren were born on or after 17 July 1956.</P>
      <P>The 1956 Act was amended by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1986.  One of the main provisions of the new Act was the fixing of a date &mdash; 31 December 1986 &mdash; after which the birth abroad of a great-grandchild could be registered in the foreign births register only if the birth of a father or mother was registered before the great-grand-child's birth.  A period of grace of six months from 1 July to 31 December 1986 was allowed during which the foreign births registration provisions of the 1956 Act continued to apply.  This transition period was widely publicised, particularly in South Africa, where thousands of people of Irish descent applied to the consulate in Johannesburg for registration.</P>
      <P>As Senator Enright has stated, the person in question had great difficulty in getting evidence of his grandmother's birth in Ireland.  The relevant baptismal registration was not finally located in Kilcock until sometime in 1987.  On the basis of his grandmother's baptismal certificate his birth was registered in the foreign births register on 16 August 1989, and his Irish citizenship dates from then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1 January 1987 births abroad of great-grandchildren can be registered only where the birth of the relevant parent <Col N="1731" /> was registered before the grand-child's birth.  Unfortunately for the children of the person in question the law does not allow us to register their births. The Act leaves no discretion to any Minister.  We are very sorry, therefore, not to be able to accede to the request <Col N="1732" /> and I hope the Senator understands why the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs has no flexibility in the matter.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 9.5 p.m. until 12 noon on Wednesday, 5 April 1995.</P>
