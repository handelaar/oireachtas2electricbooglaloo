      <P>I have notice from Senator Henry that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to ensure that all doctors can fulfil their ethical obligations to their patients.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Kelleher of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to consider the reintroduction of livestock quarantine for animal imports.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Cotter of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to increase substantially the rate support grant notified to Castleblayney Urban District Council for 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senators Henry and Kellehers' matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  The other <Col N="1250" /> Senator may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>Today's business will be items Nos. 1, 2 and 13, motion 24. Item No. 1 will be taken until 4 p.m. with a time limit of 20 minutes per speaker if that is agreeable.  Item No. 2 will be taken from 4 p.m. until 6 p.m. and item No. 24 from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. If Second Stage of item No. 1 has not concluded by 4 p.m. it will recommence at 8 p.m. or after Private Members' time, which provides a certain incentive to Members.  There will be a sos today from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.</P>

      <P>In relation to the next week and the days we are sitting, would the Leader outline the Government's intended legislative programme between now and then?  I also wish to remind him of an issue that I raised with him before, that of item No. 13, motion No. 2 on the Order Paper in relation to international funding.  The Leader might give that item priority when he is planning his programme for the new year. As the Leader is well aware major funding is now available for that programme and it is important that this House has an opportunity of discussing the special money for the Border counties.</P>

      <P>The Leader is to be congratulated on his neat footwork.  He is avoiding very studiously any temptation to introduce the guillotine to which he so strenuously objected when he was on this side of the House.  Is it the Leader's intention to try to finish item No. 1, the Courts and Court Officers Bill, 1995?</P>

      <P>The other matter is to do with the report in this morning's newspaper about the Council of Europe's report on the treatment of prisoners. We have had several calls here for a debate on crime in general.  Whatever <Col N="1251" /> one's concern might be for alleged mistreatment, we need to put it into context. The newspaper report does not say that anybody was mistreated except in one particular case in Limerick, but it says that in Garda barracks, if I read it correctly, people run a not inconsiderable risk of being illtreated.  That is altogether different from saying that people were illtreated.  We have all seen the pictures of the two people who were attacked in Galway and what happened to them.  The protection of their human rights is just as important as the protection of the rights of people in custody. For all of those reasons it would be appropriate that we discuss this matter in the near future.</P>

      <P>When the Leader answered my question concerning the role of the DPP yesterday, he suggested that it should be raised during today's debate on the Courts and Court Officer's Bill, 1995.  I have read this Bill again.  The DPP is not a court officer, therefore it would not be appropriate to discuss the role of the DPP in this Bill.  A huge number of people are concerned about the role of the DPP and his office in the justice system in Ireland at present.  It should not be debated in an inappropriate area such as the Courts and Court Officers Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned UNICEF yesterday and the fact that two million children have died in conflicts during the past ten years.  It has been suggested that the Irish media reported on this matter, but <Col N="1252" /> that is incorrect.  The media received a PR statement produced by one of the aid agencies working abroad and <i>The Irish Times,</i> the <i>Irish Independent</i> and the <i>Cork Examiner</i> each carried the same report in relation to this issue.  No Irish journalist has acquainted the Irish public with the fact that two million children have died as a result of international conflicts.  It is disgraceful that the Irish media do not care whether these children die.</P>
    <P>I request that this House be given an early opportunity to discuss the matter of international conflicts, particularly in relation to the number of children who unwillingly become involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Leader received a response from the Minister for Health with regard to his coming to this House to discuss the hepatitis C tribunal?  Last night the Minister informed the Lower House that he intends to announce the establishment of the tribunal this week. I have repeatedly requested that this House be given an opportunity to discuss the matter.  The House will sit tomorrow for the last time this week.  I believe that next week will be too late for such a discussion to take place.  This situation is unfair.  Will the Leader arrange that the Minister for Health come before the House tomorrow?</P>
      <P>On the Order of Business two weeks ago I raised the matter of the dispute in the Midland Health Board where nurses are working to rule in three hospitals in Portlaoise, Mullingar and Tullamore.  I asked the Leader if the Minister for Health might also address the House in relation to this issue.  The Minister's attendance has been promised for a long time.  Senator Finneran and I have raised many matters in relation to health.  The House is sitting tomorrow and next week and I believe that it is time that the Minister came before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>At present about eight interdepartmental committees operate under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach.  These committees deal <Col N="1253" /> with various aspects of planning and development and anti-poverty and local development issues.  I am surprised that no women representatives serve on some of these committees.  Of the larger committees, 22 members serve on both the anti-poverty and local development committees.  In each case there are only two women members.  I am surprised that the Taoiseach has permitted such a situation to exist because he made a major issue of having equal representation for women on the boards of State companies and other bodies which discuss important matters.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader inform the House with regard to whether the Taoiseach intends to address this situation?  Will the House be afforded an opportunity to discuss the work of these important strategic interdepartmental committees, some of which deal with long-term planning, European affairs and other issues? There is little or no representation for women on these committees and we know very little about the work they carry out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Honan's request that the Minister for Health attend the House.  I raised this matter last week and asked that the Leader consider providing Government time to deal with it.  He will be aware that the motion tabled by my party in relation to this issue remains on the Order Paper. We appreciate that the matter is under debate in the Lower House at present, but this House should not be slighted in relation to a discussion on it.  I hope that the Leader will provide an opportunity to debate the matter either this week or next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also wish to raise the matter of the current influenza epidemic in England. While no such epidemic exists in Ireland, in the region of 12 cases have been identified throughout the country. Can the Leader request that the Minister for Health ensure that adequate supplies of flu vaccine are made available to GPs and health centres?  This can be a very worrying time for people suffering with other medical conditions <Col N="1254" /> and the elderly.  We do not want a repeat of past situations where, when the need arose, adequate supplies of the vaccine were not available.  Will the Leader request that the Minister for Health ensure that adequate supplies of vaccine are made available to general practitioners and health boards?  Perhaps he might inform the House of the up to date situation within the next week in order that people's fears may be allayed during the Christmas period?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Daly's remarks in relation to interdepartmental committees and gender balance. Perhaps it is time to dispense with the requirement, introduced by the Minister for Education and others, which requires a 40 per cent gender balance on committees.  This requirement now seem to ring somewhat hollow in practice.  I believe that it is no longer politically correct, even in countries which introduced the term &ldquo;political correctness&rdquo;.  Women are increasingly being pitchforked onto committees in order that legislative requirements might be satisfied.  There seems to be no direction to this policy.</P>
      <P>In that context, Senator Honan and I happen&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>We can have an argument or debate on the subject at a later date.  This is just my opinion.  Yesterday, Senator Honan and I attended a meeting of the National Economic and Social Forum at which the Minister for Social Welfare outlined a challenging prospect for the future.  One of the things that came across during the Minister's speech was that 240 submissions in relation to the area of anti-poverty were received from places throughout the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Prudent housekeeping and financial management have been, and will continue to be, the hallmarks of this administration.  I am sure that the <Col N="1256" /> Intoxicating Liquor Bill, which owes a great deal to Senator Bohan, will pass all Stages very quickly.  It is a very simple Bill and will be introduced next week.</P>
      <P>The subject of flooding will also be dealt with before the end of session.  I am unsure of the format this will take.  I have received an undertaking that the Minister will be available to answer questions in relation to this issue.  Flooding will, therefore, be dealt with next week.</P>
      <P>There is also an agricultural Bill which deals with representation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Senator. This is also a short Bill and will be introduced before the end of session.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis raised the matter of the Courts and Court Officers Bill and also raised a very interesting question in relation to the report of the Council of Europe.  This is a very important report which merits careful consideration and should not be subject to soundbite treatment. However, a tendency may exist to highlight the spectacular rather than the substantial elements contained in the report.  I hope to have a debate early in the next session on that report and the allied questions raised yesterday of conditions in prisons and so forth, all of which are covered in it.</P>
      <P>In answer to Senator Lanigan, we will have to find a way to discuss the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I am not sure how we will do this but we can discuss it later.  I note his concerns about UNICEF.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Honan and Senator Finneran raised the question of hepatitis C.  It is not a question of slighting this House by not having a debate this week but it would seem to be a pointless duplication to have a debate in the other House and a simultaneous debate here.  Let us see the outcome of the debate in the other House and what new information is made available there.  We can look at the matter again as the Minister will be <Col N="1257" /> in the House next session for a wide ranging debate on health.  I will try to return tomorrow to Senator Finneran's question on the flu vaccine.</P>
    <P>We would welcome a debate on gender balance because this Government has nothing to fear from its record in that regard nor on the quality of the women which it has appointed and will appoint to State boards.  It is an issue worthy of a full debate and we would be willing to make time available next session.</P>

    <Title>Courts and Court Officers Bill, 1995: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Ms Burton) Austin Currie">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Courts and Court Officers Bill, 1994, contained measures aimed at improving the courts system.  Those measures have been retained in the present Bill with some significant changes and improvements, but the Courts and Court Officers Bill before the House today addresses in a more effective way the problem of the arrears of cases and appeals awaiting hearing before the courts.  It also contains many more provisions which will implement much needed administrative and procedural reforms to improve the efficiency of the courts system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That system is overdue a full reappraisal and a new approach.  The courts have been trying to provide a reasonable level of service in recent times in the face of modern day demands and pressures.  There has been a significant increase in the amount of business coming before the courts over the past number of years in practically all areas of the law &mdash; in civil actions, personal injuries litigation, family law business and criminal cases.  Not only is there more business <Col N="1258" /> but the trend is that cases and appeals are more complex now and, therefore, more time consuming than in the past.  Changes to the limits of the jurisdiction of the courts and developments in the family law area have had a tremendous impact on the amount and complexity of business coming before the courts.  The courts system has not been able to keep up with this growth in the number of cases and appeals.</P>
    <P>Let us be in no doubt that long delays in having cases resolved means that the system of justice is letting down many litigants, victims of crime and, to some extent, the community as a whole. Delays in the courts can also adversely affect the smooth running of the business and commercial sector.  This, I believe, could undermine public confidence in the system of justice.  It is the recognition that justice delayed is justice denied that informs the overall approach to tackling the problems in the courts system.</P>
    <P>Under the Courts and Court Officers Bill, 1994, a new Court of Appeal was to have tackled the accumulation of appeals awaiting a hearing by the Supreme Court.  An advisory commission on the courts was to have been set up.  It is a fair indication of the extent of reassessment of the 1994 Bill that the present Bill, together with the proposals for the longer term development of the courts system, differ markedly from what was proposed in these key areas in the 1994 Bill.</P>
    <P>The approach to reforming the courts service will be on three levels: first, to tackle immediately the problem of delays in all the courts by providing in this Bill for 18 more judges; second, to implement in this Bill several other changes in courts administration and procedure that will also reduce delays and enhance the efficiency of the courts service and third, to develop a longer term approach to improving our courts system.</P>
    <P>On this last point, I will be taking the opportunity to refer in a few moments to the Working Group on the Courts Commission which was recently set up. <Col N="1259" /> This Bill addresses the immediate problem of delays in the system but it is vital that we address now the issue of what kind of courts service we will have in five, ten or 15 years time.  We cannot lose sight of that.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the 1994 Bill proposed the setting up of a Court of Appeal comprised of three additional High Court judges to deal mainly with appeals against decisions of the High Court in personal injuries cases and to relieve the problem of delays in hearing appeals in the Supreme Court.  Having reviewed that proposal, it was concluded that the proposed Court of Appeal would fall short of the target of clearing the arrears of appeals before the Supreme Court.  An Appeal Court hearing appeals predominantly from decisions in personal injuries cases could not be justified even though it was also to have incorporated the jurisdiction of the Court of Criminal Appeal. This conclusion was reached following consultation with the senior Judiciary and others.  The Minister was not convinced that the proportion of personal injury appeals that come to a hearing and the nature of those appeals would have generated enough business to keep the proposed Court of Appeal fully occupied.  In addition, the proposed Court of Appeal would possibly have generated a further tier of appeals from that court to the Supreme Court.  That would have defeated the purpose of the proposed court.  It would also have been highly inefficient as it would have led to further delays in the system and greater costs.</P>
    <P>The real pressure on the Supreme Court comes from the very considerable increase in the length and complexity of appeals other than personal injuries appeals.  The same applies in relation to civil cases in the High Court.  In the Supreme Court, a further factor is that the statutory maximum number of judges of the Supreme Court has remained static at five, including the Chief Justice, for several decades while the number of judges of the High Court <Col N="1260" /> increased at various times over the period from six to the current maximum of 17.  This means that there has been a great increase in the volume of decisions that can be appealed to the Supreme Court without a corresponding adjustment in the Supreme Court to cope with that increase.  Appeals relating to the Constitution or complex appeals against decisions in major commercial law cases often require immediate attention.  We have seen many of these in recent years but that necessary prioritising of business results in other appeals, especially personal injury appeals, being put back. It is unfair to the individual litigant to have to wait so long for an outcome to his or her appeal.  We must enable the Supreme Court to make inroads on those arrears.</P>
    <P>The approach in section 6 is to provide for an increase of three in the number of Supreme Court judges giving seven judges, in addition to the Chief Justice.  Section 7 enables the court to sit in two or more divisions at the same time, thus allowing two or more appeals to be heard simultaneously.  This will enable the Supreme Court to sit in divisions of three judges for most appeals or in two divisions of three and five judges where a court of at least five judges is required.  Section 7 stipulates that a court of not less than five judges would deal with matters arising under Articles 12 to 26 of the Constitution which refer respectively to the President and to the reference of Bills to the Supreme Court, or a question of the validity of any law having regard to the provisions of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Under section 7 of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961, such matters must be heard by five Supreme Court judges.  By virtue of section 7 of the Bill, therefore, the Chief Justice may determine that the full court may sit in such cases.  It is envisaged that the full court will sit only on rare occasions.  I am convinced that enabling the Supreme Court to hear more than one case at the same time is the most effective way of tackling the arrears of appeals at Supreme Court level and <Col N="1261" /> enabling the court to deal with the increasing number and complexity of appeals which must be heard.</P>
    <P>A further development affecting the Supreme Court is contained in section 2 (1) of the Bill.  This section enables the Government by order, following consultation with the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court, to abolish the Court of Criminal Appeal and to transfer its jurisdiction to the Supreme Court.  It is intended that such an order will be made when the arrears of civil appeals in the Supreme Court are brought under control.</P>
    <P>Moving on to the other courts, sections 9, 10 and 11 of the Bill increase the statutory maximum number of judges from 16 to 19 in the High Court, from 17 to 24 in the Circuit Court and from 45 to 50 in the District Court, not including the presidents of those courts &mdash; an overall increase of 15 judges in these courts.  That represents a very considerable commitment on the part of this Government to tackling the backlog of cases and appeals before these courts.</P>
    <P>I want to focus in the time available to me on the Circuit Court.  The accumulation of civil business, including family law business in the Circuit Court, is a considerable difficulty for many people.  The provision for an additional seven judges in the Circuit Court is a considerable investment but I am confident that this will produce a worthwhile return to the public.</P>
    <P>There are two important factors that have brought about the current accumulation of cases in the Circuit Court. First, the Courts Act, 1991, increased the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court from £15,000 to £30,000 which resulted in a major increase in the volume of civil business for hearing in the court.  It appears this increase in court business is permanent and will probably grow.  Civil cases before the Circuit Court are now more numerous, complex and time consuming than before.</P>
    <P>The second factor at Circuit Court level is the huge increase in family law business.  The Judicial Separation and <Col N="1262" /> Family Law Reform Act, 1989, transferred the majority of family law business in the courts to the Circuit Court. This and the fact that more people are having recourse to the court in these proceedings has led to a marked increase in the volume of family law business in the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>Delays in the hearing of family law business in a number of Circuit Court venues lead to a significant human cost not only to the parties involved but also to their families.  Additional judges in the Circuit Court are badly needed to eliminate the present delays there and to deal with the volume of civil and family business in that court.  One point that continuously came up in the recent divorce referendum debate was the difficulty experienced by people in separation cases in getting reasonably rapid access to the court and this is a serious problem.</P>
    <P>While I have concentrated in my remarks on the Supreme Court and Circuit Court, it must be said that there are also similar problems in the High Court and District Court.  The appointment of additional judges to all four courts is an essential step to turn around the business of the courts and to improve matters in the courts system with immediate effect.  Government approval has also been obtained for the provision of comprehensive administrative back up for the new judges.  I should make it clear, however, that in no way do I see increasing the statutory number of judges as the only solution to deal with the current problems.  This approach will work in conjunction with other reforms contained in this Bill to improve efficiency in the courts.</P>
    <P>As regards the longer term development of the courts service, the Minister for Justice has decided to institute a full reappraisal of the entire existing courts system.  With that in mind Government approval was obtained last summer for the setting up of a working group on a Courts Commission.  That group, to be chaired by Mrs. Justice Susan Denham of the Supreme Court, was set up a number of weeks ago.  This provides an <Col N="1263" /> opportunity for a thorough examination of the courts system to ensure it is meeting the needs of today's society.  This development will no doubt make a vital contribution to the modernising of our courts system.  The group is broadly representative and that is essential.  We must have the views and be in a position to draw on the experience of the Judiciary, the legal professions and the relevant Government Departments as well as other types of experience, such as that of Women's Aid and the rape crisis centres.</P>
    <P>The working group will be reviewing the operation and financing of the courts system with particular regard to the quality of service provided to the public.  That should be the bottom line for the development of the service.  In light of that, the group has been asked to consider the matter of the establishment of a commission on the management of the courts as an independent and permanent body with financial and management autonomy in line with the commitment to that effect in the Government of Renewal programme.</P>
    <P>This is a better approach than adopting the advisory model for a courts commission, which was a feature of the 1994 Bill.  This Government has taken the view that working towards an independent body responsible to the Government for the management of the courts service would be a more effective and efficient approach.  That strategy, however, needs to be carefully developed in the forum of the working group.  The working group will be well placed to address all of the many and varied issues that no doubt will arise.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill deals with judicial appointments and provides for the setting up of a Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  This will introduce an important new dimension to the procedure for judicial appointment.  The 1994 Bill also provided for the setting up of a Judicial Appointments Advisory Board and I will be dealing in a moment with a number of important differences between that board as proposed and the <Col N="1264" /> one that will be set up under the terms of the present Bill.</P>
    <P>I would like to briefly put these new arrangements in perspective.  The procedure for appointing judges is governed by the Constitution.  Article 35 provides that the judges of the Supreme Court, the High Court and all other courts shall be appointed by the President. That power is exercisable and performable on the advice of the Government.  That fundamental arrangement is, of course, unaffected by this Bill.  I need hardly say that our Judiciary is widely respected for its fairness, integrity and independence.  The focus of these measures is, however, on the Government's role in the judicial appointments process.  Because of the Government's central role in the appointment of judges, there should be guarantees to ensure that procedures to appoint judges are not only appropriate but are seen to be so.</P>
    <P>The advisory board's role will be to shortlist and recommend barristers and solicitors to the Government for appointment to judicial office by the President.  The scope of the provision as defined in section 12 is similar to that proposed in the 1994 Bill in that the new arrangements will not cover appointments to Chief Justice or as president of the other courts.  This is a prudent exclusion because the Government, in considering appointments to these leading judicial posts, will want to promote continuity in the courts system.  That is why section 23 provides that the Government, when considering those appointments, shall have to first have regard to the suitability of serving judges of those courts.</P>
    <P>Section 17 further defines the scope of the new procedures.  That section provides, in effect, that where the Government proposes to advise the President to appoint a serving judge to a higher court, the procedures of the board shall not apply.  In other words, the new appointments procedure will apply to the first appointment of a barrister or a solicitor as a judge.  It is appropriate that a person whom Government has in the <Col N="1265" /> past considered suitable for judicial appointment should be exempt from the board's procedures where the Government is proposing to advise the President on the further judicial appointment of that judge.</P>
    <P>The composition of the board provided for in the 1994 Bill was not sufficiently representative.  In fact, there was no provision for any representative other than that of the Judiciary or the legal professions.  The main change in section 13 is that the Minister will have the right to nominate to the board three persons who have appropriate knowledge or experience.  This will allow the Minister to introduce a wide range of experience into the process, such as nominees with commercial, administrative and consumer backgrounds &mdash; in other words, those who can represent people who rely on the courts on a daily basis.  Representatives of victims of crime, women's groups and perhaps other bodies could bring an invaluable new perspective to the consideration of the suitability of candidates for judicial appointment.  Of course, all those interests could not be accommodated in the first round of nominees, but the provision for a three year renewable term of appointment allows the option of introducing a broad range of influence over a longer period of time.</P>
    <P>A further change in the composition of the board is that the Attorney General of the day would be a member.  The Attorney General of the day would be uniquely suitable, with his or her knowledge of the legal profession, to be a member of the board.  Under section 18, the board will be able to recommend the Attorney General for a judicial appointment, However, when the board is considering the Attorney for appointment, he or she will be required to withdraw from the deliberations of the board.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides for the submission by the board of the names of all persons who have been considered by the board for appointment, with the board recommending at least seven persons. <Col N="1266" /> Requiring the board to recommend only three to five names, as proposed in the 1994 Bill, would give the Government little discretion in the matter of judicial appointments, which it has by virtue of the constitutional arrangements relating to the matter.  For this reason the board should be required to recommend a reasonable number of names.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that where fewer than seven persons wish to be considered for appointment or where the board is unable to recommend seven persons, the board may recommend a lesser number of names for appointment. Where more than one vacancy arises, the board will be required to submit at least seven names for each vacancy or such a lesser number as the Minister may specify after consultation with the board.  The intention here is to avoid imposing an obligation on the board to produce a large number of recommendations which could prove to be difficult in the event of a number of vacancies arising in the same court.</P>
    <P>The recommendation of the advisory board will not be binding on the Government.  That is appropriate, mindful of the constitutional position relating to judicial appointments.  It is nevertheless expressly provided in section 16 that the Government shall first have regard to the names recommended by the board in advising the President on the appointment of a judge.  This is a significant direction to Government and one that highlights the pivotal role the new board will have.  To ensure that the input of the board is on the public record, section 16 also requires that the notice of appointment published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> shall indicate when a judge has been appointed on the recommendation of the board.</P>
    <P>Section 48 will enable the Minister to provide funds for judicial courses arranged by the Judiciary.  The provision of suitable courses is necessary to enable judges to keep up to date with developments in a range of legal and other areas.  The senior Judiciary has already taken initiatives in this area and <Col N="1267" /> funding has already been provided for seminars in the past.  I understand that the Chief Justice is setting up a judicial studies institute which will have responsibility both for an induction course for newly appointed judges and a continuing course of education and training for members of the Judiciary. Those countries which already have this facility have found it enormously useful, especially in new and developing areas. The clearest example in this country would be family law developments and court cases relating to women, especially with regard to rape cases.</P>
    <P>Under section 19, persons wishing to be considered for judicial appointment by the advisory board must agree to take training courses if appointed and if so required by the Chief Justice or president of the court to which they are appointed.  This is a better approach than that proposed in the 1994 Bill, whereby the Minister would make regulations requiring training for candidates aspiring to judicial appointment.  I am sure this would be unworkable, not least because it would discourage well qualified persons from seeking judicial appointment as they would be required to undertake a course without any guarantee of being appointed.</P>
    <P>Apart from increasing the number of judges, the Bill contains several measures to improve efficiency in the interests of users of the court.  I wish to explain the most significant of these. Section 25 will increase the jurisdiction of the Master of the High Court to enable the Master to deal with the range of applications that at present must be dealt with by judges of the High Court. This will ensure that the fullest possible use is made of the office of the Master in the judicial area.  This section also provides that under the rules of court, additional powers to deal with pre trial procedures may be conferred on the Master.  This would mean that the Master of the High Court could, under such rules, have jurisdiction to simplify and narrow in so far as possible all the issues which may arise in an action.  When the <Col N="1268" /> Master has disposed of pre-trial issues the action would then be submitted to court.  This will help to keep the hearing of actions as short as possible and release High Court judges from the time spent on various applications and other matters preliminary to hearing the central arguments in a case.</P>
    <P>Section 34 confers new powers on county registrars, as set out in the Second Schedule to the Bill.  These additional powers correspond to those which are currently exercised by the Master of the High Court in respect of the High Court.  The effect of the proposal is that county registrars will be empowered to deal with many motions that judges of the Circuit Court are at present required to hear, such as motions to remit actions to the High Court, notices for discovery and motions to join a third party.  I am satisfied that this will effect considerable savings of court time and will help to reduce delays at Circuit Court level. Section 34 also provides that appeals from decisions of the county registrars shall lie to the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>Section 45 gives the Superior Courts and Circuit Court Rules Committees the power to make rules requiring parties in High and Circuit Court personal injuries actions to disclose, without having to apply to court, the reports of experts, such as doctors, whom it is intended to call to give evidence.  Again, this is aimed at speeding up the hearing of actions and should help to reduce legal costs for litigants.</P>
    <P>There has been concern about the ease with which criminal trials, often of very serious offences, can be switched from the Circuit Court sitting outside Dublin to the Dublin Circuit Court. This exacerbates the problem of delay in the Dublin Circuit Court and can be a costly exercise from the point of view of bringing gardaí and witnesses to the Dublin Circuit Court.  Under the Courts Act, 1981, once the required notice is given, an application to transfer to the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court is automatically granted.  I do not accept that transfers in all of these cases can be justified. <Col N="1269" /> There may well be legitimate grounds in certain circumstances to grant an accused a trial before a jury from a region other than, say, where the accused lives.  Section 32 provides that an application to transfer the trial to Dublin will only be granted by the court if the judge is satisfied that it would be manifestly unjust not to do so.  I know that many Members of the House, especially from the Cork area, have raised on the Adjournment on a number of occasions the matter regarding the number of transfers of cases from the Cork area to the Dublin area at great expense and, in practice, at great delay. Various theories have been put forward as to why these transfers may take place.  This provision should enable us to deal with the problem, which will be substantially to the benefit of areas and court jurisdictions such as Cork.</P>
    <P>The Bill also rationalises the territorial jurisdiction of judges of the District Court.  At present an accused before the District Court may only be tried in the District Court district where he or she lives or was arrested, or where the offence was committed.  This can give rise to inefficiencies and unnecessary costs.  Section 41 will allow for much greater flexibility in the hearing of criminal cases by District Court judges. It will allow for the trial of an offence and the processing of other matters by any District Court judge in any District Court in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>A number of the measures in the Bill, some of which I have already mentioned, should have the effect of reducing legal costs by increasing efficiency and speeding up the business in the court.  However, I am acutely conscious of the need for an effective control mechanism with regard to legal costs when costs are in dispute.  The settling of disputed legal cost bills is the function of the taxing masters of the High Court, or at Circuit Court level, that of country registrars.  Significant deficiencies in the powers of the taxing masters have been identified following a number of court decisions.  Section 27 of the Bill will give much needed additional powers <Col N="1270" /> to the taxing masters of the High Court and to county registrars in the Circuit Court to evaluate solicitors' and counsels' fees and fees charged by expert witnesses in actions and to allow or disallow such fees.  These powers will also be available to the taxing masters with regard to solicitor and client bills of costs.  I am confident that this move will help to restore effective control over legal costs where these costs have not been agreed.</P>
    <P>Section 50 confers on the Master of the High Court and other court officers the discretion that only judges currently have to order the payment of interest on awards.  The Bill will ensure that a plaintiff who seeks an award of interest will not have to apply separately to a judge at additional cost.</P>
    <P>I wish to briefly mention some important changes relating to the legal profession and the Judiciary.  Under section 30, solicitors will for the first time be made eligible for appointment as Circuit Court judges.  At present, only barristers are eligible for appointment to the Circuit Court.  This measure widens appreciably the pool of talent form which the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board can draw when making recommendations for appointment to the Circuit Court.  Section 28 provides that a judge with four years service on the Circuit Court bench shall be eligible for appointment as a judge of the High or Supreme Court.  This is a significant new provision which will qualify a former solicitor who has been appointed a Circuit Court judge for appointment to the Superior Courts after four years service as a judge of the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>Section 28 also provides for an amendment to the law in relation to qualification for appointment as a judge of the Supreme Court and the High Court.  The Bill addresses an anomaly under the existing law.  At present, 12 years practice as a barrister is required to qualify for appointment as a judge of the Supreme Court and the High Court. Service as a judge of the Circuit Court counts as practice as a barrister. However, service as a judge of the <Col N="1271" /> European Court of Justice, the Court of First Instance attached to that court or as an Advocate-General of the Court of Justice does not make up practice as a barrister.  Section 28 deems such service to be practice at the Bar for the purpose of qualifying a person for appointment as a judge of the Supreme Court and High Court.  A similar provision was included in the 1994 Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 47 provides for a retirement age of 70 years for newly appointed judges to the Supreme and High Courts. The current retirement age for judges appointed to these courts is 72 years. Circuit Court judges retire at 70 years of age.  In the District Court, a judge can seek extension from 65 to 70 years of age.  This new provision for Supreme and High Court judges will, over time, effectively bring about uniformity of retirement ages for judges of all courts. The 70 years retirement age will not apply to judges who hold office at the time the provisions come into effect, including judges who are subsequently appointed from a lower court to the Supreme or High Court.</P>
    <P>The legal system can have a profound and lasting effect on the lives of individuals in the community.  Central to the success of that system is the delivery of justice and that is why an efficient courts system is so vital.  It is how that system performs as a service that is of most importance to me and, indeed, to the individual member of the public who relies on it.  I am confident that this Bill will set the courts service on course to provide a greatly improved service for the future.</P>
    <P>I look forward to hearing the views of Senators and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for introducing what is, at this stage, a considerably amended Bill.  Two matters are obvious given the number of amendments that have been made.  One is that the Minister and the Government have shown considerable and positive flexibility during Committee and Report <Col N="1272" /> Stages in the Dáil.  The other and perhaps the flip side to this is the fact that the number of changes that have been made leave the Bill open to the charge of having been hastily put together.</P>
      <P>I am bound to refer back to the ignoble birth of this Bill.  The Minister will be aware that the Bill, as originally conceived, was an attempt to assuage the conscience of somebody who felt an honourable compromise was needed in relation to a certain judicial appointment. I wish to put it on record that I do not believe Bills should be initiated in this manner.  If there is a need for legislation that need alone should be the basis for what we do.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I welcome the majority of the provisions in this Bill. Many of them make good sense. However, in the matter of judicial appointments in particular, there are sensitive areas which must be addressed.  In keeping with the positive spirit shown by the Minister for Justice and the Government, I hope the Minister of State will take note of positive suggestions the Seanad might make because further changes could be made in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister has correctly said that Ireland has been well served by its Judiciary and court system.  Unlike other countries, we have not had scandals involving judges or our courts.  The people of this country enjoy a high degree of confidence in the administration of justice.  Given that, the question must be asked &mdash; if it is not broken, why fix it?  There is an onus on anybody proposing an alteration to the system of appointing judges to come before each House of the Oireachtas and explain exactly why a change is needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To a certain extent, I am sorry that the Minister for Justice is not present because during her term of office she has appointed a few judges, yet she did not feel the need to rely upon a judicial advisory board.  Why create one?  What is the problem?  There is no problem. The quality of people appointed as judges has been exceptionally high. That brings me back to what I said at <Col N="1273" /> the start of my contribution &mdash; the birth of this Bill is ignoble.  As Deputy O'Donoghue said on Second Stage in the Dáil, there seemed to be an urgent imperative at the time but it has taken a year for that urgent imperative to see its way through the system.</P>
    <P>As a practising barrister, I can confirm the Minister's comments about delays in the courts.  Justice delayed is justice denied.  People are obliged to wait up to two years in the Circuit Court and up to three years in the High Court for their cases to be heard.  This is totally unacceptable.  There are many other unacceptable matters.  One of them is the overcrowding in our courts.  The Circuit Family Court in Áras Uí Dhálaigh is a disgrace.  Men and women who are separating must have their consultations in the corridor outside the court.  There are some consultation rooms but not enough.  That one should have to discuss an affair as intimate and personal as one's separation with one's legal adviser in the corridors of a court is a disgrace in this day and age.  Any discussion of court facilities which will result in an improvement in that situation is very welcome.  The courts committee has been set up although our party would have preferred a courts commission. However, any group which looks at the question of accommodation and so forth in the courts is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Another major issue is costs.  The Minister will agree that litigation is far too expensive.  That is not necessarily because any one legal adviser is getting a lot of money out of litigation.  It is an accumulation of costs, including Revenue and stamping costs.  In fact, a judge in the Supreme Court once said that the constitutionality of stamping costs could well be in issue if it stopped a poor person from litigating.  There should be no bar to an ordinary person litigating their case or claim.  There have been huge improvements in the civil legal aid system, due in large measure to the recent Civil Legal Aid Act, although that applies mainly to matrimonial cases. Increasingly, however, the ordinary person <Col N="1274" /> who is aggrieved should and will be able to litigate.</P>
    <P>I intend to propose amendments on Committee Stage with regard to judicial appointments.  The Government appears to be anxious to have this Bill passed but I ask the Minister to ensure that it is not rushed.  We are approaching Christmas and there appears to be an informal guillotine on the Bill.  It would serve all our purposes to take our time on Committee Stage as this is an important Bill.</P>
    <P>I have major problems with the proposals regarding judicial appointments. There is no harm, if it is necessary, in having a body to advise on suitable candidates for judicial positions.  However, the issue of confidentiality is not properly addressed in the Bill.  The Bill provides that the proceedings of the judicial advisory board will be confidential, except for the purposes of the Act. However, the board will communicate with the Cabinet.  Will the discussions of the judicial advisory board be discussed at length in Cabinet?  If the Government proceeds with its proposed constitutional amendment on Cabinet confidentiality, will we face the prospect of people's reputations being openly discussed at Cabinet and details being subsequently published?  I think the Minister would agree that this would be regrettable and that the issue should be addressed in the most careful way.</P>
    <P>A major problem is the issue of whether the recommendation aspect of a judge will be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>.  If the names of seven persons are submitted and the Government decides to appoint another person, it will be clear from <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> that the person appointed was not on the recommended list.  Will this be a stigma as far as that judge is concerned?  Will people say he or she was not on the recommended list, is not to be relied on and will be more open to appeal?  This issue must be seriously addressed.</P>
    <P>Last night in the Dáil, during the Report Stage of this Bill, the Minister for Justice stated:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1275" /> I might add that, even if the three to five continued to obtain, the Government would not be obliged to accept those candidates; it could still make another selection; no matter how many names were presented to it, if it deemed it proper, it could select another candidate for a particular appointment where there might be a specific need within a specific court for a given type of experience.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the Government will always retain the right to select a person from outside the recommended list. How would such a person feel when his or her name is published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> but has not been on the recommended list?  The Minister and the Government should think most seriously about whether such names should be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i></P>
    <P>Another serious issue is the membership of the Attorney General on the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board. In my opinion this is completely wrong. The Attorney General fills a constitutional position and is legal adviser to the Government, in effect he is part of the Government.  The function of the board will be to advise the Government on judicial appointments.  It will be more a part of the Judiciary than of the Government; its chairman will be the Chief Justice.  Insisting that the Attorney General should be a member of the board is a clear breach of the separation of powers between the Executive and judicial arms of government.</P>
    <P>What is even more alarming is that the Minister said yesterday that the Attorney General will communicate the deliberations and recommendations of the board to the Government.  This is not provided for in the Bill and is wrong.  The Chief Justice, as chairman of the board, or its secretary, should communicate the recommendations to the Government.</P>
    <P>If a person wants to put his or her name before the board, it should be confidential and respected.  This procedure must be sensitive, discreet, tactful <Col N="1276" /> and polite.  It is not easy for people to put their names forward and have their professional records and characters bandied about.  These may have to be discussed and are discussed when the Minister engages in consultations in the normal course when appointing judges. It is disturbing that a person's name and character might be bandied about and communicated and we should address this issue on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I wholeheartedly welcome the inclusion of solicitors in eligibility for appointment as judges of the Circuit Court and after four years, if appropriate, of the High Court and the Supreme Court.  As a practising barrister I say there is no reason a solicitor should not be a member of any court.  The compromise worked out by the Minister, which is that for appointment to the High Court or the Supreme Court a person must have four years service in the Circuit Court, is excellent and if she were in the House I would congratulate her on it.</P>
    <P>One of the Minister of State's colleagues, who is a member of one of the Government parties, said that as a solicitor he is in and out of the courts all day but barristers are in court all day. There is a difference between the two professions, not in terms of ability or innate superiority but of experience and working at the coal face of the courts. This provision will make sure that, if a solicitor is appointed a judge of the High Court or the Supreme Court, he or she will have full experience of a court for four years, whereas barristers must have seven or ten years experience in court.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a compromise on ceremonial wigs.  The wearing of wigs will not now be required; it will be voluntary. If barristers want to wear wigs in court, they may, if they do not wish to do so, this will not be compulsory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>What will the Senator do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>We will see when the Bill is passed.  Like any good barrister, I <Col N="1277" /> will listen to the advice of the Bar Council. I believe wigs are good, especially for junior members of the Bar.  They are also good for barristers prosecuting in criminal courts because they provide some degree of anonymity.  Research and international experience has shown this to be the case.</P>
      <P>This is a minor matter.  The Bill's most important issue is the welcome increase in the number of judges in the Circuit Court, the High Court and the Supreme Court.  I do not see why District Court judges must retire at 65 years of age and then be granted extensions. There should be a uniform retiring age for all judges and an amendment to that effect would make sense.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill because it provides for necessary and long overdue procedural changes.  The Government has not got its thinking right on judicial appointments.  I am sure the Minister understands the reference at the beginning of my speech to the ignoble birth of this Bill.  If two party leaders are trying to overcome a problem, proposing a Bill as a compromise is not the way to do it.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  I urge the Minister to listen to what is said now and on Committee Stage.  I hope she will take into account any positive suggestions about amending this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is necessary because of the difficulties in the courts as regards delays, efficiency and service to clients.  The backlog of cases and appeals before the courts is having a serious effect on people's confidence in the court system.  The courts are clogged up with outdated procedural and administrative systems.  It is time this was examined and improved.  At present the courts are inefficient and they are not customer friendly.  They are ill-equipped to handle modern day demands and pressures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The courts are not in a position to respond to the marked increase in the amount of work over the past number of years.  This is true as regards civil actions and personal injury litigation. <Col N="1278" /> There is also more family law business and more criminal cases.  The courts have failed to respond to the volume and complexity of appeals in recent years and to the growth in the number of cases, especially family law cases. People involved in such sensitive cases should not have to wait a long time to have their cases heard.  In some parts of the country people must wait six, 12 or 18 months for civil legal aid for separation cases under the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989.  That is unacceptable and this Bill should help to correct it.  The Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, has done enormous work in this area over the past two years.  He brought the State contribution from £2.2 million to £6.2 million in two years.  This Bill will complement that and ensure that the efficiency of the courts will give more value for taxpayers' money.</P>
    <P>Another area which has grown enormously is litigation.  This is a serious issue which must be examined, although I do not have a solution.  I have said in the past that the Law Reform Commission should look at it.  It is accepted that Ireland is one of the most litigious countries in Europe.  The compensation culture is like a cancer eating away at our society and it almost borders on the immoral.  The State must move quickly to halt the slide or all commercial and service facilities will grind to a halt.</P>
    <P>The system acts against the best interest of the genuine claimant who may have to wait many years for a resolution of a claim and this causes great distress.  The uncertainty of the level of appropriate compensation and the extent to which this seeks to discourage rehabilitation or a return to work is also an issue.  People are not encouraged to settle cases and they are discouraged from rehabilitation because of the view that they may get less compensation. This means people wait until their claim is granted.  This should be examined to ensure that the genuine claimant is treated fairly.  The Bill will facilitate that to some extent but because of the level of compensation which has grown up <Col N="1279" /> around this area that should be handled as a separate issue.</P>
    <P>Insurance costs as a result of litigation are causing complications for employers, businesses, motorists, public authorities and voluntary and sporting organisations.  No area has been spared the paralysis which has accompanied the escalation in litigation.  Local councils are concerned that people will send in claims if children have minor accidents in playgrounds.  It is unfortunate that many local bodies must remove such facilities which are of benefit to small towns.  School teachers can no longer send a student to a shop, and open season as regards claims has been declared in public houses, clubs, hotels and supermarkets.  Some 95 per cent of claims are successful.  The statistics show that the reward is higher if claims are taken to court rather than being settled outside it.  This puts pressure on insurance companies to settle claims. More claims will arise if people think they do not have to present their case in court.</P>
    <P>Insurance premia in Ireland are 98 per cent higher than the European Union average.  A young male aged between 18 and 21 with a full driving licence pays an average of £1,798 to insure a Ford Fiesta.  How can such costs be justified?  Personal injury compensation represents 67 per cent of all claims paid by motor insurance companies and almost all claims paid out by employers and those on public liability insurance.  Ireland is at a competitive disadvantage because it has the highest personal injury awards of any of the EU countries.  The frequency and level of Irish claims are twice those of the UK.</P>
    <P>Part of the problem resides with the legal system and the fact that the courts appear to take a lenient view of claims. They often hold employers responsible regardless of the circumstances. Employers who defend an employer's liability claim are almost presumed guilty until proven innocent.  Perhaps the Minister could ask the Law Reform Commission to do something in this <Col N="1280" /> area.  I accept there is no simple solution to this problem.  One cannot produce a Bill in two weeks or in six months to control this area because issues such as personal freedom and rights for the claimant and for the defendant must be taken into consideration.  This issue should be examined, especially in view of the lack of competitiveness in industry and other areas.</P>
    <P>The Bill goes some way towards improving the procedure for claims.  The Bill will deal effectively with the serious problem of delays in hearing actions and appeals at all levels of the courts system. The long unacceptable delays in having cases heard to conclusion are letting down many litigants who are victims of crime.  The system is letting down the community at large.  There is a growing lack of confidence in the system because of this.  Delays are inhibiting the smooth management of business, which is creating a competitive disadvantage for industry competing in EU markets.</P>
    <P>Public confidence in the operation of the courts is being seriously undermined. As Senator Mulcahy said, justice delayed is justice denied.  Cases must be completed quickly to allow all involved to get on with the business of running their affairs without concerning themselves over a period of years with the outcome of a court case.  The courts must have an efficient and effective organisational system.  They must be able to dispose of cases on an ongoing basis in a quick and effective manner. Appeals must be heard in an efficient fashion.</P>
    <P>The length and complexity of appeals, other than those concerning personal injury, has increased and this has increased pressure on the Supreme Court.  The situation is similar in the High Court.  However, in the latter case the number of judges has been increased over the years from six to 17. There has been no increase in the number of Supreme Court judges, however. I welcome the decision of the Minister to increase the number of judges by 15 &mdash; in the High Court from 16 to 19, the Circuit Court from 17 to 24, and the <Col N="1281" /> District Court from 45 to 50.  This will tackle some of the delays, thus overcoming some of the problems and allowing the Circuit Court to deal more effectively with family law cases.  As the Minister said, substantial human costs are involved.  You cannot put a money value on the human cost of delays in family law cases.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has announced the setting up of a working group on the courts which will reappraise the existing court system.  It is almost like bringing in a firm of consultants to examine how effective the whole operation is.  Consultants are not always complimented for their work, but they are often very necessary in taking an objective look at the issues and problems concerned.  This is useful because people on the inside, be they the Government or others, cannot look at the system in a detached way to see how it can be improved.  It is a welcome development to have people who can look at the court system and report to the Government on how changes can be made to bring about more efficiency and effectiveness.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy discussed at length the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  I do not have the same concerns as Senator Mulcahy has.  I do not know of many jobs in this country where applicants are not interviewed.  In most positions that one applies for &mdash; even Government appointments where the Taoiseach brings somebody in to discuss a situation with them &mdash; there is an informal or, in 99 per cent of cases, formal interview system to establish the suitability of candidates and to discuss all aspects of the position with them.  In many cases this concerns their capacity to do the job but in this case maybe not, because most people who have that length of experience would have the capacity to do the job.</P>
    <P>However, it is often a question of attitude and availability that impacts on a person applying for positions, whether it concerns judges, Ministers, chief executives or even the most junior person in <Col N="1282" /> a company.  It is necessary to explore all aspects of a position with them.</P>

      <P>If we decided that everything was right as it stands there would be no need for the Oireachtas to change things and no need for new Bills.  Everything would be the same.  We should try to improve situations.  Surely, one of our duties as legislators is to strive for excellence. This is what we are doing here. We are striving for excellence in the appointment of judges.  The situation might be adequate in Senator Mulcahy's view, but I think that striving for improvement and excellence in this area is a worthy exercise.</P>
      <P>When the Minister is selecting the advisory board she might look at some of the senior people from the personnel profession in order to have their advice and assist the board as members of it. As the Minister also said, representatives of victims of crime, women's groups and other bodies could bring an invaluable new perspective to the consideration of the suitability of candidates for judicial appointment.  That probably answers Senator Mulcahy's question better than in any other way.</P>
      <P>We welcome the area of judicial conferences and training, because one of the concerns people have is the inconsistency in sentencing from one judicial area to another.  I fully agree with judges having discretion in sentencing and I do not support mandatory sentencing for all crimes.  There are cases when it is correct and we have argued for and supported them here in the past, but the general approach to all mandatory sentencing is not fair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Judges must judge what is best from the evidence before them and it is their job to make a decision.  There are concerns about disparity in sentencing from one area of the country to another <Col N="1283" /> where the evidence appears to be the same, I will not highlight such cases but the fact that there will be education and ongoing training for the Judiciary will hopefully overcome some of that. People will meet to discuss the issues. As we know, the formal conference is one thing; but the informal conference where we have an opportunity to discuss issues of concern will improve public confidence in consistency of sentencing between areas for the same crime with the same evidence.</P>
    <P>I will not go into detail, but the measures to improve efficiency in the courts with the improvement of facilities and functions of the Master of the High Court and the county registrars are to be welcomed.  This a simple but productive way of overcoming delays and improving efficiency in this area.</P>
    <P>I never understood why people had an automatic right of transfer to a Dublin court.  I can see reasons why it would have to be the case and why it should be the case where, for example, it was felt by the court that a person would not get a fair trial in a community because of the high profile of the case, or for other reasons.  There is sometimes a good reason for it, but it is neither correct nor necessary to have a blanket right which has increased the level of costs to the State as well as to witnesses.</P>
    <P>For some time there was a long discussion about the opportunity for solicitors to become judges and I welcome the fact that it has happened.  It is well overdue.  I will not debate with Senator Mulcahy whether four years in and out of court is the same as being in court for that time.  However, it is an effective way of doing it.</P>
    <P>I question the fact that judges have to retire at 70.  Perhaps the Minister might comment on why, like most people, they do not retire at 65 years.  People receive retirement pensions at 65 years and old age pensions at 66 years.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge that, by and large, the elements of this Bill which have been changed since the 1994 one are improvements on the issues addressed in the previous legislation. Having said that, I express strong reservations on the thinking behind this Bill and the consultations, if such we may call them, that brought about the original proposals in the 1994 Bill now being adopted in this legislation.  I hope it is very clear that the views I will express are not partisan.</P>
      <P>During the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government I expressed views even more cogently on the hasty, ill-considered <i>tête-á-tête</i> in an airport between two people who decided to demonstrate a degree of concern and awareness which did not exist in previous Governments and to bring about a change without considering the implications.  My reservations are even stronger than on the previous occasion as a consequence of the amendments which have been made.</P>
      <P>The Minister has acknowledged that the Judiciary and its conduct is exemplary. She said:</P>
      <P>I need hardly say that our Judiciary is widely respected for its integrity, fairness and independence.  The focus of these measures is, however, on the Government's role in the judicial appointments process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is acknowledged that our Bench is regarded not only at home, but internationally as exemplary in relation <Col N="1285" /> to its independence, integrity and fairness, for some reason the Government is following through on what was a bad decision when my party was in Government with the Labour Party.  It wants to change what it recognises has produced judges of the highest competence and integrity.  That is unacceptable.  It is even more unacceptable that the confidentiality surrounding the appointment of judges by Government, which was always a fundamental element, is now not only being breached but is being thrown out the window.  It will be impossible to maintain a level of confidentiality in the appointment of judges.</P>
    <P>When in Government I was privy, perhaps more than any other Member of the Oireachtas, to the consideration of people for appointment to the High Court, the Supreme Court and other courts.  Not once during those years did one word eke out much less leak out about those who submitted their names or about the reasons the Government reached certain decisions.  That is a vindication of the present system.  Are we now being told &mdash; this may be a matter the Government wishes to acknowledge &mdash; that Government is the problem? Although the capacity and qualifications of judges are not in doubt, are we now being told the Government wants to demonstrate that it is doing its job fairly?  If we want to demonstrate things to the public, we should not interfere with the fundamental independent function of the courts which, under our Constitution, must be seen to operate independently, as they have done consistently &mdash; many times to the discomfiture of Government, including those in which I served.</P>
    <P>On many occasions judges who may have been supportive, active or involved on a consultancy basis with parties before they were appointed by Government, demonstrated on appointment that the only consideration they applied was independence, integrity and fair play.  If that has always been the case and if judges from the Supreme Court in the United States comment so favourably on the pattern and quality of our <Col N="1286" /> appointments as distinct from the experience in America, where people are elected, will someone tell my why we are changing a system which is efficient, fair and exemplary?  I would like to say in deference to the Judiciary, which has served this country and which has been appointed by various Governments, that this is a retrograde step. While I welcome a number of the improvements, some elements in the Bill will do considerable damage to the independence of the Judiciary and will set up an inevitable conflict between the Executive and the Judiciary.</P>
    <P>There will be interview procedures for the appointment of judges.  Judges will be interviewed by people who have no competence in the judicial or legal area.  At least three members of the board will not have particular experience. I agree that we should broaden the net and that the fundamental consideration is service to the public, not the protection of privilege of the Bar, solicitors and so on.  I would endorse that at all times.  However, if names are to be submitted to the board, whose composition will include people who have no special qualifications or authority but who appear to have experience relevant to the courts &mdash; everything in life is relevant to the courts &mdash; how can we expect to be able to maintain confidentiality?</P>
    <P>Is it reasonable to expect quality lawyers, solicitors or barristers' junior or senior counsel, to submit their names to a panel in the knowledge that they will be rejected as only one will be recommended? We are told that confidentiality is an important part of this.  Any self-respecting lawyer would not want it to be know that, having submitted an application to leave his or her practice to be appointed to the Bench, they have been rejected.</P>
    <P>The tight constitutional obligation as regards confidentiality which has existed until now will not be available to protect that applicant.  This will guarantee that a number of those who would be suitable will not risk having it known that their names were submitted <Col N="1287" /> but they were turned down.  How can people be expected to submit to that? How could one expect people of standing and experience to submit themselves to an examination as to their character and suitability?  These people are just brought together to sit on this board.  Is the Government suggesting that they will have the knowledge, capacity or authority to presume on the character and suitability of applicants for these independent constitutional positions? We must always ensure that we vindicate the constitutional organs of State and, as far as the Oireachtas and the Executive are concerned, the Judiciary is one such important element.  If a person is turned down, the implication will be that they lacked suitability of character or qualification.  That is a terrible stigma.</P>
    <P>I give a general welcome to some of the improvements.  However, one provision takes a step which is bound to give rise to a serious clash and cause friction in the administration of justice. The Government retains the right to nominate people to the Bench and it can ignore the opinions of the board.  If it can do that why are we requiring a statement to the effect that a particular judge was or was not appointed on the recommendation of the board?  Is that not a guarantee of undermining the independence and integrity of the judge who was not appointed on the recommendations of the board?  Can anyone who understands even the most basic elements of judicial independence tell me what this nonsense is doing in this legislation?</P>
    <P>This is not just my opinion, as somebody who has been practising as a counsel since 1961, has been a senior counsel since 1974 and who has never made an application for judicial appointment.  I have the authority of a former Taoiseach, the late John A. Costello, who was an eminent member of the Bar and was the father of the Bar by virtue of status and age.  I got to know him personally in my early days at the Bar and he told me that in the first inter-party <Col N="1288" /> Government in 1948 the then Tánaiste, Mr. McBride who was also a member of the Bar, suggested that the Government set up a procedure similar to that which is now being proposed almost 50 years later.  He suggested that it should consult with the Bar Council and the Incorporated Law Society.</P>
    <P>The late Jack Costello told me that when the first appointment came up and these consultations were put in train the lobbying was unprecedented.  He said it was disgraceful that professional bodies who had no constitutional function &mdash; I am not trying to find a role for the Bar Council here &mdash; were used as lobby fodder for judicial appointments.  The Government decided that it was not going to proceed further with that nonsense. As John A. Costello put it himself &ldquo;we will make our own mistakes but at least it will be confidential and our responsibility&rdquo;.  I would listen to anyone who could tell me why the most exemplary system in the world is being changed.  I realise change is needed in the area of training and so on but that can be done without changing the system of appointments.</P>
    <P>I want to make one point about personality. I recall when names were being considered for judicial appointment and I was on the inside track because I knew the people concerned.  Equally I was at a disadvantage because I would think in terms of personality, suitability and demeanour.  Some of those who I thought might have a gruff nature or a short fuse if appointed to the Bench turned out to be most patient, considerate and determined to vindicate the rights of the citizen, which is the most important objective.  They were shining examples.  I do not want to name people but there was one person in particular who is not now on the Bench but who was held as an example.  Everybody used to laugh and say he was not the same person you would meet on the golf course where he had a very short fuse.</P>
    <P>We are introducing a subjective element which is to be disclosed publicly. That will be a bad day for the independence of the Judiciary, and that is <Col N="1289" /> my main concern.  I have no problem with some of the improvements being introduced in other areas.  However, I will pose one question to the Government. If it is so necessary to have all of these procedures and interviews in the future to guarantee integrity, why were some significant &mdash; in terms of political affiliation &mdash; appointments made recently?  I do not say this was wrong but at least two of the people involved had close political affiliations.  What was the rush to have them appointed before this legislation was enacted?  The Government must answer that question for itself.  If all these procedures are so necessary and desirable why rush the appointments of people who did not just have political association but more direct political involvement than I ever experienced.</P>
    <P>I see no reason for making a distinction between district judges and other judges in terms of age.  The practice is that district judges can apply from year to year for an extension between the ages of 65 and 70.  I cannot see why we should discriminate between men or women on the District Court Bench and those on the other benches.  What consultation did the Minister have with district judges or their representatives about the proposed changes to procedures, sessions and other arrangements?</P>
    <P>I want to mention citizens' rights and escalating costs.  If one goes down to the Law Library today, one will find insurance companies which cannot do enough to settle cases because they want to clear their books before the end of the year.  That is their fundamental concern.  There is one huge element in insurance and legal costs.  A serious injury may make a person disabled to the extent that he or she will never work again.  If this happens to a person in gainful employment at 25 or 30 years of age, one is looking at a huge actuarial calculation, and that is the basis of the awards which people see as excessive &mdash; figures that can turn out to be £1 million or more.  We should tell the insurance companies &mdash; it is up to us to ensure it <Col N="1290" /> is done &mdash; that the proper way to approach those is to recommend a lump sum for past and future pain and suffering but that an annuity be paid for loss of earnings, so that if the unfortunate person dies as a consequence of the serious injury, that annuity dies with the person.</P>
    <P>In some cases the person who was responsible for the accident was the next of kin and the person who was injured dies within two years, as sometimes happens with very serious injuries, having received a huge award.  The anomaly now exists that the very person who was responsible for the accident gets the benefit of the award to the injured party.  That could be avoided and major costs could be reduced if an annuity system, which for some reason or another the insurance companies do not want to contemplate, was introduced.</P>
    <P>We will speak about many things in the course of Committee Stage, but I have a very deep reservation about interference with the independence of the Judiciary.  I have seen the consequences of that independence in a way that made life a bit uncomfortable for me as Minister for Finance, Minister for Agriculture and in other Departments. However, that is not their concern. Their concern is to vindicate the right of the citizen, irrespective of how uncomfortable that is for the Government. I am afraid that this Bill, which was cobbled together at some airport chat, will have the consequence of seriously undermining the independence of the Judiciary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Debate in this House and in the other House has been constructive and timely because the nature of law has changed so dramatically over the last number of years, even since I qualified.  It is more complicated than ever.  New forms and procedures are being introduced and it is a very difficult, changing area that warrants attention. That is why this Bill is overdue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been an increase in traffic accidents in the last number of years. <Col N="1291" /> More people nowadays have access to the courts through the legal aid system, and that is welcome.  Irish people are becoming more litigious day by day; more aware of their rights under the law and more willing to take claims before the courts.  There has been a huge increase in the nature of family law cases which have taken up increasing amounts of time for individual judges at District and Circuit Court levels, as well as an increase in cases arising from European law.  All of that has added to an overburdened judicial system which needed to be rectified in some shape or form.  In 1983, 620 applications were made to the Circuit Court, whereas in 1993 that number had jumped to 2,000. That shows the huge increase in numbers coming before our courts and why reform is necessary.</P>
    <P>Certain aspects of the courts system are problematic.  One is the delay suffered by applicants in bringing their cases before courts.  There is overburdening by virtue of the historical rules which apply and the fact that so many minor matters must be brought before High Court judges.  There is a seeming lack of co-ordination in terms of policy and administration between individual judges at various levels.  These are some of the obvious problems being tackled in an immediate way by this Bill.</P>
    <P>At the same time I welcome the long term approach taken by the appointment of the working group chaired by Mrs. Justice Susan Denham.  That commission will be given the time to study the more detailed problems of the court system and hopefully come up with further reforms.  Meanwhile, this Bill achieves some very worthy reforms.</P>
    <P>First, with regard to judicial appointments, Senator O'Kennedy's point seemed to infer generally &mdash; I do not wish to misquote him &mdash; that if something is not broken, it should not be fixed and that the judicial appointments system should therefore be left alone.  I do not necessarily agree with this.  While our judicial appointments have in the past on balance served us very well, I <Col N="1292" /> listened to the statements of a retired judge during the divorce referendum debate and I felt they were not correct in terms of law, never mind attitude, and that caused me concern; so there could be exceptions to our judicial system having worked so excellently in the past.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that there is a proper system for appointment of judges, not a system that happens behind closed doors, which we hear about when somebody has been appointed.  It should not be just as simple as that; some system was required and this Bill answers that. The appointment of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board is therefore, in my opinion, a good idea.  Article 35 of our Constitution requires the Government to advise the President on appointments.  A Government decision or input to the decision is required under our Constitution and that is not to be thrown away.  The advisory board, therefore, seems to achieve some balance between the obligations of Government to take part in that decision making process and their obligation at the same time to be transparent and open.</P>
    <P>Section 13 proposes that the Minister would nominate three persons to that board.  It states in the legislation that they should have appropriate knowledge or experience in the legal areas and it allows for a three year renewable term, which is a good idea.  However, I would like to know more about what is intended by those three appointments and who they are to be.  The bodies from which they may be chosen should be elaborated more.  I am not happy with that.</P>
    <P>I also wish to raise a query on section 18, where it says that the Attorney General may be appointed to this board. There is something of a conflict there.  I would have thought that he would advise the Government in making their decision and would therefore not advise the advisory board itself in making its nominations.  That does not make sense. Furthermore, there is a conflict of interest, because many Attorneys General <Col N="1293" /> seek appointment themselves to a judicial post; and while there is a provision that the Attorney General may then step down while that decision is being made, I question whether that is workable.  There should be no automatic appointment or entitlement to a judicial post.  The fact that the Attorney General is sitting on the board may disrupt that, and I am not happy with this.</P>
    <P>Section 16 recommends that at least seven people be nominated by the board and that is acceptable.  That gives a choice to the Government that was not available under previous forms of this Bill and it is a fair number.  Some people have referred to the fact that judicial appointments should be made on the basis of a seven year term as in the public service.  That would of course ensure a turnover of judges, but I have considered the matter and I would not be in favour of it as it would dissuade practising lawyers from applying simply because if they are now 55 or 60, they know that a term of seven years will not give them enough years in gainful employment.  Practitioners will be forced to wait until they are 63 years of age before applying to the board.  This will place them near the maximum retirement age, if appointments are made on a seven year basis.  I am not happy with that.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to interviews, applications and confidentiality.  I see no difficulty arising in this regard. Section 20 guarantees confidentiality which, I presume, must apply to all applications before the board.  This is a requisite provision and is of paramount importance.  It is not politic that someone in the legal profession is known to have applied for a judicial post.  Such information, in relation to the numbers and identities of those that have applied for consideration, is not made public under the present system.  The Bill adequately covers the possible disclosure of information and requires that the individual members of the board maintain confidentiality in relation to the nature and sources of applications <Col N="1294" /> before it.  This is adequately enshrined in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in the Bill relating to judicial training.  Members will be aware that I have requested such a provision on several occasions.  It is long overdue, particularly when the area of family law is considered.  Much new legislation has been introduced in this area in recent years with which judges may not be properly familiar.  It is imperative that some access to training be provided for judges in general. The Bill deals with this matter in a good way and does not force people to undergo training prior to their submitting an application for appointment. The requirement that they undergo such training on appointment is the best way to tackle the problem.  This is a necessary development because people involved in the legal profession will not bring specific cases before particular judges.  The attitude of those judges to certain cases is known in advance.  Many people withhold on settling cases until it is known whether a particular judge will sit.  This must be avoided.  I welcome the provision for judicial training if it will help to bring about uniformity of attitude to various types of cases and some kind of parity in relation to sentencing.</P>
    <P>Much work is required in relation to the efficiency of our courts.  This Bill tackles the problem in several instances. The Master of the High Court has been given increased jurisdiction to deal with applications which go before High Court judges at present.  That is an excellent idea because his role has been under-utilised in the past.</P>
    <P>There is no reason pre-trial issues cannot be placed before the Master of the High Court for decision.  This would save the energy and time of High Court judges to give proper consideration to actual trials and the issues which come before them in this regard.  This will result in better judgments because judges will be afforded more time to concentrate on the net issues involved and will not be sidelined by other considerations. It is a good idea that motions for discovery, and other basic <Col N="1295" /> motions, can be brought before the Master.  In her reply, could the Minster clarify whether the decision of the Master of the High Court can be subsequent to the High Court itself?  I also welcome the provision that several matters can now be dealt with by the county registrar at Circuit Court level.</P>
    <P>It is also good that criminal proceedings can be dealt with at a local jurisdiction and will not be automatically transferred to Dublin.  I come from rural Ireland and I believe that justice is best served at local level.  People from rural areas should not be obliged to travel to Dublin to obtain justice.  They are obliged to travel enough already.  It is necessary to have the essential service of a local court available for the individual as part and parcel of our access to justice and the law.</P>
    <P>The increased powers granted to the Taxing Master are also welcome and long overdue.  Queries often arise with regard to the amount of fees submitted when a case is finalised.  It is most important that this issue be dealt with in a practical way and the Bill does just that.  I also welcome the provision that the criminal appeals court will be abolished when the Supreme Court has cleared its backlog of civil cases.  In that context the Bill has achieved many practical results in tackling the various inefficiencies which existed in the past.</P>
    <P>However, there are several areas which still need attention.  The first is the fees paid to professional witnesses. I believe that much abuse takes place in this area.  Charges for medical reports are often excessive, in the region of £120 in some cases, and at times I have queried whether the person involved has been effectively examined.  This issue troubles me, particularly when subsequent reports are required prior to trial.  An individual may require reports from several different experts on the condition of their eyes or heart, for example.  This increases costs to a large degree and adds to the total bill.  The introduction of a system requiring the sharing of medical evidence at the pre-trial <Col N="1296" /> stage would be welcome.  I do not know if that matter has been adequately dealt with in the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is also an excessive incurrence of costs when expert witnesses are placed on standby for court hearings. When the High Court sits in Dundalk or Monaghan several witnesses are placed on standby.  These people are paid to make themselves available to the court while carrying out a normal day's work.  A system is needed to determine the dates when a court will come to trial.  This would mean that the expert witnesses &mdash; the numbers of whom should be limited &mdash; will be present when required.  The Bill could have done more in this regard.  Senator O'Kennedy's remarks regarding an annuity system are welcome.  I believe this warrants further consideration by the Government in relation to the Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 30 of the Bill which deals with eligibility of solicitors for appointment as court judges.  The provision that they will be deemed eligible for appointment to the superior courts following four years of practice as a Circuit Court judge seems fair.  I feel very strongly about this issue.  There is no logical justification for the exclusion of 80 per cent of the profession from being available for appointment as judges. They need not necessarily be appointed but they should not be excluded from the process by virtue of the fact that they specialise in one branch of the profession. This is a relic of history which should have been abolished before now.</P>
    <P>There is a public misconception that it is easier to become a solicitor and then a barrister.  That is nonsense and needs to be addressed.  When I studied law it was easier to qualify as a barrister, in terms of academic qualifications, at the King's Inns than it was to qualify for entry to the Law Society.  Following that, I discovered that solicitors were required to complete three years training while barristers only completed two. That misconception should be knocked on the head.  Barristers are not a superior branch of the profession.  Their work tends to deal more with the area <Col N="1297" /> of advocacy.  Other than that no real distinction exists.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the bar on the eligibility of solicitors has been removed because such action is long overdue. Some barristers are reluctant to accept the possibility that solicitors may be appointed as judges.  From experience, I am aware of several solicitors who are excellent advocates in our local courts; this is not the case with several of our barristers.  Therefore, it is not correct to assume that a solicitor cannot do the job as well, if not better, than several barristers because he or she does not spend every hour of the day sitting in court. That misconception needs to be knocked on the head.</P>
    <P>On a related point &mdash; perhaps I am getting rid of some of my pet hates here &mdash; many solicitors spend their time putting the case together and the barrister then appears as the mouthpiece in court on the day.  Without doing damage to or slurring the barrister profession &mdash; and I do not intend to do that &mdash; I often feel solicitors are more <i>au fait</i> with the details, the facts, their client and their client's needs and it is only right that, as they have been involved in the preparation stage, they should follow the case and continue it in court.</P>
    <P>The retirement age of judges should be uniform.  I do not agree that a district judge must retire at 65 years of age and come back each year to have his <i>compos mentis</i> examined.  That is not fair.  If that is proper, it should also apply to judges in the superior courts who fall asleep in court.  The same rule should apply to all. Perhaps retirement age should be reduced to 65 years of age and 70 years of age for appointments to the Supreme Court, which would allow time for promotion to that court.</P>
    <P>The pomp and ceremony of barristers' wigs is an accident of history.  The trappings of office only serve the egos of barristers and assist them in acquiring superiority complexes and do not necessarily serve the delivery of justice. I welcome their abolition.  In my opinion <Col N="1298" /> all barristers should only be required to wear a simple black gown as in the European Court of Justice.</P>
    <P>The condition of courthouses warrants a mention and the fact that so many people must work under such dire outmoded conditions warrants some mention.  The lack of consultation rooms is a problem daily in my local courthouse in Castleblaney.</P>
    <P>The Judiciary is respected and has done a good job in the past and this Bill will facilitate it in doing an excellent job in future.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is splendid that so many changes are being made in the courts at this time which cannot but be to the advantage of those who work there and those who come before the courts.  The maxim that justice delayed is justice denied has been only too true, unfortunately, and it is good to see the lack of judges and proper accommodation being addressed now.</P>
      <P>It is always regrettable if there is a delay in any case coming before the courts but I want to address delays in family law cases as these are particularly important.  As we know, there are long delays in dealing with judicial separation cases and great distress can be caused to the separating parties.  These delays can also affect the children because the completion of any arrangements the parents may be seeking between themselves regarding their children can lead only to a disimprovement in the situation.</P>
      <P>During the divorce referendum we spoke at great length about whether it was the breakdown of marriage or divorce which caused problems for children within the family.  In general, it was agreed that the breakdown of marriage is the main cause of problems for children and that the more urgently, compassionately and carefully this can be dealt with, while taking the children's views into consideration, the better for the children.  I feel the changes being made in the Bill will be particularly important in these cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1299" /> In general, judicial separation cases come before the Circuit Court.  Only the more complicated cases, or those which involve a great deal of property or money, come before the High Court.  It is good to see such attention being paid to the lower courts because it is there that many of these tragic cases must be heard.</P>
    <P>The improvements in the District Court are also important because not many people understand that a large number of extraordinarily important family law cases are heard there. Barring orders, maintenance orders and orders relating to the custody of children can be taken there.  It is hard to think of cases which could be more important on a personal basis than such cases.  It is regrettable that since the District Court is working at the coalface, they are often dealt with in a summary way so there are no pleadings before the hearing and clients come into court with no real notion of what may be alleged against them.</P>
    <P>Facilities are poor and an enormous number of courts have no facilities for any form of consultation outside the courtroom.  Any further conciliation or mediation which might be able to take place, even on the steps of the court, are hindered seriously by this.  It is important to realise that in most family law cases the parties do not arrive on the steps of the court without some efforts having been made to bring them together through marriage guidance counselling, conciliation or mediation. In fact, in a large number of cases, what gets to the court is the tip of the iceberg. When all else has failed, the court is the remedy.  It is extraordinarily important that we try to improve courthouse facilities as quickly as possible because it is ridiculous to see the opposing parties in a separation, barring order, maintenance case or, worse still, a case involving the custody of children, trying to confer with their solicitors on different sides of a door outside the courtroom.  I urge the Minister to ensure money is spent on improving courtrooms.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1300" /> These are serious matters which must be addressed with great speed in the interests, say, of the safety of one of the spouses in the home or, perhaps, of children. This means there is a great pressure of work on those courts.  Huge numbers of cases are dealt with and better facilities are required urgently.</P>
    <P>The recent divorce referendum may have made us look more closely at the importance of this type of case.  I was taken particularly with what Judge Catherine McGuinness, who has such experience in this field, said before the referendum.  She thought that everyone who had been in the vicinity of the courts would vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; because they would see there is an irretrieveability in some marriages and nothing can be done except to try to settle them legally as amicably as possible in the best interest of the partners involved, their children and the extended family.</P>
    <P>This brought to mind the reporting of family law cases so that the general public could get, at least, some notion of what is going on in the courts.  This is important because we have no idea of the huge volume and type of work going through the courts.  Sometimes we have a simplistic notion that it is all to do with drink and violence and that if people would just go back home and behave themselves, all would be all right.  In Nell McCafferty's article in The <i>Sunday Tribune</i> of 10 December 1995, an unnamed barrister said:</P>
    <P>Marital breakdown affects all of society.  People on both sides of the debate were presenting it as a simple matter of sticking together or separating amicably.  They think it's all to do with violence and drink.  That's the least of the problems.  You get spouses protesting in court that they've never put a foot wrong, always shared the money and the care of the children, and they cannot understand that their partners longed for a conversation, a night out.  There are tensions about elderly parents, about the children themselves.... <Col N="1301" /> One session in the Family Law court would teach you all you need to know about the pitfalls of marriage and how to keep one together.  Then the next day you learn something new again. If the proceedings were reported, it would frighten the life out of people contemplating marriage and make them take it more seriously.</P>
    <P>While I am not recommending that engaged couples should be forced to go to family law courts for a few days, we should take this matter seriously.  Somebody not involved in these courts would have no notion of what is happening and of the terrible human tragedies enacted there.  I have been involved from a medical point of view, as have Senator Gallagher and Senator Enright from a legal point of view.  While I wish the Irish football team well, there will be tensions felt in some homes this Christmas by spending money on travelling to England for the match rather than on presents.  There are many underlying matters, even in the most loving relationships between a man and a woman, that have often impacted seriously on marriages and it would be good to know more about this.</P>
    <P>It may be a good idea to inform clients, who may not realise they have redress under the law, that they could put their case to the family law courts. For example, we could start a campaign for women trying to get a share of their family income if people realised how many women in the home got little of it.  Perhaps we may be able to urge the Minister for Social Welfare to ensure the family income supplement was paid to whoever was caring for the children. These issues would be better addressed if we had any idea of how matters like money, for example, impacted on family law cases.  I would very much like to see a better understanding of what is happening. Maybe we feel those coming before the courts are being dealt with in a proper manner.</P>
    <P>Ms McCafferty quoted another judge &mdash; I am sure it was a long time ago &mdash; who advised the couple before him to <Col N="1302" /> go home, have a steak dinner, buy a bottle of wine and a bunch of flowers and kiss and make up.</P>

      <P>They were standing there in bits with daggers drawn.  That was the sort of advice which was being given and it is not satisfactory in many cases.</P>
      <P>Restrictions on reporting of family law cases are severe.  There are, of course, good reasons for this.  Clients do not want to see their names and details of their case in the newspapers.  These are emotional and personal cases.  Some of these cases have sexual overtones which would give the greatest delight to the tabloids.  However, it must be possible for us to somehow get legal reports from these courts which could show us what is happening there.  I do not want to hear the details of every case but only to get an idea of their volume and the spheres they cover.</P>
      <P>Nell McCafferty used to write reports about a series of cases under the heading &ldquo;In the Eyes of the Law&rdquo;.  She may forgive me for saying that we do not want reports as chatty as that, but I never heard one complaint from anyone about being identified.  She compiled these reports with great care and they were useful and influential.  Many suburban people who read those reports did not realise that cases such as these were happening in suburbia.  Was she restricted in her reporting because the courts were embarrassed at what she was disclosing about the way in which many of these cases were handled?  We need to get <i>bone fide</i> journalists who can be relied upon to report these courts in a responsible manner.  I do not think a pool system would do; people with a genuine interest in these sort of cases and who can bring these reports before the public should be involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have no idea of the judges' views in family law cases.  Are these cases being dealt with properly?  In one family law case the judge in question quoted canon law as having been important in his judgment.  I am not sure if that is <Col N="1303" /> often used in court judgments, but it would be useful to know if it was, or if this was an exceptional case.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been wise in insisting that judges who take up positions will agree from now on to go on training courses.  Judges may have a background in the family law area as a barrister or a solicitor, but then again they may not.  However, they will still have to start by learning on the hoof, which is not a desirable way for anyone to learn about such an important job.</P>
    <P>Before the 1980s sexual abuse was hardly spoken about in this country, let alone in the courts, yet a group of elderly men were expected to give judgments on these cases without any previous training and with little backup at the time by way of reports from social workers, etc.  We have had to do an enormous amount of work in this area in the last 15 years and the judges have been obliged to do it on their own.  They have had to look at new and complicated areas with little training.  They had little back up in many cases.</P>
    <P>Probation officers working with the courts are saying they cannot deal with the volume of cases coming before the family law courts.  They are asking for better facilities and expect to deal with a lesser number of cases so they can do them adequately.  The Minister should look at this area carefully, because to see this most committed group of people proposing to take action on limiting the number of cases with which they will deal must be a cause of concern for all of us.</P>
    <P>While the lack of facilities are being addressed, I am also concerned with the District Courts.  Senator Gallagher said that District Court judges have to retire at 65 years of age and are considered by the Minister as to their suitability on a year by year basis after that.  In the history of the State, only one District Court judge was considered unfit to continue in that capacity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will bow to Senator Manning's knowledge on that matter. There seems to be no reason why District Court judges could not retire at the same age as High Court and Supreme Court judges.  The idea that the stress of their work wears them out earlier than their counterparts is the best argument I can think of for allowing this, but otherwise I cannot see where there should be any problems.</P>
      <P>Some of the suggested changes regarding District Courts makes me wonder if the Minister intends to change their boundaries.  The Minister will be able to appoint further District Court justices to areas other than the metropolitan area, which may allow District Courts to be split between two judges. Is this what is proposed to happen, or will these areas be divided in two?</P>
      <P>All judges organise their affairs as they see fit in their own District Court, such as sittings of their courts, etc.  If a big area was split, will the boundaries be divided between the two judges or how will alternative arrangements be made so they will still have an independent position to deal with their various facilities?</P>
      <P>Senator Gallagher also had harsh words to say about professional witnesses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Having been one myself, Senator Gallagher was a little unkind when she spoke of professional witnesses because, generally, if one is offered £200 to attend court one might prefer to give £400 to stay away as one puts one's professional reputation, in addition to everything else, on the line. People in court are entitled to be represented by those who have either seen them professionally or have been asked to comment on their cases in a professional manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish the courts could better organise the times that professional witnesses are to be seen.  This is not for the benefit of the professional witness but because <Col N="1305" /> clinics may be cancelled &mdash; I am aware of this in my own profession &mdash; on a Tuesday and again on a Wednesday or Thursday and this is totally unsatisfactory for those involved.  Any procedures in the courts which would improve this would be of great help.</P>
    <P>The wearing of wigs appears to be an emotive issue.  I am not sure from reading the Bill whether people must remove their wigs or put them on if a judge orders them to do so.</P>
    <P>When wigs have not been worn for some time, people will wonder why they ever wore them; I know they are not worn in many courts during the summer. While we cannot expect all future Speakers in the House of Commons to have the same flowing locks as Betty Boothroyd, will they wear wigs?  Having looked at Betty Boothroyd they may not, because she appears to be totally in control of the House of Commons, wig or no wig.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  The fact that the courts should no longer have such serious delays, that accommodation is to be improved and that judges are to have training, which I am sure they will welcome, are most important factors.  I also welcome the fact that solicitors will be allowed to serve as judges.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister consider the reporting of family law cases in the media?  This should be done without intruding on the rights of those who are before the courts and in great distress and for the benefit of others who may be in such a situation, and to make members of the public realise, first, what serious problems we have regarding the family and second, that all is not as smooth and glowing as some people make it appear.  In addition, the public would like to be assured that justice is meted out in family law cases as we would like.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill.  It is one of the most important reforming pieces of legislation for many years; it is one of the first attempts at not quite a root and branch reform, but certainly a major and radical reform of the judicial system, and it is long overdue.  At present the judicial system is creaking under the weight of the burden it has to carry.  There has been an enormous increase in the amount of litigation in recent years, and there has been no commensurate increase in the resources, the numbers and the facilities available to the judicial system.  The Bill represents a radical attempt to strengthen the structure of the judicial system.  It also addresses a number of issues which have been covered by other speakers and to which I will refer.</P>
      <P>It is very important that we recognise that we have, over the 70 years of independence, established beyond any doubt the utter independence and incorruptibility of our judicial system.  It is one of the most important parts of a healthy democracy and it is, perhaps, something we take for granted.  To my knowledge, there has never been a case where the integrity of any judge was called into question.  There has never been a question of a judge being bribed or approached, and anybody who may be thinking in these terms would know at the outset that to attempt to influence or bribe a member of the Judiciary is something which would stop at the first hurdle.  It has never happened, but it is important that we state this because there are many other democracies, and good democracies, where the Judiciary does not have this sense of untouchability and integrity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the question of the independence of the Judiciary.  With the growth of judicial review we have seen that the courts have not been afraid to interpret the Constitution as they think it should be interpreted, come what may, whether it is to the discomfort of the Government of the day.  This has <Col N="1307" /> happened on many occasions, such as when the Supreme Court decided on equal taxation, the contraceptive case, the McGee case and the Single European Act, when the court, wrongly in my view, came to a conclusion that it meant we had to have a referendum to have it clarified and when it decided, during the last referendum, that the Government was not behaving constitutionally.</P>
    <P>In all of these cases the courts have shown their utter independence.  They have interpreted the law and the Constitution as they believed they should.  We should, therefore, recognise that we have something here which is at the foundation of a free, open and democratic system.</P>
    <P>We have also seen situations where the courts have not responded over the years, or have not been allowed respond.  The most important factor here has been the increase in the amount of litigation which confronts the courts at all sides.  They have not been in a position to cope with this.  Senator Henry and others spoke of the question of justice delayed and of people who have to wait years to get into court, especially in family law cases where enormous suffering and hurt can continue to be inflicted while the parties wait to have their situation resolved.</P>
    <P>To put some facts into the debate, my friend and former Member of the House, David Molony, who is President of the County of Tipperary and Offaly Division of the Bar Association, gave me some figures for the period 1991-95 to illustrate the extent to which the Circuit Court is now groaning under a weight of work with which it cannot cope.  In 1991, there were 94 criminal appeals pending in the Circuit Court in County Tipperary; there are 329 criminal appeals pending this year.  In 1991 there were 15 civil appeals; today there are 79 such appeals pending.  There were ten indictible crimes pending in 1991; there are 16 today.  There were 147 civil actions in 1991; there are 692 civil actions pending in County Tipperary <Col N="1308" /> today.  There were 19 family law matters in 1991; today there are 69.  That gives an indication of the amount of work over a four year period for one Circuit Court, and that court is probably typical. In addition, there are other matters dealt with by the Circuit Court, including motions and applications, which are also a multiple of what they were in 1991.</P>
    <P>In County Tipperary there is the same number of staff to deal with the work in the Circuit Court office now as there was in 1991 to deal with a smaller load, although even then it was probably a large burden.  This means that the situation is near breaking point.  Even after this Bill is passed and the number of Circuit Court judges is increased it will still only begin to tackle the problem. The delays will be a feature of our legal system for a long time to come.  It now takes several years before a civil action will come to court.  That is totally unsatisfactory. In many situations this creates injustice and undermines the judicial system.</P>
    <P>That is the situation in the civil courts. I can speak more directly, perhaps, about family law courts, about which Senator Henry spoke so knowledgeably. My wife is a family lawyer so I know from daily conversations about the enormous delays in family law, especially in country areas, where the courts simply are not geared either to hear family law cases frequently or to deal with them expeditiously and where such cases are heard in unsuitable surroundings.</P>
    <P>There has been an enormous improvement in the quality of the judges dealing with family law in recent years.  A couple of decades ago, perhaps even more recently, family law was an area to which a judge who was regarded as something of a dud elsewhere in the system was shunted.  Many of them were not suitable psychologically and in terms of their training and personality to deal with family law cases.  They did not have the background, the legal knowledge, the sensitivity or the sociological <Col N="1309" /> awareness to deal with such cases.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the quality of judges hearing family law cases today has increased enormously.  Judge Catherine McGuinness was cited as an example by Senator Henry of the extremely high calibre of the judges who now handle family law cases.  Nevertheless, however good our judges are &mdash; and they are good &mdash; the number of judges is far too small and the courtrooms and back-up systems are utterly inadequate.  This means that many cases drag on and on.  Children suffer and spouses have to exist under threats of various kinds &mdash; certainly psychological and sometimes physical &mdash; because of the absence of a proper system which should be able to deal expeditiously and humanely with these problems.  There is no doubt that when the divorce courts are set up the number of cases will increase, certainly in the short term and probably over the years.  However, there is not much point in having a divorce system if the underlying judicial system is not able to cope.</P>
    <P>There is a message coming from both the Seanad and the Dáil that the huge improvement in the number of judges which this Bill makes possible is still not enough.  There is a need for a further extension of the entire judicial system at all levels.  This is not something for which we should have to apologise.  The simple fact is that people are voting with their feet by entering into litigation much more easily and freely than they did in the past.  That is the nature of our society at present and if that is so there is an obligation on the State to provide the framework within which people can resolve their differences in a speedy and humane way.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy was very critical of what is being proposed and he spoke with authority on the views of great lawyers of the past, such as John A. Costello and others.  After much thought on this matter, I find that I disagree profoundly with Senator O'Kennedy.  There is nothing wrong with a system of appointing judges which is open and transparent <Col N="1310" /> and in which there are acceptable standards and proper procedures and criteria for such appointments.  I have no doubt that Attorneys General and Governments over the years have behaved scrupulously and have insisted on certain criteria being followed and so forth in the appointment of judges. However, there is a sense of an almost masonic conspiracy surrounding the appointment of judges.  There is a sense of some sort of conspiracy between the Law Library and members of the Law Library who happen to find their way into politics.  It is seen as an insiders' world; outsiders are not supposed to ask questions about it or to intrude, whether they be politicians or taxpayers or people who use the courts.</P>
    <P>This legislation &mdash; and I pay tribute to the integrity and independence of the courts &mdash; is simply saying to the legal system: &ldquo;You must abide by the same standards as any other professional body&rdquo;.  Why should positions not be advertised?  Why should people not have to provide references?  Why should outside views not be taken as to the suitability of a person for judicial office? Why should there not be interviews? Why should the full range of a person's education, background and past experience not be taken into account in a structured way when a person is applying for one of the highest positions in the land, which carries enormous power and responsibility and where the person so appointed is really accountable to nobody once the appointment has been made?  A positive and good principle is being established in this legislation whereby these criteria will apply.</P>
    <P>I also agree with Senator Henry that once a person is appointed a judge it should not mean the end of the road for that person as far as training, learning and re-equipping themselves to keep up to date with developments in their particular area are concerned.  Retraining applies to all professions.  Doctors are expected to keep abreast of recent developments and there is nothing wrong with asking judges to do likewise. I am aware that many judges do so; they <Col N="1311" /> attend seminars and are interested in the development of the law.  However, there is nothing wrong with asking them to do that.  In that sense the Bill establishes an important principle.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry, in an interesting contribution, referred to the lack of knowledge which most people have of what actually happens in the courts.  That is a valid point.  Generally, all people are in awe of the court and are scared away. Often the reporting and the business is conducted in an arcane language. However, people are entitled to know exactly what is happening in the courts and about the procedures and the value systems in operation there.  They should be open to the same public scrutiny as are this House, Members of the Oireachtas and members of Government.</P>
    <P>It is not a function of the Bill, but Senator Henry made the point that the media might look at ways in which the workings of the courts and the business they do can be reported in a way which enlightens the public.  She referred in particular to family law.  If the public knew, without names being mentioned, about the nature and details of some of the cases which are dealt with daily in the family law courts, it would be much more aware of the nature of our society and the problems which the divorce referendum, for example, and the legislation which has gone through the Oireachtas over the last seven or eight years are trying to cope with.  There is no point in fooling ourselves about the nature of our society.  It is important that the truth of what happens is known without pandering to any unhealthy instincts.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy referred to the possibility of annuities, or structured settlements, becoming more frequent in court cases.  Lump sums awarded to people who suffer horrific injuries and will be invalids for life may be dissipated by relatives and others.  I have long felt that structured settlements, or annuities, should take the place of lump sums.  These would make it possible to <Col N="1312" /> plan for the future and to ensure lifetime care for the people involved.  I do not know if this issue is relevant to the Bill, but elements of the Judiciary are sympathetic towards it and it should be studied further.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, the principles it represents and the extension of the judicial apparatus for which it provides. It does not go far enough, but it is a step in the right direction.  I welcome wholeheartedly the new system of judicial appointments which will remove any sense of political influence or motives which are deemed not to be above board, no matter how unfair this may be, from the appointment of judges.  I am not making any disparaging references to judges who have been appointed under the old system.  I look forward to the enactment of the Bill in the near future.</P>

      <P>Senator Manning said the Bill is important and radical.  I agree it is important, but I do not know if it is as radical as he believes.  This Bill is the result of a fit of pique by the Tánaiste with regard to the appointment of the President of the High Court, the debacle surrounding the appointment, the assertion by the Labour Party, particularly the Tánaiste, that one candidate was unsuitable and his threat to pull out of Government.  There has been a great deal of comment about how the Judiciary is respected and Senator Manning referred to its independence.  The manner in which this candidate was treated by the Labour Party brought respect for the Judiciary into disrepute and this should not have been allowed to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To add insult to injury, the bandying about of names of nominees for judicial appointment did a great deal of disservice to even one of the people suggested <Col N="1313" /> by the Labour Party for the position. This was not the way the Judiciary deserved to be treated and the treatment of the candidate for the post was wrong and grossly unfair to his family. To claim somebody is unsuitable for a job and not to back this up other than by saying that person is too conservative is unacceptable to the general public.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for an increase in the number of judges.  This is welcome and nobody in this or the other House would disagree.  However, this in itself will not put an end to the problem of waiting lists to which Senator Manning and Senator Henry referred.  Senator Manning gave figures for Tipperary which emphasise the increase in the number of cases being brought.  There is a minimum waiting list for civil cases of two years in the Circuit Court and three years in the High Court.  It has been repeatedly said by Members and by the Minister that justice delayed is justice denied.  Unfortunately, there are no facilities in the Four Courts to accommodate the additional appointments. The appointment of 18 or 19 additional judges is welcome and necessary but is only window dressing if there is no bench on which they can sit.</P>

      <P>The Government is refusing to build prisons, but may be it will build courts.  I do not think it can do so; my understanding is that it has to wait for the working group on a courts commission to advise it.  How can a backlog of cases be tackled without a premises in which the newly appointed judges can work?</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for the establishment of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board to advise the Government on the suitability of persons for judicial appointment.  In the Dáil on 28 November Deputy O'Donoghue stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The composition of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board has been radically altered, under the 1995 <Col N="1314" /> Bill, compared with the 1994 Bill.  It is no longer deemed appropriate that the Chairman of the Law Reform Commission should serve as a member of the board; instead, the Minister has proposed the appointment of the Attorney General, the first law officer in the land and the law officer to the Government.  That does not say much for the Government's impartiality and the Minister owes the House [and this House] and explanation in this respect...</P>
    <P>In perusing the proposed membership of the board my scepticism is, to say the least, enhanced by the Minister's proposal to appoint up to three persons whose qualifications are not specified.  There is no reason given for their appointment and it must be assumed that the Minister intends to appoint three politically partial or favourable individuals to ensure the Government has a representation of 40 per cent on the board.  The original Bill scrupulously avoided any political interference in its proposals.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning should not beat his breast about how politically correct he is with regard to the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Bill provides for the allocation of funding for judicial training and I greatly welcome this.  I particularly welcome that a person, prior to being appointed a judge, must agree to undergo training.  This is enlightened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also welcome the provision to allow for the appointment of solicitors to the <Col N="1315" /> Circuit Court.  However, I share Senator Gallagher's reservation that at least 80 per cent of solicitors have little hope of ever being appointed to a higher court and I do not see any reason for their exclusion.  I concur with her view that solicitors represent their clients extremely well.  Clients often feel &mdash; perhaps unjustly &mdash; that when they go to court their barristers do not fully take on board the cases they make in great detail over a long period to their solicitors. I support extending the right of solicitors to be appointed to higher courts.</P>
    <P>I referred to the composition of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board. I agree with Senator Manning about the independence and integrity of the Judiciary.  We have an extremely good and courageous Judiciary.  Mr. Justice Carney made similar comments last week.  Shortly after my appointment to the Seanad we had a discussion on the Order of Business about judges who are inconsistent as regards sentencing.  We have an independent Judiciary, but it is fallible like other trades and professions which make mistakes.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning made a point about politicising appointments, but he said he was not referring to previous appointments. If this legislation is supposed to address impartial appointments, why did the Government not have a problem when the Minister for Justice recently made appointments to the Bench?  If it wants to ensure that this independent body looks after such matters, why did it not wait until this legislation was put in place?</P>
    <P>There will be no courts commission under this legislation, but the Minister has set up a working group.  This reminds me of talks about talks. Government approval was obtained last summer to set up a working group on the courts commission.  That group will be chaired by Mrs. Justice Susan Denham of the Supreme Court.  This is not the first time her name has been mentioned in relation to this legislation. I am not sure if one can purchase or rent <Col N="1316" /> premises without waiting for the working group's recommendations.</P>
    <P>A Four Courts committee has been in place for a number of years.  I was appointed to it, but I did not have time to participate on a frequent basis.  It is composed of a number of distinguished members of the Judiciary and other bodies.  I know from the reports I receive that it has been examining the delays in the courts system for over 12 months and it has prepared recommendations for the Minister.  If the Minister is aware of the work of this committee, which is directly answerable to her, is it not duplication to set up an additional courts commission?  We want action, not additional commissions or committees of inquiry.</P>
    <P>Over the years the media's attention was drawn to wigs in court and Deputy O'Dea spoke about this on the airwaves on many occasions.  Although this is a minor issue, it is important.  I do not agree with Senator Mulcahy's defence of wearing wigs.  It is snobbery.  I do not know if they ever had a function other than to single out a particular elite group from the common herd.  I am delighted they will no longer be allowed in court.  I support Senator Gallagher's call for a review of such apparel and her suggestion that barristers should only wear a gown.  I am not sure if the legislation should have also addressed wigs for judges.</P>
    <P>I welcome judicial training.  Section 49 enables the Minister to provide funds for judicial training.  Section 19 provides that persons who wish to be considered for judicial appointment by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board must agree to take training courses if appointed.  Perhaps we should do more than just allow the Minister to provide funds.  We must ensure that funds are readily available and that they are not affected by budgetary constraints.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision about cases being transferred to Dublin.  It is an excellent idea not to allow these cases to be transferred.  Section 32 provides that an application to transfer the trial to Dublin will only be granted by the <Col N="1317" /> court if the judge is satisfied that it would be manifestly unjust not to do so. This has been used as an attempt to slow down the process and to cause additional hardship to the victim of crime.</P>
    <P>I will not comment on the extension of additional powers to the Judiciary and the taxing masters because I do not understand them.  This legislation is important, but it is not radical.  The acid test for this legislation will be if it serves the victims of crime.  The 1994 Bill was not perfect; it was rushed because of the Labour Party's insistence that it had to be introduced as a matter of urgency.  It has been left aside for 12 months, which suggests it is not as urgent as it was.  The Bill could have been law a year ago if the Labour Party had kept its word, which is a moveable feast.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have a lot to say on this Bill, which I welcome.  Most of the main arguments have already been made by other speakers.  I am in the happy position as an Independent of not needing to score party political points on this matter.  The Bill is useful.  The Minister sets out her objectives early on. <Col N="1318" /> She lists three, but I list two because the third one, to develop a longer term approach to improving our courts system, is a general catchall.  The two fundamentally important ones are to tackle the problem of delays in the courts by providing for more judges and to implement other changes in court administration procedures which will limit delays.</P>
      <P>As a frequent litigant myself &mdash; I think I must be one of the most litigious persons in the State &mdash; I actually enjoy going to court.  It is a kind of pastime, a recreation and I find it immensely refreshing.  So I speak as a user of these services, and the delays are very aggravating on occasions.  I have sometimes had to wait a couple of years to get into court, not just on constitutional matters but on other issues.  The delays are quite intolerable as are the conditions in court.  Senator McGennis is quite right in making the point about the provision of proper buildings.  It is a question of finance.  On the one hand you have an Opposition squawking about the Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  I am attacking all parties, which is very non-partisan on my part.  You cannot have demands for staying within budgetary lines on the one hand while looking for extra money on the other.  In a number of courts the dilapidation is pretty frightful and it does not lend dignity to conducting the business of law.</P>
      <P>The delays are problematic.  I have suggested that my interest in law is to a certain extent recreational.  Though that is a flippant remark there is an element of truth in it, because the court is real living theatre that occurs once and once only.  I rather enjoy it, but not everybody takes this approach to the law. People sometimes have severe problems and it can be a very intimidating, unpleasant, costly and painful business. For this reason the Minister was correct when she said that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1319" /> Delays in the hearing of family law business in a number of Circuit Court venues lead to a significant human cost not only to the parties involved but also to their families.</P>
    <P>That is a very accurate assessment of the human impact of these unacceptable delays.</P>
    <P>I welcome the appointment of additional judges to all four courts, which is an important step forward.  I also welcome the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, which will help to remove any suggestion or taint of political interference.  The administration of justice is an area where we must be assured that there is no political interference whatever.  I will resist the temptation to engage in point scoring against my now absent colleague who instanced a number of cases where she felt there had been this kind of interference in the recent past.  Certain named persons were held up to obloquy of various kinds.</P>
    <P>I put my feelings about that matter on the record at that time, so if anybody is interested they can look up the record of this House.  But I do not think it would be appropriate for me to follow in the footsteps of my colleague on this side of the House by opening up that tendentious matter once again.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to see judicial training being included.  This is something that has existed in the United States for quite a long time.  Judges are not infallible and it is good for them to attend refresher courses and judicial training courses.  That is something which I welcome.</P>
    <P>With regard to criminal proceedings, I am glad that the Minister is taking steps to stop the noxious practice of immediately granting a transfer from a regional court up to Dublin.  This was an invidious practice which was calculatedly used to avoid retribution and to delay the system.  It was a kind of filibustering using the legal system and it caused considerable difficulty and distress to witnesses, victims, and the <Col N="1320" /> gardaí who had to travel.  It was enormously expensive for the State.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that this kind of transfer should only be granted if the judge is satisfied that it would be unjust not to grant such an application.  Many of these applications have been made, if not frivolously, at least with the clear intention of frustrating or delaying the implementation of justice.</P>
    <P>I am dealing with these matters rapidly because they have mostly been dealt with the already by other speakers. However, there is something which has not been dealt with by other Senators and it comes from my long experience as a client of the legal profession.  The Minister raised the question of legal costs and said:</P>
    <P>The settling of disputed legal cost bills is the function of the Taxing Masters of the High Court or, at Circuit Court level, that of county registrars.</P>
    <P>That is true to a certain point, but there is an element of polite fiction about all this.  The public has a reasonable and real grievance here because the legal profession does not always deal honourably, appropriately or correctly with its clients.  If plaintiffs are awarded costs which are taxed they may frequently have been asked to put money up front. However, if they look for any of this money back after they have been given their costs they are told that there is a difference between client and own party or party and party costs.  The legal profession happily pockets the difference.  I would like the Minister to make this practice illegal, because it is certainly corrupt, immoral, wrong and unprofessional. It should not be done.</P>
    <P>It may well be that the Taxing Master so substantially reduces the costs that it makes it an inappropriate fee for a professional to be asked to accept.  I wonder, however, if the Minister will not be in a position to agree with me that it is simply wrong.  Awarded costs should cover the expense and one should not have to pay an extra 40 per cent out of one's own pocket because the firm <Col N="1321" /> engaged does not feel that the fee they have been awarded by the State is an appropriate one.  Either it is appropriate and has been properly adjudged to be so or it is not.</P>
    <P>This has happened to me on a number of occasions, and I say this without any grouse against the barristers and solicitors involved in this practice because it is a common one.  On every occasion that I have secured legal advice it has been excellent, but the practice is wrong and corrupt and should be stopped.</P>
    <P>I experienced another rather laughable thing and am still licking my wounds even though I won in court as always.  We had two days in court and I won my case comprehensively.  I was then told that because I was an idealist and a campaigner I was not getting any damages.  That is fine, but I got only one day's costs out of the two days.  It is absolutely mad.  If you appear in court for two days what is the point in awarding you costs for only one day?  The Minister ought to examine the question of legal costs as they affect the ordinary punter.</P>
    <P>I am fortunate that Santa Claus will appear at my house even though I have to pay costs, because I can absorb them. It is a minor irritation.  I am not bellyaching on my own behalf, but it could be a serious point for those who are financially disadvantaged.  For that reason I urge the Minister to take up these two significant points about legal costs.</P>
    <P>Turning to the business of apparel and wigs, I am distressed that I have never won the prize for the best dressed man in Leinster House.  Less appropriate persons have been so selected, even though I wear Irish suits of a very cheap nature.  My colleague, Senator McGennis, was not quite accurate when she said that the wearing of wigs has been abolished.</P>

      <P>That is fine because it does the civilised thing.  It says that &ldquo;they shall not be required&rdquo;.  So, people who find the wearing of wigs offensive or ridiculous do not have to wear them. Other people do, however, for a variety of practical reasons which I am sure have been placed on the record of the House.  Barristers appear to think that by wearing a wig they will not be recognised. Whether or not this is true I am not in a position to state, but some of them are of such a distinctive physiognomy that it would be difficult not to recognise them no matter what kind of wig they wore.</P>
      <P>Wigs give the appearance of equality to barristers and, apparently, court users quite like them.  They feel they are really hiring someone of substance when they get somebody in a wig.  This is perhaps a human thing.  It seems that the Minister has clearly met the requirements of the Bar Council in a very civilised way; it also behaved in a civilised manner because it voted to remove the mandatory wearing of wigs.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that solicitors have been admitted as being qualified to serve as judges.  The point was made that 80 per cent of the practitioners of the law are solicitors.  By not allowing them to become judges, we are debarring a huge proportion of practising lawyers from access to the courts.  I note the Minister has made some provision for them to become High Court or even Supreme Court judges.  This is a very good move.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have great admiration for barristers who often display a satisfied, theatrical flair and a nimbleness on their feet. These qualities, which are useful in an adversarial legal system, are not necessarily the best qualifications for a judge. <Col N="1323" /> A non-flamboyant, careful, quiet and thoughtful person may be useless as a barrister and not the type of person I would secure but could be precisely the type of meticulous personality who would be excellent as a judge.</P>
    <P>The point was well made in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 4 December, which the Law Society of Ireland kindly sent to me.  Mr. Murphy, the director general of the Law Society of Ireland, said that in society's view the person's knowledge of the law and his or her standing as a lawyer, independence of mind, judgment and decisiveness as well as ability to chair and administrate his or her court are among the qualities which are more desirable than experience as an advocate.  Other personal qualities are also important &mdash; patience, courtesy and, of course, compassion.  On most occasions one meets these qualities in court.</P>
    <P>The distinguished journalist, Nell McCafferty, did us an enormous service by exposing the bruising and hurtful manner in which the Dublin District Court operated and the way people, particularly those from a disadvantaged background, were routinely humiliated to provide entertainment for an audience. I would like to think that has stopped.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for her patience in listening to what I had to say on these matters.  I welcome this useful legislation. However, I urge the Minister to look at the question of costs, including taxed costs.  If the State decides on an appropriate level of remuneration, then it should remain so.  If the level is too low, it should be raised.  I do not believe people who have been awarded costs should be expected to make up a supposed or imaginary difference.  A judge should not award half an hour's or a half day's costs.  If a person wins the principle that they are entitled to recoup costs from their adversary, then it should be for the entire amount.</P>

      <P>I am sorry Senator Norris is disappointed that he has not yet been <Col N="1324" /> nominated as the best dressed made in the House.  From his description of barristers, he would be well qualified to be appointed as a senior counsel.</P>
      <P>This Bill has been welcomed by most Members in both Houses.  The Minister said the Courts and Court Officers Bill, 1994, contained measures aimed at improving the system which have been retained in the present Bill with some significant changes and improvements. She also said the approach to reforming the courts service will be on three levels: first, to tackle immediately the problem of delays in all the courts by providing in this Bill for 18 more judges, which I welcome; second, to implement in this Bill several other changes in court administration and procedure that will reduce delays and enhance the efficiency of the courts service.  Most people have had problems with the courts administration and all Senators spoke about the delays.  The reform which is intended in this area is welcome; and third, to develop a longer term approach to improving our courts system.</P>
      <P>I welcome the establishment of a working group under the chair of Mrs. Justice Susan Denham to put in place a formal structure to oversee the running of the courts and to carry out necessary reform.  However, I am sorry that this will not be on a statutory basis.  The Minister gave a strong commitment on Committee Stage in the other House that this would become a reality.  I accept that she is committed to this and is interested in reforming the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members have all spoken about overcrowding in the courts system.  Lists are long, court buildings are totally inadequate and consulting facilities are poor, particularly for family law cases. We all accept that the situation is critical. Even Senator Manning said the system is finding it difficult to cope with the number of cases coming before it. We see this particularly with family law cases.  It is surprising in a country which talks so much about valuing the family to see men, women &mdash; who are often the victims of violence &mdash; and children &mdash;<Col N="1325" /> who may have lived with violence &mdash; involved in family law cases hanging around unsuitable courthouses waiting for their case to be dealt with and having to discuss intimate family details in corridors or rooms which nobody would consider suitable.</P>
    <P>I welcome the commitment to increase the number of judges.  I also welcome the fact that funds have been allocated for the training of judges, particularly in family law cases.  I would like to see more women judges appointed.  Mrs. Justice Susan Denham was the first woman to be appointed to the Supreme Court, which was very welcome. Judge Catherine McGuinness was the first woman to be appointed to the Circuit Court.  I would like to see an effort being made to increase the number of women appointed.  They have a special interest in family law cases and there are many fine women lawyers in the Law Library who I would be in favour of promoting.  Most clients of free legal aid are women and they must go before a system which is hostile to them. If there were more women in the systerm, the psychological difficulties which they face when going to court would be eased.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to apparel.  Senator Mulcahy spoke about judges being allowed to wear wigs.  They have a choice, although I do not see the need for them.  For people who are not familiar with courts, they can be intimidating and I would have supported the total removal of wigs.  I am sure barristers and judges do not even notice because they are used to them.  Anything which may intimidate people, particularly those going to court for the first time, should be removed.  My party colleague, Deputy Michael McDowell, proposed an amendment in the other House but I am sure he never had a problem going into court and would never be intimidated by anything like that.  However, ordinary individuals who are not frequent visitors to the High Court or any other court can have great difficulty and can be quite frightened.</P>

      <P>Part IV of this Bill deals with its single most important reform, that is, the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board which seeks to depoliticise judicial appointments.  This is important and this Government should be keenly aware of the need for such a board given the circumstances in which it came into office. The 1994 Bill provided for the establishment of a judicial appointments commission which would sit in committee and recommend between three and five nominees to the Minister who would then make the final decision as required under the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The composition of this judicial appointments board has been radically altered.  One of the complaints against the board, as envisaged by the 1994 Bill, was that it consisted totally of lawyers. Under the provisions of this Bill the Minister will have three appointees and the Attorney General, who everybody accepts is a political animal, will also be a member of the board.  The Minister need not require that the additional appointees have any particular knowledge of the legal system.  It is totally a gift of the Minister's which politicises the board that will advise on judicial appointments.  This board is being established to depoliticise the appointment of the Judiciary and I find it very strange.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has not given us any convincing argument why this is necessary. <Col N="1327" /> She said that the Government must maintain its own discretion in the appointments.  If that is the case, why appoint the board in the first place? Why not continue to make appointments as has been the case rather than pretend to depoliticise the process? Under the 1994 Bill the board was to recommend three to five nominees and would obviously have to examine the applications and consider them in much more detail.  It was originally proposed in this Bill that the board would submit ten names but this has been reduced to seven.  It is still far too many.  Seven names will give the Minister plenty of choice for each appointment.  Since, at the end of the day, she does not have to accept any of nominees, it is just a pretence that we are depoliticising the appointments.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that this Bill will allow solicitors to become judges.  While many members of the Bar may not accept this, it is only right, as other Members have said, that when 80 per cent of the legal profession is comprised of solicitors, they should be available for appointments to the Judiciary.  One of the disappointments of the Bill is that judges are not required to retire at 65. Other public servants are required to retire at that age and we have missed an opportunity in this Bill.  People will argue that judges of that age have built up a vast experience but senior civil servants, teachers, nurses and others working in the public service have also built up a wide range of experience by the time they reach 65.  However, that is not an argument for allowing them to continue until they are 70.  Judges should be treated in the same way as other public servants and be required to retire at 65. At the moment many members of the Judiciary are quite young but they will age.  All public servants should retire at the same age, that is, 65.</P>
    <P>I welcome the allocation of funding for the training of judges which is very important.  It was one of the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of Women, of which I was a <Col N="1328" /> member, that judges would have continuous education.  It is necessary in any profession to keep abreast of developments and I certainly support this move.</P>
    <P>I was interested in Senator Manning's remarks about awards and annuities. The tribunal being established by the Minister for Health to compensate the victims of hepatitis C has a provisional award system which he said was not available in the courts.  Such a facility is important for people who do not know how their injury will affect them in 20 or 30 years time or for people who have serious accidents and are unaware of the cost of maintenance or how long they will live.  It can be difficult to make an assessment in lump sum terms in such cases.  Such a facility would be worthwhile but it is not dealt with in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I support Senator Henry's remarks about the details of family law cases. When campaigning in the recent divorce referendum I found that many people are unaware of the number of marital breakdown and family law cases going through the courts and the difficult lives many families have.  While it is important to maintain the confidentiality of individual cases, it may be useful, at the end of each law term, to publish a summary detailing the number and types of cases going through the courts.  This would go a long way towards educating people as to what is happening in Irish society.</P>
    <P>There tends to be a great push for reform when the public becomes aware of an issue as was the situation following the Kilkenny incest case and other child abuse cases.  However, family law cases are not reported and many people live in blissful ignorance.  They do not know what is happening in our society and it would be helpful if the Minister took heed of my suggestion.  I have often heard judges comment that it is a pity details of these cases are not publicised.</P>
    <P>Like many other Senators, I believe we have been well served by our judges. As somebody said earlier, we have never had a scandal on the Bench. However, people assume that if one is <Col N="1329" /> a barrister and affiliated to a particular political party, one will be looked on favourably when these appointments arise.  It is important to depoliticise the process.  I am sorry that the Bill does not deal as fully with this issue as did the previous Bill.  There are some other small areas with which I have problems but I will deal with them by amendment on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this Bill.  I have a number of questions for the Minister.  This review of the courts is welcome but it does not go far enough. Times are changing and tradition plays a major role in this profession. However, the courts and the Judiciary have not kept pace with the development of the State.</P>
      <P>While this is an attempt to adjust the courts structure, it does not go far enough.  I welcome the Bill although the Minister has a substantial input to the appointment of judges.  I would rather have that political involvement and responsibility than have the legal profession regulate themselves, because we can challenge the Minister for Justice very easily whereas it is more difficult to challenge the legal structure.</P>
      <P>I wonder why there has not been a review of the type of case the District Court deals with before now.  The District Courts in rural Ireland are in county council offices and small courthouses. Some of them are housed in very poor buildings and in some cases, district judges have &mdash; rightly &mdash; refused to hold courts.  There has been negligence toward and disinterest in the public in that the courts &mdash; I am talking about the District Courts &mdash; have not been maintained.  The district judge drives up in his car, puts on his robes, has a cup of tea and goes in.  The cases are lined up for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The type of cases dealt with in the District Court amuses me because I will never understand why somebody is brought to court for a fishery offence, such as fishing on the River Foyle.  They <Col N="1330" /> can be fined £200 or £300.  These are mostly people who are drawing the dole.  If a man with six children is fined £300 or £400 he cannot pay it.  I make representations every week to the Minister for Justice to reduce the fines for people who cannot pay them.  The family of the person who is caught would have to do without food or go to the supplementary welfare office for a hand out.  I do not understand the sense of that.  These cases are cluttering up the courts.</P>
    <P>Other matters the District Court deals with are television licence offences, sheep dipping offences, dog licence offences and water disconnection. I will never understand why there is not an updated approach to handling those cases.  We can have on the spot fines.  At least the road traffic legislation has a modern way of approaching this problem.  If someone is caught without insurance on their car they should be brought to court and dealt with by the court but the volume of less serious offences dealt with at District Court level makes this impossible.</P>
    <P>I look at the type of characters who are in court.  Some of them are up before a judge nearly every month.  It is a demoralising experience to visit the District Court when in session.  Is this modern Ireland?  Is this the stage we have reached?  Particular defendants are up before the judge so many times the judge does not know what to do with them.  If he passes sentence, he gives them a month or three months and local transport is hired to bring the defendant to Loughan House or to the prison. When they get there, the governor says he has no room and sends back the prisoner or other prisoners.  If the defendant is locked up the whole neighbourhood sympathises with him because he is in goal.  There is a scurry around and a collection is made.  If he got three months and does three days in goal he can get himself out for a few pounds.</P>
    <P>The State has spent a lot of money convicting that character and bringing him to Loughan House for three nights. <Col N="1331" /> It is the biggest farce over which any Government could preside.  I hope the Minister of State will say this to the Minister for Justice, because she and everyone else in the House is intelligent enough to understand what I am saying. There is nothing sensational or false about the picture I am presenting.  That is how the present District Court structure works.  The presiding judge gets case hardened.</P>
    <P>I experienced the District Court from the other side once.  I parked my car on O'Connell Street in front of the Royal Dublin Hotel and went inside.  I may or may not have been legally parked, but I parked for a couple of minutes to speak to a fellow.  While my car was parked a young man tried to open my car which was locked.  I went out very cunningly and caught him by the arm, which was a foolish thing to do.  I took him into the hotel.  It transpired that he was carrying a dagger.  Luckily I was able to hold on to him.  We held him in the hotel until the gardaí came.  The garda asked me whether I would attend court on a given day and I said I would.  On the day in question I came up from Donegal and attended the District Court.  The fellow was well known to the court and judge as he had been in court numerous times for breaking into cars.  He said he had the dagger with him to clean his pipe, but he had no pipe.</P>
    <P>I am trying to explain the structure of the District Court in Donegal and in the Four Courts in Dublin as I see it.  The ritual was observed.  This fellow was brought up from the bottom in a cage with a lot of prisoners.  The scene was like one from Taiwan or China.  This fellow got off and walked out the door.  I wasted my day in court in Dublin.</P>
    <P>There is a need for radical change in the type of cases coming before District Courts.  The present system is wasting district judges' time which they could use to deal with other crimes, such as social welfare fraud.  As it is, it has become a procedure with the same actors, characters and the same stories being acted out every month.  Has the <Col N="1332" /> Minister for Justice and her Department any intention of altering radically the procedure and the type of cases with which district judges deal?  I am not telling the House something new.  Everybody who is in touch with reality knows that this is the procedure from Cork to Donegal.</P>
    <P>People waiting to get cases into the Circuit Court or the High Court have to wait not weeks or months but years.  If you go to your solicitor with a fairly serious case about property, he will look at the calendar and say he will get it put down for a session in 1996 or 1997.  I refer to people who received injuries and are obliged to bring cases before the courts.  I am aware of a case where the doctor who examined an accident victim died six years before the case was heard by the Circuit Court.  The doctor was to provide strong medical evidence on behalf of the person injured, but unfortunately he had passed away. Therefore, no one was available to relate the nature of the injuries sustained by the victim.  This was due to negligence and poor administrative structures in the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>We do not require a superficial Bill which outwardly gives the impression that it will alter the courts structure.  In my opinion this Bill will do very little and is merely a cosmetic exercise.  The Judiciary will probably welcome the new structures for appointments, but this is inadequate.  More was expected of this Bill.  I hope that the current Minister, or her successor, will initiate a review of the administration of the entire judicial system.  The current system is light years out of date.</P>
    <P>A new Circuit Court office was opened by the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, in Letterkenny, County Donegal, a number of years ago.  It was intended to provide space on that site for the Circuit Court office, which is now situated at Lifford. However, the area proved to be too small, because the old court house in Letterkenny was rebuilt which limited available space.  Adequate facilities do not exist to house the Circuit Court <Col N="1333" /> office there.  I do not blame the Minister of State or the current Minister for Justice in this regard.  I blame the Department of Justice, which cannot be given much credit in relation to its administration of the courts, its own procedures and its examination of the difficulties which pertain within the system.</P>
    <P>A staff of 12 people are employed at the Circuit Court office at Lifford, which is within 12 miles of Letterkenny. These people have remained in the old building, which was renovated at a cost in excess £2 million.  The old courthouse in Lifford, which predates the State, was renovated and the Circuit Court office retained there.  To facilitate the two barristers who attend the Circuit Court in Letterkenny, it was originally intended to transfer those 12 people.  Six different reasons were given as to why they should be transferred.  The final insult came when they were privately offered £1,000 to do so.  As I understand it, this represents a breach of regulations because the facility to pay disturbance money was removed some years ago. However, an offer was made that they each would receive £1,000 privately.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State consult with the Minister for Justice to examine the possibility of retaining the Circuit Court office in Lifford on the grounds that 12 people are committed to working there? In today's age of technology and the advent of the Internet it is possible for an American insurance company to base its administration in Ireland.  No one can convince me that the prospect of retaining an efficient Circuit Court office in Lifford is a difficult one.</P>
    <P>The local authority meets twice a month in Lifford.  The elected members of all political parties who attend such meetings use the Circuit Court office extensively to examine titles for planning, etc.  The Department of Justice is planning to remove this convenience for elected members of Donegal County Council.  This is completely unnecessary and will inconvenience the staff, who are part of the structure of the office. The most recent excuse provide by the Department was that the staff of the <Col N="1334" /> Circuit Court office were living in terrible conditions.  The political parties in County Donegal stated unanimously that they are prepared to raise funds to carry out improvements to the Circuit Court office in Lifford.  The Department of Justice is not prepared to do so.  I wish to inform the Minister of State that the population of Lifford, which values the employment of those 12 people, will help fund the improvements to the Circuit Court office, without any financial aid from the State.  The Circuit Court office stands out like a sore thumb in the middle of an office complex which cost £2 million to renovate.</P>
    <P>As an elected member of the local authority and of this House, I have the unanimous support of elected Members of the Lower House to ask that the Circuit Court office remain in Lifford.  I ask the Minister of State to request that the Minister for Justice investigate the possibility on the grounds that the State will incur no cost and that the technology is available to provide the Circuit Court in County Donegal with an efficient administration.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to have had an opportunity to contribute to this debate.  This Bill is a very superficial one in so far as it deals with those involved in the courts.  It does not tackle the outdated procedures which pertain in our court system.  I call for a Bill in the near future to deal with that matter and how it affects the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Ms Burton) Austin Currie">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Senators for their thoughtful contributions and want to touch on a number of points raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy and Senator McGennis saw the Labour Party and, in particular, the Leader of the Labour Party as the catalyst for this Bill.  I confess the Labour Party was the catalyst for this reform and it is a good reform. On the fact that it took a year to bring forward the Bill, a similar situation arose with the Refugee Bill, 1995, which Members will remember was before the House when the Labour-Fianna Fáil <Col N="1335" /> Government went out of office.  The opportunity was then taken to re-examine that Bill and to take on board the points made, both in public debate and in the House, on how it might be reformed or improved.  The same process was adopted with this Bill.  In fact, it is a good mechanism by which a necessary provision coming before the House can be made the subject of a wide-ranging debate to seek, in a non-party political way, the best mechanisms for the desired reform.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy put it well when he said this was a Bill for the public, and I agree with him.  It deals with the reform of the courts system and impacts on the legal profession; but, quite honestly, it is not a Bill for the legal profession. It is a Bill designed to give the public a better quality of service from the courts system.  People have spoken eloquently of the delays and other features of the courts system which ordinary people experience in a difficult way and often when they are dealing with traumatic moments in their lives.  We owe it to them to try to bring the judicial system up to date in as modern and compassionate a way as possible, taking into account full consultation with the Judiciary, lawyers and also users of the system, which is most important.</P>
    <P>On the question of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, some concerns were expressed about both the fact that three additional members might be appointed to it and that the Attorney General is a member of it.  I refer concerned Senators to section 13 of the Bill, which states that the board shall consist of the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court, the President of the Circuit Court, the President of the District Court, the Attorney General, a practising barrister who is to nominated by the Bar Council of Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>By its chairman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and a practising solicitor who is to be nominated by the <Col N="1336" /> Law Society.  Can anyone suggest that these eminent people &mdash; and they are all eminent, highly qualified people &mdash; would be in any way intimidated by the presence in their midst on a board of the Attorney General?  I simply refuse to believe that, looking at the legal luminaries from every end of the legal profession on the board.  It is correct that these people are on the advisory board because these are the people at the top of the legal and judicial profession. They should be in a position to advise because these are the people with the knowledge and experience.  What did we do then?  We provided in the Bill for the appointment of three other persons of appropriate knowledge and experience of commerce, finance, administration or persons who have experience as consumers of the services provided by the courts who will be appointed by the Minister.  That is a substantial and progressive move forward.</P>
      <P>Senator Honan, who was also a little worried about that section, suggested rightly in another part of her contribution that she wished to see more women appointed to various levels of the Bench.  One of the points which I would make about this is that none of the eminent persons to which I referred as being members of the advisory board, is at present, as it happens, a woman.  I would assume the Minister would take the opportunity in making the three additional appointees to include some women of experience and knowledge of the courts who perhaps have been consumers. I suggest, for instance, women who have worked in the area of family law through Women's Aid perhaps, or women who have had experience of accompanying rape victims to the courts, or women who have been involved in victim support services.  All these people have substantial experience of the courts system, even though they may not be qualified lawyers; some of them are and some are not.  Bringing that breadth of experience to the context of advising on judicial appointments is a forward-looking and progressive step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1337" /> The history of such boards in this country is that their members conduct the board's affairs with great scrupulousness and care, even in a situation where some may have had a previous connection with a particular political party.  We are not talking about somebody who is a member of, or connected with, a political party being ever disqualified; but that he or she, once appointed, act impartially in the context of the function which they are asked to perform.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy need have no fears about the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  In fact, this will be one of the best innovations of the Bill.  It will also shine a light, which again from the public's point of view is important, on the way in which judges are appointed. Many Members of the House who spoke are privileged enough to have had experience of the courts, either as lawyers or as people who have had reason to have contact with the courts; but many ordinary members of the public have no such experience and the Judiciary and the legal profession are somewhat remote as a result.  Any reform which brings the courts closer to the people in terms of the understanding of the courts functions and the way they exercise those functions adds to the esteem in which the courts should be properly held by the public.  Senator Norris spoke of his experience in going to court.  I hope the day would arise when, just as members of the public visit these Houses and learn a little about the work which is done in both the Dáil and Seanad, we might similarly see people availing of the opportunity to visit the courts in order to understand the work there.</P>
    <P>Senators raised the question of facilities for family law cases and Senator Henry raised specifically the reporting of family law cases.  Again, as somebody who was involved in the recent referendum debate, I spent a great deal of time talking to small groups of people, many of whom were women, and attempting to answer their queries.  One of the issues which came up time and <Col N="1338" /> again was the extent to which people did not know of the volume and kind of family law cases in our courts.  It is important that we give the public the opportunity to know &mdash; and not in a peeping Tom manner &mdash; the kinds of cases which go through the courts.</P>
    <P>I can imagine how this could occur in court jurisdictions in the greater Dublin area or in Cork, for example, where there are large societies and anonymity could be achieved.  However, there may be a difficulty with family law cases in rural areas, for instance, where it would be relatively easy for people to identify the parties involved.  That would worry me.  Whatever system of reporting was devised, whether it be summary or detailed reporting of the case, clear provision would have to be made as far as possible to retain the anonymity of the parties, especially for the sake of their children.  It would be dreadful and unfortunate if a couples' children came to know the details of the estrangement of their parents through reporting. However, I accept the point that there should be better reporting of family law cases.</P>
    <P>On the issue of accommodation, which is related to the points made about family law cases and delays in the courts, the Government decided in 1990 that the local authorities should be relieved of the financial burden of providing and maintaining courthouses and that the cost should in future be borne by the Exchequer, subject to a limit to be agreed annually between the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>A sum of £6 million has been provided for capital works and £1.5 million for maintenance work in courthouses for 1995, which represents a substantial increase over previous years' allocations. Maintenance projects have been completed in over 40 venues.  The total amount provided in the courthouses subhead of the Courts Vote is £7.59 million.  Priorities are being established in my Department between the different premises requiring attention and, as many Senators know, work is underway in a number of locations. <Col N="1339" /> Therefore, I am confident the next few years will see substantial improvements in the standard of court accommodation throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Major refurbishment work has been completed in Athlone, Letterkenny, Carlow, Phase I of Galway, Donegal and at the Model School in Cork city, whose new District Court complex was opened last month.  A new courthouse has been approved for Carrick-on-Shannon and work on that has commenced recently and refurbishment works are nearing completion in Clonmel, Ballina and Ballinasloe.  In conjunction with the Office of Public Works, my Department has recently completed Phase II of a three phase refurbishment of the Four Courts, about which Senator McGennis was most concerned.  This work will also ensure the Four Courts, which will be celebrating its bicentenary in 1996, will provide an excellent standard of accommodation. All who work and have to go there deserve to be accommodated in the best possible way.</P>
    <P>We have made provision for the hearing of family law cases a matter of priority in all courthouse refurbishment projects.  We have had refurbishments in Athlone, Galway and Cork, which have the necessary facilities for conducting family law cases.  These facilities are being provided in all major capital projects and will be provided in future court accommodation projects in venues where family law business is being transacted. Senator McGowan made an eloquent plea on behalf of Lifford courthouse and I will take that matter up with the Minister.</P>
    <P>The working group on the courts commission will institute a full reappraisal of the entire court system.  It will be asked to review the operation and financing of the courts with particular regard to the quality of service.  It will consider the matter of the establishment of a commission on the management of the courts as an independent and permanent body with financial and management autonomy in line with a commitment to that effect in the programme <Col N="1340" /><i>A Government of Renewal</i>.  This is a positive and practical step and is better than the provision in section 29 of the 1994 Bill, which proposed to establish a courts commission with an advisory function on the organisation and management of the courts.</P>
    <P>As with our social welfare system, if we can inject up to date modern information technology into our courts system we can take a substantial leap forward. The days when, for instance, people had to wait a considerable period of time to get a judges' written judgment could be removed forever. Why not make it available rapidly through a proper secretarial system on a computerised basis?  There is a whole series of simple management improvements that can be exercised for the benefit of plaintiffs, lawyers and the Judiciary.  This working group will have an important function to perform in that area.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy referred to the publication of the judicial appointments in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>.  It is important that the input of the advisory board goes on the public record.  The new appointments procedure is to open up the judicial appointments process, not to interfere in it, and provide transparency so the public can have a greater understanding of the matter.</P>
    <P>In almost any job a person goes for nowadays, they have to present themselves, a record of their qualifications and an argument in favour of their being appointed.  Politicians do that when they go before the electorate and people seeking a university appointment have to go before a board.  Therefore, there is no reason why the appointment of judges should not be subject to an appointments procedure where the public can, at the end of the day, have the confidence that appropriately qualified persons with the requisite experience etc. will be appointed.</P>
    <P>A number of lawyers have spoken on this matter.  Members of the legal profession, inevitably because they know each other and they operate in a small world, are confident, and correctly so, <Col N="1341" /> about the calibre and quality of the members in that profession.  However, one needs to stand outside the profession and look at it from the view of those who are not members and ask what they need to know about it.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a dispute in the comments between barristers and solicitors. A song in &ldquo;Oklahoma&rdquo; says the farmer and the cowman should be friends; barristers and solicitors should do the same and call a truce.  We are working towards a unified legal profession where different functions and expertise are being used by both parties. The possibility of the appointment of solicitors to the courts is long overdue and is extremely welcome.  They have a depth of experience to offer which barristers may not have.  However, I also accept Senator Mulcahy's point that barristers also have a certain experience to bring.  Why not get the best of both worlds?  In that way we can improve the quality of our courts.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry raised the appointment of additional District Court judges, especially in Cork city.  The court system there has to carry a huge amount of work and almost everybody agrees that it should be possible to appoint an additional judge to its District Court.  Senator Cregan suggested that it might be appropriate to look at the matter in Cork city in a northside-southside context.  Many Senators welcomed the tightening up of the provisions in moving court cases.</P>
    <P>Senator Cregan has spoken on many occasions about the frustrations in Cork at court cases being moved to Dublin from Cork city and essentially being used as a delaying tactic to deny justice. It is an extremely expensive delaying tactic, because witnesses and defendants have to be moved to and accommodated in Dublin.  As a Dublin representative, I can say that the feeling in Dublin is that our courts have been clogged up by the fact that these people from Cork want <Col N="1342" /> to come to Dublin for some unknown reason, although we can guess at it.</P>

      <P>Other than for exceptional cases, it should be completely satisfactory that the bulk of cases which arise in Cork be heard in the Cork courts, in the same way as applies to cases originating in Dublin.</P>
      <P>There will be an opportunity tomorrow on Committee Stage to consider the various amendments in detail.  The Government has taken an open attitude to the Bill.  We have accepted amendments and have considered the Bill in conjunction with the original Bill, which was put together by the previous Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn. As with the Refugee Bill, I acknowledge the work which she, as Minister for Justice, did on the Bill.  It is interesting to see how it has been possible, given a certain time gap and certain changes, to improve on Bills in an agreed way which first came forward and to be able to accept the improvements in a way which is non-partisan.</P>
      <P>Often when Bills come from Government, it is sometimes very difficult for the Government to accept amendments. However, because we have inherited certain Bills from the previous Government, it has been possible to take them in a much more open and non-partisan manner.  This Bill has been a very good example of how the Dáil and Seanad can effectively work and improve Bills. I thank Senators for their contributions and for their courtesy to me today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 28, between lines 25 and 26, to insert a new paragraph as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(e) when making any appointments under paragraph (a), (b), (c) or (d), the Minister shall consult with the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland and following such consultation may appoint a particular person to be a director to represent the business interest&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter was debated in the Dáil on Second and Committee Stages.  I am seeking that the Minister allow the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland to put forward the name of a suitable member of its organisation to sit on the board.  There is hardly a need to bring to the Minister's attention the work chambers of commerce are doing in cities and towns throughout the country. They have a huge input into trade, commerce and tourism.  I have watered down the provision in the amendment.  I am not telling the Minister that he must <Col N="1345" /> appoint a member of the chamber of commerce because he might turn it down flat.  I am giving him leeway.  Perhaps if he consulted with the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland that organisation might be able to propose somebody who might even have a dual role. Many people in business in a city or town could be considered for membership of the board but they might also be a member of the chamber of commerce. Thus, the two purposes might be looked after.  I am asking that the chamber of commerce have some say in appointing a suitable person to the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>In our case there is no chamber of commerce.  I am a member of Foynes Harbour Board and there is no chamber of commerce in the area. There is an unofficial chamber of commerce in Rathkeale which is ten miles away and a chamber of commerce in Limerick city.  I find it difficult to understand why a chamber of commerce in Limerick which has no contact or influence on Foynes should be consulted about who should be appointed to Foynes Port Company.  There are other harbour boards in areas where there are no chambers of commerce, especially in the west.  Why would such organisations which do not have contact with and often little knowledge about the activities of a port be consulted in the appointment of people to that board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this proposal although I understand the point Senator Neville has made.  However, the amendment does not refer to the local chamber of commerce; it asks that the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland be consulted.  It is a mild and modest proposal. The Minister will probably say that no board would consider appointing members without taking local business interests into account.  The point in the amendment is crucial.  In the past ports have been bedevilled by restrictive practices, bad opening hours and excessive charges.  There is a need to be more responsive to customers' requirements and needs.  The motive behind <Col N="1346" /> the amendment of consulting the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland is one way of achieving this.</P>
      <P>I am not a believer in fixed seats on boards but the Bill provides for fixed seats for local authorities and employees.  If we are to have such seats for certain entrenched positions, we must ensure that the local customers and users are represented.  I long assumed that customers consisted of importers and exporters using ports.  It is only recently that my attention was drawn to the fact that the leisure industry is of crucial importance to the future of the tourism sector.  In some cases sailing clubs and others are being treated as second class citizens by harbour authorities. I can understand this because I would have made the mistake in the past of saying to such persons that they are only out to enjoy themselves and that the real work involves bringing in ships and running ports.  However, when we take tourism and jobs into account, the leisure industry, leisure craft and sailing clubs must be considered also.</P>
      <P>Is there some way we can make sure that all those who use harbours at present will not be asked to vacate them in future?  They are of real and not secondary value.  Consultations with chambers of commerce would ensure that all interests, not just local ones represented by local authorities, are taken into account.  Leisure and sailing interests, as well as businesses, use ports.  I am sure the Minister would say that no board would be appointed without account being taken of these interests.  I would love if he said this and took the spirit of the amendment into account, even if he has difficulty in accepting its wording.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. When the county enterprise partnership boards were being established, I moved an amendment to the relevant Bill to the effect that chambers of commerce should have right of representation on these boards.  It did not seem sensible that business interests in the communities in which these boards operate should not have a direct right of <Col N="1347" /> representation.  The same principle applies here.  It is inconceivable that people who know most about the commerce of their localities should not be on these boards.</P>
      <P>The amendment does not go as far as I would go.  It proposes that, following consultation, certain action should be taken.  This is a sensible approach. Section 30 (1) (a) of the Bill as initiated provides that employees of a port company who are more than 50 in number are entitled to two places on the board. This is a high level of representation for 50 people.  The business community in any port consists of much more than 50 people, all of whom have at some stage some connection with the port and probably strong views on how it should be run commercially.</P>
      <P>The most appropriate body to represent the business community is the local chamber of commerce.  Several county enterprise partnership boards include people from chambers of commerce; regrettably, the Kildare board is not one of them.  The secretaries of a large proportion of these boards are members of chambers of commerce. The same principle should apply to port companies and I commend it to the Minister.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the constructive and helpful approach of Senator Fitzgerald.  I am sure he is aware of the debate we had on this issue in the Dáil.  I will respond positively to the amendment.  With regard to Senator Quinn's contribution on the amendment, it is our strong intention that when boards are being appointed, business, professional and leisure interests will feature greatly in their memberships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the principle of the amendment. There is some fine tuning which needs to be done and I will do this before Report Stage.  I need to see if this is the appropriate section which needs to be amended to provide what Senator Fitzgerald is proposing because this section deals with worker and local <Col N="1348" /> authority directors and it may be section 17 which needs to be amended.  I need to consider the type of situation mentioned by Senator Neville, which is that there may not be a chamber of commerce in a port area and it may be necessary to consult not just the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland but also IBEC and other bodies.  The parliamentary draftsman will have to consider what we want inserted.</P>
    <P>I accept the principle of Senator Fitzgerald's proposal, which is that there should be a formal process of consultation with business interests and the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland, and I will introduce an appropriate amendment on Report Stage to provide for this.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 28, subsection (6), line 46, to delete &ldquo;persons&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;members of a local authority&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Over the years elected members of local authorities have been losing their power on many bodies.  I am not blaming the Government, but legislation has slowly excluded county councillors.  Section 30 (6) states that the &ldquo;Minister shall appoint 3 persons, nominated in the prescribed manner&rdquo;.  I am worried that the Minister or the county council could nominate an assistant manager or a planning officer.  I want to ensure that the people appointed are elected members of county councils.  Senator Cregan supported this on Second Stage. Those who are elected know what is happening and they have an input into legislation.  They are suitable to be appointed to boards such as these which deal with issues in their local councils or corporations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Miss Ormonde Miss Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Fitzgerald because I am worried that the word &ldquo;persons&rdquo; could mean officials from county councils or corporations and would not include members of a local authority.  I was on the same local authority as the Minister at one stage and I am sure he knows how we feel about the erosion of our powers.  If local authority members were appointed it would reinforce the role they play in local democracy by reflecting the needs in their areas.  Perhaps the Minister could consider this amendment to ensure that three local authority members are appointed, not three &ldquo;persons&rdquo;. As a member of a local authority, I would not like to be by-passed for an official who would not be answerable to the people.  Local authority members are answerable to the people.  We will <Col N="1350" /> do the job and ensure there is democracy on the boards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his concern on this matter.  On Second Stage we mentioned the watchdogs who will watch the operations of particular boards.  There is a general impression that the less one sees of public representatives, including those on local councils and in the Oireachtas, the better.  We saw over the past few months what can happen when public representatives do not act as watchdogs, particularly in semi-State bodies which sell property or land.  The Minister knows the work which public representatives do.  Public representatives from all parties are conscious of the fact that the public elected them.  Other people are not conscious of that and they can make decisions which are not as open as those made by public representatives.  I hope we can find a compromise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the other speakers.  The Bill states they will be nominated in the &ldquo;prescribed manner&rdquo; which means the local authority must nominate them.  We must ensure that the level of power and involvement of local councillors is maintained and improved.  A commission has been set up and views have been submitted.  I hope that will enhance and improve the powers of local authority members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was a local authority member on a board for ten years but not in a commercial or personal capacity, although these are important.  I was appointed as a public representative who was answerable to the people in my area.  Councillors on boards are often demeaned by many people, but they do an excellent job.  They represent the independent views of those who elect them and they are able to bring that to bear on the activities of a board.  It is important to continue this practice.  I understand from the Bill that it will always be a local authority member who is appointed.  We must ensure that the contribution of and the potential to involve local authority members in the <Col N="1351" /> development of the new harbour boards are recognised.</P>

I know more than three local authorities who would like to nominate members to a harbour authority.</P>

Four local authorities surround the estuary &mdash; Kerry County Council, Clare County Council, Limerick County Council and Tipperary North Riding County Council. Will we appoint three members from each of these local authorities?  That situation would to be totally unfair.  Unless there is some bit of give, I will table an amendment on Report Stage looking for a harbour authority for the Kerry region on its own.  There is nothing to laugh about with a couple of thousand acres of land under State control on the deepest part of the estuary.  As there is now fragmentation on the river we <Col N="1352" /> might as well have another authority or two on it.  I will definitely be looking for one for Kerry, you can be sure of it.</P>

      <P>Both amendments which have been moved by Senator Fitzgerald on section 30 &mdash; one of which the Minister has already agreed to accept, and this one which I hope he will also accept &mdash; are improvements because they are specific.  Senator Cregan and Senator Fitzgerald made a valid point that there is a propensity within Government Departments to downgrade the role of elected representatives.  Senator Neville has made this point on several Bills.  It is an extraordinary attitude to emanate from any public department.  Senator Neville put his finger on the most germane point.  The humblest town commissioner has something that other people do not, which is the democratic endorsement of the people of an area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>If Senator Neville or any other colleague serves as a town commissioner or councillor and goes onto a harbour board they are answerable to the people.  They are the only members of the harbour authorities who are democratically answerable.  There is something fundamentally wrong and it is not just in this Bill.  It runs through a whole series of legislative provisions we have had in recent years.  A distressing anti-democratic attitude has been evident in drafting legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said on Second Stage, it is vitally important that local authority members are on the harbour boards or their successor bodies because they provide a vital link between the hinterland and the harbour authority.  I strongly support Senator Fitzgerald's amendment to delete the word &ldquo;persons&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;members of a local authority&rdquo;.  On a small drafting point, I hope the Minister will check that when it says members of a local authority it means the elected representatives of the <Col N="1353" /> people and not the assistant county manager or county secretary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators on all sides of the House have put this point very well and the Minister should accept it.  It is a small blow to re-establish democracy.  I am not saying it has happened in this Administration, but over the years there has been a propensity to remove the elected representatives, which in my view is unhealthy.  It is an extraordinary feature of Irish life that one could be a mass murderer &mdash; having served his or her term &mdash; and gaily become a board member of any State body, but if you are an elected representative of the people you are unacceptable.  That is not right in a democracy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the idea behind Senator Fitzgerald's amendment which says that members of local authorities should serve on this board.  If the Minister is making changes to that section he should perhaps insert &ldquo;at least three persons&rdquo;.  That would get over the difficulty the Minister will face when he appoints three persons in Shannon because trying to find only three from four or five local authorities will be difficult. No matter who you pick you are not going to please everybody.</P>

From my experience on a variety of local authorities, health boards, town commissions, county councils and regional technical colleges, it is a fundamental error to use the word &ldquo;persons&rdquo; loosely.  It is of critical importance and should be specific that it is the elected representatives.  Senator Quinn will have to accept my word that the wiles of county managers and their staff are better known to the elected representatives in this House than they are, with all due respect, to my colleague, Senator Quinn.</P>

      <P>Senator Quinn said that local authorities may have someone else in mind who would not be an elected member of a local authority.  But the maximum number of members who can be appointed to these port authorities is 12.  If it is recommended that the Minister appoints someone else who is interested he should have the power to do so.  At least three elected members of local authorities should be appointed to the harbour boards.  The Minister has a solution to satisfy Senator Quinn's concern in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Members will recall that when the review group considered the membership of the harbour companies it did not recommend that there should be representation for sectoral interests, including representation for local authorities. In that sense it was a significant departure from what had been the practise <Col N="1355" /> with regard to the composition of harbour commissioners.</P>
      <P>In considering the Murphy report and in preparing this legislation, the Government decided there should be local authority representation on harbour company boards.  The Government did so in order to confirm the important link between harbours and the local communities and the economies they serve.  It was done to reaffirm the Government's commitment to local democracy and devolving to local government as much power and authority as possible.</P>
      <P>In doing so it was intended that the representation from local authorities should be elected members.  Senator Fitzgerald's amendment has drawn attention to the fact that the way in which it is expressed in the legislation leaves open the possibility that persons other than elected members of a local authority might be appointed.  I am accepting the principle of Senator Fitzgerald's amendment.  However, I need to give the parliamentary draftsman a bit more time because there is a bit of tidying up to be done as it is expressed in this amendment.  It turns out that where you would have more than one local authority it is possible to interpret it that they would all have to be selected from the one authority.  We can tidy it up before Report Stage but the principle is accepted.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to two other points which were thrown up in the course of the discussion.  The first is Kerry.  I am surprised that Senator Kerry is not aware that Kerry, in fact, does have a harbour authority.  The Tralee and Fenit Harbour Commissioners is a very important harbour authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation, as Senator Fitzgerald said, establishes Dingle as a fishery harbour centre.  County Kerry is doing very well in terms of the governance of its harbours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1356" /> I refer to the issue of where more than one local authority has an interest in making an appointment to the board of the respective harbour company.  The case of the Shannon Estuary port company has been raised as four or possibly five local authorities have an interest in that harbour company.  It should be pointed out that there will be two harbour companies in that area.  I am aware of the organic relationship between Members of the Seanad and members of local authorities.  I expect that Members would have views on how that should be resolved.</P>
    <P>The legislation provides that the selection of local authorities to make appointments to the harbour companies will be a matter decided on by the Minister in consultation with the Minister for the Environment.  Given Members considerable experience of the views and preferences of members of local authorities, I thought they might want to express an opinion on what local authorities should make nominations and the quantity for particular port authorities.</P>

How will we handle that?  My county manager told me that under this legislation county councils have nothing to do with ports and port authorities.  I told my county manager that Fenit would be brought under the jurisdiction of Kerry County Council.  If it was making a loss and if we only had one member on the board of the authority, who would make up the shortfall if the company ran into difficulties?

      <P>I am reluctant to intrude on the delicacies of the relationship between Limerick and Kerry.  The Minister must be congratulated on the way he has approached this legislation; it is a good example of how the House should work.  Reasonable amendments have been taken on board, although there have been instances where this has not happened.  I would be grateful if Senator Fitzgerald would have a word with me after the debate because I am in awe of his record in this regard.  My record in having amendments accepted is lamentable and my most recent minor victory was many months ago during the National Heritage Council Bill.  I would be grateful if Senator Fitzgerald would tell me how he does this because it would be of enormous use.</P>

Only two port authorities in the Shannon Estuary are mentioned &mdash; Shannon and Foynes.</P>

The Minister said that as there are two local authorities in that area, the counties could agree on something.  Foynes is only in the jurisdiction of Limerick County Council and I would like to know if membership of that board will extend beyond Limerick County Council.</P>

      <P>In many of the areas in which these port companies will operate there are well established industrial promotion agencies dealing with aspects of development that are port-related. Senator Dan Kiely mentioned the land bank in Ballylongford and the amount of land in the hands of the Industrial Development Authority.  There has been a considerable amount of development in some ports which is related to the activities of the industrial promotion agencies.</P>
      <P>During the consultation process which will take place when membership is established, I hope the Minister will take into account the views of bodies like the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, which has responsibility for tourism promotion and development as well as industry in the mid west region.  The previous Shannon Estuary Port Bill provided for direct representation for the Shannon development company on the board, which comprised nine members plus four from local authorities. There will naturally be a considerable amount of discussion between the port company, the local authority and the development agencies.  The views of the industrial promotion agencies, which are paramount if this exercise is to work successfully, should be closely scrutinised.</P>

      <P>The Foras Forbartha report commissioned in 1983 identified 12 or 14 deep water areas along the Shannon Estuary for future development. Some were located in Clare and others in Limerick and Kerry.  I <Col N="1359" /> intended to mention the future development of the Shannon Estuary on Second Stage.  As was stated by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, the Shannon Estuary could be developed into a second Rotterdam.  How will the Minister develop the Shannon Estuary to its full potential if there is only one representative from Kerry on the board? There are thousands of acres of land under the control of the State which were bought for future development in Kerry, Clare and Limerick.  The arrangements for proper representation are very loose.  There should be proper representation of each of the local authorities.</P>
      <P>No part of the country is similar to the Shannon Estuary.  The land bank is on the Kerry side and that is why I propose the formation of another port authority on the Shannon Estuary.  The State owns 160 acres of land, Atlantic Resources and Toyota own another 150 acres while Aran Energy holds 200 acres.  The deep water berths which will facilitate development at Shannon are all on the Kerry side of the estuary.  If there is to be development, the people in the area must be represented properly.</P>

Has the Minister the power to stipulate how many members shall be appointed from local authorities if there are more than three local authorities in a harbour board area?  Will he stipulate whether the appointees should come from the local authority area in which the harbour board is situated?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Daly mentioned co-operation with the industrial development agencies.  I expect that the port companies will work closely with the industrial development agencies in the development of the port authorities. We are beginning to see an encouraging development of industrial activity close to ports.  The best and most recent <Col N="1360" /> example is the way in which the development of the port at Bellvue in Waterford has brought industrial development to its hinterland.  I expect that will continue in other ports.  In the mid-west region there should be co-operation with SFADCo, and the other ports should co-operate with the other industrial development agencies.</P>
      <P>It is not intended to create any further companies under this legislation. There is provision whereby the scheduled harbour boards, which are not being established as State companies, can at some stage in the future become State companies if there is a case for it. Senator Dan Kiely's suggestion about a separate port authority for north Kerry is not envisaged and there is no provision made for it in the legislation.</P>
      <P>Senator Rory Kiely mentioned local authority appointments to the boards of the port companies.  There will be three local authority members and the appointments will be very easy where there is just one local authority.  In other cases it will fall neatly into place and most people could tell now which local authorities will make nominations to particular port authorities.  In the cases of Galway and Cork, where there are two local authorities &mdash; a corporation and a county council &mdash; a decision will have to be made.  One authority may have all the appointments or one authority could have two appointments while the other authority has one.  Limerick is the area in which the number of local authorities exceeds the number of local authority places on the board. Some thought will have to be given to which local authorities will be the nominating bodies for that port authority.  I mentioned earlier that perhaps Members might want to express a view on that at some stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has powers to remove directors from the company in the event of non-compliance with the <Col N="1362" /> section.  I presume that power also extends to directors nominated by local authorities.  In that situation it would be desirable and reasonable if the Minister would consult with the nominating body before the person is removed.  I do not wish to pursue it but I ask the Minister to take it into account and provide for consultation with the nominating body, which may be totally innocent of the incident which led to the removal of the person from the company.  If the Minister is removing somebody because of an irregularity, he should consult with the body which appointed that person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The power of removing a director of a port company here relates to a situation where the Minister is satisfied that the director has contravened section 32 (1).  This subsection deals with a situation where a director has not declared his interest in a particular commercial decision that the company is making.  In that situation it would not be necessary or desirable for the Minister to consult the nominating body.  The Minister would have to satisfy himself or herself whether the director was in breach of section 32 (1) where an interest was not declared or where the director had not absented himself or herself from the part of the meeting where that decision is being made.  The Minister would have to satisfy himself or herself as to whether there was a breach of section 32 (1) and then make a decision on that basis.  It would not be necessary for the Minister to consult with the nominating body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, if a director who was nominated by one of the three members of Kerry County Council who will be nominated to the Shannon Estuary Port Authority and one of them was in breach of this section, it would not be necessary to go back to Kerry County Council to consult with them as to whether that director should be removed.  The Minister would simply act.  In any event, I doubt very much whether in a situation like this the nominating county council would know if <Col N="1363" /> there was a breach.  In a situation like this it might wish not to be involved in a consultative process about it.  It is a case where the Minister would have to satisfy himself or herself that there is a breach of the rule.  If there is the Minister acts on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on this subsection.  For the first time we see strong words used and I am happy with that.  I am sure Senator Daly is also happy with the subsection which covers many of the points we were making on Second Stage and again yesterday in regard to directors who would have a particular interest being appointed and who would have a vested interest.  The Minister states the position very strongly in section 32 (1) (c) (i) (ii) (iii) and also in paragraph (iv) of subsection (c) &mdash;&ldquo;shall not vote on a decision relating to the matter&rdquo;.  I welcome that part of the Bill.  It covers much of the argument I made yesterday in regard to particular directors.</P>
      <P>We are always harping on the public representative or the local authority member but this has no relevance to local authority members in comparison to other directors.  The local authority member has to declare his interest in any business when he first becomes a local authority member.  Oireachtas Members now have to declare everything, and rightly so.  The local authority member is covered here more than anybody else.  I do not see any danger to the local authority member but I see a big danger to the people who would have an interest elsewhere or a direct interest in something going on in the port.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Members will have a great interest in these amendments.  The object of the amendments is to make sure that Members of the Seanad are not disqualified from holding a position as board members in any of these boards. I am not saying that the Minister must nominate a person from the Seanad.  All these subsections and amendments deal with Members of either House of the Oireachtas or the European Parliament. I am looking for the deletion of the <Col N="1365" /> phrase &ldquo;Where a director of a company is nominated as a Member of Seanad Éireann&rdquo;.  To leave that phrase in the Bill would mean that Senators would be disqualified.</P>
    <P>I will go back to what Senator Cregan said about local authority members on Second Stage.  These people are watchdogs. I hope I am not insulting anyone here in saying that.  Let us take Senator Neville who has been a member of Foynes Harbour Board for many years. I do not know how long the Senator has been a Member of the Seanad but I am sure that he and other Senators have made a major contribution to the development of Foynes.  I know the arguments the Minister has put forward. I will be brief because I know every Member will want to contribute to this. I want Members of the Seanad not to be disqualified from being a director of a harbour board.  I want Senators to be eligible for nomination if the Minister sees fit or if a Member has a dual mandate as a local county councillor as well as a Senator.  I know the arguments the Minister put forward in the other House and in the Select Committee, but those arguments relate to TDs.  No Member of this House can be a member of the Public Accounts Committee or the committee on State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">

      <P>Sorry, Committee of Public Accounts, where these boards would be brought in to answer questions. I cannot see a conflict there.  If a Member of the other House who is also a member of the Committee of Public Accounts is on a harbour board, it is possible that he or she could be adjudicating on his own board and that would not work there.  I agree with the Minister on that.  However, the role of Senators is totally different. Why would we want to deny Senator Neville the right to make a contribution to the Foynes board or any other Senators who are on boards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The harbour commission in Dingle does not come under this legislation.  I <Col N="1366" /> have been on Dingle Harbour Commissioners for 22 years and I am the chairman.  Every year when the post of chairman comes up every member, of all political persuasions, asks me to take the chair again not because I am a good chairman but because there is a tie between those people and they have a feeling for the work they are doing.  If I write a letter as chairman of Dingle Harbour Commissioners to the Department of the Marine I usually have a reply the following day.  Unfortunately if the secretary writes a letter, seven or eight months may pass before we get a reply, or we may never get a reply. Departments are afraid of elected Members of the Oireachtas.  Oireachtas Members carry the can for many of the country's problems.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister of State will continue to serve in the Dáil for many years.  However, what would happen if he found himself back in the Seanad with an opportunity to serve on one of the boards, which would be vital to furthering his political career?  Ports such as Dublin, Waterford, New Ross, Cork, etc., make a major contribution to the economy and Members should be permitted to partake of that contribution. I am not asking that the Minister nominate Senators to serve on the boards.  I merely ask that they not be disqualified from doing so.  They should be given the opportunity to serve.  I know the Minister will agree with me.</P>

The majority of Senators are members of local authorities and reflect the needs of their areas.  As Senator Fitzgerald stated, they can be the main link to the Department when a matter requires urgent attention.  In my opinion, it makes no sense that a Member of the Seanad cannot serve on the harbour boards.  I hope that the Minister will review this situation because he has empathised with our views to date.  I <Col N="1367" /> have served with him in another forum and know that if he were in my position he would feel the same way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>While I was a member the Minister for the Marine had direct control of the harbour board.  Now, however, it is a semi-State board with its own commercial responsibilities.  There has been a long standing arrangement that Members of the Oireachtas do not serve on the boards of semi-State bodies. Under this amendment, Members would be permitted to serve on such boards.</P>
      <P>I was a member of the Joint Committee on Commercial and State-sponsored Bodies during the period when Senator Roche served as its chairman.  He proved to be a very good chairman.  Yesterday, the House was informed that representatives of the harbours boards can be requested to appear before the Joint Committee on Commercial and State-sponsored Bodies to answer questions. The ensuing report of the committee will be laid before this House.  Senator Roche and I have agreed that the contents of such reports should be debated here.  As Members of the Oireachtas, we should be completely removed from involvement in reviewing and evaluating the performance of semi-State boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the Bill was published and during the Second Stage debate I have consistently stated that I have no problem with Senators being removed from the <Col N="1368" /> harbour boards.  The presence of local councillors will adequately cover local involvement and public representation. I assure Senator Fitzgerald that if a local councillor, as chairman of a harbour board, experienced a problem and approached a Senator for assistance, the Senator involved would move very quickly to provide assistance.  I am sure that any Member who was approached for assistance by a councillor with regard to a harbour situation would help in any way possible.  It is our duty to do so.  Members of the Oireachtas should not serve on the boards of semi-State bodies because we are required to review the reports of the Joint Committee in relation to harbours boards.</P>
    <P>Deputy Finucane made a considerable contribution to Foynes Harbour Board during his time as a member. Why should he not be permitted to serve on the board?  As a Member of the Oireachtas he should be permitted to do so.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I have been involved with the development of the Shannon Estuary over a number of years.  I believe I know more about the estuary and the people who control the lands along its banks than anyone else. This was one of the reasons I gained <Col N="1369" /> election to Kerry County Council.  I remain a county councillor, but I am excluded from serving on the harbour board by this legislation.  Therefore, I am prevented from lending my expertise to that board.</P>
      <P>Senator Fitzgerald referred to a situation where the Minister might find himself serving as a Member of the Upper House in the future.  If he were invited to become a member of a harbour board he would be excluded from doing so.  His experience of maritime law would be lost to that board simply because he was a Member of the Upper House.  That situation is completely unjust.  People should be permitted to lend their experience to boards of this magnitude.  The choice of those to serve as members of such boards becomes limited by the exclusion of certain people.  If the boards are to develop and their members are to lend their experience to developing the estuaries, the exclusion of Senators from service limits the Minister's choices.</P>
      <P>I am not asking that the Minister appoint Members to the board.  The councils involved in selecting the membership of the boards should not be excluded from nominating Senators because many serve on local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister and Senator Neville stated, there has been a long standing practice which excludes Members of the Oireachtas being appointed to the boards of commercial or non-commercial State-sponsored bodies.  A new type of State-sponsored body or board is now being created which includes local representation. One of the reasons the Bill was drafted as it is was to give local authorities the choice to put forward nominees to serve on these boards.  That is a very laudable ambition.  There is no reason a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, if nominated by a local authority, should not serve on the board of one of the new State bodies created to replace the harbour boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that context it is interesting to cast our minds back to the early days of the <Col N="1370" /> commercial State-sponsored bodies.  I have done a little research over the years as I have some interest in the historical establishment of State-sponsored bodies and it is difficult to find in any departmental files or, indeed, in any pronouncement by any Minister at any time in either House of the Oireachtas a cogent argument why Oireachtas Members should be excluded from the boards of any type of State-sponsored body.</P>
    <P>There is vast literature, and a huge amount of cynical journalistic literature too, on the composition of boards of State-sponsored bodies.  The argument continually put forward is that the principle which governs the appointment to a State board should be capacity, expertise and experience.  Those are the elements which should be represented on a board and it strikes me that a person who may serve years on a local authority should not, because they become elected to either House of the Oireachtas, be excluded from these boards if they have the experience and expertise and make a valuable contribution. It is the quality of their contribution, not what other title they hold, which should determine on which boards they serve.</P>
    <P>I made this same point when my party was in Government when there was a change made to the boards of a regional technical colleges.  I argued &mdash; and at that time I had some self-interest in the matter because I was a member of a board of an regional technical college &mdash; that the one thing I, as a local representative, enjoyed and to which I believed I made a personal contribution was my membership of the board of a regional technical college.  I am not being immodest or flattering myself because, if asked, members of all parties on the board of Carlow regional technical college would suggest I made a contribution for the brief time I was there, and it was never a partisan contribution. I happen to be interested in the regional technical colleges and the idea of spreading their capacity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1371" /> I believe the boards of these new bodies should be allowed cast their nets as far as possible on the waters in order to bring in as many people as possible with the qualifications, expertise, experience but, above all else, dedication to those harbours.  I am not flattering a colleague when I point to Senator Fitzgerald, who is synonymous with Dingle Harbour.  If that harbour was elevated in due course to the point where it became one of the new form of boards, it would be a tragedy for him to be excluded simply because he happens to be a Member of this House.  This is a sincere argument and I have made it more often with Ministers from my party than with those of any other.  There is a fundamental flaw in the logic which excludes automatically Members of the Oireachtas from any board.  With all due respect to Senator Neville, I simply do not believe that the argument that the same Members may on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies or, in the other House, on the Committee of Public Accounts and that they therefore have a secondary look at the boards through their reports, an argument which provides the Minister with a compelling reason for excluding Members of the Oireachtas from the boards of a State body.</P>
    <P>We will not be able to reinvent history with regard to the vast majority of the commercial State-sponsored bodies. The principle and practice which has been established there will undoubtedly continue and Oireachtas Members will not become members of the board of the ESB, etc.  But there is no reason whatever that a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, in his or her capacity as a member of a local authority, should not or could not be appointed by a local authority which believed they were the best person to serve on one of these boards.  A fundamental error is being made here.  The Minister is limiting choice unnecessarily. There is no cogent argument to support that view and I argue strongly that the Minister reconsider it.  I realise the Minister would have difficulties because he would be facing precedents which <Col N="1372" /> have been set by Ministers who were members of my party.  But I believe they were bad precedents and bad decisions, and bad decisions should not beget other bad decisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and I want to explain the reasons for that.  On Second Stage a number of Senators commented on the fact that Deputies, Senators and Members of the European Parliament are disqualified from appointment to the boards of the new port companies. Senator Fitzgerald appears to be setting new parameters for the appointment of Senators on the boards of harbour companies. In this regard there is a longstanding convention that Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas and MEPs should not be eligible to be directors of semi-State companies.  The rationale behind this prohibition rests in the risk of a conflict of interest arising between a person's functions as a legislator and his or her functions as a member of the board of a State company. For example, it might not be easy for a Member of the Oireachtas to be objective about draft legislation dealing with the semi-State body of which he or she was a director.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators, Deputies and MEPs can, of course, continue to serve as harbour commissioners under the 1946 Act because the provision in this Bill relates only to the 12 companies which are being established as semi-State bodies. It is important to recognise that the 12 companies being established under this legislation are semi-State companies with the same status as companies like An Post, CIE or Aer Rianta.  Nobody, apart, perhaps, from Senator Roche, would suggest that Members of the <Col N="1373" /> Oireachtas should be directors of any of these State companies.  If it is inappropriate for a Deputy or Senator to be a member of the board of directors of Aer Rianta, which is responsible for the management of Dublin Airport or Shannon Airport, then it is inappropriate for a Deputy or Senator to be a member of the board of directors of the Dublin port company or the Shannon Estuary port company, which is responsible for the corresponding seaports in the same areas.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald's amendments seek to establish a special status only for members of the Seanad.  First, I draw his attention to amendments Nos. 14 and 15, which, if passed, would deny employees of harbour companies the right to secondment from their employment if elected or appointed to the Seanad.  Perhaps Senator Fitzgerald did not intend this to be the result of these amendments, but that would be their effect.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 12, 13 and 16 seek to give a Member of the Seanad the right to be appointed as a director of a port company.  Why should the Seanad be different from the Dáil in this respect?  Both Houses deal with legislation and will exercise a supervisory role in relation to these semi-State companies through the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies.  A Senator is responsible, in his or her capacity as a legislator, for legislation which comes through this House.  For example, a Finance Bill might deal with the tax regime which should apply to the port companies of which, if Senator Fitzgerald's amendment where agreed, a Senator might be a director.  The House might deal with harbours' legislation at some future point which would directly impact on the company of which the Senator would be a director. We have had, for example, in the course of the debate on this legislation some sensitive issues dealing with the regulation of affairs between competing ports &mdash; such as Foynes and Limerick or New Ross and Waterford &mdash; and it would be quite inappropriate if legislative <Col N="1374" /> decisions on these matters were being debated and voted upon by a Senator who was also, simultaneously, a member of the board of directors of one of the companies concerned.</P>
    <P>We should also bear in mind that the port companies being established will be in competition not only with each other but, in some cases, with private interests.  Again I am sure many Members would find it uncomfortable to be in a position where they were legislating on matters which directly affected the company of which they were a director.</P>
    <P>A fundamental change is being made by this legislation from the local authority type body which the harbour commissioners were under the 1946 Act, where their position was in some way analogous to local authorities or bodies of that kind.  They are now becoming commercial companies with boards of directors which will be governed by the Companies Acts.  Specific provisions are being made in the legislation governing the directors of these companies and requiring them, for example, to declare interests and to separate their private interest from their function as directors of the company.  It would be inappropriate if a director of one of these companies was at the same time a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, which is making the law governing those companies and which has a supervisory function over the conduct of the affairs of those companies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to contribute before the Minister spoke but I decided to wait to hear what he had to say.  The Minister made two points I would have mentioned if I had spoken before him. He has shown an admirable degree of flexibility with the arguments from this side of the House so we have a responsibility to reciprocate when he puts forward reasonable arguments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first point is to do with the potential conflict that would arise in terms of legislation going through the House. While I am not suggesting that anybody would misuse their position &mdash; I know <Col N="1375" /> the quality of the representation on the boards has been high &mdash; when legislation impinges directly on the activity where one would be a director, one's attitude to the legislation would inevitably be coloured.  However, that is not to say we leave our personal prejudices behind when we come here &mdash; we do not in many circumstances &mdash; but the relationship is of such a close nature that one would be open to the accusation of having brought a narrow sectoral view to bear on legislation.  The Minister has certainly convinced me on that argument.</P>
    <P>I also support the Minister's argument on the semi-State boards.  I would love to be on the board of Bord na Móna but this would not be good for either Bord na Móna or myself. However, since a large part of my constituency is employed by Bord na Móna, there is potential there, however one might try to avoid it, for a conflict of interest.</P>
    <P>One cannot treat the two Houses differently.  A rule either applies to both Houses or to neither.  If the Seanad stands equal to the Dáil, as it does under the Constitution, its Members have to be treated equally otherwise the status of the House is reduced, which is another argument as to why the Minister's reply has been reasonable.  On balance, I would tend to support him. However, I am not saying I will support him in the event of a division.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to substantiate the many points made by Senator Dardis and the Minister.  While I agree wholeheartedly with the idea of having public representatives as watchdogs on boards, what we are talking about here are directorships.  A member and a director of an authority are two different positions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no difference in the Constitution between Seanad and Dáil Members in that both are Members of the Oireachtas.  As an Oireachtas Member, I do not want to be a director of any semi-State body and no Member should <Col N="1376" /> want to be either.  We are the national watchdogs and are elected for this purpose. I tell my local representative colleagues when they sit on certain boards to inform me if they come across any matter of substance that is relevant to the national situation.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald means well with these amendments but they give the impression that a Senator is not a full Member of the Oireachtas.  A Senator is a full Member of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">

      <P>We are not talking about money.  However, the real question is whether one is committed to being a Member of the Oireachtas.  We are elected by the people to do work at national level.</P>
      <P>I would not like any Member from either House to be a director of a semi-State body.  The Minister has already spoken about this in regard to the Finance Bill.  Points could be made there that may be relevant to a board.  Question marks could put over section 30. Senator Fitzgerald is especially interested in Dingle.  There is no danger of him losing his chairmanship of that board because of the excellent job he has done.</P>

      <P>Dingle has done well because of the Senator.  However, at the same time we should be subtle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have undermined each other for far too long by saying that we should be concentrating on local matters.  If we did this we would have no time to do anything nationally and then others could dictate policy.  We would not be able to attend Oireachtas committees because we would be too involved in local hospital boards and city councils.  While these are undoubtedly important &mdash; I am very involved in the Southern Health Board &mdash; I am also conscious that I have a responsibility as a national <Col N="1377" /> watchdog.  Under no circumstances do I want put myself in a position where I cannot speak about certain semi-State or new boards set up by this Minister because of serving as a director on one of their boards.</P>
    <P>I ask the Opposition to be subtle and to let the Minister solve this in a way that will allow all Members to regain the standing we deserve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I may have been the first Member to have been disqualified from a board.  In 1981, the leader of the Fianna Fáil group, Senator Wright, and I were directors of Bord Iascaigh Mhara, and that was when the provision that Members of the Seanad would be disqualified was introduced.  I took it badly at the time.  In the years we served on Bord Iascaigh Mhara, we were not biased in any shape or form and we served it to the best of our ability.  It was wrong to do this in view of my interest in fishing and the fishing industry and what I could contribute to the board.  I had been a director of that board for three years before that provision was introduced.  That was the first time I was elected and Senator Wright was nominated to the Seanad.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand why, if I am trusted to be a Member of the Seanad, I am not to be trusted to be a member of a board.  I do not demean the other House, but I cannot agree with the Minister's argument not to allow Members of the Lower House be members of boards because they could be members of an Oireachtas committee which would call the chief executives or whoever from the harbour boards to answer questions.  Can Senators be members of the Committee of Public Accounts, the main committee which calls for the attendance of members of these boards?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We are different from the other House.  For example, if we win <Col N="1378" /> an amendment on this Bill, it returns to the other House which will overturn it and that is the end of the matter.  If we had this power we could delay the Bill for the next three years, but we do not, nor do we have the same powers as Members of the other House.</P>
      <P>As a member of the Agricultural Panel, I represent fishermen.  My first nomination to the House was from the Central Fisheries Board and I have been nominated by it on several occasions to stand for the Seanad.  Is Senator Neville suggesting that this board will no longer have power to nominate me?  The Seanad is a different type of legislative body.  It was set up to do a different job, to be a watchdog.  We are watchdogs of the legislation coming through the other House, although we cannot stop it.</P>
      <P>The Minister's approach to the other amendments has been favourable but because Senator Wright and I were disqualified from a board, we must press this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Constitutionally, Seanad Éireann was created as a vocationalist body, and it represents in a vocational sense.  It is not a representative House in the same sense as the other House.  It is fundamentally at odds with the concept that one tries to put people on boards who know something about them, that one then passes a law that such people cannot be put on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The argument regarding conflict of interest was put forward for years in Departments against the idea of worker directors in State-sponsored bodies. This argument does not hold water.  I do not believe the worker directors on State-sponsored bodies have been anything other than a good and a positive force, and I would not like this argument again extended to see them being withdrawn from the boards of State bodies.  The conflict of interest does not apply here, indeed I would go further than other Senators in that I do not <Col N="1379" /> want to penalise Members of the other House, but they can speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>The point was made that there is a difference between being a director and being a member of a local authority. There is not a great difference because the members of the local authorities should, in my view, look on themselves as directors charged with the task of ensuring efficiency and effectiveness.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that the argument regarding a conflict of interest holds water.  For example, I am a member of a vocational education committee, I am a Member of this House and I was a Member of the other House.  I had no difficulties airing my views on vocational education committees.  In addition, I am a member of a health board, which has been an educative process, and I do not have any problem arguing the case here for or against the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <P>The arguments here have not been well thought through.  I thank the Minister for his exposition because he came as close as possible to putting on the record of either House, at any time, the cogent arguments against boards of directors.  However, I do not accept the validity of the arguments.  I have a fundamental problem with them, especially with regard to this House, which was put in place to be semi vocationalist.  I do not believe the arguments can stand.</P>

      <P>I speak reluctantly because I have reservations about the amendment.  Members of the Oireachtas, with all the time they have to spend in Dublin and so on, may not have the time to devote their energies to State boards.  There are other elected members of local authorities equally <Col N="1380" /> qualified in this regard.  I may not be gifted with the qualities or the abilities that God bestowed on Senator Roche, but there is a limit to what can be done. If the amendment is pressed I will vote for it, but I will do so with my feet, not my heart, because I believe that on this issue we are greedy.</P>

      <P>I do not see why the Senator should visit on me or on the Bill a grudge he has about being removed from the board of BIM 14 years ago.  I am sure there are other ways he could have exercised his spleen on this.  I ask Senator Fitzgerald to reconsider the matter, taking account of opinions that have been expressed on his own side of the House.</P>
      <P>There is not a case for making a distinction between the Dáil and the Seanad.  Senator Dardis put it accurately when he said that one either has or does not have Members of the Oireachtas as directors of companies.</P>

      <P>Anois, ní chuirfidh mé aon am amu ag tagairt don aighneas náisiúnta ná aon rud mar sin.  Ní chuige sin atáim anocht, ach chun ár n-aire a dhíriú ar staid na teanga sa chóras oideachais i gcoitinne, agus ar na deacrachtaí speisialta atá le réiteach ag na Gaelscoileanna agus ag na scoileanna sa Ghaeltacht ach go háirithe.  Léigh mé cúpla abairt ón aighneacht a chuir an grúpa anailíse faoi na húdaráis oideachais áitiúla i dtoll a chéile faoi na Gaelscoileanna an bhliain seo caite.  Tá ár n-aire á dhíriú air sin agus deirtear ansin, ó thaobh na Gaelscolaíochta de, is gá go n-aithneofaí gur tír dhátheangach í Éire agus go bhfuil polasaí dátheangach ag an Stát, is cuma cé chomh teoranta is atá sé ó thaobh feidhmithe de.

    </Speaker>
    <P>That may be one of the most backhanded compliments the Department of <Col N="1383" /> Education has ever been paid.  I hope the Minister will recognise there is genuine concern among Gaelscoileanna and those concerned with education in and through Irish about the potential implications of the neglect of these schools in the White Paper.  In chapter 14, which deals with the establishment of education boards, a whole series of objectives and functions are listed in which education in Irish is completely neglected. It is one of the most striking omissions in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>I am not proposing &mdash; there has been misunderstanding about this &mdash; a series of boards to mark the proposed ten education boards for gaelscoileanna and various Gaeltacht areas within the proposed regional areas.  I propose a national organisation with national responsibility for the problems common to teaching in what is a minority language for practical purposes in a country which is officially bilingual but for which little specific pedagogic provision is made for teaching through the minority language. There are major issues here which require to be teased out and confronted in a systematic way and not to be evaded.</P>
    <P>My disappointment with the White Paper on Education is that it does not begin to recognise the issues which emerge in that regard.  As far as the overall approach to the policy decisions listed in the chapter on the establishment of education boards is concerned, several can be met more effectively at this stage, as far as the Gaelscoileanna and the Gaeltacht schools are concerned, by a national board.  In terms of parental involvement, for example, the Gaelscoileanna are parent driven.  It is a remarkable organisation in terms of the voluntary involvement of parents in our education system.  Whatever one thinks of the decisions parents may take, one should recognise the intensity of parent's commitment in the Gaelscoil movement to the education objectives.  It states that the regional boards' activities should be consistent with and contribute to the realisation of overall national educational policy and objectives.</P>

      <Col N="1384" /> It seems impractical &mdash; I am open to correction &mdash; that in ten educational boards, where a small number of Gaelscoileanna are within the remit of the individual boards, there will be the expertise, whatever about the commitment, to cope with the challenges presented by teaching in a minority language.  I find it difficult to believe that, whatever the commitment of individuals, more than a tiny factor of their time can be devoted to considering all the implications which arise in terms of the optimum type of resourcing, the curriculum and the pedagogian role, about which I am concerned, of all-Irish schools and what regional educational boards can be expected to contribute.  It seems unrealistic to assume, given the small number of schools within any individual board's remit, that this will feature prominently or that they will have the staff capable of dealing through Irish with the schools.</P>
    <P>It has been one of the main problems of what I would call the anglicisation of the educational system that the State has been one of the main agents of anglicisation in the Gaeltacht.  This is not exclusive to the Department of Education, but every State agency and organisation has played a role in diminishing the place of Irish in the Gaeltacht, even when national policy was directed in the contrary direction.  There is ample empirical evidence available in this regard. It seems to be imposing an unrealistic expectation on the regional boards to assume that they can do full justice to the demands of education through Irish in the Gaelscoileanna at this time.</P>
    <P>The Gaelscoileanna satisfy a number of the principles which the White Paper on Education elucidates.  The report on the National Education Convention noted a concern that the highly centralised character of education administration has also fostered a culture of dependency with an over reliance placed by institution of a Department's role which may have resulted in a sapping of self-reliance and innovative approaches at local level.  There may be a good case here in general terms, whatever our criterion <Col N="1385" /> of local may be.  There is no educational movement in the country which has displayed greater self-reliance and greater capacity for innovation than the Gaelscoileanna, which in many respects are a model of what one would hope other schools would be.</P>
    <P>The demand which will be made on the Gaelscoileanna in dealing with ten regional educational bodies will divert a lot of the energy which could be focused more constructively on building on what they have already achieved.  I stress that I am not a supporter of boards for the sake of boards.  It is a consistent theme in my writing and in my speeches that we have too much fragmentation in this country.  I support local initiatives, whether that is achieved most effectively through the type of regional body the Minister has in mind or not.  I do not support fragmentation or more boards for the sake of more boards.</P>
    <P>One must always ask if there is a particular challenge to be confronted, if there is a specific problem and what is the most effective institutional arrangement for dealing with it in present circumstances. A board capable of providing services on a national level, whose thinking is immersed in the most advanced international thinking on education through a minority language, is in our current state of development, the most effective way of approaching this problem. It involves co-operation with regional boards in those areas where co-operation makes sense.  I cannot see &mdash; I am open to correction &mdash; how any regional board, as envisaged, will have either the resources or the expertise to provide the most effective possible service in terms of conceptualisation of how one can progress education through the Irish language and how one can progress the purpose of the Gaelscoileanna unless there is a significant national will. We cannot divide it up into ten groups because there is no core to split into ten areas.</P>
    <P>This comes back to the weight one lays on the objective of promoting Irish in education and education through Irish.  There were disastrous results in <Col N="1386" /> Irish in this year's leaving certificate. These were even more disastrous than it seemed because we focused attention on the failure rate on the ordinary paper.  However, it does not stop there. If one tried to conduct a sustained discussion in Irish with many of those who passed, one would not be able to do so because they cannot put two sentences together.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of disinvestment in the Irish language programme in schools. The Gaelscoileanna have provided a purpose, a focus and a return on the investment in terms of the declared objectives of the State which provides some ray of hope that it is possible to promote education effectively through Irish to bring people to a level where Irish can be a normal part of their vernacular.  We need to sustain this development.  There is not a word in the White Paper about the responsibility of the regional councils in the direction of the Irish language. If we are to achieve those objectives, which we pronounce to be national objectives, we need a national body capable of sustaining the momentum they have already achieved and of ensuring that in the Gaeltacht areas the constant erosion of the Gaeltacht schools will be reversed if that is possible.</P>

      <P>I second the motion.</P>
      <P>I bhFraincis, nuair a labhraíonn duine go drochmheasúil, deir sé faoi dhuine eile go bhfuil blas vache espagnole, nó bó Spáinní ar a chuid cainte.  Mo léan, níl mé chomh líofa ná chomh snasta sin ó thaobh na Gaeilge de, mar blas bó United Europe atá agamsa anois.</P>
      <P>I am not going to attempt to converse as Gaeilge and I am ashamed to do so. I went back to school a couple of years ago and did my five or six weeks in Merrion Square where I was delighted to learn there are other ways of learning Irish than those I had experienced in my school days.  In just a few weeks I learned what I had failed to learn in 13 or 14 years at school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I rise to support Senator Lee, therefore, in order to find a way to teach Irish in a more effective way.  This needs to <Col N="1387" /> be done both in the Gaeltacht itself and in the Gaelscoileanna that are now becoming so popular around the country.</P>
    <P>My children attended Gaelscoileanna and went to Ring for full year courses. There is a love for the language in the country and a demand to learn it.  Senator Lee has touched a nerve and out of frustration he is saying that we are not facing up to the challenge in a modern way.  We are teaching Irish in a manner which is not succeeding, but Senator Lee has said he is not certain this motion is the only way to go about improving it.</P>
    <P>With the regional boards we have the opportunity to face up to this challenge in a different way.  Like Senator Lee, I am concerned about the creation of more boards.  I personally have experience in the leaving certificate applied programme area where the Minister has faced the challenge and has grabbed hold of an opportunity to make sure that 90 per cent of school children will go on to sit the leaving certificate.</P>
    <P>There is an ability to face up to the challenge of teaching and learning Irish differently from the methods used in the past.  I am not sure that setting up boards for Gaelscoileanna or for the Gaeltacht schools is the right way.  However, I support Senator Lee's motion.  It gives the Minister an opportunity to respond with concern for the manner in which we have been learning Irish for the last 70 years and which is clearly not succeeding.</P>
    <P>The Minister's response will be well thought out and I hope it will take into account the challenges that Senator Lee has put before us.  I am sure the Minister will respond with concern, but let us face the fact that we have not succeeded.</P>
    <P>The report on education has not been able to face up to the challenge through the regional boards.  If the answer is to have boards dedicated to teaching the Irish language then we may have to do that.  I hope there is an alternative and I look forward to hearing it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>Scrios amach na focla go léir tar éis &ldquo;Molann Seanad Éireann&rdquo; agus cuir na focla seo leanas ina n-áit:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;go sásófar na riachtanais ar leith atá ag scoileanna agus oideachas Gaeltachta agus scoileanna Lán-Ghaeilge sna Boird Oideachais atá molta sa Pháipéar Bán Oideachais.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil le Seandóirí Lee agus Quinn as ucht an tairiscint seo a chur faoinár mbráid, ach ba mhaith liom leasú a mholadh don Teach.</P>
      <P>I move the amendment in the hope that we will not have a division on it. This debate is valuable and focuses on the policies we have had towards the Irish language since the foundation of the State.  As Senator Quinn said, it is self evident that those policies have not been successful.  Not many Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas could speak for half an hour as Gaeilge, even though many of us have had a fairly good grounding in Irish.  The fact is, however, that the conditions have not been there to allow or motivate us to continue to speak Irish as adults.  Most of us have chosen not to.</P>
      <P>As the years have rolled by it has also been evident that the motivation to learn Irish has deteriorated as well. Having been a teacher myself, I know that one of the greatest difficulties teachers of Irish have is that their students are not well motivated.  This is central to the topic we are discussing.</P>
      <P>Gaelscoileanna and schools in Gaeltacht areas have genuine concerns about the way they are treated by the Department of Education.  They see themselves as being very different from ordinary schools and they feel their needs are not being properly represented.  This is a good opportunity to place these difficulties before the Minister and to see how they might be resolved, because such schools have grievances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may well be that the Department of Education needs to change its attitude, <Col N="1389" /> not just to Gaeltacht schools but to all schools.  Perhaps we need a more customer friendly attitude from them. Some Departments are trying to restate their mission and becoming more customer friendly is on top of their agendas. The Revenue Commissioners, for example, have succeeded in becoming far more customer friendly over the past couple of years.  They are getting a much better reaction from the public as a result. There may be a need to examine how the Department of Education is dealing with schools in general, including Gaelscoileanna and schools in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>On a few occasions this year the Minister has had discussions with the people who have put forward a national policy that we should have an education board to look after Gaelscoileanna and Gaeltacht schools.  I have no doubt that as a result of those discussions the Minister has been told in detail what the deficiencies are.  I was glad to hear that this is not seen as the be all and end all of solving the difficulties concerning our Irish language policy; nor is it seen as the panacea for all ills in Gaelscoileanna and schools in the Gaeltacht areas.  It opens up a valuable discussion which we should focus on as much as we can.</P>
    <P>We have spent a lot of money, energy and time discussing policies for the development of Irish.  It is our national objective, and always has been, to try to revive the language.  One of the major steps taken with the support of various Governments in that direction concerned the growth of Gaelscoileanna across the country.  I meet ten year old children who are happily multi-lingual and who find it easy to converse in Irish and English. They can switch on and off as required when speaking to people and it is wonderful to see that.  I have no doubt that it helps them to be better linguists in general, thus learning and using other languages later on.  It is a shame that the school day is not longer so that pupils could have more time to learn a third language with Irish and English.</P>
    <P>Our policies have not been too fruitful. They have been given a considerable <Col N="1390" /> injection by the growth in Gaelscoileanna. Those of us who are interested in the Irish language would like to see that growth continuing and more parents coming together to form such schools to promote the language.</P>
    <P>Is it a good idea to have a separate board look after the interests of these schools which are scattered through the country?  I do not it believe that it would be a good thing.  From my experience I have found that the parents who come together to set up Gaelscoileanna are highly motivated.  The interaction of these parents with those of children in ordinary schools would be very beneficial and would help to redirect people's thinking.  If people become aware of the activities in Gaelscoileanna and the fine results they achieve, it would motivate others to put the Irish language in its proper context and it would help rather than hinder the development of the language.</P>
    <P>The motion is of considerable value and I hope we will not have a vote on it.  This topic may be looked at again. We can return with another proposal to put before the House perhaps a different way to deal with this.  It deserves more attention than we can give it and I am sure the proposers would agree that nobody can deal adequately with the subject before us in eight or none minutes. We have been dealing with this issue since the State was founded and we have not yet dealt with it adequately. While the Minister cannot agree to set up an education board, I know she has a deep interest in the language and in supporting schools involved in trying to promote it.</P>

      <P>Tá tábhacht ag baint le rún seo an tSeanadóra Lee.  Dar le Fianna Fáil, tá gá le seirbhís speisialta oideachais maidir leis an nGaeilge agus leis an nGaeltacht.  Tá fadhbanna speisialta ann ó thaobh oideachais trí Ghaeilge, fadhbanna a bhaineann le siollabais, téacsleabhair, áiseanna agus le teagasc i gcoitinne.  Tá gá freisin le tacaíocht agus traenáil in-seirbhíse do mhúinteoirí agus le seirbhísí síceolaíocha. <Col N="1391" /> Tá mé ag caint faoi na mílte mac léinn agus le Raidió na Gaeltachta, Údarás na Gaeltachta agus, le cúnamh Dé, Teilifís na Gaeilge, cén fáth nach féidir le haonad speisialta freastal ar chúrsaí oideachais trí Ghaeilge.  Go bunúsach, nil an tAire ná an Roinn dáiríre faoin nGaeilge.  Mar shampla, an Páipéar Bán a tháinig amach cúpla mí ó shin, níl oiread is focal amháin Gaeilge ann agus níor tháinig an páipéar sin amach i nGaeilge fós.</P>
      <P>The reason I support this motion is that there is a need for a special unit in the Department of Education to look after Gaeltacht areas and Gaelscoileanna. If a teacher telephones the Department of Education and wishes to conduct the conversation in Irish, they will have great difficulty finding somebody who can converse with ease in the Irish language.  Many Irish teachers spoke to me about that.  This service is not provided for remedial teachers, those who are on a panel, those involved in the psychological service and for in-service training.  That is why a special unit or service for the Gaeltacht and Gaelscoileanna should be available to those who wish to conduct their business through Irish.  As in-service training in geography, for example, is usually done through English, teachers seeking this service in Irish must translate it.  Surely, that is not good enough.  A special unit should be set up in the Department of Education to give extra attention to those who speak Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not find one word of Irish in the White Paper on Education.  I thought an Irish version would be published, but that has not yet arrived.  The Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins, published a Green Paper and simultaneously brought out the Irish version.  It is hard to believe that an Irish version of the White Paper on Education has not yet been published. I looked meticulously through the White Paper but could not find any Irish, although I hope I am wrong.  We are talking about the service we will provide to Gaeltacht areas and Gaelscoileanna, <Col N="1392" /> which was not mentioned in the White Paper.  People want to know what service the Minister intends to provide to Gaeltacht areas and Gaelscoileanna.</P>
    <P>We are now part of Europe and we want to promote the Irish language and to keep our identity.  The Gaeltacht and Gaelscoileanna will help us to nourish that.  The number of Gaelscoileanna is increasing in urban areas, yet the Department of Education seems unable to acknowledge them.  There is a need for a special unit which should have been in place long ago.  We should support Gaeltacht teachers and Gaelscoileanna in their endeavours to promote the Irish language.  Such a unit would only be a small extra dimension to the Department of Education.  It would consist of a small number of people, including remedial teachers and a psychological service, who could conduct their business through Irish.  Textbooks should be at hand and not translated as required. These services should be coming onstream because the teachers are calling for them.  They are fair-minded people and are not so overly ambitious as to look for anything to which they are not entitled.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to examine this area in the Department of Education and consider the creation of a structure to facilitate people looking for information or a service.  They should not be going around in circles when they need an Irish remedial teacher or a teacher who will conduct his or her business through the Irish language when that is what the parents want.  They choose to send their children to the Gaelscoileanna and yet they are not getting the service.  I speak for those parents and teachers who are anxious to provide that service, promote the language and go into the year 2000 with this process in motion and with the backing of the Department of Education.</P>

      <P>Sa chéad áit ní mór dúinn dhá cheist thábhachta a choimeád i gcuimhne &mdash; dílseacht an Rialtais don <Col N="1393" /> Ghaeilge agus don Ghaeltacht agus cén fáth go mbeidh córas oideachais níos fearr againn de bharr bunú na mBord Oideachais.</P>
      <P>Tá muinín agam féin agus ag an Rialtas i bhforbairt na Gaeilge i measc an phobail agus gur féidir linn an Ghaeilge a theagasc go héifeachtúil sna scoileanna. Tá an muinín seo léirithe i gClár an Rialtais <i>Government of Renewal,</i> áit a bhfuil an abairt seo a leanas:</P>
      <P>The State must play a leading role in expanding the degree of bilingualism in Irish society and, in particular, in achieving a greater use of Irish.</P>
      <P>Maidir leis an nGaeltacht deirtear sa doiciméad:</P>
      <P>Is sa Ghaeltacht is mó a labhartar an Ghaeilge mar ghnáth-theanga phobail agus caithfear iarrachtaí ar leith a dhéanamh chun í a chaomhnú agus a fhorbairt.</P>
      <P>Léiríonn sé seo dearcadh láidir an Rialtais maidir le forbairt chultúrtha, shóisialta, structúrtha agus eacnamaíoch sa Ghaeltacht.  Cén fáth go bhfuil boird oideachais á mbunú ag an Rialtas? Creidimid gur gá do phobail áitiúla agus réigiúnacha feabhas a chur ar fhiúntas na seirbhísí Oideachais.  Is mór againn tionchar na bpobal áitiúla agus réigiúnacha agus teastaíonn uainn iad a bheith lánpháirteach sna scoileanna áitiúla acu.</P>
      <P>Ní ceart go mbeadh an Roinn i Sráid Maoilbhríde gafa ó lá go lá leis na cúraim a bhaineann le riaradh an 4,000 scoil atá sa chóras againn.  Ba cheart go mbeadh an t-am aici chun tacú le heagrú an chórais ar mhaithe lenár mic léinn, lenár n-aosaigh agus leo siúd a bhfuil riachtanais ar leith acu, agus chun maoirseacht a dhéanamh ar an gcóras.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá daoine ann a bhfuil eagla orthu nach ndéanfaidh na boird nua cúram ceart den Ghaeilge ná de chur chun cinn na teanga sna scoileanna lánGhaeilge. Sin é an chúis go bhfuil bord ar leith ag teastáil uathu.  Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil an ceart acu.  Measaim gurb amhlaidh a dhéanfadh bord ar leith dochar do chaighdeán an oideachais sa Ghaeltacht <Col N="1394" /> agus sna scoileanna lánGhaeilge.  Léireoidh mé daoibh cén fáth a cheapaim sin.</P>
    <P>Deirtear sa Pháipéar Bán go gcaithfidh na boird feidhmiú i gcónaí de réir critéir áirithe mar seo a leanas &mdash; go gcaithfidh an méid a dhéanfaidh siad tacú le forbairt an pholasaí náisiúnta agus cur chun cinn na Gaeilge san áireamh agus go gcaithfidh siad aicmí éagsúla scoileanna a fhorbairt.  Beidh na scoileanna Gaeltachta agus na scoileanna lánGhaeilge ina gcuid riachtanach den fhorbairt sin agus beidh feidhm dlí ag an riachtanas sin.</P>
    <P>The plans and operations of the education boards will be subject to the review and scrutiny of the Minister and the Department of Education.  Any board which is not making proper provision for the teaching of Irish can be statutorily directed to do so.  The White Paper indicates that each board must provide for the systematic planning and co-ordination of the provision of education in its area; provide a range of support services to the schools; ensure the empowerment and participation of local communities in the education system and provide fully for the diversity which exists in the community, including the Gaeltacht community and the community of all-Irish schools, not to mention other areas of interest such as special education needs, multi-denominational needs and traveller education needs.</P>
    <P>The proposed boards of education will have the following advantages when dealing with the Irish language.  Their location will be in proximity to the schools and to the communities which they will serve.  Each board will be empowered to establish committees and/or specialist groups to advise and assist it, as appropriate, in the implementation of policy.  The Irish language or the needs of Gaeltacht and/or all-Irish schools are appropriate as issues for which a board might see fit to establish such a committee. I cannot visualise that boards which have Gaeltachtaí or Irish-medium schools in their areas would fail to give a high priority to their needs and I would expect that all of the boards would establish <Col N="1395" /> subcommittees to deal with the special concerns of these schools.</P>
    <P>A separate education board for Irish-medium schools, whether Gaeltacht or scoileanna lán-Ghaeilige would run counter to the two objectives which I set out at the beginning of my statement&mdash; the promotion of Irish and the improvement of the education system.  Let us look at a few examples.</P>
    <P>The Gaeltactaí are spread through the areas of five education boards and through seven counties from Cork to Donegal and from Galway to Meath.  At present, only four counties do not have scoileanna lán-Ghaeilge.  Any location for a headquarters of a board which would co-ordinate all of these schools would be as remote from the majority of them as the Department of Education is now.  The advantages associated with proximity of the schools to their boards would be lost in such an arrangement. If there was a separate board dealing exclusively with the Irish-medium schools it would have as much occasion for such a range of subcommittees as any other board.  However, the lack of geographical integrity inherent in such a separate education board would make such subcommittees totally unworkable and prohibitively expensive to manage.</P>
    <P>The principle of pluralism is one of the most important principles which the education boards are designed to advance. The existence of Irish-medium schools or of Gaeltacht schools in any board area enriches the system enormously. Grouping all the Irish-medium schools under the one education board would run counter to this principle in two ways.  It would limit the diversity within the separate board itself and it would impoverish the other boards culturally because of the absence in them of any Irish-medium education provision.</P>
    <P>What I am stressing here is that I do not want to ghettoise the Gaeltacht, the teaching of Irish or Irish-medium schools. After all, the children in Cois Fharraige or the Kerry Gaeltachtaí are more likely to identify with their neighbours in other rural schools in Galway <Col N="1396" /> or Kerry than with children attending Irish-medium schools in Dublin or other urban areas.  Conversely, children attending an Irish-medium school in Black-rock or Dungarvan are more likely to identify with schools in their immediate neighbourhoods.  I will not ghettoise Irish.  I will not deal with the Irish language in its teaching, in its living community, in a chapter entitled &ldquo;Oideachas tríGhaeilge&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Ní bheadh dóthain achmhainní ag bord amháin chun freastal i gceart ar na scoileanna Gaeltachta agus na scoileanna lán-Ghaeilge.  Conas a d'fhéadfadh scoileanna ar an gCeathrú Rua agus sa Daingean teacht i gcabhair ar a chéile?  Bheadh sé níos éasca dóibh comhoibriú le scoileanna eile i gContae na Gaillimhe agus i gContae Chiarraí. B'fhéidir gur i sruth lán-Ghaeilge i meánscoil áitiúil a dhéanfaí teagasc trí Ghaeilge.  Bheadh sé mar chúram ag gach bord oideachais féachaint chuige go mbeadh rogha ag daltaí bunscoileanna lán-Ghaeilge chun meánoideachas trí Ghaeilge a fháil.</P>
    <P>Tá a fhios agam nach bhfuil scoileanna Gaeltachta agus scoileanna lán-Ghaeilge ar aon dul ar fad le scoileanna eile.  Mar sin, ní mór roinnt socruithe ar leith a dhéanamh.  B'fhéidir gurbh fhearr téacsleabhair agus ábhar teagaisc trí Ghaeilge a chur ar fáil ag an léibhéal náisiúnta agus b'fhéidir gurbh fhearr cúrsaí inseirbhíse do mhúinteoirí a eagrú ar an mbonn céanna.</P>
    <P>Measaim gur beag atá idir rún an tSeanadóra Lee agus leasú an tSeanadóra Manning.  Creideann an bheirt acu gur cóir teanga na Gaeilge a chaomhnú agus a fhorbairt i ngach ceann dár scoileanna, ach dá gcuirfí bord oideachais ar leith ar bun don Ghaeilge d'fhéadfaí dochar a dhéanamh don Ghaeilge sa chóras oideachais.  Creidim féin go bhfuil stádas na Gaeilge slán.</P>

Is cuimhin liom go raibh ceann amháin a chuaigh <Col N="1398" /> leis an teorainn ó Dhún na nGall soir go Droichead Átha agus ní raibh mé róshásta le sin, ach ceapaim, ó thaobh réigiúnachais, go mbeadh an méid atá molta ag an bpointe seo i bhfad níos áisiúla ná an chéad rud a bhí molta ag an Aire. Dúirt mé sin sa Teach seo ag an ám.</P>
    <P>Anois, chun teacht ar an méid atá ráite agus atá molta ag mo chomhSheanadoirí, an Seanadoir Lee agus an Seanadoir Quinn anocht.  Molann siad go mbeadh pé ríarachán a bheadh ann do chúrsaí Gaeilge ar fad in aon bhord amháin.  Cuireann sin sort sceoin orm féin.  Sa mhéid sin aontaím leis an Aire. Níor mhaith liom go mbeadh aon sort <i>ghettoisation,</i> mar a dúirt sí féin, ar siúl. B'fhéidir go bhfuil sé sin róláidir mar fhocal.  Tá mé cinnte gur daoine iad na gluaiseachtaí agus na daoine atá ag moladh seo go bhfuil a mhalairt á iarraidh á bhaint amach acu.</P>
    <P>Dá mba rud é go raibh an Seanadór ag moladh, mar shampla, go mbeadh réigiúin ag Údarás na Gaeltachta faoin bprionsabal réigiúnachais, go bhféadfá réigiún nua, mar shampla, a chur ar bun ag freastal ar chursaí Gaeltachta, mar a dúirt an tAire ina hóráid, b'fhéidir go mbeadh sé deacair teacht ar aon sórt comheagair idir scoil sa Daingean agus scoil ar an Spidéal.  N'fheadar an bhféadfá é sin a dhéanamh, ach má tá réigiúnachas le bheith againn, ba chóir go mbeadh sé bunaithe ar an bprionsabal sin de réigiúnachas.  Dá mba rud é gur bhunaíomar bord nua chun cúrsaí Gaeilge a riar, an deacracht a bheadh ansin ná, cad é an chéad chéim eile ina dhiaidh sin?  An t-aon rud loighciúil a thiocfadh as sin ná an méid a bhí ráite agus seanráite ag daoine nuair a bhíomar sa Chaisleán, go mbeadh na hargóintí céanna ann d'oideachas speisialta, dóibh siúd a bhfuil freagreacht acu ar leanaí na tíre go bhfuil deacrachtaí áirithe nó go bhfuil freagrachtaí áirithe ag baint leo.  Bheadh oideachas speisialta ar bhord eile ansin.</P>
    <P>Is féidir dul ar aghaidh céim ar chéim le sin agus is féidir an argóint chéanna a chur ann i bhfabhar bord nua a bheith ann, mar shampla, do scoileanna nó áiteanna atá faoi mhíbhuntáiste.  Ansin <Col N="1399" /> bheadh macnamh á dheanamh ar an bprionsabal ó thús.  Nílim ag rá go bhfuil aon rud mícheart leis an gcóras oideachas a ríar sa tslí sin más sin atá i gceist againn, ach más é sin atá i gceist againn, ní réigiúnachas é sin agus caithfimid réigiúnachas a chur ar leataobh agus dul ar aghaidh i slí eile, go mbeadh stiúradh lárnach ar ghnéithe áirithe den chóras oideachais agus go bhféadfaimis dul ar aghaidh céim ar chéim mar sin. Is féidir le daoine é sin a phlé.  Tá sé seanphléite agus táimid tagtha anois go dtí an pointe go gceapann daoine nár cheart go mbeadh daoine i Sráid Marlborough ag déanamh gach cinneadh ar leith do scoileanna i ngach cuid den tír. Sin é an fáth gur tháinig daoine i bhfábhar an réigiúnachais.</P>
    <P>Nílim chun an argóint sin a thosú arís, ach ba mhaith liom cúpla rud a rá go ginearálta ar a lán de na rudaí atá ráite go dtí seo. Tá sé ráite agam roimhe seo agus déarfaidh mé arís é, go gceapaim féin go bhfuil scoileanna Gaeltachta na tíre seo faoi mhíbhuntáiste.  Tá sin ráite agam go minic.  Ceann de na deacrachtaí atá ag muintir na Gaeltachta ná seo: a lán acu tá tithe nua acu atá togtha le deontais agus tá <i>ambience</i> na Gaeltachta, go mórmhór i rith an tSamhraidh, it looks a lovely comfortable place to live in.  Dáiríre níl mórán airgid ag munitir na Gaeltachta agus tá sé andeacair fiú an Ghaeilge féin a mhuineadh do leanaí na Gaeltachta ag an bpointe seo.  D'fhreastail mé féin ar scoil Ghaeltachta, agus nuair a bhuaileas isteach ar scoil Ghaeltachta dhá mhí ó shin bhí mé ag caint leis an mbunmhuinteóir i rang na naíonán, agus dúirt sí liom go raibh 28 leanaí sa rang agus ní raibh Gaeilge ón gcliabhán ach ag ceathrar acu agus bheadh deacrachtaí aici an teanga a chur ar aghaidh.  Is é an rud is tábhachtaí atá ráite ag mo chara an Seanadóir Lee anocht ná go bhfuil ganntanas tacaíochta ann do mhúinteoirí Gaeilge i ngach cearn den tír.  Tá a lán acu i mbunscoileanna ar fud na tíre, caithfear cúrsaí inseirbhíse a chur ar fáil dóibh, caithfear cúrsaí nua foghlamtha a <Col N="1400" /> chur ar fáil, agus an pointe deireanach, tuismitheoirí agus leanaí a bhfuil claonadh i bhfabhar na Gaeilge acu, ba mhaith liomsa go mbeadh siadsan measctha le gnáthdhaoine na háite sa dóigh is go mbeadh an dea-thionchar ann.  Pé rud a dhéanann tú, a Aire, ba chóir go mbeadh critéir agus rialacha náisiúnta ann maidir le coibhneas idir leanaí agus múinteoirí, go mbeadh critéir náisiúnta ann a chuirfí i bhfeidhm go háitiúil.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte mhór a chur roimh an Aire.  Tar éis bheith ag éisteacht leis an Seanadóir Lee, tá orm a rá nach bhfuil mórán Gaeilge agam. Dá bhrí sin, leanfaidh mé ar aghaidh i mBéarla.</P>
      <P>I do not believe I can match the speed or eloquence of Senator O'Toole in speaking Irish, therefore I will revert to using English for the moment.</P>
      <P>I have a slight difficulty with the motion tabled by Senator Lee.  When Senator Ormonde expressed support for the motion, I perceived a completely different picture from the one described by Senator Lee.  Perhaps my confusion in this regard might be clarified later.  As I understand it, the regional boards oversee the daily operation of all schools in their region, from the colour of the paint on the front door to the management of relations with parents and problems experienced in relation to staffing. However, I would be in favour of Senator Ormonde's suggestion that a special unit be established in the Department of Education which would focus on Irish.  The main responsibilities of such a committee would be to promote the in-service training of teachers, deal with linguistic policy in relation to the Irish language, encourage those responsible for teaching it and offer guidance to all-Irish schools.  The latter could take the form of a support group and not interfere with the daily operation of the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mo bhaile féin tá Gaelscoil agus Gaelcholáiste, dhá choláiste agus trí bhunscoil eile sa pharóiste, agus dá bhrí sin bheadh dhá bhord ann, bord do na Gaelscoileanna agus bord do na scoileanna <Col N="1401" /> eile.  Bheadh difríochtaí ann, taisteal chun na scoile ar bhusanna, srl.  I foresee major problems arising between the two boards in relation to the daily organisation of school life.</P>
    <P>Ceapaim freisin go bhfuil an-difríocht idir scoil bheag i nDaingean Uí Chúise agus Gaelscoil láidir i mBaile Átha Cliath, mar scoil tuaithe atá sa scoil i nDaingean Uí Chúise agus scoil chathrach atá sa cheann eile.  Bhí mé ag caint le daoine in Uibh Rathach i gCiarraí an bhliain seo caite agus bhí an-eagla orthu go mbeadh an-chumhacht ar fad ag na Gaelscoileanna, mar gur mhó an bhéim ar Ghaeilge na cathrach ná an teanga dhúchasach sna scoileanna Ghaeltachta. Tá an Gaelcholáiste faoi stiúradh an vocational education committee freisin agus tugann a lán daoine an-chabhair ansin.  Bíonn múinteoir speisialta ann idir an vocational education committee agus an Gaelcholáiste, idir mhúinteoirí Francíse agus adhmaid, agus go leor múinteoirí eile agus iad ag freastal ar na scoileanna éagsúla.</P>
    <P>Senator Ormonde argued earlier that the vocational education committees have a great role to play and can help enormously and take a great pride and interest in the Gaelscoil.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I tabled a Motion chun campus amháin idir an Ghaelscoil agus an Gaelcholáiste a bhunú agus tá súil agam go gcuirfear sin i gcrích.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that too much is being left to the Ghaelscoileanna and that all hope for the Irish language will be left in their care.  If they are separated from the other schools in an area, the Irish language becomes their responsibility and the primary schools can take a more relaxed approach in this regard.</P>
    <P>Under the chapter entitled &ldquo;The Irish Language&rdquo; the White Paper states:</P>
    <P>It is the function of the education system to provide the means for students to learn the Irish language and to make them aware of its inherent value.  Students' proficiency in a language is crucially related to their motivation and the opportunities for them to use the language outside the <Col N="1402" /> classroom.  These in turn depend on the attitudes of parents in the community, the extent to which the home encourages the learning and use of Irish and how far Irish is used, encouraged and appreciated in a community. Without significant support from both home and community, even the best language programmes and pedagogical methods will have limited success.</P>
    <P>While people are dedicated to maintaining an interest in the Irish language through the medium of Gaelscoileanna &mdash; the Minister stated that there are only four counties in Ireland which do not have a Gaelscoil &mdash; and promoting it within the greater regional board, other Irish teachers in ordinary primary schools will be encouraged to take a greater interest.</P>
    <P>It could be counter-productive, in the long-term interests of the Irish language, to have a board which deals specifically with Gaelscoileanna and scoileanna sa Ghaeltacht.  I agree with Senator Ormonde's suggestion that a special unit be established in the Department of Education to consider the area of policy and encourage teachers to improve their methods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>I dtosach báire, caithfidh mé a rá go bhfuil deacrachtaí agam leis an rún agus leis an leasú atá os ár gcomhair um thráthnóna.  Is é mo thuairim nár cheart smaoineamh ar bhord oideachais nua ar bith a bhunú go dtí go réiteofar an t-aighneas atá ar siúl maidir leis na boird réigiúnacha atá molta sa Pháipéar Bán Oideachais.</P>
      <P>I have some difficulties with both the motion and the amendment to it.  The motion is somewhat premature.  That does not mean I do not welcome the opportunity which the motion provides to discuss the issues involved, which are important and complex.  They are also extremely relevant to both the development of the education service generally and the promotion and wellbeing of the Irish language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1403" /> The motion is premature because it was only today, this afternoon in fact, that the gaelscoileanna, Eagraíocht Scoileanna Gaeltachta and Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge launched their policy document for the establishment of an education board for the Gaeltacht and all-Irish schools.  It would be better if we had some time to study and reflect on the arguments and case put forward in that document before the proposals contained therein came before the House in the form of a motion.</P>
    <P>My second reservation is that this proposal is being put forward in the context of the proposal in the White Paper on Education to establish regional education boards.  It is important to bear in mind at this stage that the White Paper proposals in this regard have been rejected by practically all local authorities and vocational education committees in the country as well as by the General Council of County Councils and the IVEA.  My personal view is it would be premature to give consideration to the establishment of any new education board until there is some general consensus and agreement on the format of the intermediate education structure.</P>
    <P>The second big question mark I have in my mind concerns the advisability of establishing a board which would, in effect, be a sectoral one.  There are many sectoral interests which combine to make up the educational landscape. There are many schools throughout the country which have been designated as disadvantaged.  There are many multi-denominational schools and schools which cater for children with special needs also.  A case could be made in the same way for the establishment of an education board to look after the special needs of any of these categories of schools. The question we must ask is whether or not that is the road along which we should go.  I would need a lot of convincing at this stage that this is the best way forward.  That is not to say that the schools to which are the motion refers <Col N="1404" /> do not have special and particular needs.  Of course, they do.</P>
    <P>The policy document which we received today deals in great detail with the specific linguistic and educational requirements which need to be addressed as far as these schools are concerned. They have needs in relation to a long list of areas, such as the provision of Irish medium teaching resources and textbooks, linguistic and educational research, language planning, the development of Irish medium remedial teaching services, career guidance services, the establishment of a computer network for the Gaeltacht and for other Irish-medium schools, the provision of a suitable assessment system and syllabi, the provision of language support teachers for pupils in Gaeltacht schools who do not have access to Irish at home and, indeed, for parents residing in the Gaeltacht who do not speak Irish, and the provision of services from agencies such as the health boards, which, of course, should be provided through the medium of Irish.  These are just some of the specific needs of these schools.  All these needs should be provided for, and I must say I was surprised to learn the Department of Education has been so remiss in this regard to date.  However, I must ask whether it is necessary to establish a new bureaucratic structure for the purpose of addressing these matters and if that is the only or best way to ensure they are addressed.  Senator Ormonde suggested they might be addressed through the provision of a special unit within the Department of Education and I feel that suggestion has considerable merit and should be examined closely.</P>
    <P>My view is that before any decision is made on this issue, a wide-ranging and considered debate should be undertaken. There should be the greatest possible degree of consultation with all the interests involved in education as well as with the Irish language organisations. The views of the teacher unions should be ascertained, as should those of the teachers in the schools in question.  I would be concerned about the risk of <Col N="1405" /> sectoral friction if we were to go down this particular road.  I would be concerned at any development which might give rise to a perception that there is not a level playing pitch for schools in different parts of the country and between primary schools in particular.  I would be concerned about the implications this perception might have for attitudes towards the Irish language and the teaching and learning of Irish in schools which would be outside the remit of the proposed board.</P>
    <P>These are all factors which should be considered carefully before any decision is reached to establish the type of board called for in this motion.  In addition, the difficulties and differences of opinion which have arisen in relation to the format of the intermediate education structure would need to have been resolved.</P>
    <P>I reiterate that I agree that the specific linguistic and educational requirements of Gaeltacht schools and all-Irish schools need to be addressed, but I remain to be convinced of the desirability of rushing into the establishment of a body to be known as An Bord Oideachais do Scoileanna Gaeltachta agus lánGhaeilge in order to achieve this aim.</P>

Is é an aidhm atá ag na páirtithe go léir agus, ar ndóigh, ag na Ríaltais go léir, ná Stát dátheangach a fhorbairt.  Nuair a bunaíodh an Páirtí Daonlathach, d'fhógraíomar go poiblí ár lántacaíocht don pholasaí dátheangach, agus b'shinne an chéad Pháirtí a d'fhoilsigh cáipéis chuimsitheach i leith ár bpolasaí maidir le forbairt na Gaeilge, a réitigh Comhdháil Náisiúnta dár bPáirtí.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá sé curtha in iúl cheana féin ag urlabhraí ár bPáirtí ar an nGaeilge agus an Ghaeltacht, go dtugann an Páirtí Daonlathach <Col N="1406" /> lántacaíocht don mholadh atá os ár gcomhair anocht ó na Seanadóirí Neamhspléacha.  Tá siad tar éis an cheist a ardú leis an Aire Oideachais agus leis an Aire Ealaíon, Cultúir agus Gaeltachta trí ceisteanna Dála a chur síos agus labhair sé i bhfabhar an mholta ag an gcruinniú stairiúil sa Cheathrú Rua, 18 Samhain 1995.</P>
    <P>Aithníonn an Páirtí Daonlathach an cuspóir tábhachtach atá ag scoileanna Gaeltachta agus scoileanna lánGaeilge an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn agus an chabhair a thugann siad don Stát a pholasaí a bhaint amach i leith an teanga a fhorbairt, agus aithnímid go bhfuil an tacaíocht speisialta do na scoileanna seo cóir toisc na dualgaisí breise atá glactha orthu féin agus na deacrachtaí speisialta atá rompu.</P>
    <P>Tá eolas maith ag pobal na Gaeltachta agus daoine atá ag tógáil a leanaí trí mhéan na Gaeilge ar na fadhbanna atá sa bhealach rompu nuair a bhíonn siad ag lorg a gcearta laistigh de na húdaráis áitiúla &mdash; agus tá roinnt mhaith díobh siúd ann &mdash; boird sláinte agus boird turasóireachta, mar shampla. Toisc an chiall ceannaithe atá acu ó bheith ag plé leis na boird éagsúla seo, tá fhios ag na scoileanna Gaeltachta agus na scoileanna lánGhaeilge go bhfuil sé riachtanach go mbunófar bord neamhspléach lena mbeadh siad in ann comhcheangal a dhéanamh.</P>

      <P>It is essential that a separate board is set up to which they could affiliate if their special needs and difficulties are to be adequately provided for under the Government's proposals to establish the regional education boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1407" /> The difficulties faced by parents and students in Irish schools have been catalogued here.  Among them is the increasing difficulty of filling vacancies with teachers of adequate fluency, knowledge and skills to teach through Irish, the lack of textbooks in the Irish language, the special need to keep small Gaeltacht schools in existence even when the numbers of pupils have fallen below the Department of Education's requirements and the special transport needs of pupils who wish to attend all-Irish schools.  These are only some of the special needs which in themselves highlight the need for a special board, especially as direct access to the Department will be removed by the Minister's proposals.</P>
    <P>My party was most disappointed with the responses given to Deputy Molloy who asked parliamentary questions to the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, and the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins, who has Cabinet responsibility to promote the use of the Irish language in our society.  This can never be achieved if side by side with that objective, we allow the Gaeltacht and all Irish speaking schools to languish in a regional board system where their special needs will not be entitled to any special considerations.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht had a Labour Party representative present at the Carraroe meeting expressing his full support for the proposals in this motion.  It strikes me as being disingenuous that the Minister would state on the one hand that he supports the proposal while on the other as a Cabinet Minister, support the Minister for Education who published a Government White Paper on education refusing the proposal put forward by the Independent Senators.  For all those reasons, the Progressive Democrats will be supporting the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom tagairt go tapa do na pointí a tháinig amach sa díospóireacht a bhí againn.  I am in two <Col N="1408" /> minds on the Minister's contribution.  It comes down to how much credibility one attaches to her declaration of governmental high principles to which she referred.  Hitherto, in all my attitudes towards Government proposals, I have tried to avoid reflecting on motives.  It seems we are coming close to a situation where the gap between the declaration of principle and the actual details which subsequently follow is becoming almost unendurable.</P>
      <P>On page 4 I notice the following: &ldquo;Creidimid gur gá do phobail áitiúla agus réigiúnacha feabhas a chur ar fhiúntas na seirbhísí oideachais, etc.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Áitiúla&rdquo; suddenly surges in; this is different from &ldquo;reigiúnach&rdquo; in the context. If a regional board, which will be reputedly closer to the Gaeltacht and many Gaelscoileanna, is located, for example, in the Cork-Kerry area, the gap between that and Dunquin is, for practical purposes, nearly as wide as a gap between that and Dublin and Dunquin. This proximity to which the Minister refers does not seem to make much sense in the context of her proposed regional boards.  It would be a different matter if there were some devolution of these boards to local level, but that is one of the main issues between the various parties on this matter.</P>
      <P>The Minister claims the proposal of a board of this type would damage education in the Gaeltacht and the Gaelscoileanna. I cannot see how she has demonstrated that.  She also argues that to get support, &ldquo;go gcaithfid na boird feidhmiú i gcónaí de réir critéir áirithe, go gcaithfidh an méid a dhéanann siad tacú le forbairt an pholasaí náisiúnta agus cur chun cinn na Gaeilge.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>They are under the injunction to operate in support of the national policy, including the promotion of Irish. National policy in promoting Irish has failed up to now.  If there is no policy in place other than the one which has failed, to impose that injunction on regional boards is simply a recipe for further failure.  The injunction is meaningless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1409" /> I do not accept the argument advanced by the Minister and by some of my colleagues that if one makes provision for Gaelscoileanna or Irish language teaching, this will open the door to a whole range of other special interests.  It seems that in terms of national policy, the constitutional situation and of the pedagogy of teaching through a second or minority language, it is a case <i>en fait.</i> It does not involve principles of the same type applied to other categories from a purely pedagogic point of view. However, I will not argue that point at length because we could spend a great deal of time on it.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that each board will be empowered to establish committees and/or specialist groups to advise and assist it in the implementation of policy.  What the White Paper said was that such specialist committees will not normally be permanent but will have a specific remit for a particular issue.  I can imagine nothing less likely to be transitory or ephemeral than the support required by the Gaelscoileanna and Irish language education in general for and far beyond the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>While I am encouraged by the Minister's reference to this as a possible way forward in encouraging regional education committees, it would be necessary to stiffen it up as far as potential legislation is concerned before one could regard it as an adequate substitute.  The board only might see fit to establish such a committee.  The Minister talks about a location for a headquarters of a board which will co-ordinate all these schools. However, it would be as remote from most of them as the Department of Education is now.</P>
    <P>There is a difference between the geographic and intellectual, ideological, conceptual and pedagogical principle remoteness about which the proposal for a board was concerned.  There should be a wavelength which would relate to the Gaelscoileanna in a way which, as far as the White Paper is concerned, seems unlikely at present.  I will not linger on the arguments about lack <Col N="1410" /> of diversity because time is short but they no make no sense to me.</P>
    <P>Having said that, the Minister did make some encouraging comments such as:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Bheadh sé mar chúram ag gach bord oideachais féachaint chuige go mbeadh rogha ag daltaí bunscoileanna lánGhaeilge dul ar aghaidh go sruthanna lánGhaeilge chun meánoideachas trí Ghaeilge a fháil.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If that could be fleshed out in legislation, it would be a potentially important advance on the current tone of the White Paper.  The question of textbooks is left in a permissive rather than a compulsory way but at least this is some recognition.</P>
    <P>The Minister concludes by saying &ldquo;beidh mé ag caint leo ar mhaithe le cabhair ó scoileanna Gaeltachta agus scoileanna lánGhaeilge a fhorbairt,&rdquo; I emphasise the word &ldquo;forbairt&rdquo;, i ngach réigiún de gach bord oideachais ar fud na tíre.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am in a dilemma.  I am not pressing a vote on the basis of the credibility I attach to the Minister's integrity on that statement.  I am prepared, to the great relief of everybody, to accept that statement at face value, maybe even at more than that, on this occasion, not because of anything the Minister has said in this document but because of observations made by you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, by Senator Ormonde, Senator Kelly and others that the implications of the proposal require further fleshing out, and a number of valid points were made which would require detailed exploration there.</P>
    <P>However, I remain committed to the principle that the Gaelscoileanna, and education in Irish and through Irish &mdash; the education of Irish in a way &mdash; now requires a programme that I cannot see the Government, whatever its rhetorical commitment to the promotion of Irish, has any ideas how to promote beyond the current stage.  If it were not for the Gaelscoileanna, for that private initiative, <Col N="1411" /> one of the most enterprising taken, we would have already fallen far behind where we are even now.</P>
    <P>I make very few party political observations in the House, but I was pleasantly surprised by the commitment of Senator Dardis in addition to the quality of his Irish which he grossly under-estimated in his self-deprecatory comments.  I was not aware that his views were an expression of the policy of the Progressive Democrats.  I rather assumed their policy was the opposite.  If any hope has emerged this evening it is that at least the Progressive Democrats have committed themselves &mdash; perhaps they were already committed without my being aware of it &mdash; to a policy which appears to offer some hope.</P>
    <P>When legislation following the White Paper emerges, the extent to which the indications of possible developments beyond the White Paper, as outlined in the Minister's speech, and the degree to which they are incorporated in legislation will be, for me, a fundamental criterion in terms of evaluating the totality of that legislation.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for attending the House.  Last week the Minister for Health delivered the Doolin lecture to the Irish Medical Organisation in which he stressed the need for the medical profession to learn to communicate better.  I made this point myself when speaking at the inaugural meeting of the Trinity Biological Association <Col N="1412" /> last month.  The Minister is correct when he says that most complaints about doctors to his Department, to hospitals and to the Medical Council are about lack of communication.  Indeed, the medical insurance companies say that this is also the initiating problem with patients in many of these cases.</P>
      <P>While this lack of communication is regrettable, even if it arises in a small number of cases only and given that a huge volume of work goes through the hospitals, through general practices and so on, it is much more serious if any obstacles are put in the way of doctors expressing concerns on behalf of their patients, which is one of our primary ethical duties.  Recent directives by some health boards, if taken at face value, will mean that doctors, especially those who work for health boards, will not be able to speak out on behalf of their patients.  For example, page seven of the handbook from the Southern Health Board handbook entitled &ldquo;Caring for People&rdquo;, in many ways a laudable document, states:</P>
      <P>Publications &mdash; Publication of any matter relating to the affairs of the Health Board, or use of information drawn from official sources in publications by staff members or for publication by others, should have the prior approval of the Chief Executive Officer.</P>
      <P>Media &mdash; The giving of interviews, statements or any other information connected with the services provided by the Health Board should not be undertaken without the prior approval of the Chief Executive Officer or the delegated official spokesperson for the Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Information &mdash; Public statements by Board staff may be taken as reflecting Board policy or illustrative of Board attitudes.  Therefore information should be issued only through authorised spokespersons (leaking of such information to any source, including making it available to colleagues in professional/staff associations <Col N="1413" /> in this or other Boards, is not permitted).</P>
    <P>These are extraordinarily serious matters, and these directives are in direct conflict with the consultant's common contract and associated legislation on clinical independence of the consultant which, under paragraph 6.4.6, states:</P>
    <P>...the employing authority will provide a forum, in the first instance, for the consultant's advocacy role. Neither does it preclude the profession as a body advocating more or better services for patients.</P>
    <P>Even worse, these directives are in direct conflict with our obligations to our patients.  It is our patients and not health boards, or even the Minister, to whom we owe our first loyalty.  Article 25 of the principles of medical ethics in Europe, which is supported by the Medical Council states:</P>
    <P>It is the duty of a doctor, whether acting alone or in conjunction with professional organisations, to draw the attention of society to any deficiencies in the quality of health care or in the professional independence of doctors.</P>
    <P>Similar directives to those issued by the Southern Health Board were issued some time ago by the Western Health Board, but according to a report in the <i>Irish Medical Times</i> of 10 November, these have been modified, because the chief executive officer of this health board said of his board: &ldquo;...[it] was an open shop and [he] was not in the business of stifling comment&rdquo;.  He was responding in this instance to complaints by County Mayo GP, Dr. Noel Rice, a member of the board, who urged that employees should be allowed to speak without fear of reprisals by the board or its agents.</P>
    <P>A complaint about doctors could be made that we do not speak out enough on behalf of our patients regarding the inadequacies we see.  Lack of medical facilities are among the criticisms made in the report by the European Committee <Col N="1414" /> for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment published today.  I know that complaints by doctors working within the prisons have been made privately and publicly, but how much notice does the Department of Justice take of them?  Who is responsible for the fact that so many prisoners have been treated, or inadequately treated, for psychiatric diseases within the prisons? It is important to mention that, in the early 1970s, if it were not for the complaints in Northern Ireland, we do not know how many of the inadequacies regarding the treatment of those in holding centres may not have been brought forward.</P>
    <P>This is an extraordinarily serious issue for doctors.  I was at a meeting of the International Medical Parliamentarians Organisation in London last week and we talked about these kinds of problems, and that our ethical obligations are to our patients and not to Governments. I hope the Minister will explain to health board why instructions, such as those set out by the Southern Health Board, are in conflict with doctors' ethical obligations.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, who is unavoidably absent from the Seanad tonight &mdash; I apologise for his absence &mdash; I thank the Senator for raising this important matter on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>The primary obligation to fulfil their ethical obligations to patients falls on doctors themselves.  This is one of the distinguishing marks of a profession. The development of ethical guidelines is a matter for the profession itself, and I would refer the Senator to the <i>Guide to Ethical Conduct and Behaviour and to Fitness to Practise</i> published by the Medical Council for the guidance of medical practitioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The responsibility of the Minister for Health is to provide facilities for the diagnosis and treatment of those who need to avail of properly funded health <Col N="1415" /> services.  Doctors who are employed by health boards, voluntary hospitals and other agencies funded by his Department are obviously required, as members of the medical profession, to behave in an ethical manner towards their patients.</P>
    <P>It would not be considered best practice for a doctor to undertake a procedure or a course of treatment for which he or she had not been trained. Equally it would not be prudent for a doctor to undertake procedures where he or she did not have the necessary staff, equipment or other facilities. However, it is for the individual doctor to decide in each and every case whether it is prudent for him or her to proceed.  In coming to that decision the doctor has to carefully balance the possible risk to the patient's health in undertaking a course of treatment in less than optimal conditions with the risk of allowing the patient's condition to deteriorate if left untreated.  Only a doctor can make that decision.  In fact, the long period of training required to become a fully qualified medical practitioner is required to equip doctors to make these difficult decisions.  Ultimately, it is a matter for the individual doctor to decide.</P>
    <P>In coming to a decision in such cases doctors have access to a range of guidelines and advice.  In the first instance they can take the advice of their colleagues. The Medical Council publishes a set of comprehensive guidelines on ethical matters for doctors.  All doctors have access to the expert ethical and medico-legal advice of their medical defence organisations.  The Minister would therefore find it difficult to accept that doctors in general should have any difficulty in fulfilling their ethical obligations to their patients. However, the Minister is grateful to the Senator for allowing him the opportunity to address these issues.  If she has any more specific concerns the Minister would be glad to have them looked into.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister.  I should start with the last sentence: &ldquo;If she has any more specific concerns the <Col N="1416" /> Minister would be glad to have them looked into&rdquo;.  I obviously did not make clear enough the matter I put down for discussion on the Adjournment.  I am seriously worried, as are all members of the medical profession, about the guidelines which are being issued by health boards which effectively mean that we will be muzzled.  This is not right.  If we feel there are facilities or situations which must be brought to the attention of the Minister, we are not in a position to do so if we abide by the guidelines being laid down by the health boards.  I would be most grateful if the Minister would bring this to the attention of the Minister for Health.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>The most perfect science is probably the science of hindsight. That was brought home to me after attending a recent meeting in Fir Grove Hotel in Mitchelstown where up to 600 farmers, mainly pig farmers, met to voice concern and fear that their livelihoods could be put in jeopardy by the importation of wild boar.  That in itself is a serious issue, but we must look at the broader perspective.  I understand that we had to change the quarantine rules to comply with EU regulations. However, having spoken to many farmers and others involved in our livestock and livestock processing industry and having spoken to people who are trying to market our produce abroad, it is clear that the present situation is not good enough to protect this country's disease free status.  That applies to all areas of livestock production, be it pig production, poultry, cattle, beef and so forth.  Something must be done to ensure that we can guarantee to our markets that we have disease free status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1417" /> Last week the importation of the wild boar took place and they were brought to Mitchelstown.  They complied with the criteria laid down in the voluntary code of practice of the pig producers council.  However, it still jeopardises a huge industry in the Mitchelstown area. At the meeting I was informed by both trade union officials and those involved in pig production that up to 1,500 jobs in the immediate Mitchelstown area could be put in jeopardy if by any chance the importation of the wild boar resulted in exotic diseases also being brought to Ireland.  That in itself is serious and suggests that a change in the current regulations should be made immediately.</P>
    <P>In the cattle sector, since quarantine regulations were removed we have seen two new diseases appear in our national herd, mycoplasma bovis and Johnes disease. These diseases are alien to this country and some veterinary practitioners suggest that mycoplasma bovis could have disastrous effects on our national herd.  Our one advantage in this regard is the fact that we are an island nation and have natural barriers to the spread of disease.  We are in the EU and we would like to adhere to the regulations, but surely one of the objectives of the EU is the advancement of peripheral areas.  Why must we sacrifice one of the few advantages we have as a result of being an island, which is our disease free status, to comply with EU regulations? It is not good enough that Ireland must jeopardise this status in order to receive funding or to have access to markets in the EU.  This issue deserves more than a motion on the Adjournment.  It has major implications for our food processing industry.</P>
    <P>Some farmers would argue that it is difficult to import animals into this country, but those farmers are few in number.  The majority of livestock leaves this country; it is our largest single industry, larger than tourism or all our pharmaceutical industries.  That shows the importance of this issue.  I ask the Minister to consult with his officials and see if it is possible to seek a derogation through which our disease free status could be protected.  The only way <Col N="1418" /> it can be protected is by full quarantine, which means that animals are quarantined not only in the country of origin but also when they arrive in this country. They should be quarantined off the mainland in appropriate quarantine centres.</P>
    <P>The code of practice that has been adopted by the pig industry should also be brought into legislative effect immediately.  We still would have to go to the EU to try to change the present regulations pertaining to quarantine. Every person in the veterinary and animal health profession would say that quarantining an animal in the country of origin and transporting it through many countries and ports before bringing it to Ireland is not quarantine in itself.  It is like wearing a condom on one's head to prevent sexually transmitted diseases. That point was forcefully made in the Fir Grove Hotel in Mitchelstown.  The meeting was attended by 600 people who are directly affected and who thought the issue important enough to attend a meeting and seek that this situation is changed immediately.</P>
    <P>We have seen the development of many new agricultural enterprises, such as ostrich rearing, deer farming and other diverse activities.  Our main agricultural products are cattle, milk, beef, sheep, poultry and pigs.  All this is being put in jeopardy.  We should enact legislation, similar to the voluntary code of practice the pig industry has adopted, to ensure it is not put in jeopardy.  We should immediately broaden this to ensure all animals adhere to the regulations. In the meantime the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, the Minister of State and the Government should ask the EU to change the regulations to which we must at present adhere.</P>
    <P>We are at a distinct disadvantage in transporting our products to Britain and Europe.  We should take steps to guarantee consumers of our livestock products that we are a disease free country.  The Americans and Japanese are large consumers of pigmeat produced in Ireland.  If the pig herd were to contract any of the diseases which would result in Japan and America banning <Col N="1419" /> imports of pigmeat, this would have catastrophic effects on our pigmeat industry.  Some 12,000 people are directly associated with this industry through producing, processing, exporting or marketing this meat.  We must also consider the sheep and dairy sectors.</P>
    <P>None of us would like to play politics with an issue as serious as this.  Two years ago we discussed this matter. Hindsight is the perfect science and we are now in a position to point out examples.  It is up to the Minister and the Government to ask the EU to allow us protect our disease free status to ensure that our agriculture is not jeopardised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Kelleher for raising this matter, which has aroused considerable interest in the media in recent weeks.  All countries maintain measures to ensure food is safe for consumers and to prevent the spread of pests or diseases among animals and plants.  These measures by their very nature may result in restrictions on trade.  All Governments accept that some trade restrictions are necessary and appropriate in order to ensure food safety and animal and plant health protection.</P>
      <P>The EU has dealt with this problem in a very definitive way, with the creation of an internal market.  The objective of the Treaty of Rome is to create a single market with no frontiers across the entire EU, with free movement of goods, persons, services and capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to veterinary issues, one of the justifications for obstacles to trade has been the need for protection against diseases carried by animals and their products.  These obstacles usually took the form of an obligation for animals and products to be accompanied by certificates to prove conformity with the rules of the country of destination. In addition systematic border checks were frequently imposed.  One of the <Col N="1420" /> objectives of the internal market is to abolish such obstacles.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the internal market had two effects of note in the animal health area: the suppression of frontier checks on 1 January, 1993 and the acceleration of the process of harmonisation, a process which in the cattle and pig sector had been largely completed some years previously.</P>
    <P>There are two significant dates relating to changes in animal importation requirements &mdash; 6 August 1992 and 1 January 1993.  The first is important because on that date Ireland's foot and mouth disease quarantine requirements for animals being imported from certain other member states came to an end. Or, to put it more positively, Ireland was obliged to end quarantine on that date as all EU member states had achieved foot and mouth disease free status, that is, two years freedom from the disease and a prohibition on the use of vaccine of at least on year's duration. For this reason cattle, pigs and sheep being imported into Ireland from EU countries need no longer be placed in the official quarantine on Spike Island.</P>
    <P>Of course there had been no quarantine for such animals coming from the UK and Denmark for some time past.  It goes without saying that once quarantine, an expensive and time consuming task, was ended, imports were bound to increase, which they did quite dramatically, rising from 260 cattle imported in the two years prior to the cessation of the quarantine requirements to 35,000 cattle in the three years since.  I reassure the House and Senator Kelleher that in spite of the concerns that have been expressed, such imports have not been accompanied by any serious disease problems.</P>
    <P>On 1 January 1993 the internal market was completed and frontier controls were abolished between member states. Such controls were replaced by a system of checks at origin and destination.  Animals could move freely provided they were accompanied by an official EU health certificate issued by the competent authority of the member state of origin.  In addition, there was provision for advance notification to the country <Col N="1421" /> of destination of such movements via the Animo system, which is a computerised system whereby the member state of origin notifies the member state of destination of movements of animals and animal products.  This Animo system is now operating in each of the member states and the district veterinary offices of my Department receive and send daily details of impending imports and exports of live animals to their counterparts in other member states.</P>
    <P>Under the trading directives 64/432/ EEC, which deals with cattle and pigs, and 91/68/EEC, which deals with sheep and goats, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry as the competent authority must accept animals from other member states if they are accompanied by an official EU health certificate issued by the member state of origin.  Trade takes place exclusively by reference to the various rules about the different diseases covered in those directives.</P>
    <P>Under these directives the State veterinary services cannot require additional official guarantees.  However, the individual importer is free to and can insist on additional conditions.  This is the basis for the industry codes of practice.  These codes amount to advice from knowledgeable sources about the type of diseases importers should be concerned about and what they can do to protect their herds.  Diseases, once imported, are immensely expensive to eradicate or control.  In the changed international trading situation that now exists, the onus for protecting the disease free status of our individual and national herds is spread between the farmer, the veterinary practitioner, the various industry representative bodies and the Department.</P>
    <P>At official level we are, of course, limited by the terms of EU legislation as regards the level of checking which we can carry out on imported animals and the extent to which additional guarantees can be required over and above those laid down in EU trading directives. However, within those limits the Department is committed to ensuring that imported animals do not represent <Col N="1422" /> any risk to our existing health status. We have also sought Commission approval for the application of additional safeguards in relation to a number of diseases which are at present under consideration.</P>
    <P>Given the foregoing, it is extremely important that all those involved in importing livestock continue to be extremely vigilant so as to ensure that we do not unwittingly introduce diseases into the country through imported animals. If imports are regarded as being essential, there is an onus on those importing to seek the additional guarantees over and above the mandatory community measures.</P>
    <P>My Department has recommended from the outset of the liberalisation of trade that individuals importing animals should consider seeking additional guarantees relating to a variety of diseases and that the imported animals be isolated for 30 days prior to entering the herd of destination.  These additional guarantees take the form of private veterinary certification relating to the status of the herd of origin in respect of certain diseases together with tests for these diseases on the individual animals being imported.  I encourage the adoption of such codes in relation to all livestock imports and encourage all importers to abide by them.</P>
    <P>The Single Market provides both opportunities and potential risks to Irish farmers.  The opportunities involve unhindered access to EU markets and the potential risks include the possibility of introducing other diseases into Ireland following relaxation of our import controls.  It is obvious that the trading scene has changed enormously. As regards trade with the Union, we can no longer return to our former system of quarantine and we cannot ban imports.  My Department will work through the European Union's institutions to ensure reasonable conditions for imports and exports of animals in relation to those diseases which are properly dealt with in the public domain.</P>
    <P>The various industry sectors can help in other areas, particularly through the <Col N="1423" /> promotion of the concept of advice in the form of a code of practice which, if all or a substantial majority choose to observe it, would significantly reduce the risks of importing disease.</P>

      <P>The most important statement tonight was that &ldquo;diseases, once imported, are immensely expensive to eradicate or control&rdquo;.  We can guarantee whatever we like, but allowing animals to be imported into the country prior to inspection could jeopardise the national livestock industry. Voluntary codes of practice are not enough to protect the largest industry in the country.  As an island nation, we must argue our case with the European Union.</P>

      <P>This régime was put in place before I came to office.  However, like any Minister with responsibility for <Col N="1424" /> animal health, I am concerned that imported animals could be a risk to the health of the national herd.  We are continuously monitoring the occurrence of rare diseases in the national herd.  I agree with the Senator that because we no longer have quarantine we are more exposed.  I assure the Senator I will take his comments into consideration.  I hope we will prevent diseases from coming into the country.  It is important to remain vigilant and to consider further restrictions if required, although this could be difficult in the context of the EU.  The Senator repeated views I have heard from a number of people outside this House.  People are concerned about this issue, particularly when they consider the large number of cattle and other animals imported into the country on a regular basis.</P>
