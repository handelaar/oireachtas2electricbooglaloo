      <P>I have notice from Senator Henry that, on the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to set up a commission to regulate best practice in the field of medically assisted reproduction.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to appoint a remedial teacher to Ballingarry, Granagh, Kilmeedy and Banogue schools.  County Limerick.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Kelly of the following matter:</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take items 1 and 2 today.  Item 2 will be taken from 6 p.m. until 8 p.m. and item 1 will be taken from the end of the Order of Business until 6 p.m. and from 8 p.m. until 10 p.m.  The principle of this Bill has been fully debated, and I hope we can complete Second Stage today. However, there will be no guillotine; if it has not finished by 10 p.m. we will continue Second Stage tomorrow.  I thank the Leader of the Opposition for agreeing to sit late on this matter.

I have raised this matter on a number of occasions and I believe the Minister for Health should have such a paper published and this House should have the opportunity to debate it.  At present the psychiatric services are carrying out their functions under legislation enacted over 50 years ago.  When we take into consideration some recent developments and happenings, it is totally inappropriate that this should continue for much longer.</P>

      <P>When does the Leader envisage that the Minister for Enterprise and Employment will come to the House to discuss the cutbacks in the community employment schemes? This is giving rise to a great deal of fear in the community.  I raised this issue last week.  The Minister should make a statement in the House to clarify the matter.  At present, 7,000 people do not know where they stand.</P>
      <P>The control of farm pollution grants has been raised a few times.  The Government has announced that funding for these grants has been cut.  It would be greatly appreciated if the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry could come to the House to clarify the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Senator O'Kennedy said about the situation in Bosnia and the attacks by the Serb forces. There is a motion about Bosnia on the Order Paper &mdash; item 13, motion No. 1 &mdash; in the name of the Independents. which perhaps could be taken at some stage today.  It is of particular concern that the UN commander in the region stated that he was impotent to order air strikes because of the threat of Serb reprisals by rocket against the civilian population.  This is clearly a breach of the Geneva Convention.  I wonder if any action will ever be taken against these people who are publicly and flagrantly committing war crimes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support Senator Kelleher's call for a discussion on the community employment schemes.  I am involved in two of these schemes, both of which have been cut back.  One of them gave the prospect of employment to 15 young people.  It was initially abolished because of an overrun on the grant and was then restored but reduced to employing only three people.  This is very disillusioning for young people who were given the <Col N="657" /> impression they were getting employment under this scheme.  I would welcome a discussion on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make every effort to keep the House informed if there are any developments with regard to TEAM Aer Lingus, I do not yet have specific details on an education Bill but I will try to communicate with Senator O'Toole on the matter.</P>
      <P>In relation to Senator Dardis' point. it was intended that there would be a short series of statements on the Competition Authority's report on the newspaper industry.  Because a decision on this report will be taken shortly, it was intended that these statements would conclude today.  The amount of time for each speaker will be determined by the number of people offering; at present it is envisaged that there will be between ten and 15 minutes for each speaker.</P>
      <P>We all agree with Senator O'Kennedy's and others condemnation of the savage attacks by the Bosnian Serbs in Sarajevo.</P>
      <P>I have promised Senator McGowan a debate on the matter he raised and I hope to have definite information on the timing before the end of the week. This debate and a debate on Northern Ireland have been promised and will take place.</P>
      <P>Senator Finneran has on many occasions raised the question of a White Paper on mental health.  I thank him for his interest.  The paper is now in the final stages of completion and should be published in the relatively near future. Both the Minister and the Department are very anxious to have it published. and it will contain a number of legislative proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="658" /> I will convey Senator Kelleher's message to the Minister and I will seek to have a debate on the subject here.  As regards Senator Kelly's request, if she does not see the Minister first, I will ask him to come into the House to discuss the question of housing and urban renewal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. J. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am here today to honour a commitment given by me in the House during my first few weeks in office as Minister of State with responsibilities in the Office of Public Works.  That commitment was, of course, the introduction at an early stage of new legislation aimed at combating the flooding problems which have persisted throughout the country and which were the subject of many debates in both Houses of the Oireachtas earlier in the year.</P>
      <P>It gives me great pleasure, therefore. in the light of the various statements made and commitments given, to be in a position to give the necessary legislative backing to our proposals for the physical relief of the hardship caused by the very heavy rainfall in the past few years.</P>
      <P>It is comparatively rare for legislation to be initiated from the Office of Public Works which is essentially an agency for the delivery of Government policy. Senator Daly will recall that, in 1990 as Minister he introduced the Shannon Navigation Act which extended the scope and capacity of the Office of Public Works to include valuable and vital work in the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works I can say that this Bill is a <i>cause célebre.</i>  I am conscious that it did not prove possible to meet the undertaking which I <Col N="659" /> gave in good faith to Senator Quinn to publish the Bill before the end of April. I regret that and I assure the House that it did not happen through any lack of commitment on my part or that of any of the officials who have been involved in transforming the heads of the Bill that was approved by Government in March into the Parliamentary Bill which is now before the House.</P>
    <P>Although the Bill is relatively short and, I hope, uncontroversial, the House will appreciate on reading it that a considerable amount of administrative, legal and technical research had to be done in the course of drafting.  The speed with which such important and substantial legislation was drafted is remarkable and I express my appreciation to all concerned, in particular to the staff of the parliamentary draftsman's office, for their efforts.</P>
    <P>The commitment I made to Senator Quinn and to the House was to have the Bill through the House by the end of May.  I now ask for the co-operation of all sides of the House to ensure that that target is not just achieved but is surpassed.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us seeks to amend and extend the powers to execute works of drainage and flood relief conferred on the Commissioners of Public Works by the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  It is the second such Bill to be introduced this year, the first having been introduced by Senator Daly in February.  The House will recall that the Government's opposition to that Bill was based primarily on the fact that it did not entirely address the issues involved and that the Government intended to introduce its own Bill as soon as possible.  Nevertheless it would be less than prudent if I did not again acknowledge and express appreciation of Senator Daly's efforts and intent to expedite the introduction of the statutory measures necessary to widen the scope of the existing drainage legislation.  It is also only right to acknowledge that the heads of the Bill approved by the Government, which form the basis of the Bill before the <Col N="660" /> House, were substantially the same as those prepared by the former Minister of State, Deputy Dempsey.  That work was also of considerable benefit in expediting the introduction of this legislation.</P>
    <P>Before discussing the provisions of the new Bill in depth I will reflect briefly on the current legislative position and the circumstances which brought about the necessity for change. Although much has been said in our earlier debates on flooding problems throughout the country, a brief summation of the national drainage programme as it stands might be useful at this juncture.</P>
    <P>The main statutory provision for the execution of drainage in the State is the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  This Act provides that when the Commissioners of Public Works &ldquo;are of opinion that the execution of arterial drainage works is expedient in respect of any catchment area for the purpose of preventing or substantially reducing the periodic flooding of lands in that area or of improving by drainage lands in the said area, it shall be lawful for the Commissioners to prepare a scheme for the execution of such works.&rdquo;  This provision has always been interpreted as conferring power on the commissioners to prepare and undertake drainage schemes only in cases where a flooding problem encompasses the entire catchment area of a river, usually involving an area of several thousand hectares.</P>
    <P>The 1945 Act endeavoured to consolidate previous drainage legislation dating back for more than a century.  Under these various earlier enactments drainage works were carried out on a piecemeal basis often without regard to conditions elsewhere in river catchments or the effect of such works on conditions in other areas.  With its passing the Act gave effect to the recommendations of the Browne Commission of 1938 to 1940, among which was the establishment of a central drainage authority based in the Office of Public Works which would thenceforth be responsible <Col N="661" /> for the execution and maintenance of arterial drainage on a catchment basis.</P>
    <P>I have alluded on a number of occasions in the past to the extent of the progress made under the national drainage programme established following the passing of the 1945 Act.  More than 40 drainage and embankment schemes have been undertaken, involving works to some 7,300 miles of channels and embankments and conferring benefit on more than 650,000 acres of land previously damaged through flooding or waterlogging.</P>
    <P>Some will argue progress was not what it might have been or what was envisaged when the programme was set up.  I contend it demonstrates conclusively the commitment of successive Governments and the Commissioners of Public Works to the resolution of the problems which have persisted.  Arterial drainage requires a lengthy preparatory process involving the collection of hydrometric data over many years to establish the flow regimes of rivers.  It requires detailed engineering and valuation surveys of lands and watercourses &mdash; again over many years &mdash; and the design and formal exhibition of schemes so that those affected may comment on the proposals.</P>
    <P>In recent years we have become much more conscious of our environment so that many modifications to both design and work practices have evolved.  Care must be taken to minimise or avoid damage to wildlife, fisheries and landscapes, among other things.</P>
    <P>Not least it requires a huge investment and commitment of resources.  In the last 50 years a total of £640 million in current terms has been spent on the construction and maintenance of the works undertaken to date.  In the 1980s substantial EU grants were made available for the work.  It is essential, therefore. that drainage schemes satisfy accepted economic criteria as must all projects involving large scale public investment.</P>
    <P>The increased awareness of our environment in recent years as well as changing emphasis on land use, the diminishing <Col N="662" /> returns on the high capital investment required for arterial drainage and current EU policy, which is aimed at reducing production in many areas, has greatly reduced the prospect of formulating economically or environmentally acceptable catchment schemes. In the processing of future schemes regard must he had to all these factors. Various options for drainage or flood relief schemes will have to be considered and subjected to detailed analysis.</P>
    <P>The apparent restrictions inherent in existing drainage practice leads me to the provisions in this Bill which propose to amend the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, to provide the powers necessary to enable the Commissioners of Public Works to undertake drainage schemes for the relief of localised flooding from rivers and other watercourses in addition to their existing powers to undertake arterial drainage schemes in entire river catchments.</P>
    <P>It will, however, be a requirement that any scheme to relieve localised flooding must have regard to the possible effects of the proposed works throughout the entire river basin.  Thus such schemes will not be inconsistent with the strong recommendations in the report of the Browne Drainage Commission of 1938-1940 that &ldquo;all future arterial drainage operations should be conducted on the basis of comprehensive schemes embracing entire catchments and not otherwise&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Flooding in localised areas and particularly in urban centres has, of course, always been a problem.  Incidences of such flooding are widespread and not confined to any single area.  There are also many rural areas where flooding is known to be particularly acute.  The Commissioners of Public Works have been unable to undertake schemes to overcome the difficulties in these areas because existing legislation limits them to the catchment approach.</P>
    <P>Catchment drainage schemes, by their nature, involve doing work in large areas where, because of the present situation in agriculture, the benefit is often <Col N="663" /> marginal and is, therefore, outweighed by the costs.  To that extent, unfortunately, it is our experience that the overall scheme becomes uneconomic despite the fact that the benefits that would result from the scheme works in urban and other local problem areas may far exceed the cost of doing localised work. That catchment schemes typically cost tens of millions of pounds while a scheme targeted at a specific problem area could be done for a fraction of that cost and would be more effective in that specific area, is also relevant.</P>
    <P>Flooding, particularly when it affects residential areas, can cause severe hardship and disruption.  Residents in areas which are subject to regular flooding live in continual fear of damage to their property and, in extreme cases, being cut off from their neighbours, supplies and services at times of heavy rainfall. They live in fear of the threat to life and loss of business or livelihood.  Residents in such areas in some cases cannot even insure against the losses arising from flooding because of its frequency.  This flooding, however, is not a new phenomenon and the Office of Public Works has faced pressure for many years to undertake drainage schemes in river catchments to relieve flooding in urban areas.  The existence of a priority list of arterial drainage schemes, combined with the fact that works were in progress in higher priority schemes, served to offer hope to those lower down the list.  Because of the difficulty in designing economically viable catchment schemes due to the current EU policy of discouraging the production of some agricultural products many areas are now left without hope.</P>
    <P>While catchment schemes may become viable again in the future, the time has come to make the necessary changes to the legislative provisions to enable localised flood relief schemes to be undertaken.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, an existing supplementary legislative provision, the Local Authorities (Works) Act, 1949. which provides a basis for the execution <Col N="664" /> of localised works in certain circumstances. It does not, however, impose any requirements to have regard to the effect of works undertaken elsewhere in the catchment.  While it might have been satisfactory in 1949, it is not now considered to be a satisfactory legislative basis on which to undertake the type of flood relief schemes I consider will be required in the future.  In many cases river catchments cross administrative boundaries, a fact which lends weight to the argument for a central drainage authority as currently exists in the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>While I am aware there are many other matters which merit consideration &mdash; which I am sure will be brought to the fore during the course of the debate &mdash; I would like to deal in general terms with the provisions of the Bill whose primary purpose is to extend the powers of the Commissioners of Public Works to undertake drainage works as provided in the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the 1945 Act outlines the circumstances under which a scheme may be prepared in respect of a catchment area and details the matters to be included in the body of the scheme. Section 3 of this Bill proposes to amend this provision by extending it to include any watercourse or any part of a watercourse, thus permitting the preparation and execution of works in respect of more restricted areas, particularly urban and other areas where flooding causes considerable and significant hardship but where it is not possible to design economically viable catchment schemes.</P>
    <P>Under section 4 of the Bill it will also be incumbent on the commissioners, in deciding the nature and extent of the works to be done for the relief of localised flooding, to have regard to the effects of any such works on conditions elsewhere.  In this connection, it would be necessary to establish that the benefits accruing from the works undertaken in one area will not be greatly outweighed by the adverse effects they might have elsewhere.  It might not <Col N="665" /> always be possible to guarantee that changes in the flow characteristics of a river, arising from works, will not result in the worsening of conditions elsewhere along its course.  It is, however the intention to ensure that any unavoidable adverse impacts are taken into account before an order confirming a drainage scheme is made.  There is of course, provision in the 1945 Act for the payment of compensation for loss or damage suffered by reason of any interference during construction works.  It will, therefore, be possible to compensate anyone who suffers damage during works undertaken in pursuit of the wider public interest.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill deals with the publication and exhibition of localised drainage or flood relief schemes.  Under the provisions of the 1945 Act the commissioners are obliged to allow local authorities a period of three months within which to submit their observations to them in relation to catchment drainage schemes and for the commissioners to place such schemes on public exhibition for a period of one month.  In view of the urgent nature in many cases of schemes for localised relief, and their more local extent, it is considered that periods of one month and 14 days, respectively, should suffice.</P>
    <P>In the drafting of the Bill I have also endeavoured to avail of the opportunity to make a small number of largely technical amendments to deal with shortcomings which have been identified in the existing legislation over the years.</P>
    <P>I wish to provide a clear legal basis to enable the Commissioners of Public Works in certain circumstances to make agreements with third parties whereby such parties would bear all or part of the cost of executing or maintaining arterial drainage works.  This is done in section 6.  An example of the type of circumstances I have in mind would be a situation where a private individual, local authority or other body wished to have drainage work carried out by the commissioners and, while the commissioners might consider such works to be worthwhile, they would be unable to undertake <Col N="666" /> them due to lack of funds.  The works could nevertheless proceed if a third party was willing to meet the shortfall in the funding.  In this connection I am of the view that the cost of any drainage works undertaken and paid for out of public funds should be fully justified by the benefits, whether social or economic or a combination of the two. accruing from their execution.  A provision whereby funding could be provided from other sources should help dispel the fears of those who might otherwise be excluded or get a low priority rating.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 7 are necessary to limit the burden of maintenance work for which the commissioners will be responsible.  The cost of maintenance will be payable from Exchequer funds. The 1945 Act provides that where the commissioners do work in an existing drainage district as part of a catchment drainage scheme, the district ceases to exist and the commissioners become responsible for maintenance of the river and its tributaries.  While this is not unreasonable in the context of catchment drainage schemes, it would involve a substantial burden on the commissioners if it was allowed to apply to schemes for localised flooding.</P>
    <P>It is also necessary to cater for the situation which arises from time to time where, due to the development of land subsequent to the confirmation or completion of a drainage scheme, it is considered expedient to undertake drainage works even where such works may have been considered unjustifiable when the original drainage scheme was confirmed or executed.  There are many circumstances where works which were once regarded as unjustifiable might be considered necessary on later reappraisal of circumstances.  These would include situations where the development of roads, housing or industrial estates result in significant additional quantities of surface water being discharged into rivers and watercourses. This in turn results in flooding which needs to be prevented or alleviated by <Col N="667" /> further drainage works or increased flood protection.</P>
    <P>There are also examples of situations where drainage works to prevent or alleviate flooding of undeveloped lands which were considered unjustified in the course of a drainage scheme may become essential where the land has been subsequently developed for housing, industries and so forth.  These situations are provided for in section 8.</P>
    <P>Sections 9 and 10 are designed to deal with the situations which arise from time to time whereby modifications are made by landowners and others to channels and embankments which are maintainable by the commissioners.  Circumstances vary from place to place.  In some, the modifications may be allowed stand but there is doubt as to the commissioners' right to continued maintenance of the altered situation.  In others, restoration may be necessary and prompt action required to ensure the effective functioning of the particular drainage works, especially where there is a substantial risk of flooding.  These by implication involve costs and an adequate mechanism must be provided to enable such costs to be recovered. The existing provisions do not adequately cater for the differing situations which might arise.</P>
    <P>The 1945 Act empowers the commissioners to compulsorily acquire any land for the purposes of a drainage scheme.  However, it does not set out a detailed procedure to be followed by the commissioners in cases of compulsory acquisition, for example, for publication of acquisition notices and service of notices on affected owners.  It is intended to correct this defect by providing that the Land Clauses Consolidation Acts will apply to compulsory purchase under the 1945 Act and otherwise by setting out in detail the procedure to be followed.</P>
    <P>While the compulsory purchase powers already contained in the Act are rarely exercised, it is felt nevertheless that the defect in the 1945 Act should be corrected.  It is simple enough, with <Col N="668" /> the extended powers of the commissioners, to envisage a situation, such as an urban flood relief scheme, where such powers might now have to be exercised.</P>
    <P>The existing provisions relating to determination of the nature and extent of compensation to be paid to persons from whom land or rights have been acquired, or whose land has been severed from other lands, or access thereto. or been otherwise injuriously affected. have been found to be inadequate and it is intended also to provide definitive procedures for the future.  These matters are dealt with in sections 11 and 12.</P>
    <P>During the debate on Senator Daly's Bill reference was made to the provision in that Bill whereby local authorities would in future be obliged to publish annually their reports on the maintenance by them of drainage districts constituted by Acts prior to 1945.  A similar provision is being made in section 13 of the current Bill.  Section 14 is simply aimed at updating the long outdated penalties prescribed in 1945 for offences under various provisions of the existing legislation.  While it is my understanding that the Minister for Justice is currently preparing proposals for a general updating of fines and penalties, it is proposed to avail of the present opportunity to cater for offences under various headings in the current drainage legislation in order to deter offenders.</P>
    <P>The amendments now being introduced will, by definition, have implications for various other provisions of the 1945 Act, many of which are actually being repealed.  This matter is dealt with in section 15.  One particular aspect of this section requires elucidation.  I refer to the requirement of section 37 of the 1945 Act that the cost of arterial drainage maintenance be recouped from county councils.</P>
    <P>When the 1945 Act was drawn up it was envisaged that the capital cost of drainage construction works would be borne by the Exchequer but that the subsequent maintenance of completed schemes, though borne by the Exchequer in the first instance, be recovered <Col N="669" /> from the county councils in whose jurisdiction they lay.  The councils in turn levied a drainage rate to meet the cost.  This remained the position until 1986 when the Government decided, rightly, as both domestic and agricultural rates had long been abolished, that in future such costs would be borne entirely by the Exchequer.  No costs have been recovered from county councils since.  The new provisions give statutory effect to the decisions already taken.</P>
    <P>While the prime aim of this Bill is to provide a mechanism for limited schemes for the purpose of providing relief from localised flooding, it is not the intention that the prospect of undertaking further major schemes at some time in the future should be abandoned. The possibility of seeking EU funding for such schemes on the basis that they might permit acceptable levels of agricultural output and increased income to be achieved in a more environmentally friendly fashion, for example, by reducing fertiliser inputs, is currently being examined by the Commissioners of Public Works.  Other similar opportunities may occur in the future.</P>
    <P>Schemes for the relief of localised flooding will be undertaken by the engineering services divisions of the Office of Public Works.  The division which comprises administrative and professional staff has responsibility for the current arterial drainage construction, maintenance programme and inland waterways.  The workload on arterial drainage construction has been reducing due to the reducing number of schemes in progress.  On the other hand, the drainage maintenance workload has been increasing as completed schemes have to be maintained.</P>
    <P>The inland waterways programme is expanding steadily, especially since the transfer of the Grand and Royal Canals and Barrow Navigation to the Office of Public Works in 1986 and with the reopening of the Shannon-Erne Waterway in 1994.  This expansion of engineering services seems likely to continue in coming years, especially with the <Col N="670" /> introduction of these new measures for flood relief.  In the meantime, the first step is to secure the passage of the Bill into law and I look forward to the co-operation of all sides of the House in ensuring its speedy enactment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the speed with which he has acted and for introducing the legislation to the House today.  I assure him that he will have our full co-operation to get the best possible legislation on the Statute Book arising from our discussions here and in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>However, the Bill appears to be inadequate in some respects and it will greatly disappoint many of those affected by flooding following the acute problems which arose late last year and early this year.  The proposed amendment of the 1945 Act to enable the localised flood relief schemes to be undertaken is welcome and I pay tribute to the Commissioners of Public Works and their professional and technical personnel for the work they have undertaken in the whole area of drainage and work arising from the legislation on the canals, which I put through the House, together with their forward thinking with regard to the development of a modern waterway system.  They have not only professional and skilled personnel available to them to deal with these problems, but also a large data bank containing records going back over a number of years which will be important and valuable in the work to be undertaken under the new legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some deficiencies in the Bill, which we will address on Committee Stage, and which will inhibit the Commissioners of Public Works in responding speedily to events, especially in places where damage appears quickly.  Measures will be taken to enable schemes to be prepared to relieve flooding, but there could be a considerable delay in the preparation of these schemes.  While the Minister has attempted to shorten these delays by reducing the time limit for public display, <Col N="671" /> the fear is that in the preparation of localised schemes there could be long delays which would exacerbate certain problems which could be dealt with expeditiously if other arrangements were in place.  In view of this, the Minister should extend the authority of the Commissioners of Public Works to undertake works without the necessity to prepare a scheme.</P>
    <P>I agree with the necessity of preparing schemes.  Indeed, in many cases it would be essential to prepare schemes, because as the Minister rightly remarked, account must be taken of the impact any scheme may have on the overall catchment or indeed on other local areas.</P>
    <P>Under this legislation the Minister and the commissioners would need to have authority to move speedily in an emergency without having to prepare a detailed scheme.  This could be done in consultation with local authorities and others.  I suggest that the Minister look carefully at the prospect of having a further amendment included to deal with emergency cases.  If he is not prepared to do so I will provide an amendment for him.  It will be similar to the amendment I have put down to the Bill, as introduced, and not an attempt to undermine the desirability of having schemes properly and carefully prepared and examined before they are executed.</P>
    <P>Emergencies may often only necessitate moving in to relieve the situation where a flood could quickly &mdash; as was seen in Ennis last winter &mdash; almost submerge four or five of the busiest streets in a town.  It was suggested that certain minor works could be undertaken in an emergency.  If this is not done the legislation might be found, in practice, to be inadequate and either the Minister of State or some other Minister of State for the Office of Public Works would have to return to the Oireachtas seeking permission to further amend what is being amended here.</P>
    <P>I am fully aware of and appreciate the sentiment expressed by the Minister on <Col N="672" /> the greater public awareness of the importance of preserving the environment. We must ensure that care is taken in undertaking works, to be aware of our fishing industry and the damage which could be caused to it, or environmental damages which arise from certain types of schemes.  In light of this, in the Bill I prepared and published, which was debated in this House, a specific section was included that the commissioners would in consultation with the Minister for the Marine and the Environmental Protection Agency agree a formula for undertaking works. I thought at the time, that the provision whereby the Commissioners for Public Works were not bound by fisheries laws was no longer a tenable position and it would be in the best interests of the environment if we had a more defined statutory consultative process.  My view has not changed.  I note from the Bill that the Minister has a procedure for consulting with them on environmental matters.  It would be preferable to have a section which would put it beyond any doubt that the Minister would consult with the Minister for the Environment, the Minister for the Marine and the Environmental Protection Agency on schemes where there would be a risk of environmental problems or of damage to fisheries.</P>
    <P>It is not too clear from the Bill whether some other issues are covered. I want to draw the Minister's attention to coastal and tidal incursions and tidal catchments.  It is not clear whether works such as repairing culverts in coastal areas or estuaries are covered by the Bill.  The Minister will be aware that there is a Coastal Protection Act which may need to be amended; I am not certain this is the way to proceed.  I would like to hear the Minister's views whether it would be possible to make it clear beyond doubt that estuarine incursions of culverts and embankments in coastal areas could be dealt with in this legislation because that is not clear.</P>
    <P>The Minister received a number of complaints from different parts of the country.  I know he was made aware of <Col N="673" /> the complaint we had about the Shannon estuary and Leamore, which is near Kilrush, where hundreds of acres of land were flooded because a wall which was built by the Commissioners of Public Works fell down and there has been no clear indication who is responsible for the maintenance of work that was done 50 or 60 years ago.  Some of these works were carried out by the Land Commission, which has since been abolished, and no authority is willing to accept responsibility especially where heavy expenses may be involved.</P>
    <P>That brings me to maintenance, which the Minister also raised, and the establishment of responsibility for maintenance, even that which will be done after some of the new proposals the Minister has in mind are undertaken.  A major complaint from landowners, local residents and householders has been that in areas where culverts have broken down, especially because of coastal erosion and matters connected with it, no system has been found where somebody in authority could be made responsible to have the damage repaired.</P>
    <P>During my time in the Office of Public Works, there were difficulties with Clohaninchy and the west Clare coastline &mdash; I am sure there are hundreds of other Clohaninchys &mdash; where the old system, because of coastal erosion, had broken down and the county councils and the Office of Public Works were reluctant to accept responsibility.  I am not certain these proposals are covered in this legislation &mdash; coastal areas are not mentioned but the Bill mainly deals with catchments and arterial drainage.  I would like clarification of that before we move to the next stage.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the greatest complaint and the biggest flaw in this legislation is the absence of any provision for the payment of compensation in genuine hardship cases arising from the flooding of domestic dwellings which has been caused largely by the failure of the drainage system provided by the State. These points have already been discussed in this House and it is not necessary <Col N="674" /> at this stage to go over them again, but I want to remind the Minister of the severe hardship many people suffered because of the acute flooding at the end of last year, in some cases for the second or third time.</P>
    <P>I understood that the Government was to avail of this opportunity to put a mechanism in place that would enable compensation to be paid in these cases, and that it would have availed of this measure to put this matter on a statutory basis rather than the haphazard way in which it has been dealt with by agencies which have other humanitarian work to do.  Here I refer to the involvement of the Red Cross, a humanitarian organisation which deals with major disasters and crises around the world. Dealing with the problems arising from flooding, and the periodic flooding of catchments should be dealt with by the Government, the Minister for Finance and this Administration.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry was in Gort travelling around like Noah in his Ark at the time of the crisis, but I do not think he has been seen there since.  I do not know what happened to Noah after he left the Ark, but people whose homes have been flooded would like to see Noah come back to deal with their claims.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not enable claims to be made, examined or paid.  This will be a cause of great disappointment to many people, some of them in Clare, who have been looking forward to this legislation and for some indication from the Government that a mechanism would be put in place to examine and deal with their grievances.  A number of sections in my Bill dealt with that matter in some detail.  I was prepared to look at the establishment of a committee to examine claims and report to the Minister.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider his attitude in that regard.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is prepared to amend the Bill in regard to compensation, some provisions in the Bill I introduced could be refined, if necessary, to adequately deal with the situation.  If the Minister is not prepared to do that we <Col N="675" /> will have to consider drafting some amendments and seeking the support of independent Senators and others for them.  I remind the Minister of the experience of his colleague here last week.  I am not threatening the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor Quinn Mrs. Taylor Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor Quinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very clear indication that we firmly believe it is necessary to set down a statutory basis from which to deal with compensation for people who have had serious problems and who because of the inadequacies or unavailability of insurance cover &mdash; the Minister highlighted this in his speech &mdash; have not had their grievances and problems satisfactorily dealt with.  The committee I suggest should be set up to deal with compensation would have other functions; it would not be entirely committed to dealing with applications for compensation.  It would be an advisory committee for the Minister and it could also examine the causes and effects of flooding.</P>
      <P>As the Minister of State is well aware, when we discussed the drainage problems here a number of Senators mentioned issues such as the desirability of granting planning permissions in areas likely to experience flooding.  Some huge town developments took place in areas, which an examination of the Ordnance Survey maps shows, are clearly identified as being areas likely to be subject to flooding.  Nevertheless planning permissions were given for major developments in these areas, some of which have in no small way contributed to problems which have arisen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer here to areas of Loughville, an area adjacent to Ennis, where the complaint has been that some fairly major developments adjacent to the town of Ennis have caused flooding.  Major land reclamation and development caused flooding on adjoining land and on the public road and this problem has been getting worse each year.  It would be advisable if the Minister could call on an <Col N="676" /> advisory committee and that committee should not only deal with claims for compensation arising from incidents of flooding but should also examine the possibility of producing an annual report setting out precisely its findings and what action is being taken.  I welcome the provision in this section, which was in the previous Bill, which makes available to the public the reports of the drainage committees.  The committee which I suggested the Minister should establish would advise him on priorities and causes and effects which could be remedied outside his remit and control and would publish an annual report which would set out what was being achieved.</P>
    <P>To a large extent, the Commissioners of Public Works have not got the maximum credit for some of the outstanding work they have completed.  It is desirable that such arrangements be put in place and I urge the Minister to consider them before Committee Stage. The Bill, while welcome, is flawed in a number of respects but we can deal with them effectively here.  It would be better to deal with those flaws here because it is unlikely that we will see similar legislation before the Houses of Oireachtas for the next 40 or 50 years.  It is more than 50 years since the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, was before these Houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and compliment <Col N="677" /> him and his staff for bringing this comprehensive and detailed Bill to the House so quickly.  This legislation constructively and positively tackles the problems caused by drainage and flooding. We have been beset by difficulties because, as the Minister clearly outlined, of the restrictions which pertained in relation to the 1945 Act.</P>
      <P>Over the years public representatives have had a good relationship with the Office of Public Works which, because of the restrictions in the 1945 Act, was unable to move into certain areas and undertake works which needed to be done to relieve flooding.  This Bill looks at this problem and empowers the Office of Public Works and the Minister to undertake small operations in major catchment areas while not detracting from the major catchment drainage proposals for those areas.  This must be commended.  The Minister and his staff must take full credit for the fact that this has been dealt with so well in the Bill and for acting promptly.</P>
      <P>Listening to Senator Daly one would believe that Fianna Fáil had not been in power for the past 50 years.  He was Minister of State in this Department for two years some time ago, but we did not see him present similar legislation.  This Minister must be complimented for responding and reacting so quickly.</P>
      <P>There are problems caused by flooding in each constituency and the severity of flooding has been evident since 1991. The main problem which exists at present commenced in 1991 and continued through 1992, 1993, 1994 and 1995.  It is not for me to say who was in Government during those years, but the fact is that there was no response and no action for four years.  There is an onus on each of us to ensure that this fine legislation is passed through the House quickly so that the Office of Public Works can tackle the problems throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that by the end of this year and early next year urgent remedial works will be completed which will prevent a recurrence of the flooding we have seen over the past number of years.  The <Col N="678" /> Minister has been motivated by that.  He must be complimented for touring the country and visiting the affected areas in every county.  He and his officials have seen at first hand the difficulties which people have endured in recent months and years when their residences were flooded.  In some cases their houses were destroyed beyond recognition and they will never be able to live there again.  A great deal of repair works needs to be done to houses which have been seriously damaged.  The effect and the psychological impact this has on those concerned is dramatic and cannot be underestimated and the hardship experienced by these people has had major repercussions on their families.</P>
    <P>Farmers, particularly in the Gort area of County Galway, have experienced severe difficulties.  Their land, cattle and fodder have been destroyed.  Senator Daly referred to a visit by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, to that area and to Noah's Ark.  That Minister had the wit to come to see the severity of the situation even if it involved getting into a boat.  Unfortunately, that cannot be said of his predecessors.  The Minister must be commended on the way he responded and acted.  I have been in contact with many people who have received compensation cheques for loss of fodder and livestock and they are happy with his response.</P>
    <P>The fall out which business people in urban areas have experienced as a result of their businesses being flooded has been phenomenal.  They lost goods and business because people could not get into their properties.  I hope the Minister's proposal will relieve the problems for these people and that remedial work will be undertaken.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides specific powers and substantially amends the 1945 Act.  I am pleased the Minister has made specific announcements for nine priority areas because he saw at first hand the fall-out from flooding there.  I hope the £1 million to £2 million which he proposes to spend will relieve the situation in those areas and that the work will be done <Col N="679" /> which will enable people to remain in their homes next year, without the fear of being flooded out.  I appeal to the Minister to prioritise other areas and to look at each of them.</P>
    <P>Section 6 is particularly welcome because it enables the Minister and the Office of Public Works to &ldquo;enter into an agreement with one or more other persons (including a local authority or authorities) whereby that other person or persons agrees or agree to defray, in whole or part, the costs&rdquo;.  A lot of constructive work can be carried out between the Office of Public Works, the local authorities, the Department of the Marine, the Land Commission, the ESB and CIE.  I appeal to the Minister to use that section to full advantage.</P>
    <P>The Minister visited the Ballycar area of Newmarket-on-Fergus where part of the railway line is flooded and unusable for over five months each year.  This has caused a lot of difficulty for CIE.  This section could be used if CIE, Clare County Council and the Office of Public Works were involved in a joint venture to relieve the situation there.  I appeal to the Minister to use that section in relation to this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="680" /> The Clonlara-Blackwater area of the River Shannon is subject to flash flooding. Locals say this happens because the ESB engaged in specific activities and changed the course of the River Shannon to erect a dam to generate electricity. That is an area that needs to be investigated.  Section 10, which confers powers on the Minister when another authority changes the course of the river and causes flooding, should be considered in relation to this problem.  I welcome this section in the Bill.  The information the Minister and his officials collated during their tour of the country over the past number of months has been included in the various sections of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Belharbour in New Quay, County Clare, has also experienced problems. The Minister met a deputation from that area in Gort some weeks ago.  Clare County Council and the Department should address this issue.  The Minister has arranged for a specific study to be done of the swallow-holes and watercourses in that area.  I hope this will be done as soon as possible to resolve the problem.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly referred to flaws in the Bill, particularly the lack of compensation provisions.  The Bill specifically deals with compensation for the compulsory purchase of lands to alleviate flooding.  I commend this approach. Senator Daly is more concerned about money and financial compensation for people whose houses are flooded.  It would be unwise to include in legislation details relating to monetary compensation. What is the Department's role in this regard?  Where major crises arise, each case must be examined on its own merits because every case is different.  It is not possible to put on the Statute Book details about monetary compensation.</P>
    <P>Recently we witnessed an effective way of compensating people.  The Government must be commended for the way it provided compensation for victims of such hardship.  The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Higgins, went to Brussels and <Col N="681" /> got £260,000 from the EU, the highest <i>per capita</i> in Europe, and that was supplemented by money provided by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>We did not hear about the additional money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister asked the Red Cross to administer the scheme and an office was set up in Gort. Senator Daly criticised the involvement of the Red Cross in this area.  I disagree with him because it was a good idea to ask the Red Cross to administer the compensation scheme.  He claimed it should be involved in humanitarian work in Third World countries or elsewhere. However, if there is a crisis in this country and assistance is required, there is no organisation better than the Red Cross to do it.  It is currently examining the applications in relation to house damage, etc.  Will we ask the taxpayers to take on the role of insurance companies and, if so, what will be the fall-out?  It could be a dangerous precedent and should not be commended.</P>
      <P>Senator Daly also said that this Bill does not deal with tidal or estuary problems. I would remind him that in 1989 a Fianna Fáil Government transferred powers covering these areas from the Office of Public Works to the Department of the Marine.  Is he now saying that we should give those powers back to the Office of Public Works?  Under section 6 third parties may co-operate with the Department of the Marine to defray the costs of arterial drainage works.</P>
      <P>The Bill is comprehensive and detailed and covers every aspect of the recent flooding problem.  As I said, the Minister and his officials must be commended for doing this so quickly and effectively.  The £2 million allocated this year will be put to good use and I hope future budgets will allocate more substantial funding for arterial drainage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A section in the Bill deals with local authorities and maintenance.  Unfortunately, local authorities are not getting the necessary funding to carry out the <Col N="682" /> necessary maintenance works.  There is an onus on the Government to provide local authorities with proper funding for the maintenance of rivers.  The Bill states specifically that annual reports on maintenance works should be made available to the public for examination. Clare County Council has not carried out maintenance work on rivers; the money has been used on roads.  In the past local authorities received money from agricultural and industrial rates and they then decided how to spend it. Proper funding must be provided to local authorities for necessary maintenance works.  If these works had been done, the flooding would not have been so severe.  The Government must consider this matter.</P>
    <P>I hope this Bill is passed as quickly as possible.  I commend everything in it but I am anxious to hear other ideas.  The situation we experienced over the past number of years must not be allowed to continue and this Bill will ensure that does not happen.  I hope that by the end of the month, as the Minister promised in the House some time ago, this Bill will be on the Statute Book and that during the summer the Office of Public Works will get the necessary work done throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The introduction in the Bill of a reduction in the time-scale for consultation with local authorities from three months to one month and for publication from one month to 14 days is extremely welcome and will reduce the amount of time that is wasted.  Yesterday or today Senator Daly said &mdash; I am not sure if it was on Clare FM or in the House, he seems to have one speech for that radio station and another one for here &mdash; that we could not get this work done speedily enough.</P>

That would be an irresponsible approach.  The basic groundwork must be done and a scheme prepared.  This scheme has been completed in much less time than heretofore and I commend the Minister for this and wish him good luck with the Bill.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is a step forward and I compliment the Minister and his officials on the work they have done preparing it.  It provides the key development in that the Office of Public Works will now have responsibility for the relief of flooding throughout the country.</P>
      <P>However, while I applaud much of what is in the Bill and do not have a problem with it, there are two areas about which I am concerned.  The first has been mentioned by Senator Taylor-Quinn. This is the necessity to prepare schemes to respond to an urgent situation, such as we have seen in the recent past.  It is one thing for the Office of Public Works or any Department to prepare and implement a scheme.  We all know how long it takes for the wheels of bureaucracy to turn.  On the other hand, a scheme may be prepared in a joint venture with the private sector, perhaps with the support and approval of the Office of Public Works. The Minister has missed a major opportunity to provide for a situation where schemes can be prepared as a matter of urgency to alleviate the major problems we have seen up to now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not our intention to propose amendments which would result in commencing digging with a bulldozer or Hymac without proper planning.  It would not be our intention to see any work done which would hinder or have a negative effect on the environment, ecology or wildlife of an area, but this is not to say that the Bill should not <Col N="684" /> include a provision whereby the Minister would take the power to have a scheme prepared as an urgent short term measure.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the little scheme in Galway which was carried out by Deputy McCormack.  The emphasis of this scheme was not to drain land but simply to alleviate abnormally high flooding.  Consequently, a great deal of the concern which was expressed by some people that this was going to have a dramatic effect on the ecology or environmental stability of the area was without basis because all it did was to reduce the level of flooding to a normal level.  I found it rather strange that on the one hand we were told we had approval from the Office of Public Works and, on the other, we received faxes from the wildlife section of the Office of Public Works stating this work could not be carried out.</P>
    <P>I know this part of the country inside out and not one whit of damage will be done to its wildlife or ecology as a result of what has been done.  I defy anybody to say what difficulties could be caused. The people involved in that scheme wanted to reduce the level of the water under the Ballinderreen road by another 18-24 inches.  This was not allowed because it may have reduced the level too much.  There is no reason a common sense approach could not be applied in that situation, for instance, using a sluice which would control the level of the water.  The Minister is missing a major opportunity by not allowing for simple straightforward common sense schemes like this to be included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>In south Galway there are two ways of solving the problem.  There is the way provided for in the Bill, which means that in five years we will have the same problem or there is the more common sense approach, which is that a scheme will be initiated with the support, backing and authority of the Office of Public Works and the local authority but it will be a joint venture with the people who are affected.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="685" /> I have seen data which have been collected locally by some engineering firms as to how the problem in Coole can be solved.  There is a simple solution but it is not provided for in the Bill.  The location of the real problem in Coole and in all of the Gort area is the inability of water to flow from the lake in Killamoran to the sea.  There is sufficient evidence in the studies which have been carried out to show that the water collects in Coole, some goes underground to Killamoran and some underground to the sea.  Hydrological studies in the past, using dives, have shown that the water goes in a number of different ways to the sea at Kinavara. Water levels have been taken and it is not financially impossible for a drainage scheme, like the one carried out in Ballinderreen, to be carried out from Killamoran to the sea at Kinvara.  It would have the effect of reducing in a controlled way the level of the water at Killamoran, which would result in a reduction of the level of the water at Coole and its backup, and the flooding which this has caused could then be relieved.</P>
    <P>The Minister can carry out any studies he likes over the next few months and I guarantee that this is the solution they will recommend.  I have always advocated the cleaning of swallow holes because this would make the problem less serious as water would not get through them as quickly as in the past. I am advocating a simple scheme which will only have the effect of alleviating flood levels and not draining any place.</P>
    <P>I am proud of the unique ecological system in south Galway and I do not want to see it interfered with.  I do not want to see the unique turlough at Caherglisaun, which we describe as Killamoran, affected and it need not be because excess water can be released from that location which, in turn, will release excess water from Coole thus alleviating the flooding problem.</P>
    <P>We do not want to drain the country around there and do not want to lower the levels in Coole because we realise <Col N="686" /> the serious ecological effect it would have on one of the most unique landscapes in the world.  We simply want to take a common sense approach to get rid of the excess water.  This legislation will do that but it will take a long time to get to grips with how to do it and it will spend a long time dealing with environmentalists.  We have no problem with the environment, and the environment will not be affected but, unfortunately, we have a problem with environmentalists who, irrespective of what you do, feel it is wrong to put a spade in the ground.</P>
    <P>That is why we will be tabling an amendment asking the Minister to take the power to execute works to prevent or reduce periodic flooding in an emergency without the necessity of preparing a drainage scheme.  By that I mean that, rather than starting to dig, one should first carry out the necessary preparatory engineering and planning works.  But there is no necessity other than to do a cursory examination of the environmental impact because the scheme will not be designed to take away water that has always been there.  It will simply be designed to take away excess water in an unusual period as we had in the last couple of months.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider including that in the Bill because I am concerned about what we will get as a result of the major study to be undertaken by consultants who are about to be appointed.  The issue of drainage will be confused with the issue that I want dealt with.  We are not talking about drainage, reducing water from areas where it has always been, or about a negative ecological effect on the environment.</P>
    <P>The question of compensation is also missing from the Bill.  Senator Taylor-Quinn commended the Minister for the effective manner in which compensation had been provided but the Senator should speak to the 20 or so householders who have been homeless for 15 weeks during which time they have been paying large mortgages as well as rent for alternative accommodation.  As of <Col N="687" /> today, 16 May, they have not received one penny and that is not good enough.</P>
    <P>There was no necessity to bring in the Red Cross to do this job which should have been done quickly and effectively by the Departments.  Voluntary agencies, meanwhile, were running around the country trying to do a job which they should never have been asked to do and the result is that we are still struggling to get money to those people.</P>
    <P>Nobody appears to have responsibility for a natural disaster but surely the Government must take responsibility for occurrences which are not covered by normal insurance premiums. I agree with Senator Taylor-Quinn that we should not allow any insurance company off the hook in regard to their responsibilities in this respect.  However, when a natural disaster occurs and brings about a most unusual situation, as south Galway experienced over the last 16 weeks, the Government must take responsibility for it.</P>
    <P>The Bill is seriously flawed since it does not address that situation.  It is a natural inclination on the part of Government not to take responsibility to pay any money unless they absolutely have to, but that is not good enough. The affected householders should have received some compensation from day one, and the insurance issue could have been dealt with in the normal way.  If this had been done, the money which would have been paid by the insurance companies could then have been refunded to the Government.</P>
    <P>As of today none of these people has been paid any money and it is clear that the compensation they will receive from insurance companies will not be sufficient. In addition, the money being given to the Red Cross by the European Union is also insufficient, yet we still have not received any indication from the Minister other than to say that he will, in time, introduce a Supplementary Estimate.  Because that is unsatisfactory we will be proposing amendments along the lines of the previous Bill introduced by Senator Daly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="688" /> The situation was well summed up by Senator Taylor-Quinn.  We will have this Bill passed in a month &mdash; and I give credit to the Minister and his officials for that &mdash; but that is as much as we will have achieved because this Bill is not going to solve any problems.</P>
    <P>If anyone wants an assurance that the problems are not going to be solved this year it is included in the explanatory memorandum which sums up my main dissatisfaction with the Bill.  Under the heading &ldquo;Financial and staffing implications&rdquo;, the final paragraph states:</P>
    <P>The cost arising from the Bill will depend on the availability of funds [that is as good a piece of Civil Service-speak as you can get] and on the case, on cost/benefit grounds, for undertaking works [that is a close number two].  Expenditure of the order of £1 million-£2 million may arise in 1995 [I would put in brackets after that &ldquo;and we hope it does not arise&rdquo;].  The staffing implications in Office of Public Works will be the subject of further consideration.</P>
    <P>That is a pathetic piece of English to put into a Bill.  How are the people in south Galway, who have been suffering unbelievable hardship for the last 16 weeks, going to take that kind of tripe?  Do you think the people in the west are complete fools?  I am annoyed because when I showed this to some people in south Galway over the last few days I was told to go to hell and to tell the rest of the politicians to go with me.  If that is the kind of stuff we are getting to solve a human crisis, a situation where families are at breaking point, then we, as politicians, should keep it.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister say something definite about what will be done before the Bill leaves the Seanad and not say it will depend on the availability of funds or on expenditure that may arise in 1995? We know expenditure must arise this year, so why does he not announce how much will be spent and on what?  If he has not yet decided what he will do this year in south Galway and Gort and what swallow-holes need to be cleaned, <Col N="689" /> he will never decide.  If he has decided he should tell us.  That at least will alleviate some of the uncertainty and frustration.</P>
    <P>I spoke to a man last night who did not know whether to go back to his house because he did not know if it was worthwhile to repair it.  He wanted an indication that something would happen this year to alleviate his problem. Neither the Minister's contribution nor the Bills gives that man any hope. Consequently I am dissatisfied with the legislation.</P>
    <P>In speaking so strongly I am reflecting the frustration found where I live.  I hope there will be a response to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and congratulate him for expeditiously bringing forward this Bill. Like every Bill introduced in these Houses it is not perfect.  No Bill ever produced in any legislature can be. However, it is the best which can be produced in the circumstances.</P>
      <P>The original Bill was introduced by Senator Daly who is one of the least partisan politicians I have known.  He brought to the production of his Bill a great deal of expertise from the Office of Public Works and from his period as Minister for the Marine.  That same expertise is available to the current Minister.  In so far as the background is concerned, therefore, the information talent bank is the same.</P>
      <P>I have read the Official Report of everything said on this subject.  A few moments ago Senator Fahey gave great technical detail, as Senator Finneran and Senator Kelly, among others when they spoke.  I am sure the Minister will take on board the tremendous knowledge and technical expertise of Members.  The local and national knowledge displayed by the proposer of the other Bill has been noted by everyone in the House and I join with the Minister in congratulating him on a job well done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems earlier that one has to be from Clare to speak about flooding. Having listened to Senator Taylor-Quinn <Col N="690" /> and Senator Daly, I decided that was one battle I did not intend to join on this pleasant afternoon.</P>
    <P>I know that Cork city suffered flooding for many years; it used to be said that if one took a lease in Oliver Plunkett Street, one bought a punt to go with it, to carry out one's goods and leave because as regularly as clockwork, when the wind, tide and rain coincided. Patrick Street and Oliver Plunkett Street were flooded, sometimes up to four feet deep.</P>
    <P>Friends and colleagues of mine had shops in this area so I know what is involved when houses, farms and businesses are flooded.  It is not only a question of compensation &mdash; flooding sets a person back months and in some cases years.  Even worse, it is disheartening. The victims have to deal with insurance companies whose standard practice is to avoid paying if at all possible, slide out of their obligations when the opportunity arises or in every way to mitigate their responsibilities.  In many cases people only get part-compensation for their goods and chattels when they deserve a full accounting.</P>
    <P>I use the Shannon for recreation and I know almost every harbour and inlet on that river.  I drove through Clare and other counties and saw the devastation caused by flooding throughout the region.  Last week I was in Banagher, and it is obvious great hardship has been caused.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier there are many experts on this in the House, but to an urban dweller it is shocking to see the devastation to farms and houses, even with the knowledge that this is a natural phenomenon, or a so-called &ldquo;act of God&rdquo;.  When I went to sea, it was always an act of God when a person fell down a companion-way in heavy weather; it was not that someone had put something slippy on the companion-way. However in the case of flooding we have control over some aspects of the problem but none over others.  We have no control over the weather and cannot foresee the strength of winds or that there will be constant rain.  We cannot <Col N="691" /> always know what damage has been done to land by the ways it has been used.  As Senator Finneran said last week, we do not know what farm operators do to their land, what they fill in, cover up or neglect.</P>
    <P>It would be unreasonable to hold the State responsible for many matters but there are areas for which it is responsible. Senator Daly and the Minister highlighted one such area, the lack of a fast response because of the confinements of the legislation.  That was addressed in both Bills.  A fast response, by doing what needs to be done in one area without defining a catchment scheme, is of vital importance in addressing the problem.  This will be welcomed by all sides.</P>
    <P>There are other major players, some of them part of the State, such as the ESB and Bord na Móna.  Any investigation of responsibilities should be directed towards Bord na Móna. Although it is a State body it still has responsibilities.  A person who sailed up the Shannon and got Bord na Móna bags or wire caught in his propeller, would not feel warmly towards that organisation.  However, in many cases its care of the rivers adjacent to its operations leaves much to be desired.  It is easy to talk about the responsibility of farmers or the Office of Public Works but Bord na Móna will have to play a role.</P>
    <P>I am an unashamed, if not uncritical, fan of the Office of Public Works.  There are monuments to that organisation throughout the State.  In most cases it does a first class job.  I have seen that myself and I have heard many comments from French and German visitors to the Shannon region about the quality of work done by the Office of Public Works along the Shannon system.  The ESB was the main contractor for the Shannon-Erne waterway, and its daily operation is of a consistently high standard. I was in Derry last week and I met people who had travelled it &mdash; Unionists who are now starting to come South in greater numbers &mdash; and they had the <Col N="692" /> highest praise for the way the section of the waterway in the South was conducted.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works has enormous expertise.  We can read the past reports of the Commissioners of Public Works in the National Library which were a source of information on rivers, for example, when there was little else available.  The Office of Public Works's efficiency is evidenced by the transformation of the canal system on its transfer from CIE to the Office of Public Works. It is now rapidly becoming one of our best tourist attractions.</P>
    <P>Senator Fahey quoted the explanatory memorandum where it refers to financial implications.  It was a little disingenuous to do so.  Having held office Senator Fahey knows better than most that a Minister first fights for the Bill and then fights the Department of Finance; that is the way it works.  When Senator Fahey was a Minister of State he knew that if there was a chance of getting any money he had to overcome the conditioning that seems to affect most people when they become officials of the Department of Finance.  It is a culture which automatically includes so many caveats that it may render provisions meaningless.</P>
    <P>This simply tests the mettle of the Minister concerned.  I thought the note was in good English but I know what Senator Fahey means.  One should not be put off by the caveat that: &ldquo;The cost arising from the Bill will depend on the availability of funds...&rdquo;  How many times did the Senator hear that when he was in office?  Incidentally, the Senator did a reasonably good job and extracted substantial amounts from the system.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill as I welcomed Senator Daly's Bill.  It is important to remember that, despite billions of dollars having been spent in the US over many years, millions of dollars worth of damage is done every year by floods.  It is impossible to tell people there are environmental hazards we can get rid of and which will never affect us in the future.  It is most important that this is said at the beginning of this debate.</P>
      <P>Great effort was put into building the Thames barrier, for example, but there is still flooding in the Thames basin. There is not a major river valley in Europe where there have not been floods.  It may happen only occasionally, such as the Adige Valley or near Florence or along the Rhine, but there are environmental and geological hazards which we will not be able to overcome.</P>
      <P>There have been acute problems in the west due to high rainfall in the first few months of the year &mdash; up to 200 per cent the normal figure.  It is impossible for any ground &mdash; never mind the karst limestone of Senator Daly's and Senator Taylor-Quinn's area &mdash; to cope with such an increase in a short length of time, and the floods, therefore, were not surprising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The implications of flooding for the wildlife service must also be considered. A great deal of effort has gone into the preservation of the country's flora and fauna and, in certain areas, these will <Col N="694" /> alter dramatically even without flooding. However, that is poor consolation to those who have suffered from the flooding recently.</P>
    <P>I have not visited the affected areas in the west but from what I have seen on television and in photographs, houses seem to be relatively new in the areas where flooding has occurred.  A major difficulty associated with the flooding along the Rhine this winter was that there had been a considerable amount of building between the winter dykes and the summer dykes.  This had not been the case in the past and an additional strain can be put on land with which it cannot cope.  When planning permission is granted for building, is any consideration given to warning people about environmental hazards which may occur in the area?  I hope the Minister will consider this.</P>
    <P>Meteorologists tell us that just because we say it is wetter it does not mean the climate is getting worse. Apparently, climactic changes are measured over a 30 year period.  I gather, however, there has been a change in the climate; we are having much wetter periods with much heavier rainfall and more predictable drier periods. It is little consolation to those who are flooded but such matters must be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>Many of the areas where flooding has occurred recently have a history of flooding going back to medieval times. However, when examining the reasons for the flooding we must look at the man-made factors that may be involved. It has been suggested that forestry may be important in this regard and I presume the Department is researching this.  Efforts were made apparently to plug turloughs in some areas to control the water.  My knowledge of hydrology is poor but, as far as I know, if one plugs groundwater exits in one place the water will come up in another.  In the west we are dealing in the main with ground water and not river water, and it is extraordinarily difficult to deal with this problem because of the geographic hazards in the area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="695" /> I spoke briefly about the environmental problems which may also arise. There is a long and difficult problem regarding road building in the Pollardstown fen.  When areas are important to the preservation of the country's ecology, we have to see if we can go around rather than through them.  I hope the Minister will ensure that such matters are examined.  We also have to look at matters from an international perspective which may have seemed good at one stage but were later found to be disastrous.  The building of dams was popular 30 years ago but now even the Aswan Dam is considered to have been a mistake to a certain extent. I hope that a broad and philosophical outlook is adopted when drainage schemes are being considered.</P>
    <P>Particular difficulties can arise in urban areas because public health must be taken into account.  When draining an area we must be careful that the drinking supply is not affected.  This has been a problem in Gort where drainage water does not benefit from the cleansing effects of passing through the soil and sewage seams go rapidly down into karst limestone and along the fissures. This can contaminate drinking water. However, these problems may have been rectified in every area but I remember this happening in the west where a heritage centre was built in outbuildings at Lough Coole.  It had to be closed because the sewerage scheme was found to be contaminating the drinking water for the heritage centre and a considerable amount of work had to be done.  This was one of the problems mentioned in connection with Mullaghmore. In areas where the geology is unpredictable, one can encounter a considerable amount of trouble and rectifying one problem may cause a disaster in another area.</P>
    <P>I have one more question: where will the outflow be?  The outflow from any drainage scheme can cause trouble.  I remember hearing about trenches that were dug in the west, unofficially &mdash; I think towards Galway Bay &mdash; and it was <Col N="696" /> said that they were affecting the oyster beds.  I hope the Minister examines environmental issues, public health issues and the effect of these measures on other industries or endeavours in the area.  This is a most difficult problem which requires much thought.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear the Minister's comments on advising people seeking planning permission about serious environmental hazards to their property, be it residential or industrial.  This is becoming a problem, not just in Ireland but everywhere.  I am not suggesting that we build houses on stilts but perhaps we should suggest that they be built on higher land.  I was struck by the fact that all the houses in the disaster area in the west appeared to be new.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's comments.</P>

      <P>Much has been said in strong tones about the flooding problem in this country and, no doubt over the next two days, many more voices will vociferously elaborate on the problems. I bring into the House this afternoon a blatant example of what the flooding and the wet situation on the western seaboard does to its people. Being a man of sober habits and not given to decimation of the body I believe that the heavy cold that has now engulfed my body results from the fact that I live on the western seaboard which is wet in the extreme.  This wetness has been caused in the main by the prevailing winds which roll in so much rain from the Atlantic.  It hits the western seaboard and leaves the area with a deluge of water which has caused many problems, particularly over the last number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no need for me to elaborate on the trauma families have experienced in many areas, particularly in my own area of south Galway, in the last <Col N="697" /> number of years and the terrible flooding problems of late last year and early this year.  The problem of water getting into houses and their desecration has sent a wave of sadness through the nation.  A few short years ago, in 1991, a similar problem occurred and lasted for a number of months; this is an ongoing situation.  Since then, apart from words of sympathy, the help of neighbours and efforts by the local authorities from their own feeble resources to help the people who have been beset by this natural disaster, very little has been done.  Thankfully things have changed.</P>
    <P>The introduction of this Bill is a watershed in the history of this country and I am sure many people who have been beset by the problems of flooding over the last number of years are very happy that the torch has been passed to a new Government which is prepared to apply itself to finding a solution to a very difficult problem.  In welcoming this Bill to the House it would be remiss of me, having seen at first hand the efforts of the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Higgins, not to compliment him and his Department on a meaningful initiative in introducing a Bill which will not put obstacles in the way of the permanent alleviation of flooding problems.</P>
    <P>This is a major step forward and for the first time ever the Office of Public Works will be empowered to deal with flooding on a localised basis.  It has been apparent for some time that there were considerable benefits to be achieved by tackling flood relief work on a local rather than a catchment basis as was required by the legislation up to now. The flooding situation, particularly in south Galway and other areas, was the impetus for the amendment of the Act. The Bill will see to it that the alleviation of the suffering and hardship in both urban and rural areas due to localised flooding can now be tackled in earnest. I also welcome the Government's commitment to provide extra resources to the Office of Public Works in 1995 to get this work under way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="698" /> When we talk of dealing with flooding on a localised basis, it would be remiss of me not to put on record the great work that has been done in the Coolarne area of the parish of Turloughmore in County Galway.  That area has been subject to flooding for hundreds of years.  However, in recent years the flooding problem has been greatly alleviated by a local initiative which was undertaken with the assistance of Galway County Council and a local committee. This can be seen as a pilot area. The local authority in question also deserves to be complimented.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not spared himself. It would be remiss of us not to compliment him on the interest he has taken in the problem and on his present efforts to implement a lasting solution to prevent a recurrence of the disasters we witnessed in the flooded areas last winter.  There is an all party approach to this problem and we must give credit where it is due.  I compliment Senator Daly for the initiative he has taken and the effort he made to highlight the flooding problem in his Bill.</P>
    <P>This Bill is most welcome.  It is vital that it is implemented now so that there is not a recurrence of the flooding in future years.  Money must be provided to enable county councils to raise roads in areas prone to flooding.  A welcome aspect of the Bill is the inclusion of a provision that councils will be reimbursed for money spent on such work. At least the local authorities will not be out of pocket.  That is crucially important because local authorities are starved for cash at present.  I commend my local authority in Galway for its marvellous work during the emergency in the Gort area over Christmas, despite limited funds.  It cleared debris and helped to drive back the waters.  It is crucial that councils are not penalised in such cases.  I hope that money spent by local authorities will not be taken from the roads programme and that these authorities will be reimbursed.</P>
    <P>As a resident and representative of the area of County Galway that has been most bedevilled by flooding, I <Col N="699" /> compliment the Minister on his decision to have a study of the problem carried out.  A number of companies have tendered to undertake it.  I hope the Minister will do all in his power to expedite the implementation of the results of that study &mdash; no time can be wasted.  I also appeal to him, on completion of the study, to ensure that remedial action will be taken, particularly in Gort and the south Galway region.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that the Government ensures that the people of Gort will never have to face another winter in fear and dread of flood waters invading their premises and farmyards, leaving them, their children and their households in disarray.  People living in the flooded areas are like John the Baptist crying in the wilderness and looking for assistance and resources.  Over the last number of years little has happened. Those people are looking to the Minister, Deputy Jim Higgins, as the messiah. We do not pretend that he can walk on water but we believe he might be the Minister who will lead these people so that they will never again have to wade through water.</P>

    <P>Like the Cathaoirleach who will put the question to the House following the Minister's concluding remarks, my question to the Minister is &mdash; will he ensure that the study is implemented as soon as possible?  Will he do all in his power to ensure that remedial action is taken before the rains and the floods of next winter so that the people of south Galway <Col N="700" /> in particular will never again have to face a winter like last year?  I live in an area called Turloughmore which means Dry Lake.  The water in my parish has receded as a result of a flooding programme which was implemented by the former Minister, Michael Donlon, a member of my party.  I hope our party in this Government, with the assistance of its partners, will see to it &mdash; and we are going in the right direction with this Bill &mdash; that the flooding problem that has bedevilled this country, especially during last winter which was the wettest in the history of this State, can be prevented in the future.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the enormous effort he is making.  I am confident he will see to it that this Bill is quickly implemented throughout the country.  It will be of great assistance to many communities.</P>

There is no point relieving flooding in one area by creating a flood elsewhere.  That is the problem confronting the Office of Public Works in this Bill.</P>

    <P>The policy since the passage of the 1945 Act has been that a big catchment area should be drained.  That is easy to understand and much good work was done throughout the country.  At this stage, however, the Office of Public Works has sufficient knowledge from its experience and research to oversee and complete small areas to relieve localised flooding.  This will be welcome in areas that suffered greatly during last winter. Some of those areas were in County Galway, County Clare, in my own County Longford, along the Shannon basin and parts of County Roscommon. All along, there was no hope.  People expected help from the county councils and turned to the Government; but, in fairness, everybody's hands were tied. The Bill, therefore, moves the process <Col N="701" /> forward.  The Office of Public Works, the local authority and the local community can now have an input in resolving the problems in their areas.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister arrange for the Office of Public Works to undertake a survey on flooded land throughout the country?  There are many areas in the Shannon basin and elsewhere where the land is flooded for three or four months of the year.  There was a joke in Longford at one time where a local man was asked how much land he had and he replied that he had 25 acres when the tide was out and 15 acres when the tide was in.  He meant by this that during the winter months, inland as he was, the tide from the local river was flooding.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister and wish him and his Department the best of luck.  There is a hard task ahead.  It is intricate work and much research needs to be undertaken.  There is no point in solving one problem by creating another.  The legislation is timely and the Minister is to be congratulated for the speed with which he dealt with this matter as many important factors had to be considered before the legislation could be drafted.</P>

      <P>I was under a misapprehension before Senator McDonagh's intervention.  I had thought that the Minister and his colleagues in the Fine Gael Party had reached the promised land shortly before last Christmas when they acceded to Government, but it is now apparent that we must wait until the floods are parted before the chosen people reach the promised land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I also welcome the Bill.  I will not be opposing it on Second Stage, but there are some amendments which I have tabled as the Bill can be improved. Hopefully, when we discuss the amendments, the Minister will treat them in <Col N="702" /> the spirit of our attempt to be helpful to the construction of the legislation rather than otherwise.</P>
    <P>The Minister has expressed regret about the fact that he gave an assurance to the House regarding the Bill which was not fulfilled to the letter.  I accept his regret, but, as I said a couple of weeks ago on the Order of Business, commitments of this nature should not be given lightly to the House as they are very solemn.  This was an explicit commitment, and explicit commitments of this kind need to be delivered on, even though I accept that there can be difficulties in drafting and so on which cause problems.  We owe a debt to Senator Quinn for drawing attention to the commitment. It was especially serious in the context of a vote which was likely to be close, whereby its outcome was affected by the statement which was made.</P>
    <P>Having expressed regret, the Minister has appealed to us to expedite the passage of the Bill through the House to ensure that the second deadline for the end of May will be met.  In this respect, it is not our intention to hinder the Bill, but the passage of the Bill and the speed of its passage are predicated by the fact that it is presented to the House on time.  This is, again, a reminder to the Minister, and others, of the importance that commitments entered into on the floor of the House be delivered upon.</P>
    <P>I commend Senator Daly for his initiative, because without it we would be waiting very much longer to have the legislation before us.  We, therefore, owe him a debt of gratitude also. Neither the Government nor anybody else can predetermine the incidents which took place over the winter, but experience teaches us that we can expect severe flooding in certain places almost every winter.  In those circumstances it is highly important that intervention be rapid and effective.  It must operate at two levels.  The first is possibly not directly within the scope of the Bill &mdash; although it is related to it &mdash; and it is the degree to which people who are seriously affected can be helped and supported by the local authority and the <Col N="703" /> Government when the incident happens. This must be the greater priority. Where people are displaced from their homes and where their homes are flooded, the initial concentration must be on relieving their suffering and rendering whatever assistance can be put in place.</P>
    <P>As a secondary consideration, and one which is urgent, but less urgent than the first, action must be taken to ensure that the flooding can be avoided in future if that can be effected by a drainage scheme or by other action, which is what the Bill proposes.  It is important that we have the capacity to respond quickly and effectively.  In trying to avoid future flooding and deal with the flooding that has taken place, the Bill goes some way towards producing a more rapid response, one that is tied up in less bureaucracy and allows for intervention.</P>
    <P>However, we should have passed the time when the Minister for Agriculture, like Captain Bligh, sailed through the flood waters of Gort and gave assurances as to how the people would be attended to and protected.  The budget contained provisions to alleviate some of the suffering, but these should not be represented as a panacea for all the ills. The terms of the proposals were narrow. One was in respect of the loss of livestock and the other was loss of fodder; no more than that.  However, what about the householders, those who were displaced from their homes and the damage to homes, property and businesses? Assistance must be provided in these instances, in addition to the farmers who had to endure the loss of their livestock and fodder.  What about their machinery and their homes?  It should not have been represented that the provisions contained in the budget were going to solve all problems, and photo opportunities on lakes of water in Gort do not do anybody any good.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>People have been forced to take rented accommodation.  What happens in those circumstances?  No officials have visited those homes to see for themselves the extent of the damage and what may done.  While the Office of Public Works has done valuable work over the years, some of the work undertaken brought huge environmental consequences. It is not right, as is the case in parts of south County Kildare, that we still have heaps of spoil lining the banks of the River Barrow or that there are mountains of spoil lining river banks in County Meath, or that we produced canals which devastated the fish life and some of the fauna around those rivers. I suspect those things were done out of good intention, by the lights of the time, but they had environmental consequences. That is the defect I see in the Bill.  It does not pay attention to the potential for environmental damage. We have to act speedily, on one hand, so the difficulty exists about not restraining the Office in terms of a quick response.  We must ensure, nevertheless, that the environmental consequences are not permanent.  That is the deficiency in the Bill.  I know that Senator Daly has an amendment down for Committee Stage, which I support, in terms of protection of fisheries etc. The Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht will be introducing the third plank of his platform on heritage, which involves wildlife.  How does that fit in with some of the proposals on arterial drainage?  There is the question of spoil and the final question &mdash; I support Senator McDonagh on this &mdash; of reimbursement of the county council for moneys which it must spend by virtue of having to intervene in a flood situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="705" /> In the good old days of the &ldquo;Minister for Snow&rdquo; Kildare County Council spent a large sum of money clearing the motorway around Naas and we are still waiting for the compensation.  I would hate to be the county council that carries out immediate work to alleviate flooding and then tries to recover its expenditure from central Government funds.  It must be said that if local government were properly funded it would not have to seek to recover funds from central Government.</P>
    <P>There are a number of minor points I would like to raise which I will return to on Committee Stage.  In section 11 (1) (a) (ii) of the Bill it says &ldquo;the compulsory substantial interference with any land&rdquo;.  What is substantial?  Would somebody please define what substantial means?  Section 12 (4) (a) states that &ldquo;in case all the land comprised in the vesting order is in the occupation of the same person, or persons, post a notice containing a copy of the order on or near the land&rdquo;.  Is there a specific legal definition of what &ldquo;near&rdquo; means?  Must we wait until the courts test that particular matter?  These are simply minor points.  I do not wish to be pedantic about them.  We will return to them on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Dardis for sharing time with me.  I welcome the Minister.  I welcome the Bill, even though I do not agree with it in its entirety.  There are many flaws in it.  I hope that the Minister, having heard contributions from all sides of the House, will consider some of the amendments which have been put down and perhaps come to a compromise in the best interests of the people we represent. I can see many flaws in the Bill. The Minister is not going far enough in certain quarters.  I suggest that he extend the authority of the Commission to undertake works without the necessity of preparing a scheme.  It is a major flaw that while a scheme is being prepared, a problem might evaporate in the <Col N="706" /> short term and reappear in the long term.  The scheme would then be lost and another one drawn up.  It is simply layers of bureaucracy and the Minister has not gone far enough in this regard.</P>
      <P>The problem of flooding did not arise in this country during last winter.  Flooding has been a fact for the duration of the country's history and the duration of our lives.  Floods are a regular occurrence in the part of the country I represent. During most winters we experience eight, ten or 15 storms.  In summer there can also be severe storms and major flooding.  I mentioned before that I was a small shareholder, with the bank, in a public house.  One morning, in the busiest part of the year, I opened the back door of the premises and four feet of water flowed through and out the front door.  The place had to be closed down at one of the busiest times in the year.  That happened years ago, as the result of a flash flood.  This is the norm in the area I represent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to mention something already referred to by other speakers and that is the level of compensation. While much huffing and puffing was made about £2 million being made available for fodder throughout the country, no compensation was paid. There was no mention of EU moneys. There is no mention of any money at all in this Bill for the people who have suffered.  I know of one particular family in my own area outside Ballybunion and the bridge that connected them to society was completely washed away. These people have to use planks of wood to enter and leave their homes, to go to work, to church and to the local towns.  Where will these people get compensation to replace this bridge?  There has been much talk about Galway.  I empathise with the people of Galway for the hardships they have endured, but several homes in the North Kerry constituency are still under water and the people have moved out.  People who were constructing homes, that were almost finished, will not now complete the work where mortgages have been drawn down by building societies.  I <Col N="707" /> would like to know what the future outcome will be for those people?</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister why he does not take power in section 6 of the Bill to enter into joint ventures with county councils, local farmers and others.  Is the power there to enter joint ventures with these people?  Has the Minister the power to do that rather than the Commission?  I would like clarification on this particular part of the Bill.  Much work can be done in that regard.  In the past much work was also done under the local improvement schemes on small drainage problems, whether they arose from bogs or headlands. While this was abolished some years ago, attempts have been made to have it reintroduced into the local improvement schemes.  There is room for the Minister to give extra funding to local authority members for local improvement schemes in their areas. That would alleviate many of the problems we now face.  The Minister mentioned the large arterial drainage schemes carried out in the past.  The two in my own area, on the Feale and Cashin, were quite successful.  Environmentalists are now worried about flora, fauna and wildlife.  I am worried about them also.  I am involved with many gun clubs in my county.  We try to preserve and breed wildlife, but we are worried about the damage the floods are doing to the flora and fauna.  It is the damage the floods are doing, not the amount that drainage work will do, which concerns me.  I am not particularly worried about the amount of damage done by drainage work, but it should be monitored. A flood can do much more damage to the country's wildlife.</P>
    <P>The Minister recently mentioned nine pilot schemes which would be undertaken. I did not see any mention of my area in this regard.  Perhaps he was not notified that County Kerry had floods in the same way that other counties had. Why were the nine places not identified in the Bill?  Was the Minister successful on his recent trip to Europe in obtaining any money from the European Commission <Col N="708" /> for the severe flooding problem we had in Ireland?  Does he envisage putting a programme to the European Union to try to get some compensation for the people who had their homes and property damaged?</P>
    <P>Does the Minister intend to get extra money for repairing the roads whose surfaces were washed away or to give any money to help repair private roads? These roads cannot be repaired unless people pay for it out of their own pockets or a local improvement scheme is established.  Does the Minister intend to give extra money to local authorities for the local improvement schemes to help the people who are severely disadvantaged by what has happened?</P>
    <P>The bridge in Ballybunion was washed away and that story was aired on the national airwaves on numerous occasions; Pat Kenny mentioned it on his programme too and it was brought before our county council.  The cost of replacing the bridge will be in the region of £15,000.  Nobody knows from where this money will come.  Until something is done, the planks will remain on this bridge and nobody will take any notice of them until they break some fine morning when people are going to mass.</P>
    <P>Will money be put in place to compensate these people?  Great damage was done to property in my constituency and these people can no longer get insurance.  This is a huge problem. Something will have to be done because our climate and the floods will not go away.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the Minister given more powers and a stronger voice in the Bill.  Would the Minister clarify section 6 because this concerns me the most?  I compliment the Minister on the speed with which he brought this Bill to the House.  I also compliment Senator Daly for initiating this debate; this Bill would not be here today had it not been for him.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister. This Bill has been long awaited.  The last Arterial Drainage Act was passed in 1945.  This Bill is eagerly awaited by communities whose property is regularly flooded.  The most recent prolonged spell of bad weather, with people being marooned and not being able to get to their homes, brought home to us the plight of families living in flooded areas.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to the Blackwater catchment area in County Cork.  We were advised that the arterial drainage scheme for that catchment area was No. 18 on the priority list.  Does such a list still exist or is priority given where a crisis arises?</P>
      <P>I particularly welcome the provision in the Bill which gives the Commissioners of Public Works the power to undertake drainage schemes to relieve localised flooding from rivers and other watercourses in addition to their existing powers to undertake the arterial drainage schemes in the entire catchment areas.  The Minister said &ldquo;It will, however, be a requirement that any scheme to relieve localised flooding must have regard to the possible effects of the proposed works throughout the entire river basin.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister refers to the Report of the Browne Drainage Commission of 1938-40, which said that &ldquo;all future arterial drainage operations should be conducted on the basis of comprehensive schemes embracing entire catchments and not otherwise.&rdquo;.  I am a little concerned about that statement.  Does it mean that, if a person puts forward a project to relieve flooding in a local area where it is has been proved that this can have a detrimental effect on the people living there and would not be a costly scheme, they would have to go through these criteria before it is approved?  I would be sceptical about this if we were talking about localised flooding; this has been mentioned by others as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="710" /> The Minister also said that &ldquo;The Commissioners of Public Works had been unable to undertake schemes to overcome the difficulties in these areas because the existing legislation limits them to the catchment approach.&rdquo;.  It is recognised that there is a problem in such areas and that this Bill will give effect to relieving that problem and the flooding in such areas.  The Minister also talks of the existing supplementary legislative provision, that is the Local Authorities (Works) Act, 1949, which provides a basis for the execution of localised works in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>I raised this issue in my area &mdash; we must be concerned about any flooding problems in our constituencies &mdash; and the reply was that the local authority could undertake this scheme under the 1949 Act.  Everybody knows that asking a local authority to undertake a scheme of that nature with the financial constraints under which local authorities work is not on.  I also welcome the repeal of section 15 of the Act, which I suppose is a relief to the local authority. However, I do not know to what extent because I am not familiar with that aspect.</P>
    <P>The Minister will no doubt be commended for bringing in this Bill, but to give effect to its provisions, the people who will be looking to this establishment for relief will require works to be urgently undertaken and to do that, finance must be provided.  I hope the Minister will consider that matter and provide the necessary finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimTownsend" hpid="Mr. Townsend Mr. Townsend">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Townsend</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Sherlock for sharing his time with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  I come from County Carlow which suffered from bad flooding on three occasions recently.  I cannot understand why it has taken 50 years to bring in an amendment to the 1945 Act; it baffles me.  It can be said without fear of contradiction that this Minister has done more by putting this mechanism in place than has been done by other Ministers in the previous 50 years so far as the flooding problem in Carlow is concerned.  We have talked <Col N="711" /> about this many times but this Minister has done something.</P>
    <P>I was also delighted that the Office of Public Works has identified Carlow as one of the nine high priority areas where relief works can be undertaken immediately.  This did not happen by accident.  It was brought about by submissions to the Department of the Environment and the Office of Public Works by Carlow County Council and Carlow UDC as a result of strong local public representation.</P>
    <P>Under the new legislation the Office of Public Works will have the power for the first time to deal with localised urban flooding.  This section, which is the main provision of the Bill, gets to the root of the problem as far as Carlow is concerned.  I am glad that work will be carried out in such a way that flooding will not be relieved in one town by transferring it to another.  In other words, flooding will not be relieved in Carlow town in such a manner as to cause flooding in Leighlinbridge, Bagenalstown, St. Mullins or Kilkenny.  In that context as well I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Office of Public Works and the craftsmen who work for the Office of Public Works on the fine work they have done in restoring the lock at Millford, County Carlow.  People in the area &mdash; and, I hope, a wider public &mdash; know that Millford is a place of great natural beauty and the work which has been carried out will add greatly to the amenities there.</P>
    <P>I am glad that in addition to its main objective, the Bill will rectify deficiencies in the original 1945 Act.  These relate to compensation for compulsory acquisition or interference with land during the course of drainage works, authorising the Office of Public Works to deal with unauthorised interference with drainage works and requiring the local authorities to make annual reports on their maintenance drainage districts available to the public for inspection. This is also welcome.  As I said previously. I come from an area which has <Col N="712" /> been affected by the flooding.  I am not worried about the niceties of the situation or about bureaucracy.  I ask Senators to pass this Bill as soon as possible.  We have waited and talked for 50 years about such a Bill.  The time for talk has passed.  Let us get on with the work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I wish his Bill well. This legislation has my broad support in so far as the main thrust of the Bill is to deal with localised flooding, a matter that I have spoken about many times.  I compliment the Minister for bringing it forward.  In his address to this House he acknowledged the contribution of the former Minister, Deputy Dempsey, and our colleague, Senator Daly, in their efforts to have this matter expedited.</P>
      <P>The spring of 1995 brought home to many people the severe hardship and trauma that extensive flooding can cause.  Over the years we have seen photographs and reports on television about serious flooding problems on the banks of the Shannon and the Suck and in other areas of the country.  On this occasion we were shown houses, towns, streets and whole stretches of countryside under massive amounts of floodwater. The extent of flooding on this occasion was brought home to everybody through television.  People did not know what could be done to relieve this serious situation.  The Bill being initiated in Seanad Éireann today allows the Office of Public Works to initiate small <i>ad hoc</i> drainage programmes where there is a serious flooding problem which can be alleviated without involvement of a scheme for a whole catchment area.  That is a very important step.  I compliment all those who have come forward with that proposal to address this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had an extensive debate in the Seanad on flooding some weeks ago.  At that time many of us outlined the problems as we saw them and the difficulties being experienced by people in different parts of the country.  I addressed the problems experienced in County Rosin <Col N="713" /> common.  The Minister recently circulated a press release about the Bill and a list of priorities to be included in the first tranche of activities of the Office of Public Works under the new legislation. While I am sure there was relief and praise for the Minister in the nine areas mentioned &mdash; they are all deserving cases &mdash; people in my county were somewhat taken aback that Roscommon was not mentioned in the Minister's list of priorities.  They feel they were discriminated against, that their case was not properly evaluated and that the due entitlement of the people of County Roscommon was not recognised.</P>
    <P>When we had the debate here on flooding I outlined the reasons Roscommon is subject to flooding.  The county is hemmed in between the Shannon and Suck rivers.  During my time on the Consultative Council to the European Commission I spoke with many people about flooding in Roscommon and many surveys on flooding have been done.  It is known nationally and at European level that the consequences of 50,000 acres of Bord na Móna bogs being drained into the Shannon and the Suck over a period of 40 years has created a silt problem in both rivers.</P>
    <P>I explained as best I could to the Minister during the debate in this House that the maintenance of the River Shannon from Meelick Weir back to the town of Athlone and from Shannon Harbour back to Athleague was a priority.  I consider it to be the most important priority outside Gort in 1995. It is not accepted in the Minister's statement that hundreds of families have been cut off in the mid and south Roscommon area over the years.  This year many more were cut off than ever before.  I outlined in this House that a farmer of 80 odd acres had 60 odd acres under water; I was wrong.  He has 100 acres, of which 84 acres were under water.  I was not aware of the full situation at the time.  About one acre of this farmer's land is under water all the time. This is prime upland in a place called Dysart in County Roscommon.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="714" /> I do not say that we should take out some other area and add the county of Roscommon, but the Minister and his officials should look at the possibility of the maintenance of the Rivers Shannon and Suck.  The Shannon river is the responsibility of the Office of Public Works to a great extent.  No other body has any drainage responsibility in that area.  It is known by all the counties and local authorities that adjoin the Shannon that the maintenance of that river from Meelick Weir back to the town of Athlone would alleviate much of the flooding that takes place in the whole Clonown and south Roscommon area back to Athlone.  I understand also from my colleagues across the Shannon that it would be very helpful to them as well. With a certain amount of maintenance, without any removal of rock but with the removal of silt, much of the flooding in that area could be alleviated.</P>
    <P>The river on the other side is the River Suck.  It is generally thought that the River Suck Drainage Board has responsibility for this river, but the first nine miles are that of the Office of Public Works.  It is only at the town of Ballinasloe, nine miles from the mouth of the river, that the River Suck Drainage Board comes into play.  There is limited maintenance of the River Suck from Ballinasloe to Athleague to Castlerea, but none on the first nine miles.</P>
    <P>In this area there is a major commercial industrial development, that is, the excavation and processing of 50,000 acres of peatlands.  The two rivers must accept all the silt from that development, although not one shovelful has been taken out of either for 30 or 40 years.  I admit that one fold was removed somewhere between Ballinasloe and the mouth of the Shannon for navigational purposes a few years ago. The Minister and his officials should look again at that situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister should visit the north western part of the county &mdash; the Castleplunket, Castlerea, Bushfield and Brackloon area and other areas, including Dysart and Curaboy.  The flooding which people in County Roscommon <Col N="715" /> have experienced over the years merits the inclusion of the county for works under the priority list.  I will emphasise that again on Committee Stage and I ask the Minister to look again at this matter.  I understand a statement was made that surveys had not been carried out.  However, the Rivers Suck and Shannon have been surveyed many times.  There is a Shannon forum and a Suck Drainage Board and there is also an Office of Public Works report on the River Suck from the Shannon Harbour to Ballinasloe.  There is enough paper work as regards those rivers.  I hope the Minister will look at that situation in the near future.</P>
    <P>As regards third parties and their involvement in joint ventures or drainage works, does the Minister envisage that a body such as the River Suck Drainage Board would have the opportunity for a joint venture for the maintenance of that river?  If that is the case, I do not see a problem getting the minimum maintenance of the River Suck over a period of years which would result in a reasonable flow of the river.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to water courses or parts of water courses.  The River Shannon is the main artery of water through the west midlands area. While there is an excellent flow in most parts of the river, there are pockets where clogging occurs.  That has happened as a result of the work of Bord na Móna and the natural build up of silt caused by land drainage.  Will the Minister identify problem areas along the section of the River Shannon between Meelick and Athlone?  Further up the Shannon at Ballyleague in the Strokestown area there is a problem.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill the Minister could do something positive about drainage in County Roscommon.  He might save his colleagues in Government a lot of money in this regard.  Applications for millions of pounds have been made to the Department of the Environment to raise roads to alleviate the problem where people cannot get to their villages, homes and farms.  Is the local <Col N="716" /> authority allowed to be involved in this scheme?  Can the local authority identify a problem on the basis of access as well as the relief of drainage?  These problems are interlinked and the involvement of local authorities with the Office of Public Works would be important.</P>
    <P>The issue of compensation was referred to by my colleague.  Senator Daly, when we had a debate on flooding and again today.  The Minister and his officials should look at this matter again.  People cannot get insurance in certain circumstances.  I believe compensation on a statutory basis is essential. However, we do not want to open the floodgates &mdash; excuse the pun &mdash; by allowing people to believe that the public purse is open at all times.  What people have experienced this year cannot be allowed to happen again.  The issue of compensation should be looked at.</P>
    <P>My party will submit amendments on a number of technical points in the Bill, which I hope we can tease out.  The Minister has responded to a public demand by introducing this Bill and I compliment him on that.  By and large, he will have my support.  I ask the Minister not to allow this matter to be clogged up by bureaucracy further down the road.</P>
    <P>Drainage is an emotive issue.  Even where local authorities are responsible for drainage, there can be an &ldquo;I'm all right Jack&rdquo; attitude, and co-operation and understanding of the other man's position can be cast aside.  When the Office of Public works is dealing with drainage in an area I hope there will be public debate.  If this happens the public will support efforts being made.  Often when public works are considered or initiated, fear caused by a lack of information and communication causes people to put up barriers.  When this Bill is being implemented the public must be made aware, through the local authorities or otherwise, of what it is about.</P>
    <P>The Bill has a lot to offer and will improve the situation in rural areas.  I understand that it also provides for problems in urban areas.  The Bill has <Col N="717" /> great potential and it will have a positive effect.  Roscommon County Council met yesterday and sent a resolution to the Minister in this regard.  The people from County Roscommon, who have suffered greatly from industrial waste in the rivers and from a lack of jobs, feel aggrieved that no one has responded favourably to their problem.  The number of people employed by Bord na Móna is one-third what it was four or five years ago.  Job opportunities are not as plentiful as they were and neither the local authority nor the local community can change this.  Perhaps the Minister could ask his officials to consider removing the silt in the rivers.  I am not talking about removing rock formations in the River Shannon or the River Suck but about their maintenance to allow a better flow of water.  This would help to alleviate some of the other problems in the county.</P>
    <P>I welcome the thrust of the Bill, although my party will table amendments. The House and the public welcome the opportunity to consider the Bill's benefits.</P>

      <P>I join with other speakers in welcoming the Minister to the House.  While people may disagree with certain points and criticise different aspects of the Bill, everyone must agree that it is a great achievement to bring this Bill before the House when the Minister has been in office such a short time.  The Minister is amending the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, the Arterial Drainage (Amendment) Act, 1955, the Companies Act, 1963, the Land Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, and the Registration of Title Act, 1964. I congratulate the Minister and his officials in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to pay tribute to Senator Daly because he introduced an excellent Bill. The Minister also paid tribute to his predecessor, Deputy Dempsey, who had undertaken work in this area.  The Minister came to the Department at a time when the country had just seen some of the worst flooding in living memory.  He did not start with a baptism of fire but <Col N="718" /> a baptism of water and he responded to the crisis.</P>
    <P>The main thrust of the Bill is to carry out works to relieve localised flooding in urban and rural areas.  The Department and the Office of Public Works should be able to carry out improvement works in local urban and rural areas where houses have been continually flooded and prevent damage being caused to homes, businesses and livelihoods. This Bill ensures that the Minister will be able to act in time if people risk losing their homes and lives as a result of flash flooding which recurs each year.  The Minister and his Department will also undertake other major schemes.  The main thrust of the Bill is to relieve localised flooding.</P>
    <P>I live in County Offaly and I watched with interest the television coverage of the areas affected by flooding, including Carlow and Galway.  The Minister and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, were present on many occasions.  While the flooding in County Offaly was not as bad as that in Gort or in parts of Carlow, we also suffered considerable losses and I will mention some of the areas worst affected.  I understand from Offaly County Council and Laois County Council that proposals have been submitted to the Department.  Perhaps the Minister could confirm if he has received them and if he will be able to rectify some of the problems in these two counties.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have received a proposal for Moneygall.  Army Hill in Moneygall lies along the national primary road and many of the local authority houses on it were damaged by the flooding.  The water swept further down the village and other houses were also damaged.  Perhaps the Minister, in co-operation with Offaly County Council, could try to relieve this situation.  I am confident he will get support from the county council.</P>
    <P>Kinnitty lies at the bottom of the Slieve Bloom mountains and it, as well as Cadamstown and Clonaslee, were flooded.  It was dangerous to travel the <Col N="719" /> roads in that area because one was in danger of being swept off them.  The culvert in the main street in Kinnitty was completely blocked and it was lucky that no one was killed.  A licensed premises in the village was destroyed.</P>
    <P>This problem also occurred in Kilcormac. Flooding originated in lands at the rear of Kilcormac and no drainage was able to cope with it.  Flooding has occurred in Kinnitty and Moneygall on a number of occasions.  I visited houses in these areas and saw the serious damage the people suffered.  It is essential that this does not recur.  The main street in Ballycumber was damaged by flooding. In Geashill, outside Tullamore, there has been regular flooding over the years.  This year it was particularly bad and four houses were very badly flooded.  Mountmellick road on the way into Geashill and the area near the high wall in Geashill, across from the main street, were affected.  There was a massive amount of water there and houses were very badly flooded.  Mill Road in Geashill was swept away.  The proposed schemes could encompass this area and allow improvements to be carried out.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear Senator Finneran mention Shannon Harbour.  Across the harbour, the areas of Banagher, Lusmagh, Shannonbridge and Doon were badly flooded.  A person on the hill of Banagher might as well have been looking out to the sea from Dún Laoghaire because the Shannon was so high at the time.  This Bill is more geared towards smaller schemes.  I do not think money will be available to carry out major work on the Shannon.  Because of the continuing flooding problems experienced in this area it is essential that the Minister endeavours to allocate at some future date a sizeable amount of funding to see how flooding there can be relieved.</P>
    <P>Kennedy's Cross is just outside Birr. I hope to show it to the Minister in the near future.  The local authority has had to spend over £150,000 there since the flooding occurred to ensure that the national secondary road was clear for <Col N="720" /> traffic.  There was a diversion of traffic on this road.  Families were totally cut off.  One person had to leave her house, which is so badly damaged that she has been unable to return to it.  Other family members could not travel to and from school.  They even had difficulty driving their tractor in and out because the flooding was so high and was like an artificial lake.  The extent of the flooding problem in Kennedy's Cross will have to be carefully examined by the Minister in the not too distant future.  The top experts in the Minister's Department should come to the area and examine it in co-operation with Offaly County Council to see how the problem there can be relieved.  Flooding will be a continuing major problem on the national secondary road and the lives of families will be ruined because of it.</P>
    <P>There was flooding in the Blueball/Mount Bolus area.  The Minister will be aware of this because the area has submitted a scheme.  Aghagurty Bridge, which is on the back road from Roscrea to Kinnitty, was totally swept away by flooding.  A number of other areas in Offaly were flooded, but I will not mention them.  They have submitted a scheme to alleviate the flooding, the total cost of which will be in excess of £1 million to implement.</P>
    <P>Houses in Bridge Street in Portlaoise were badly flooded and some people had to leave their homes.  Fortunately, the fire brigade was able to get there in time to pump out the houses.  Firemen were on active service there for a few days because the flooding was so bad. Bridge Street is lowlying.  Some of the residents there are elderly and the flooding caused them a great deal of distress, worry and concern.  A family had to be evacuated from its house in New Road, Portlaoise.  I ask the Minister to see what can be done about this.</P>
    <P>There was flooding in Mountmellick and a scheme for the area has been submitted to the Minister.  Part of Graiguecullen is in County Carlow and part of it is in County Laois.  County Carlow engineers may have submitted a scheme for the area to the Minister.  The streets <Col N="721" /> and roads there were flooded and homes were severely damaged.  I ask the Minister to see what can be done about this also.</P>
    <P>The Minister's Department has problems because some of the drainage which has been carried out has not been successful.  Artificial manure is being spread at such a level that it is causing excessive growth, and weeds in rivers and lakes are part of the problem.  Road widening is upsetting water courses and causing problems.  Afforestation and the cutting away of bogs are also contributing to the problem.</P>
    <P>In fairness to the Office of Public Works, when it has carried out drainage works it has tried to look after wildlife. It has brought about many improvements in the Lusmagh area and has done a great deal to protect wildlife there.  The Minister is to be congratulated on this.  He has been sensitive to fisheries in the carrying out of drainage works.  I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on it.  He is in office for only a few weeks and it is great to see him bringing such an important Bill, which has great relevance for many people, before the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister and thank him for initiating this Bill in the Seanad.  I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  Last winter there was flooding in many parts of the country, which was more severe and widespread and lasted longer than in any previous winter.  Some areas which were only marginally affected in the past suffered severely on this occasion. In several areas the flooding was the worst in living memory.  Homes were flooded and had to be abandoned. Houses and whole communities were isolated.  Farmers lost livestock and fodder, and young and old suffered hardship and inconvenience as a result of road closures, detours and traffic disruptions. Some business premises, particularly in rural areas, were severely affected.  Local authorities are faced with huge unforeseen bills because of the costs incurred in trying to deal with <Col N="722" /> some of the problems caused by the flooding.  Some of the roads which were used as detour routes were unsuitable for the additional traffic they had to carry and, as a consequence, suffered severe damage.</P>
      <P>I assume at this stage there are some statistics available on the extent and severity of the flooding and estimates of the damage and losses it caused.  My local authority carried out a survey of the main areas which were affected in County Roscommon.  I assume other local authorities did likewise.  Our county engineer prepared an estimate of the cost of repairing flood damage to roads in the county and an estimate of the cost of raising certain roads which were affected by the flooding.  I am sure that the Department of the Environment and the Minister's Department have received similar estimates from other local authorities.</P>

      <P>This debate on the state of the Irish newspaper industry is timely.  It is not an overstatement to say the industry is in crisis.  Leader writers have been speaking of doom and gloom for so long that the reaction of the public is similar to that in Aesop's fable when the child continually cried wolf. However, if we in Ireland are to continue to enjoy a free press uncluttered by economic pitfalls on one hand and litigious citizens on the other it is time for someone to act and the body which should act is the Government.  In facing that claim the Government's response will be that whenever people have a problem they want the Government to bail them out.  However there is a responsibility on a Government of whatever hue to take whatever steps are necessary to protect a free press in this democratic society.</P>
      <P>We are concerned here with the continued existence and viability of the printed media.  The Irish Press Group is in severe financial difficulties; <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> is being propped up by one of its major competitors and <i>The Irish Times</i> finds it difficult to continue to publish viably and economically because of harsh VAT rates and the libel laws.</P>
      <P>I must state a vested interest; I have been a member of the National Union of Journalists for 20 years and continue to earn my living outside this House as a journalist in the broadcasting and print media.  My comments are obviously tempered with a bias in favour of the media, particularly the newspaper industry.  I cut my teeth in journalism on the local newspaper, <i>The Leitrim Observer.</i>  My late father was a stringer for the local and national media from the mid-1940s until his death.  I grew up in a house where a typewriter and a telephone were as common&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The telephone and the typewriter were as common in my house in the 1950s as televisions and tape recorders today.  I will not say I was born with ink in my veins, but I have had a lifelong love of reading.  My daily reading diet would be predominantly the newspapers of the day and, like many of my colleagues, I would spend many hours at the weekends perusing the Sunday newspapers.</P>
      <P>I want to convey the sense of shock and horror felt in the newspaper industry at recent events.  The speed of change is so great that much of what is happening to our newspapers is lost on the general public.  The information superhighway is upon us.  There is a general decline in the readership of newspapers around the world.  Newspaper proprietors are selling out increasingly to large conglomerates.</P>
      <P>In Ireland we have been shielded to an extent from much that has been happening, particularly in America, Australia, the Middle East and the UK, where the name Murdoch stalks the land.  We might say that in Ireland O'Reilly stalks the land, but I do not wish to indulge in a witchhunt against anybody.  I admire Tony O'Reilly, or as his newspapers prefer to call him, Dr. A. J.F. O'Reilly.  He has been a successful entrepreneur and a proud ambassador for this country in his chosen field. However, I am concerned at the growing power structure of the newspapers under his control.  At present he is propping up <i>The Sunday Tribune</i>; his company has also invested money in the Irish Press Group and the suggestion is that this group would not last without it.  The political editor of <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>, Emily O'Reilly, a former employee of the <i>Irish Press</i>, wrote in her column last Sunday:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Press titles represent a failed commercial and editorial enterprise. Anyone with a huge commercial investment in another national newspaper group [the Independent <Col N="725" /> Group] is unlikely ever to rebuild that enterprise to the point where it would seriously compete with the &lsquo;parent&rsquo; group.</P>
    <P>She went on to say:</P>
    <P>The case of <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> is an instructive example.  Had it chosen to, the Independent could have brought its commendable commercial and other skills to <i>The Sunday Tribune.</i> It obviously chose not to, and the Tribune continues to limp along, offering no significant threat to the <i>Sunday Independent's</i> dominance but neatly blocking off the &lsquo;upmarket&rsquo; threat posed by <i>The Sunday Times</i>&mdash; something of considerable commercial importance to O'Reilly.  The scenario for the Press group would hardly be any different....  The fundamental principle of media success &mdash; that people will read newspapers that interest and entertain them &mdash; obviously escaped the Press management, but it is the &lsquo;philosophy&rsquo; that underpins the Independent Group. One might hate the <i>Sunday Independent</i> brand of vitriolic, polemical and at times repellent journalism, but the bottom line is that it produces an editorial package that is commercially successful and Tony O'Reilly does not have to put a gun to anyone's head to buy it.</P>
    <P>She continued, and this is the nub of the issue:</P>
    <P>...if politicians want truly diverse media, if they want a successful mass market newspaper or newspapers that challenge the <i>Sunday Independent</i> style and ideology by providing a viable commercial alternative, then the Minister has a duty to challenge the Independent's grasp on the Press and create an environment where an alternative publication might flourish.</P>
    <P>This message seems to come across in all comment about the current state of the Press Group and the newspaper industry: there is a need for the Minister to intervene in some way.  The lobby <Col N="726" /> group which represents the provincial newspapers, which has carried out a letter writing campaign to members of the Oireachtas, quotes elements of the Colin McIver study on the Irish print and paper industry launched in 1994.  It makes the point that the survey revealed that newspaper profits fell on average by just over 50 per cent between 1987 and 1992 and that the trend is consistent across the industry; that profits have fallen so low in some areas that the ability of firms to re-equip is threatened; that cable TV monopolies and concerns are moving quickly to have advertising placed on satellite television channels which they distribute.</P>
    <P>The two matters that seem to concentrate the minds of newspaper proprietors are the high level of VAT and the obstructive nature of our libel laws. I am sure the Minister will address these issues.  I want to convey a sense of urgency that something has to be done to protect us in a free democratic society.</P>
    <P>I am perhaps treading on political eggshells, but I have often felt the existence in broadcasting of a monopoly such as RTÉ has not been as conducive to free debate in a democratic society as might ideally be the case.  If we had but one newspaper with one editorial policy, one message being propagated on a daily and weekly basis, and considering the influence that newspaper would have, the Government would quickly take action.  In broadcasting that had been the case until 12 to 18 months ago. There is now an alternative news network in operation, albeit in an embryonic state.  The Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht is examining the issue of news and news dispersal through the broadcast media in the Green Paper on Broadcasting.</P>
    <P>I cite the example of RTÉ as a State monopoly at national level to illustrate my point.  While it has been accepted and has been seen to be fair and impartial in its news dispersal, primarily because it was set up by an Act of the Oireachtas, there are no controls in the commercial sector for the printed <Col N="727" /> media.  It would be a serious development if any one individual or group was to control totally the newspaper industry.</P>
    <P>I am not offering the solutions to the problems that exist.  Unless the Government takes action in the areas identified by the printed media, I fear for the future of the media.  It would not be dramatic to suggest that in the next year or two we could have two or three titles but just one owner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this issue. It is of enormous importance in a democratic society that we have a viable and vibrant newspaper industry.  As many people as possible should participate in the current debate on the newspaper industry.</P>
      <P>The last 20 years has been a period in which we have seen a gradual fall off in the sales of daily newspapers.  The contrast within the different sectors is startling. The sales of daily newspapers are still growing &mdash; they grew by 16 per cent in the last 20 years &mdash; but by contrast sales of Sunday newspapers have fallen by 23 per cent and the sales of evening newspapers have fallen by almost half. The big new factor of growth in the daily sales has been the growth of tabloids, and they have been predominantly British.  Looking at the contrast between British and Irish sales, we see a situation where British sales have grown in the 20 year period by about 40 per cent and sales of Irish titles have fallen by about 20 per cent.  The British sales seem to be driven by taste, if you like, on one side where there has been a big expansion in the sales of daily tabloids accompanied by a big expansion in the sales of Sunday quality papers. These are the areas where British titles have increased.  In other areas they have not shown any significant deviation from the overall market trends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other feature that has been driving these patterns is the cost factor. Having taken account of inflation, the <Col N="728" /> real price of an Irish newspaper has almost doubled in the last 20 years. There is no doubt but that has affected sales.  That real price increase has been double the rate of British newspapers, so not only are British newspapers entering the market at a lower price but they have also increasingly been getting cost advantage in the marketplace over a long period.</P>
    <P>Within Irish sales there have also been significant changes occurring in the last 20 years.  The Irish Independent Group has increased its share of Irish newspaper titles from 45 per cent to 55 per cent.  <i>The Irish Times</i> has also increased its share from 8 to 13.5 per cent.  <i>The Cork Examiner</i> has largely been stable, but the big casualty has been the <i>Irish Press</i>, which suffered a huge decline in its market share.  The share held by the <i>Irish Press</i> has halved, from 35 per cent of the market 20 years ago to 17 per cent today.</P>
    <P>These broad facts give a sense of background to what is happening in the industry.  These trends have given rise to a number of concerns about fairness of competition in the industry.  They have been the subject of the study by the Competition Authority, and I will come back to its conclusions.  The key issues they were asked, and have examined, are: was there unfair price competition from British sales, involving them in predatory pricing; were there unfair alliances between large players in the market and new companies, or unfair competitive practices and dominance? These were the issues the Competition Authority investigated against the background of those changes that have been occurring.</P>
    <P>Everyone knows and recognises the special role of the newspaper industry. It is not like the market for cans of beans.  It has a special significance.  It plays a vital role in covering issues important to democratic debate, and we can all agree on what we want.  We can agree we want to provide stable employment, diversity of choice to the consumer, allow expression for the various points of view that make up a plural <Col N="729" /> society, preserve quality and cultural expression and balance the right of privacy with the right of the public to know. However, the much more difficult question is to decide what is the appropriate role for the State in achieving all of these desirable features we would like to see in our newspaper industry. Important questions arise, particularly in the context of the special nature of the industry, like can there be diversity with single or heavily concentrated ownership.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  There are issues of concentration of ownership and also indigenous ownership.  Does preserving social and cultural identity mean we must keep out non-national entrants into the newspaper industry? Does that sit with our obligations undertaken under EU and other treaties as to freedom of establishment?  These are important questions that have to be assessed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What do we mean by diversity and plurality in the media?  Some of the debates in the last number of weeks since this debate has started have concentrated on the quality of what is provided to readers.  It suggests a sort of public health argument, that perhaps the Government should have a role in ensuring the public reads only good, healthy, wholesome things in the newspapers. That clearly begs the question as to whether the State can ever have that sort of role.  In the past, there is no doubt that censorship was a powerful instrument used by the State to regulate the newspaper industry.  I do not think <Col N="730" /> anyone wants us to turn the clock hack to a situation where the State tries to decides what constitutes good journalism, the quality of debate or the coverage of important issues.  There are issues that need to be assessed.  How does the promotion of quality sit with freedom of the press and has the State a role in this area at all?</P>
    <P>The other aspect, of course, is purely a competition one.  Is what the consumer pays for the only issue that should govern what happens in the marketplace, or are there wider issues? Allied to that is the question of whether the competition law, which deals with plurality and diversity in a certain way &mdash; in the market sense it deals with issues of concentration and merger and takeover &mdash; is adequate to deal with the issues that arise in a newspaper industry, which we all recognise is different. Are the tools of competition analysis and the policy instruments of competition adequate to deal with the newspaper industry and its future development?</P>
    <P>I would like to say a few words about the competitive challenges the industry faces.  Senator Mooney mentioned the FÁS Mclvor study and it is timely to look at some of the findings of that study.  They put forward the challenges facing the industry in a stark way.  One of their key methods was to take a ten year perspective, looking ahead at what is going to happen in the newspaper industry according as the industry would adopt different strategies.  I took note of some of these.  A strategy of stagnation would produce a 34 per cent decline in employment.  A strategy of continuing on the way we are going would produce a 24 per cent decline in employment; and even a radical strategy, a reformist and progressive strategy, would see a 13 per cent decline in employment.</P>
    <P>In any scenario, this is an industry that is facing serious pressures.  The significant thing in that study was the difference between facing up to that challenge with a radical and progressive strategy, or stagnation, waiting for it to burst upon us, amounted to 21 per cent <Col N="731" /> of employment in the sector, or 900 jobs if it was put in terms of jobs.  In the challenge of gearing up to the competitiveness difficulties in this industry the stakes are large and there are huge problems there that we must adjust to. Not least of these is the simple cost competitiveness of our industry; but there are also many other issues, including the increasing erosion from crossmedia competition, which Senator Mooney referred to.  Newspapers are no longer working in a vacuum.  They are impacted upon by the growth of the broadcasting media, the increasing use of electronic media as a way of conveying and accessing information and many people are now experimenting with a sort of situation where there will be no copy at all.  People will draw down stories onto their PCs.</P>
    <P>It is instructive, in looking at the debate we are conducting on concentration of ownership, to examine similar debates that are raging in the US and other countries about concentration of ownership.  The situation in the USA is quite significant.  From a situation where there was diversity and many newspapers, now there are few US cities with more than one morning and evening paper and most of them have only one publisher in each city.  There is a growing concentration of chains across the US and this is giving rise to considerable concern about concentration of ownership. I suppose in one sense these US cities are far larger in population than the whole of Ireland, but on the other hand we are a nation state.  The issue we must face up to is: are these trends of concentration inevitable or desirable and what can we do about them?  The other critical issue for the industry is cost competitiveness.  Many people will recognise that the printing and publishing of newspapers can now be done much more cheaply elsewhere.  We face significant disadvantages in the cost of newspaper production and that is certainly a challenge for us.</P>
    <P>I am throwing out some of the questions we must pose.  There is an ongoing <Col N="732" /> debate about the sort of legislation we need to ensure fair competition.  The control of mergers and takeovers is an important issue.  The questions which must be asked are: what are the proper bounds of control and by whom and how should they be exercised?  One view of competition is the need to create national champions with the capacity and sheer strength to stride the globe.  The other view is that concentration of ownership and market agreements in Ireland mean that huge economic rents are extracted from consumers and this is holding back economic progress.  There is no doubt that historically this country has a weak track record in competition and the pursuance of an effective competition policy. This is put into sharp focus by the minority report which points out strongly that failure to initiate proceedings and tackle the Independent group's position in relation to the <i>Irish Press</i> would seriously undermine the effectiveness and credibility of the Competition Act.  That is another point of view we have to assess.</P>
    <P>The decision of the Competition Authority is at the forefront of our discussions. It decided on two important issues.  On the issue of predatory pricing, it said quite unequivocally that in its view predatory pricing was not being practised by British newspapers in the Irish market.  While they may have been engaged in keen competition, it was not predatory pricing within the strict definition of that word.  The other finding was that the purchase by Independent Newspapers of a 24.9 per cent share in the <i>Irish Press</i> and the issuing of a loan of £2 million to the <i>Irish Press</i> was contrary to section 5 of the Competition Act which deals with abuse of a dominant position and section 4 which deals with anti-competitive agreements. It went on to say that it was of the opinion that I, as Minister, should take action in the courts to deal with this issue.</P>
    <P>That is the background to the debate and I hope those comments will help. Since I received the Competition Authority's <Col N="733" /> report, I have tried to have discussions with the key newspaper interests.  Last week I held a forum attended by experts in the field.  Opposition spokesmen, the newspaper industry and the journalists and many of the issues were addressed successfully.  I intend to take a decision in early June. As Senator Mooney pointed out, there is a slight irony about the current debate on newspaper and television.  On one side there is growing concern that, as the television monopolies break up with the arrival of private industry, standards will decline.  On the other side concentration in the newspaper industry is cause for concern.  The strange dilemma in what we want to achieve in these different media was pointed out at the forum by Colm Kenny.</P>
    <P>I welcome this debate and I look forward to the contributions from many Senators who will have studied the issue.  I am sure I will benefit from their deliberations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on the report. It would be impossible to do it justice in the time available.  It will certainly be a catalyst for important discussion on this issue and it furnishes us with the facts. Few of us have not offered a comment on this debate over the last number of months.  The more I have looked into it, the less I seem to know about it.  I wish to make some general comments rather than homing in on the specifics.</P>
      <P>I have certain concerns.  I am well aware of the reason the sales of evening newspapers have dropped.  They have dropped because of some changes in television programming but also because a newspaper such as the London daily <i>The Independent</i> is exactly the same price as the <i>Evening Herald</i> or <i>Evening Press.</i>  People make a choice in the late evening depending on whether they want value for money or something to read and there is certainly a problem in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>VAT does not seem to have been dealt with in the final recommendations and conclusions of the report and I <Col N="734" /> regret that.  I note the proposal of <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> and related proposals from the NUJ that there should be a clear approach to the costing of newspapers. I do not fully agree with their proposal that newspapers should be sold at the same cover price as in the UK and I do not think it would make a huge difference either way.  I do not understand the point they make in that area but the 12.5 per cent VAT difference as well as the technological, production and publication processes are tied in with economies of scale in the larger newspapers in the UK and this certainly makes it difficult for the Irish newspaper publishers to compete with them.</P>
    <P>In the history of this State, and indeed of this country, newspapers have always been used to influence.  In this century alone, the <i>Freeman's Journal</i> and <i>Scéala Éireann/Irish Press</i> have had particular influences on Irish life.  They responded to particular needs and were really propaganda organs for many people.  I do not say that in any derogatory way; they were tools of their time.  I do not wish to home in on the O'Reillys and others because it does not really matter whether we talk about the O'Reillys or the Murdochs.  If a newspaper was to be owned by one group to reflect the editorial policy of one group or respond to the whims of one group, it would be doing a disservice to the nation.  That is one point on which we can all agree but breaking away from that is difficult.</P>
    <P>I cannot go into the difference between dominance and influence but I can see its impact on journalism.  In recent days I heard a story &mdash; it may be untrue &mdash; that one Irish daily newspaper is considering reducing the starting salary of journalists to £7,000 or £8,000. There are people who would say that reflects market forces.  However, if the bottom falls out of the wages and salaries being paid to people who are to provide the quality of the content of these publications, we will suffer every bit as much as we would if one dominant force influenced all editorial policy.  We need to look at it from both sides.  That point was not developed in the NUJ presentation <Col N="735" /> but it certainly concerns readers of the newspaper.</P>
    <P>We have a long tradition in this country of journalists of high quality and standards, many of whom have in their own way become institutions.  They have replaced the Victorian essay writers and brought influence to bear on discussion. This is very important and needs to be continued.  This is evident from the current debate on this area.</P>
    <P>It does not matter whether one agrees with the comments made by Vincent Browne and John Waters; they have raised issues and their columns have served as catalysts for discussion.  They have raised worrying issues particularly those points in which they, and particularly Vincent Browne, try to make a connection between dominance and influence in one Sunday newspaper. How can we control that?  I do not know that it can ever be controlled satisfactorily without resorting to what will be seen as censorship by people who believe that free market forces mean that there should be organs of free expression.  The problem of how to reconcile the two is impossible for me to comprehend.  I do not see how it can be done.</P>
    <P>What if it reached the nightmare scenario and there was only one dominant newspaper group?  One commentator said that he would prefer to see the Irish Press Group of newspapers go to the wall rather than see it in the control of a particular person.  Let us suppose that happened.  What would be the next step?  People would become dissatisfied with that single editorial view, influence and commentary and another newspaper or organ would be founded in opposition to it.  That is the theoretical approach.  Obviously, it would be irresponsible of a Government and of the Minister to stand back and let that nightmare scenario develop and hope that the phoenix of a new newspaper would rise from the ashes.  That means there must be a hands-on approach.  I believe the Minister must take the line he has indicated.  He must take an <Col N="736" /> interest in who owns what portions of what newspapers.  Controls must be implemented and the reader must be assured of that.</P>
    <P>We must work our way through the hysteria that has developed around certain personalities who own newspapers. I have criticised the Murdochs and the O'Reillys of this world many times.  I do not consider them to be great employers or entrepreneurs.  They have mainly exploited people as they progressed.  I would not like to see either of them own Irish Sunday newspapers.  However, take them out and we must admit that the same worry would remain regardless of the person who would replace them.</P>
    <P>If that is not what we want, how do we control it?  The only way is through the competition laws.  The interventionist policy being indicated by the Minister must be the only approach.  It will be difficult.  I would find it difficult as a Minister to make a decision in that area. I would consider it to be interference, perhaps, with editorial control which is a response to people indicating their newspaper preferences by buying those newspapers.  If people buy certain newspapers they are indicating what they want.  If that is all that is left to the rest of us, obviously that monopolistic control and single voice is not answerable, accountable or competitive and therefore we will need to create some form of competition.  It is better to do that now rather than when newspapers go to the wall.</P>
    <P>The recent proposal to have one print facility in the Dublin area with a staff of 50 people which would print every daily, evening and Sunday newspaper is an extraordinary vision of where the newspaper industry is going.  That, at a stroke, would create close to 2,000 redundancies.  I understand that up to 500 people are working in the print area in one newspaper group alone.  The idea that new technology can now print every newspaper with 50 staff demonstrates how things will inevitably and inexorably go.  We must bear that in mind also.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="737" /> There are three pressures involved: editorial control, the need to retain competition for the sake of choice and the fact that technology will take over one way or another.  As far as I know we do not have newspapers published in Ireland by remote.  However, many newspapers including <i>The European</i> and the American newspaper, <i>The Herald Tribune</i>, are published by remote, that is, they are put together in one part of the world and published in another.  I understand that the <i>Financial Times</i> is published in the same way.  It is only a matter of time before something similar is done here.  We will lose many staff to those industries over the coming years. That will happen with or without our intervention.</P>
    <P>An interventionist policy becomes essential.  It is the Minister's responsibility to ensure that there is choice, that there is editorial diversity and variety of access to different editorial and personal views and that there is a place where all views will receive a response. This is a growth area in the United States.  I read recently that the fastest growing newspaper on the east coast of the US has all the modern technology and can compile and publish each issue very quickly with low numbers of staff.</P>
    <P>There is also a development in some European and American newspapers where they attempt to cover all news stories.  One of the problems people have seen in Irish newspapers in recent times is that all news stories are not covered.  Stories are cut out and there is more comment than news.  There is not enough space for news and that is a cause of concern for many groups, particularly small groups who have a point of view to put forward and who can add to a debate on general issues.  It is important that there is space for such groups.  However, the &ldquo;Drop the Dead Donkey&rdquo; syndrome of certain stories and people not being sufficiently important and being edited out means that a diversity of views is not coming through in normal news coverage.  Many changes must take place.  There is also a <Col N="738" /> challenge to journalists and newspaper owners to meet and deal with the challenge of new technology.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for making the report available.  I hope it will be a catalyst for discussion.  I also thank the Minister for raising the issue in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I also thank him for responding so readily to the invitation to come to the Seanad to hear the House discuss a matter of public interest in which a major decision must be taken.  In taking that decision, the Minister will need the wisdom of Solomon and more &mdash; probably some sort of divine efficacy &mdash; to achieve a solution which will please all those who are seeking something from him on this issue.</P>
      <P>The problem the Minister faces was summed up by a journalist who spoke at the Minister's forum.  He said that there was an enormous problem, that he did not have the answer to it and that it was the Minister's job to find the answer and to make it work.  To a certain extent, that theme has run as a subtext through all the speeches this evening &mdash; and I will not be an exception &mdash; in the sense that people recognise the nature of not just one problem but a series of problems.</P>
      <P>There has been an interesting debate over the past couple of weeks.  None of us is directly involved in the newspaper industry and, from the sidelines, we see a debate littered with many hidden agendas.  We see an enormous number of vested interests &mdash; some, but not all, of which are declared &mdash; and the debate has not been as open as people in the newspapers might expect of us if we were holding such a debate here.  We have also seen a fair amount of settling of old journalistic scores as old battles are fought again under the guise of seeking a solution to the problem.  We have seen all these elements in what has been for this society a useful and timely debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has been given a poisoned chalice.  No matter what decision <Col N="739" /> he makes he cannot win.  It is that kind of debate and the Minister will have to be brave, as I know he will.  He has handled the issue very well to date.  He has consulted widely, has remained calm, open and objective and has done everything he can to make the right decision.  However, when he announces a decision it will not be seen in this way by many of those involved.</P>
    <P>All of us considering this subject begin with certain agreed principles.  We all agree that we want a strong, healthy press and we all sincerely believe that it is vital for any democracy.  It is no accident that when freedom and democracy are threatened the first targets of any potential dictator will be the press, the trade unions and the free organs of expression.</P>
    <P>We want a press which, in the first instance, gives us the news.  We do not wish to be too pompous about this.  The first job of a newspaper is to give us as wide an objective coverage of news as possible.  We want newspapers which will reflect and mirror our society, which will investigate within the bounds of fairness and which will be a conduit for new ideas and new ways of looking at society.  We want a press which should not exclude sections of the population from having its views expressed or interests covered.  It does not matter if the press has strong views; as long as they are fair and there are rights of reply, the stronger the viewpoints the better.</P>
    <P>We also want diversity, and on this we need to know from where the newspapers are coming.  Have they a specific viewpoint?  We had no difficulty in this respect 35 years ago.  Everybody knew that <i>The Irish Times</i> represented a Protestant, liberal, urban viewpoint; the <i>Irish Independent</i> was middle Ireland &mdash; Catholic, middle, rural, business and farming; the <i>Irish Press</i> was Fianna Fáil &mdash; and unashamedly so &mdash; and a radical newspaper and <i>The Cork Examiner</i> was Cork &mdash; is any place more important? As it was, you paid your money and you knew what you were getting and where <Col N="740" /> the newspapers were coming from. There is often a degree of healthiness in knowing where a paper stands on certain issues and that it is not changing from week to week on a whim or, perhaps more important, that it is not buffeted by hidden commercial agendas.</P>
    <P>With regard to principles, I have a strong preference, which may be unfashionable in these days of the EU and international multi-media, that, as far as possible, Irish newspapers should be controlled by Irish people.  This is not absolute nor is it chauvinistic; however it reflects a view which is strongly held in many other countries.  There is nothing in that preference to be ashamed of.  It does not make me any less European or afraid of the wider world; I like to believe that my newspapers are owned and controlled by people who have a genuine stake in this country, who do not see it as a satellite to a major power or as simply a handy location where the circulation of newspapers can be topped up to make them more attractive to the advertising interests.  In this I am referring to the UK, because French and German papers will not have a wide circulation in this country.</P>
    <P>I would be worried about a situation where the people who own and run my newspapers are not answerable.  They are not people one will meet, who are accountable or about whom we will know something &mdash; where they are coming from, where we can get at them.  I make little apology for having a strong preference, if at all possible, for Irish ownership.  This does not mean that there cannot be foreign investment and some foreign newspapers, but I would like to see the market as predominantly Irish owned.  On this, I speak as one who unashamedly loves newspapers and who made my first honest money, a princely sum of ten shillings, as the Bagenalstown correspondent for the <i>Carlow Nationalist.</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I was ten years of age at the time, and the answer to the Senator's question is yes.</P>
      <P>There are some newspapers which we do not like.  For example, there are some Sunday newspapers I will not buy because I do not like to get annoyed on a Sunday; I have better things to do with my Sunday than paying £1 to be annoyed.  It is a right which I, as a consumer, have and to buy or not to buy a newspaper is one of the most fundamental rights we all have.  Nobody is forcing us to buy newspapers.  However, I believe we all value the richness, diversity and excitement which comes with our newspapers, including the variety of comment and also &mdash; we should not be too pompous about this &mdash; the sports coverage, the crosswords and the other parts that make up a newspaper.  There is a danger of thinking of newspapers solely in terms of politics, of ourselves, but there are a variety of other aspects to newspapers which commend them to people.</P>
      <P>When speaking of diversity I am referring to diversity of ownership, and this brings me to the nub of why we are here this evening, the immediate problem in the Irish Press Group.  We have before us the report of the Competition Authority.  The Minister can do a number of things.  He can accept the report of the authority in full, as he has been urged to do by a number of people, especially Deputy O'Malley.  However, speaking not as an expert, the immediate consequence of the implementation of the report &mdash; which would mean that the <i>Irish Independent</i> would have to withdraw from the <i>Irish Press</i> completely and the loan would have to be repaid &mdash; would be the end of the <i>Irish Press</i> as we know it.  The 600 jobs will be gone and the three titles may not survive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The <i>Irish Press</i> will be dead within weeks if the report of the Competition Authority is strictly implemented.  The <i>Irish Independent</i> has put the <i>Irish Press</i> on a life sustaining machine.  We do not have to look for motives &mdash; they are probably good and are made out of self-interest <Col N="742" />&mdash; but without the injection of money from the <i>Irish Independent</i>, the <i>Irish Press</i> would be dead in the water today.  There is no point fooling ourselves about this: it is an important fact in this debate and if the plug is pulled there will be little hope for the <i>Irish Press</i> as we know it.  If this happens, what follows?</P>
    <P>There are three possibilities.  First, nothing happens.  If the <i>Irish Independent</i> is forced to pull out, the <i>Irish Press</i> dies.  The view could be taken by hard headed accountants that there is no future, financial or commercial, for the titles of Irish Press Limited and they have no niche and no position.  This, sadly, is a possibility and it is one which faces any business which goes to the wall.  Let us not fool ourselves that it is not a very real possibility in the present debate.</P>
    <P>The second possibility is that some local consortium will try to take over the titles cheaply and restart the <i>Irish Press</i> or, more likely, organisations headed by Mr. Rupert Murdoch or Mr. Conrad Black will move in and buy up the existing titles.  Either way, the <i>Irish Press</i> as we know it is gone.  Under a native consortium or one headed by the Murdoch/Black people, the title will be bought cheaply, the staff will be hand picked, most of them will probably be let go and most of the remainder will be on contract.  It is also likely, although not necessary, that standards will drop. In the case of Murdoch and Black, their track record is not great in this respect. Neither lives here, neither cares anything about this country and each of them sees it simply as a top up to the circulation of their British newspapers. I do not see any great commitment, but I could be proved wrong; they could give us papers of the highest quality.</P>
    <P>However, the knock on effects of that on our existing newspapers will be huge. I cannot spell them out but I am told by people in the industry that the effect on the three existing major national newspaper groups will be huge and they may find themselves, largely because of economies of scale, competing with <Col N="743" /> multi-conglomerates, whereas they are small operations in a small country with all the advantages of lack of critical mass.  They may well find themselves greatly reduced in quantity, quality, staff and so on in order to compete at the same level and at the same price as other papers.</P>
    <P>The third possibility has been discussed in the industry.  It is one with which Independent Newspapers Limited would certainly run and to which &mdash; and I am speaking from what I hear &mdash;<i>The Irish Times</i> would not be opposed. It is that a consortium of Irish newspaper groups, all with a share of under 25 per cent, would take over the <i>Irish Press</i>, give it breathing space, appoint a new management and allow the operation to be restructured.  They would do this to protect their own interests, and to see if the <i>Irish Press</i>, under different management and restructured, could survive.  The group could perhaps establish a trust under a very distinguished person who would guarantee its integrity and independence.</P>
    <P>I want to make one further point about the issue raised by <i>The Irish Times</i> and knocked by the <i>Sunday Independent.</i> We need some overall national consideration of the newspaper/media industry.  <i>The Irish Times</i> raised this issue on Saturday and Monday.  The <i>Sunday Independent</i> knocked it on Sunday. On the basis of the argument so far, I would put the <i>Sunday Independent</i> high on rhetoric, not great on reason and <i>The Irish Times</i> dull, but perhaps more reasonable.  However, I am not correcting essays.  The basic issue is that there may be a need for a national media policy.  National policy does not mean Government or State control. National policy means that there should be a clear public policy on certain key issues.  We have stumbled into a situation where there are a range of issues about the media world which need to be dealt with.  Some of them are being tackled in a piecemeal way.  There is the question of defamation.  That needs to be tackled, not once and for all, but the <Col N="744" /> laws need to be modernised.  Clear definitions must be established in that area.</P>
    <P>There is the question of the principle of diversity.  Perhaps a public definition is needed of what is meant by diversity of ownership, principles to which we can all subscribe and which make it clear commercially what people can or cannot do.  There is the question of standards. It is extraordinary that people who are forever urging standards on us, standards of openness, accountability etc., themselves live in a world which is largely self-regulated.  There is no authority, apart from the laws of libel, to which we can go if we feel that we have been wrongly treated by a newspaper, other than recourse to the courts.  There is the question of subvention and the role of the State, which was mentioned by other speakers.  A number of calls were made by trade union leaders in particular that the State should get involved.  I would not like to move in that direction, but the State does subvent a paper at the present time.  <i>Anois</i> is perhaps one of the most heavily subsidised papers in the western world because we believe the Irish language should have an outlet through the media.  There may be circumstances in which properly determined public policy will dictate that certain subvention or changes in VAT regimes etc. are possible.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is the question of whether or not we want certain principles of national ownership.  Whatever the outcome of the present issue the Minister must face &mdash; I wish him well in that &mdash; there is a strong case to be made for some form of commission to consider the state of the industry in Ireland, to lay down principles which we, as democrats, can agree upon and to ensure that problems are resolved in a reasonably orderly fashion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister.  I wish him well with the task he faces and agree with Senator Manning that it is an extremely difficult one.  I compliment Senator Manning on his contribution.  It <Col N="745" /> is as good a contribution as I have heard in 13 years in the Oireachtas.  He has stated succinctly what the problems are and what is required.  I agree with much of what he said, but not all of it.</P>
      <P>There is a need for a policy on the media and the newspapers.  It should be part of the overall media policy involving radio and television.  It does not exist.  I do not think that any party could claim to have a clear-cut policy at present.  Perhaps that is part of the reason we are in this dilemma.  The Government should not get involved in the industry other than to lay down the guidelines.  The industry should be independent and should remain so.  In that context the most important start that the Government, the Minister and all of us must make is to level the playing pitch.  At present many of the newspaper industry's problems are due to the fact that we do not have a level playing pitch.  Despite what the Minister and the Competition Authority have said, British imports, which are low-priced because of the massive economies of scale they have, are involved in predatory pricing in Ireland.  They are involved in predatory pricing for the simple reason that their economies of scale and the technological developments which have taken place mean that British newspapers are being produced for a fraction of the cost of their Irish counterparts.</P>
      <P>A very important point which the Minister must keep in mind is that the production of newspapers in Ireland can never and will never be the same as the production of newspapers in Britain. We need only look to other small European countries to make comparisons. Production costs in Ireland are similar to those in other countries of similar size and population.  We can never hope to compete with British tabloids which are being dumped on the Irish market. The Minister must beware of this fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of VAT is one which leaves the most uphill playing pitch from the point of view of newspapers. We must recognise that the level of VAT on newspapers is a major factor in <Col N="746" /> the difficulties they are undergoing.  The dominance of RTE is the third major factor which makes the newspapers uncompetitive.  This debate must include the situation with regard to RTÉ, a monopoly which has a major contribution from the State in terms of the licensing fee and has major advantages in terms of advertising revenue.  It is only when the overall picture is considered &mdash; the newspaper industry and RTÉ &mdash; and we make a level playing pitch for all that we will begin to address, as a Government and as politicians, the difficulties which the industry is experiencing.</P>
    <P>I will move on to the question of what the Minister should do in the immediate future.  Fianna Fáil has consulted widely. Our spokesperson for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy O'Rourke, and the party leader have had 14 meetings with various interest groups.  The Fianna Fáil front bench will be considering the various options in the near future.  I would like to make a personal comment on what I see as being the desired progress in the future.  I agree with Senator Manning that we must ensure that Irish newspapers remain under Irish ownership. It would be a disaster if the Irish Press Group fell into the hands of people like Rupert Murdoch or Conrad Black.  The main difficulty which would arise from this, as Senator Manning pointed out, would be that the economies of scale that would be introduced, the reduction in costs and the number of jobs lost would put major pressure on the other newspaper groups, the <i>Irish Independent, The Irish Times</i> and <i>The Cork Examiner.</i>  We would have a situation where the quality of our newspapers would drop and the bottom line would be the most important factor for them to fight against.</P>
    <P>From that point of view I support Independent Newspapers' acquisition of the 24.9 shareholding in the <i>Irish Press</i> and the provision of the loan.  I agree with Senator Manning that this is the best of a number of bad options.  The <i>Irish Press</i> will otherwise go out of business. The opportunities which would <Col N="747" /> then exist would be very confined and lead to further trouble for the industry in general.  The Minister should be supportive. I certainly do not speak for the Independent Group &mdash; I find much to be dissatisfied with &mdash; but they have shown the way forward in this country, not alone in the newspaper industry but in industry generally.  We can see this from the way in which they have made their titles, particularly the <i>Irish Independent</i>, very popular and successful, the way in which they have followed an acquisition trail, both nationally and internationally, and the way in which they are now able to generate significant profits.  At the end of the day, it is all about competition and the best survivor. While I agree with the desire not to see one particular company or person having a dominant position, we must face up to reality.  If the Independent Group has been better in that respect than anybody else, then I say good luck to it.</P>
    <P>The suggestion made by Senator Manning that perhaps an arrangement could be arrived at so that if the Independent Group's attempt to buy the <i>Irish Press</i> titles was allowed, and I believe it should, a consortium of Irish interests could be involved in a takeover of the <i>Irish Press</i> which would leave it with an independent voice that would not be part of any one dominant group.</P>
    <P>The possibility of the British newspapers getting a stronger stranglehold in this country would bring about a reduced level of quality in our newspapers. Whatever else, we are extremely lucky that we have an exceptionally high quality of newspapers across the board, from the <i>Irish Independent</i> to <i>The Irish Times</i> and <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> to <i>The Sunday Business Post.</i>  Producing an excellent newspaper, living with the competition and staying in business is extremely difficult.  I was a great fan of <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> when Vincent Browne was its editor.  It is an excellent newspaper, but it simply could not continue to hold its place with its competition because of its cost of production. If we give any foothold to English newspapers <Col N="748" /> we will find further examples of that happening to other Irish newspapers, such as <i>The Cork Examiner</i> or <i>The Irish Times.</i></P>
    <P>Consequently, I would first urge the Minister to ensure that we retain Irish ownership of Irish newspapers; second, that we would bring about a fair playing pitch through the reduction of VAT and the acceptance that there is predatory pricing on our market by British newspapers because of their economies of scale and cost of production; and, third, and possibly most importantly &mdash; in this respect I would agree with Senator Manning &mdash; that we need a policy for the media operating across the spectrum involving the newspapers and RTÉ.</P>
    <P>Suggestions have been made about putting newspapers on a fairer competitive level with RTÉ.  It is past time that this was done and that part of RTÉ was privatised.  The suggestion was made that Network 2 should be privatised.  It is long past time that we break up the RTÉ monopoly.  It is answerable to nobody and does what it wants in terms of the massive amount of money going to it from the licence fee and the serious competitive advantage it has in regard to advertising.  If a forum could be put together &mdash; I agree with the point that we do not want a commission that may sit for up to 12 months &mdash; comprising of the Irish media industry, the politicians and the public servants to look at the immediate requirements of that industry, we could come up with interesting solutions that will continue to give us the high quality of journalism that we have in this country and also ensure that we get a balanced view, which in fairness we do get at the moment, from our newspapers.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I also welcome this debate, which is particularly topical and timely in light of the fact that it is very much a live issue at the moment and that the Minister has indicated that he will have to make a decision in the near future on the specific aspects related in this interim report.  It is good that the <Col N="749" /> Seanad is very much part of this debate. I hope that we will be of some assistance to the Minister in his deliberations, although I am not sure that we have any conclusive solutions to offer.</P>
      <P>I have been interested in the contributions of other Senators, particularly the concept introduced by Senator Manning, in that there is a need for a public debate and stand on the newspaper industry.  It also ties in with the public debate in broadcasting &mdash; I note that the Minister has his copy of the Green Paper on Broadcasting with him.  All of these issues are interconnected.</P>
      <P>The barrage of information that comes at people is part of the problem. It is indicated by the fact that fewer people are buying newspapers, because they can get information from many other sources.  When I was growing up there was only one television channel and a number of radio programmes.  We did not have anything like the amount of information available now.  We did not have computer networks to sift, cipher and pick out what amount, level or type of information our brains could hold or wanted to receive.  It is a whole new world out there.  The fact that the newspaper industry is in this kind of trouble is an indication of the dramatic changes in the area of information in recent years.  It is almost inevitable that there is a crisis in the newspaper industry. Indeed, such crises have already broken out, as has been referred to, in the newspaper industries in America and Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not like to see us going the way of America and Britain in this regard.  The American experience is particularly alarming, because a much smaller number of people are influencing public debate there.  Deregulation has brought all sorts of problems with it.  I was listening to a media programme on RTÉ a few weeks ago which specifically related to broadcasting, but apparently there is a growing number of small radio stations in the south of the United States which can advocate all sorts of things, like the use of firearms and so on, which is a totally alarming situation. <Col N="750" /> We are trying to find some sort of balance between people's freedom to express themselves and public responsibility. The libel laws and the laws that allow people to protect their good name also come into this, as does the legislation that is referred to in this document.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper on Broadcasting deals with the broad debate.  It raises the question of &ldquo;What is the optimum balance of power we should strive for in the multiple relationships between technologies, regulators, providers and users?&rdquo;, which is the basic question for the newspaper industry as well as that of broadcasting.</P>
    <P>The paper goes on to say&mdash;</P>
    <P>In the tradition of western European democratic theory and practice, modes of public communication are situated at the heart of the democratic process.  The public interest is to broaden and deepen democracy by providing each citizen with opportunities for equal and affordable access to mediated public debate and to the fully diverse sources of information needed for participation in social life.  Policy should, therefore, be built on an assessment of the needs of citizens in an emerging information society such as Ireland is today, and be focused on providing the appropriate mix of technologies and organisational resources available in a mixed economy which will meet those needs. What policies promote citizenship rather than passive consumerism?</P>
    <P>That is the broad question that we are trying to address.</P>
    <P>The power of the press is enormous &mdash; Senator O'Toole touched on it in his contribution.  Any régime trying to control people and how they think will inevitably first take over the press. Senator O'Toole also made the point that newspapers have been used throughout history to promote particular ideas and to be subversive.  In some cases they have had direct roles in, for example, getting rid of colonial powers and in bringing about huge changes in <Col N="751" /> society and its structures.  While they do have a huge influence, they also have a responsibility that goes with that.  What is the Government's role in all of this? That is the question that the Minister will have to answer.</P>
    <P>The question in the interim report is very specific.  It relates to the role of British newspapers in Ireland and to the Independent newspapers question, which is clearly the focus of most of the debate tonight.  It draws the conclusion that the activities of the Independent Newspapers Group are in contravention of this legislation.  The report states that Independent Newspapers is clearly capable of inflicting considerable harm on most of its rivals and could force them out of the market altogether.  That fear must be addressed.</P>
    <P>The various options that Senator Manning referred to are interesting. There is a real fear that the <i>Irish Press</i> could go out of business if something is not done to save it; if the recommendations of this report are immediately put into practice there is a danger that the <i>Irish Press</i> could go out of business.  I am very concerned at Independent Newspapers getting any more control of the market than they have already.  It is clear in this report that the Independent Newspapers Group is very strong in the market.  It has a wide range, wide diversity; it has worldwide interests.  It also has what they call upstream and downstream interests in both printing and distribution and therefore it is considered to have a dominant position.  I am very concerned at that dominant position being increased by Independent Newspapers taking control of the <i>Irish Press.</i></P>
    <P>I strongly favour the third option suggested by Senator Manning, that of the various interests in the Irish media somehow coming together to rescue the <i>Irish Press</i> so that none would have a dominant position, allowing a balance of interests from various aspects of the media.  I do not know how practical this option is, but if it was possible, it would be the best option.  The main problem is in the area of cost.  I am not sure what <Col N="752" /> can be done about that.  We have a very small market here and if we want diversity, that market will be divided among a number of interests and viewpoints.  I would like to see the situation remaining very much as it is, where there is a balance and a number of newspapers to choose from.  I would not like that choice to be limited by one company having too much control over editorial policy.</P>
    <P>We all have our differences with editorial policy in various newspapers &mdash; I have my differences with the editorial policy of the Independent Group, that is obvious, as a member of my political party &mdash; but I do not want to muzzle them or to exercise censorship. However, the public has a right to know where a newspaper is coming from.  I would welcome an independent study of the various utterances of the <i>Sunday Independent</i> in particular over the last few years to see whether political bias is evident.  The public has the right to know what the political viewpoint of a newspaper is, and the <i>Independent</i> is clearly not in favour of the Labour Party.  I can say that for sure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know, I think the <i>Independent</i> is worse to the Labour Party than it is to anybody else.  Newspapers have a right to say what they want as long as it is within the law and as long as it is presenting fact as opposed to fiction.  However, I do not think the <i>Independent</i> had the right to do what they did in sending that letter that was supposed to be from an unmarried mother to a number of people.  At the same time, if there is not an even distribution of opinion, there is a dominant position in the market and that is not good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Toole said that we have a fine tradition of Irish journalism, a fine tradition of individual columnists putting forward strongly expressed but well reasoned viewpoints, balanced by other, equally strongly expressed points of view.  We would lose that fine tradition <Col N="753" /> at our peril and I hope we can maintain it.  I am concerned to maintain jobs; everybody is concerned to maintain jobs.  It is very difficult and I know it is also the primary concern of the NUJ.  I do not know what we can do to fight against technology, but on his record, maintenance of jobs will be the primary concern of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment as well.</P>
    <P>I wish to speak about provincial newspapers. They have not yet been mentioned during this debate because they are outside the scope of this report to some extent.  We also have a fine record of provincial journalism.  I must express my interest in this, as Senator Mooney expressed his.  My father was a provincial journalist most of his working life, so I was reared on newspapers.  Like other Members, I am a passionate reader of newspapers.  Unfortunately, the majority of the Irish public are not. Perhaps that is the problem.  Provincial newspapers are also concerned with the whole problem of costs and with the competition they encounter from local radio stations, a recent problem for them.  I know that they are also lobbying in this debate.  I would not like to see provincial newspapers in trouble because of the competition from local radio.  That is an ongoing debate; maybe it is for a different forum but the level playing field is important in this area also.</P>
    <P>This debate is broader than the specific context of the interim report.  It will be broader again when the full report comes out, because the brief of that body is much broader than the specific issues of the competition from British newspapers and the Independent Newspapers issue.  This broader debate, which is just beginning, is necessary and must go in tandem with the debate on broadcasting.  I share the view of Senator Fahey and Senator Manning that there should be Irish control of Irish newspapers and the Irish media.  I would hate to see the Murdochs of this world having any more control than they already have.  The sale of British tabloids more than any other newspapers <Col N="754" /> seems to be on the increase here. To that extent they have some control over the Irish mind.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the thrust of this report implemented.  I would not like to see Independent Newspapers gaining any more control within the Irish media than they have already, but I also realise the immediate problem for the <i>Irish Press</i> and I do not want to see it going under.  As I said earlier, if it were possible I would favour the suggested third option that a consortium representing a much broader range of interests than Independent Newspapers, although it could include Independent Newspapers, would take the Irish Press Group out of its present problems.  The debate should continue to go on and whatever we as legislators and the Minister responsible can do to support a strong and vibrant Irish newspaper industry should be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few disconnected random thoughts on this very important subject.  We can be proud of the media in Ireland, in particular of the print media.  I will refer a little later on to what the Minister has said in his speech. He drew some interesting comparisons with the American newspaper industry. I feel there is a baleful warning there.  I go quite often to America and the Minister is quite right.  There has been a tendency to concentrate ownership in very large cities, running to millions of inhabitants, in the hands of one newspaper proprietor with one title being published.  They are very often of extremely poor quality, with very little really incisive political analysis or any form of cultural journalism.  Many of these newspapers are basically pap and I would not want to see the Irish newspapers degenerating to this level.  I do not believe they will.  All the titles mentioned are honourable titles.  I am a news addict.  I read five newspapers a day, all of them Irish.  I read four newspapers on a Sunday, all of them Irish.  I used to read the English newspapers until the appalling Rupert Murdoch got his grubby little hands on the throat of <Col N="755" /> the English newspaper industry. Although I am not xenophobic, I am inclined to recall the remarks of Arthur Cleary around 1912, when he said that a nation which takes a British newspaper for its Sunday breakfast may one day find a change in its Friday menu.  He had a type of Catholic siege mentality.</P>
      <P>I am appalled by the number of Irish people who buy rubbishy, dangerous, badly written, evil newspapers like <i>The Sun</i>.  It is an immoral newspaper and represents, as the great playwright Denis Potter said, a corruption of our political discourse.  That is why newspapers are so important.  I was at a dinner last night in Trinity College and we spoke about things we had studied 30 years ago, including Milton's <i>Aereopagitica</i>, about the freedom of the press.  It is intensely important for political and intellectual discourse that we have good organs of information in the State.</P>
      <P>I am horrified that people would buy newspapers like <i>The Sun</i> which specialise in libel.  A Member referred to libel laws.  It selects its targets and lies about them, as it did in the case of Elton John, for example.  I am glad he took <i>The Sun</i> for £2 million, but it did not worry the proprietors of that newspaper because the resulting sensational coverage of the case helped its circulation to spiral upwards again.  Lying can actually be profitable for unscrupulous newspaper proprietors.</P>
      <P>I disdain Rupert Murdoch.  I remember Denis Potter, who towards the end of his life, glared into the camera and said that he could not understand how people could work for <i>The Sun</i> and go home to their families in the evening without a deep burning sense of shame in their gut.  I echo that.  It is a narrow newspaper with an anti-Irish bias, which is demonstrated time and time again. Every group which is perceived as weak or a minority is a target for <i>The Sun.</i>  I would not welcome the introduction of a Murdoch style operation in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have never met Dr. A.J.F. O'Reilly, although I heard him once or twice <Col N="756" /> on the radio.  I imagine his jokes are quite good the first time one hears them, although I understand he tends to repeat them at rugby dinners.  Not having met the man, I have a great admiration for him.  If it came to a choice between Rupert Murdoch and Dr. A.J. F. O'Reilly, I know who I would chose. I believe Dr. O'Reilly is an Irish hero. He was a sporting star and has done fine academic research; and I understand his doctorate, unlike some of the other barons of Irish industry, was actually won and achieved.  He has been a spectacular success in business in the United States without any whiff of scandal, corruption or mean dealing attached to him.  I have no objection to him personally, but I believe we should be careful about the concentration of power in the hands of anyone, including somebody who I accept is a decent person.</P>
    <P>As regards the penetration of the British tabloids, we cannot control people's desire to buy what they want because we are dealing with a market economy.  I have spoken to friends and colleagues in the gymnasium where I go to do a few exercises&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who buy the tabloids, as do a lot of people, for the sports results which are clearly displayed and they ignore a lot of the comment.  That is one area in which some of the Irish newspapers may not have done their marketing research.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A lot has been said about the Independent Newspapers Group.  I believe that is a stable with a number of different inhabitants.  The daily <i>Irish Independent</i> is a good newspaper, but I do not care for the <i>Sunday Independent,</i> although I read it.  It is a mixed bag, like the curate's egg &mdash; good in spots.  What worries me about the <i>Sunday Independent</i> is the uniformity of opinion which it sometimes displays.  Some weeks ago there was a nasty episode when it decided to take on another heroic figure in Irish public life, the President, Mary <Col N="757" /> Robinson.  She is not immune to criticism, and nobody would suggest that. But when a newspaper decides on a head on attack and every single columnist from the sporting column to the social column &mdash; even the bloody weather forecast &mdash; seems to take a smack at Mary Robinson, it is unbalanced and the people do not like it.</P>
    <P>I do not care for the tone of the <i>Sunday Independent.</i>  It has, however, researched its market and it knows exactly what sells and it gives it to the people in spade loads.  If we have quarrel I do not believe it should be entirely with the <i>Sunday Independent</i>, which is clearly a commercial exercise.  We should ask why Irish people have a taste for secondhand and second rate gossip about minor figures in Irish royalty, a lot of which is inaccurate, and scurrilous and prurient material about alcoholic ex-journalists and all the rest of it.  It seems to me to be dull and boring, but there is an appetite for it.</P>
    <P>As regard the <i>Irish Press</i>, I am sorry for the catastrophic decline which is clearly illustrated in the tables in this report.  Sales of the <i>Evening Press</i> have fallen by 65 per cent in the past couple of decades &mdash; a catastrophic decline, which I regret.  I did not always share the political slant of the <i>Irish Press</i> when it had one, because it was clearly committed to a Fianna Fáil Party line. However, having that party line clearly enunciated by a fine newspaper was a good thing.  I have had good friendships with many journalists in the Irish Press Group.  I would regret if anything happened to that newspaper.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that most US cities have only one newspaper publisher, that in more than 170 American cities a single publisher produces both the morning and evening paper and that in other cities a single evening paper is published. He said that fewer than 30 cities have competing papers with different ownership and that most daily papers have a monopoly in their cities and surrounding metropolitan areas.  So much for competition, which is one of the ideas invoked in this.  There is no competition <Col N="758" /> when one gets into a monopoly situation like that.  We can find Murdoch's hand in a lot of that in America. He is an extraordinarily dangerous man.</P>
    <P>In an article in <i>The Irish Times,</i> Fintan O'Toole looked at the way the media can actually create reality.  He gave the example of Dan Quayle and a television soap opera where he complained about a single mother having a baby.  The next episode showed that character watching Dan Quayle who then presented a teddy bear to the fictional child.  That is a simple example. In the <i>Sunday Independent</i> it was purported that an interview had taken place with Bishop Casey.  That is a dangerous manipulation of fact and reality which in other circumstances could be very damaging.</P>
    <P>The Minister asked if that type of US development was desirable or inevitable in a small nation state.  The answer is no. He asked if Irish newspapers were competitive enough and what did they need to do to become more so.  Obviously, they are not competitive enough, although I was interested to see that both ends of the spectrum have managed to maintain their share of the market, that is, <i>The Star</i>, which is at the lower end of the market, and <i>The Irish Times</i>, which is a quality newspaper and has made a remarkable comeback. We should ask why?  What are the management procedures and the structures in <i>The Irish Times</i>?  What is the editorial policy?  Why is it that a newspaper which is so expensive &mdash; I remember when it cost 3p, now it costs 85p&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>That was when the penny was worth something.  How can this quality newspaper sustain its market level despite the fact that it is intellectually challenging, well written, by and large, finely produced and expensive? Perhaps we could learn from our enemies, that is, the appalling Rupert Murdoch. I recall it was Rupert Murdoch who developed a vast printing works at Wapping and completely revolutionised <Col N="759" /> newspaper technology.  Perhaps there is a possibility for co-operation among Irish newspapers where they could share technology, a print run, machinery and distribution.  I do not know if that breaches competition, but the sharing of technology, plant, equipment and knowledge might be one way to assist Irish newspapers because there is competition from English newspapers.</P>
      <P>The report says this does not represent predatory competition.  The difference caused by the high rate of VAT charged to Irish newspapers as against a nil rate of VAT in Great Britain should be looked at.</P>
      <P>The report states:</P>
      <P>Since 1975 Irish newspaper prices have increased at a much faster rate than the general rate of inflation and at a faster rate than that of UK newspapers. A remarkable similarity was found in the timing and amount of price increases for most Irish newspapers over a long period.</P>
      <P>This is the type of coy language one gets in these reports, but it seems they are close to suggesting that there is something approaching a cartel already operating in the Irish newspaper business. I am sorry to have used up my time, but I got carried away with the fascination of the Irish press.</P>

      <P>I wish the Minister well as he faces difficult problems in the newspaper industry and the media. However, these are not home-grown; they extend beyond our borders to Great Britain.  The Minister has seen the figures which have been circulated.  The <i>Sunday Independent</i> is the largest seller in this country and between July to December 1994 258,291 copies were sold; the <i>News of the World</i> sold 205,000 papers in the Republic and 124,000 in <Col N="760" /> Northern Ireland, a total of 329,000 copies; the <i>Sunday Press</i> is the next biggest seller with 154,000 copies; the <i>Irish Independent</i> sells 145,450 copies, while <i>The Sun</i> sells 78,000 copies in the Republic and 104,000 in Northern Ireland, a total of 182,000 copies.</P>
      <P>We need to be careful about where we are going.  Mr. Rupert Murdoch owns a group of newspapers, including <i>The Times, The Sun</i> and the <i>News of the World</i> and the Sky television channels. People must make decisions about whether we should limit further growth in the Independent Newspapers Group which has increased its profits.  <i>The Sunday Independent</i> and the <i>Evening Herald</i> are now ahead of the <i>Sunday Press</i> and the <i>Evening Press</i> as regards sales. We should be careful about holding up the growth of the Independent Newspapers Group which has invested a lot of its profits in newspapers in Britain and throughout the world.  It is of benefit to Ireland to be able to spearhead development and it is good to have a strong growth rate at home for further development overseas.</P>
      <P>Some articles in the Independent newspapers are distasteful.  Journalists have the right of free speech, provided they do not breach libel laws or use bad language.  I congratulate the newspapers in this country because they have successfully highlighted many difficult issues.  The <i>Irish Press</i>, the <i>Irish Independent, The Sunday Tribune</i> and <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> have, on different occasions, shown courage by exposing many stories which required research. State institutions have been well served by these publications.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed at the State television broadcasting system's lack of research and coverage of current affairs. Many people, including myself, were proud of the investigative journalism &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; did in the past.  I do not know if it is editorial policy not to break stories, but I regret &mdash; I am not pointing the finger at anyone &mdash; that other television stations have been able to do so.  We need a more independent broadcasting system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="761" /> We can be proud of <i>The Irish Times</i> because it has published difficult stories at various times as have <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> and the <i>Sunday Independent.</i> We need to be careful about restricting the growth of some of our newspapers and I know the Minister will give careful consideration to this matter.</P>

      <P>I am almost in injury time, but, perhaps.  Senator Dardis will allow me a few minutes to speak because this is a useful debate.</P>
      <P>This is a difficult decision for the Minister; if he takes one course of action he could create a number of jobs but if he takes another many jobs could be lost.  There is no simple solution to this problem.  This country has been well served by the media, although we may not always agree with what they write.</P>
      <P>This issue must be looked at in relation to costs and as Senator O'Toole mentioned, employing people at slave rates.  Banks and supermarkets employ temporary trainees but I hope the newspapers will not do so.  We must consider the technology aspect of this issue.  It was interesting to hear the figures given by the previous speaker for the sales of certain newspapers. Some of the papers imported and sold here are produced at a far lower cost than newspapers printed here.  We must consider whether there can be a combining of technology so that the lot of the consumer can be improved.  I would like to see the Irish Press Group survive. Its daily paper may have outlived its usefulness in relation to modern needs but the <i>Sunday Press</i> and the <i>Evening Press</i> certainly still have a role to play. There may be also be a role for the group in targeting possible provincial areas, like <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> did in different areas of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many aspects of this issue must be considered and the Minister is faced with a difficult choice.  We support the action taken by the Minister so far on consultation.  It is not a case of slamming any individual.  Dr. O'Reilly has done a great deal of good work.  We do not <Col N="762" /> always agree with what is in his papers but he had a role to play.  <i>The Irish Times</i> has played a pivotal and central role and has rebounded from difficulties over the last ten years.  There are many positive aspects at which we can look. There is an immediate issue to be faced by the Minister but there is also a wider and broader question in relation to the media, including possibly RTE, and advertising.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Dardis as I have probably taken a minute or two of his time.  The debate has been useful and I hope we can discuss this issue again.</P>

      <P>I am relieved to hear this and would be very happy to share my time with Senator Henry.  We are confronted with some very complex issues. I am pleased the Minister adopted the approach of asking questions.  It is a reasonable criticism of our record in the Oireachtas over several years that we have not given careful and close examination to the issues which confront us. It is possibly one of the good things coming out of the present crisis in the newspaper industry that we will have to address in a coherent form what national policy should be and what the relationship of the State to the press should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of a free press is central to democracy.  It is one of the pillars on which democracy rests.  It was people working in underground caverns in places like the former East Germany and Poland who maintained the survival of democracy and probably helped to <Col N="763" /> contribute to the eventual downfall of the regimes there.  It is characteristic of all regimes which wish to impose their views unilaterally on society that the first place they do it is through the press. Thus, the question of diversity is extremely important and one which I, as a member of a liberal party, espouse as a central plank of policy.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House by discussing some of the principles and the philosophy of this matter; I would if I had more time.  The Minister made a statement which is fundamental and worth repeating.  He said that &ldquo;consumers vote with their cash and choose which newspaper they wish to purchase&rdquo;. This is a central truth.  For over 20 years I worked for a newspaper, albeit a technical one.  I am aware that on a very regular basis the newspaper surveyed its readers and, on the basis of their responses about what they required of the paper, it adapted its editorial policy.  It tended to write about things which were popular with readers and not about things which were unpopular.</P>
    <P>This is a reality of life.  Any newspaper which defies that economic reality will find itself in trouble, and I suspect that is one of the reasons the <i>Irish Press</i> is in trouble.  Perhaps to a degree it defied, or attempted to defy, some of those realities.  If those realities are defied, the point is reached where the State must support the industry if it is to continue to provide the diversity of view which is central to a liberal and democratic society.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that newspapers are increasingly dominated by accountants and that people like Mr. Smyllie and other great editors do not seem to be evident anymore.  It is faceless men with calculators who seem to set the agenda. I believe the Competition Authority's report is right about the <i>Irish Press</i> and that undue dominance is not desirable. I take Senator Manning's point about how the <i>Irish Press</i> can continue while taking on board the issue of dominance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="764" /> There are models at which we can look.  <i>The Farmers' Journal</i> was a model. Many years ago, when there was an attempt by British barons to take it over, it became a trust.  Some people made an immense contribution to the country by foregoing huge financial gain to ensure the paper stayed in Irish hands and represented an Irish ethos. There are models and we should not deceive ourselves into thinking there are no alternatives.</P>
    <P>We have a tiny market and there is predatory pricing but the Minister is aware of the significance of the Single Market.  If it were apparent there was dumping of British newspapers as a result of below cost selling, would that be grounds for intervening at European level or elsewhere to control the market? The pace of technology is such that perhaps some of the things we are discussing will be irrelevant.</P>
    <P>I want to reinforce the point made by Senator O'Sullivan about the central importance of the provincial press, its contribution to small societies, the essential need to ensure it is allowed to flourish and continue and that nothing is done, through the broadcasting media or otherwise, to prevent it from flourishing and competing on an equal footing with other media.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Dardis for sharing his time with me.  When I first became a Member of the House I asked Senator Norris's advice on what I was supposed to do and say here.  He said my main function was to say &ldquo;hear! hear!&rdquo; after everything he said.  The main part of my contribution is to say &ldquo;hear! hear!&rdquo; to what he said during this debate because it was most apt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I applaud what Senator Dardis and Senator O'Sullivan said, particularly about the provincial press.  A great deal has been said about the O'Reilly group. I know Dr. O'Reilly.  He is a most intelligent and affable man and has done a great deal for this country but I am not always totally enamoured of what his papers do.  Around Christmas the <i>Sunday Independent</i> stereotyped the single <Col N="765" /> mother by sending out begging letters to people all over the country.  As President of Cherish I found this regrettable but these sort of lapses happen everywhere.</P>
    <P>With regard to Mr. Murdoch's bids for papers here, we would be well advised to remember what <i>Private Eye</i> had on its front page when he bought <i>The Times.</i>  I will use medical terminology because I do not know if the terminology of <i>Private Eye</i> is suitable for this House.  It said that a breast and buttocks person snapped up <i>The Times.</i>  It would be well for us to remember this. It is enough to have papers under his control selling heavily here without the enormous influence he could have on our press.  I would very much regret if the monopoly he has created in America happened here and I hope the Minister will take all we have said on this into account when he is making a decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly take what has been said into account in reaching a decision.  However, I am not sure that everything which has been said can be formulated into a simple line of advice because there seems to be many different strands.  I suppose people are looking for micro-surgery to be conducted with pretty unsophisticated instruments that might be available under the competition legislation.  That does pose dilemmas because in the course of the debate issues like Irish ownership were raised.  Of course, Irish competition law does not recognise the difference between Irish and non-Irish ownership. It is not part of its brief.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis raised the issue of dumping; competition law does not regard marginal cost pricing or below cost selling as generally anti-competitive. As in the British case with which the authority dealt, you would have to prove dominance in the first instance, as well as having to prove predation &mdash; that the intention is designed to kill off a competitor &mdash; which is an extremely difficult concept to deal with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="766" /> We have a competition law whose framework sets limitations on what I can do as Minister.  There seems to be a general consensus, arising from the debate, in favour of a need to step back from the industry and look at a broader range of issues including VAT.  Irish ownership and editorial diversity.  The latter is a different issue from concentration in the marketplace; they are different concepts.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning raised the interesting idea of the trust as a concept, but the key question that must be asked is whether any trust can be made to conform to Irish competition law.  People must be aware that Irish competition law sets out that agreements between undertakings which have as their object or effect the prevention of competition are illegal.  It then sets tight grounds under which a licence could be granted to such an agreement.  These have to be connected with improving the production or distribution of goods, the provision of services or the promotion of technical or economic progress while allowing consumers a fair share of the resulting benefit.</P>
    <P>As well as reflecting the general view of what is good for producing quality newspapers, this debate also has to be informed by what is existing law.  There is clearly a difficult balancing act in dealing with these issues.</P>
    <P>Part of the debate suggested a more depressed tone than is necessary concerning the state of the Irish newspaper industry.  We are a country of very high readership; 5.5 million titles are purchased every week, which is more than six per household.  Although the British titles have a significant share in the tabloid market, they have not penetrated the quality dailies.  Some 93 per cent of quality dailies purchased are Irish, and 84 per cent of quality Sundays purchased are Irish.  The competition has hit the tabloid area and while there is some reassurance in that on the one hand, on the other, it contains the seeds of difficulties for the future.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to draw conclusions from the debate which I found very useful. <Col N="767" /> While it has pointed up some of the dilemmas rather than resolving them, some useful ideas have been put forward which I will take into account as I consider the future decision in relation to the Competition Authority's report.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his contribution.  The debate reminded me of an old programme on the BBC in which it was said that so and so looked into the sound archives and came to no very general conclusions.  I am afraid that the debate did not give the Minister any very general conclusions but it has pointed up the complexity of the issues. We wish the Minister well in coming to a conclusion that, at least, will be in the best interests of the largest number of people in the industry.</P>

    <Title>Arterial Drainage (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1995: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>Like you, a Leas-Chathaoirleach, and many other public representatives, I attended meetings in different areas of my own county during January, February and March last to discuss the problems caused by flooding. Those who attended the meetings were reasonable people but they were also very angry.  They did not blame politicians for the high winter rainfall of recent years but they were demanding action because they are not prepared to suffer the same hardship and losses in the future.  This was the message that came across loud and clear at all the meetings I attended, and I know that the message to politicians was the same in other parts of the country which were similarly affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People are not prepared to tolerate a repetition of this hardship year after year.  They are convinced that in the vast majority of areas there are solutions which, if implemented, would eliminate or significantly alleviate the problem of <Col N="768" /> flooding.  What is needed is the political will to ensure that these solutions are found, that the legislative framework is there to enable them to be implemented and that the necessary finance is provided to allow this to happen.  In so far as this Bill is a step in that direction I join other speakers in welcoming it.</P>
    <P>At the same time I concur with the reservations that have been expressed in relation to its limitations.  A fundamental shortcoming of this Bill is that it does not provide any statutory entitlement to compensation for people who have suffered serious loss or damage resulting from flooding.  Neither does it, as far as I can see, enable certain works to be undertaken which will provide protection against coastal flooding.</P>
    <P>The Private Member's Bill which was introduced some months ago in this House by Senator Daly was a far more comprehensive Bill than the one we are now debating.  This Bill enables the Office of Public Works to undertake drainage works to deal with localised flooding.  That is just part of the response which is required to deal with this problem but I accept that it is an essential part.  Under the 1945 Arterial Drainage Act such works could not be undertaken and schemes could only be drawn up for entire catchments.  This meant that the Office of Public Works was precluded, even in emergencies, from carrying out works on a localised basis.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in this Bill that more than one scheme may now be prepared in relation to a particular catchment or watercourse and that work that is essential to relieve or prevent flooding can be carried out with some degree of urgency.  However, I am concerned that a scheme must be prepared in the case of every single project which the Office of Public Works proposes to carry out and that that scheme must be put on public display even in cases of extreme urgency.  In certain emergencies the Office of Public Works should have the right to move in and carry out the work without the necessity of preparing a scheme and putting it on <Col N="769" /> public display for a certain length of time.</P>
    <P>It is fine to prescribe those steps in non-emergencies but in an emergency &mdash; with water levels in a house rising perhaps at the rate of six inches or a foot per day &mdash; the Office of Public Works should not have to prepare a scheme and put it on public display.</P>
    <P>With the exception of serious fire damage, the worst thing which can happen to any house is flood damage.  Last winter it was heartbreaking to see fine modern houses flooded up to a depth of five feet.  Inevitably many of these houses have suffered structural damage in addition to damage to carpets, furniture, electrical fittings and personal belongings.  If flooding persists for a period, water will penetrate the walls above the damp proof course and it will be several months before the walls fully dry out.  Walls which have suffered in this way become porous and are less water resistant in the event of subsequent flooding.  It is little wonder therefore that those whose houses were flooded last winter want action to ensure they will not experience the same hardship again.</P>
    <P>The old saying, &ldquo;Prevention is better than cure&rdquo;, is particularly relevant to flooding.  When the provisions of this Bill become law the emphasis should be on the prevention of flooding.  Works carried out to this end will be far cheaper and more cost effective than those undertaken when flooding becomes reality.</P>
    <P>The cost of dealing with serious flooding and problems arising from it can be considerable.  The Minister probably has figures available to him showing the cost of the involvement of the emergency services, the Air Corps helicopters and local authorities in dealing with the problems of last winter.  He will agree it would be far more beneficial if this money could have been spent on measures to prevent a recurrence of flooding.</P>
    <P>In the press release the Minister issued last week he identified nine problem areas which will be given priority by <Col N="770" /> the Office of Public Works when the Bill becomes law.  County Roscommon does not figure on the list, which disappoints not only me but the many people in the county who suffered severe hardship last winter.  The Minister visited some of the worst hit areas in County Roscommon shortly after his appointment and saw the seriousness and extent of the problem.  He heard from the local people about the losses and hardship they suffered.  Because of the Minister's visits and the commitment he gave, they were hopeful something would be done to ensure they would not have to suffer the same hardship next year.  It now appears nothing will be done for these people and areas of County Roscommon. I share the disappointment and anger these people feel because more than likely they will suffer again as they did last winter.</P>
    <P>As was pointed out by Senator Finneran and as the Minister is aware, the water levels in the Shannon and the Suck have a crucial bearing on the nature and extent of the flooding and waterlogging which occurs each year in various parts of Roscommon.  At certain points along its course the Shannon flows through lakes and then through narrow channels.  The longest and best known of these channels is the stretch of river between Athlone and Meelick. It has often been suggested that the removal of silt from this channel would improve the flow rate in the river and enable it to cope more effectively with high water levels during periods of heavy rainfall.</P>
    <P>Proper maintenance of this stretch of river would be helpful, but there are channels farther up the river which also require urgent maintenance.  Because of lack of maintenance over the years many of these channels, some of which are quite short, have silted up.  The performance of maintenance work on these channels would not require the preparation of major schemes or involve complicated preliminary surveys or reports.  It is simply a question of removing the silt from the river bed to enable the water to flow more freely.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="771" /> The level of maintenance on the Suck is also far short of what is required, which is because of the inadequacy of the funding available to the River Suck Drainage Board.  As Senator Finneran also pointed out, that part of the Suck between Ballinasloe and Shannon Harbour is the responsibility of the Office of Public Works, so no maintenance has been carried out on that part of the river for many years.</P>
    <P>The silting problem on both the Shannon and the Suck is seriously exacerbated by the drainage from the Bord na Móna works along the banks of both rivers.  Some months ago the Minister attended a meeting of the River Suck Drainage Board and heard the difficulties it faces.  A proper maintenance programme, involving silt removal where necessary, would help greatly to alleviate the flooding problems in a large area adjacent to the Suck in County Roscommon.</P>
    <P>Some of those to whom I spoke in the Castleplunket and Ballintober area &mdash; one of the areas visited by the Minister &mdash; were convinced this year's flooding in Bushfield, Carrowduff, Enfield, Brackloon and other townlands was related to the water levels in the upper Suck.  The theory was that the water was backing up through swallow-holes and adding to the problems in those areas.</P>
    <P>The extent to which this legislation will be effective in eliminating the problems seen last winter will depend on the funding made available to the Office of Public Works to carry out the work identified as necessary in the various areas.  Local authorities have a vital role to play in ensuring that the problems and hardships people experienced this year will not arise again, but they also must be provided with the necessary funding to carry out such works as raising roads, repairing or improving culverts, etc.  There is also scope for considerable co-operation between the Office of Public Works and local authorities on preventative measures.  There could be joint ventures between those bodies, which is provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="772" /> The explanatory memorandum to the Bill states that the cost arising from the Bill will depend on the availability of funds, that expenditure of between £1 million and £2 million may arise in the current year and that staffing implications in the Office of Public Works will be the subject of further consideration. There is also great scope for local authorities to undertake works on an agency basis on behalf of the Office of Public Works.  There could also be co-operation between the Office of Public Works and local authorities in the preparation of schemes for some of the works which may be carried out.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to include County Roscommon on his priority list. Even if a scheme cannot be prepared in the time available to have works carried out within the areas so badly affected this year, he should at least try to ensure the problems hindering the flow of water in the Suck and the Shannon are dealt with before next winter as it would have beneficial effects for Roscommon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking after another Member from Roscommon, I will be reiterating many of our problems sandwiched, as we are, on one side by the Shannon and on the other by the Suck.  I welcome the Minister and compliment him on honouring the commitment he gave to have this Bill brought to the House as early as possible.  It will be passed, hopefully, before the end of May.  We all appreciate difficulties can be encountered in preparing legislation and bringing it before the House.</P>
      <P>This Bill, which amends the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, is long overdue and I have argued for such an amendment in the past.  I live and farm on the banks of the Shannon.  All in my parish have suffered over many years from such flooding as has been seen recently in Gort.  Not as many houses would be affected, but some houses are flooded nonetheless.  People are cut off annually. They can only commute to the shops, schools or churches by boat, and that is appalling in this day and age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="773" /> I listened to the Opposition Members talking about the slow progress being made with the Bill and the payment of compensation.  I remind them they were in Government for the last seven years. Roscommon County Council has had an application lodged with the Department of the Environment for funds to raise the roads in the Clonown area so that people can commute to schools, churches and towns in comfort.  That money has not been approved, despite all the funding received from Brussels over those seven years.</P>
    <P>The only person who did anything for the people of my parish was James Dillon when he was Minister for Agriculture in 1954.  He transferred the farmers who wished to leave to Westmeath, and they got farms through the Land Commission, and those who wished to stay got new houses raised above flood level.  The highest flood in the area since 1954 was last February and, thankfully, none of the houses was flooded.  Unfortunately, some haysheds were, and I welcome the Government's commitment to provide needed compensation.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the hardship suffered by people in the Gort area and in other areas, such as the Castleplunket-Bushfield area, where many people had to drive four or five miles out of the way just to cover a 200 yard stretch due to floods.  They look forward to the introduction of this Bill and to the Minister's commitment to try to alleviate their problems.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to nine areas that can benefit from this Bill.  As Senator Mullooly said, we are naturally disappointed that some of the areas in Roscommon are not included.  As far as I am aware, the first time the Office of Public Works directed its attentions to the major flooding problems in Roscommon was last February, when the Minister visited the Castleplunket-Bushfield area and the Clonown area where I pointed out houses that were completely cut off by a half mile of water.  They could only be reached by boat.  It is a scandal that people have <Col N="774" /> been left in such circumstances for so long.  Areas such as Belclare, Gort town and Williamstown have been surveyed before by the Office of Public Works and they are probably in a position to have a scheme up and running fairly quickly.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is not able to secure the finance for the implementation of the work envisaged under this Bill, we will not get the work going on the ground.  I acknowledge the amount of work the Office of Public Works has done: 7,300 miles of channel have been widened or improved at a cost of £640 million pounds.  The Office of Public Works has done some tremendous work in north Roscommon in the Boyle-Bonnet area.  Unfortunately, that has let the water faster into the Shannon and created major problems for those living downstream.  The water comes down faster and spreads over the land.</P>
    <P>The same problem arises from Bord na Móna's development and drainage works.  A lot of silt gets into the river and no maintenance work is done. Drainage work for forestry development allows the water to run off the bog areas, and water that might have taken six to eight weeks to seep into the Shannon is now in the river in 24 hours.  This all adds up to a huge problem for the residents who live along the Shannon and Suck valleys.  They have suffered greatly as a result of the extensive rains from November to April, when there was double the normal rainfall.  In addition, since then there has been no rain to clean off the land.  The grass is not growing because the flood water receded leaving a layer of dirt on the land.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to examine what can be done to alleviate the problems of the families living in the Shannon and Suck valleys.  Surveys have been done and they have indicated that a small expenditure of around £1 million would help greatly.  A major problem is the channel between Shannonbridge and Meelick Weir, which is not wide enough to take the flow of water and is silted up.  If it was cleaned and if the <Col N="775" /> draught on the Shannon was reduced in Lough Ree by one foot during the summer months it would allow the lake to absorb substantial additional quantities of water in the wet season and, therefore, reduce the level of flooding between Athlone and Meelick.  I ask the Minister to consider these points.  With a small expenditure we could get great value for money there.  The Minister's predecessor, Deputy Avril Doyle, instructed the Office of Public Works in 1986 to clean the weir in Meelick and untold advantage resulted from those cleaning works.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister in this Bill is reducing the time for dealing with local authorities and the publishing of their reports.  It is important that we get the co-operation of local authorities and that all those who have an input into alleviating local drainage problems deal with the matter seriously and in the fastest possible way.  I referred to funding and staffing earlier. The reality is that if we do not get funding, this Bill will not be successful.</P>
    <P>We referred to the Castleplunket-Bushfield area in Roscommon, which the Minister visited.  He was shown, at first hand, the difficulties there.  The people in the area and I believe the drainage problem there can be alleviated with a small expenditure.  Seemingly, this was not a problem in the region in years gone by.  I know it has been a problem over the last 20 years, but obviously the drainage system that existed there no longer operates.  It appears the same thing happened in the Gort area and, indeed, in other areas such as Dysart, Curaboy and Kiltoom, where massive flooding took place this year.  Some of the swallow-holes have got blocked up, there is no question about it.  They could be cleared with small expenditure and that would allow the natural drainage system to continue.</P>
    <P>The £4 million allocated by the Government for improvements in the repair of roads, which have suffered drastically as a result of the bad winter, is totally inadequate to meet the huge <Col N="776" /> problems that face county councils. Being a former member of a local authority, the Minister will be aware of this. We must secure additional funding to alleviate the problems faced by local authorities in carrying out repairs to the roads.  Many roads were flooded and had to be raised while others were totally washed away with the inclement spring weather.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is long overdue. I compliment the Minister for responding so quickly to the needs the Bill intends to cover.  Hopefully, the Bill will progress through the Houses swiftly and we will see positive action on the ground before the end of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think you are both reasonable.  We should not disagree on this Bill.  Whether it was Senator Brendan Daly's Bill or the Minister's Bill, everybody is anxious to have the best possible piece of legislation to solve a serious problem in the country.  No matter where one goes, people have different solutions to the problem.  I strongly urge the Minister not to put all his eggs in one basket.  Do not go down the road of getting a feasibility study or an assessment by expensive consultants and hydraulic experts.  That would result in an expensive report, recommending the spending of millions of pounds which the Minister will not be able to get his hands on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have good reason to make that suggestion.  A former Member of the House, Joachim Loughrey, persuaded Donegal County Council to provide <Col N="777" /> £100,000 to conduct a study of the Leannan river.  That study recommended the spending of millions of pounds and we had nowhere to get that money.  Despite spending £100,000, that study is lying with the dust accumulating on it.  I urge the Minister not to fall into that trap.</P>
    <P>Any consultant brought in will do an effective job.  He will take into account all the eventualities, the compensation, the drainage of the tributaries, the bridges and he will look at the dangers flood relief will have on those downstream. A good consultant will do a good job, but the Minister will not be able to undertake the recommended work if the last speaker is correct and the sum available is £4 million.  Any one of the counties that has a serious flooding problem would need in excess of £4 million to alleviate the trouble.</P>
    <P>I do not claim to have a simple answer but I hope we will agree here. Consensus in the Seanad should urge the Minister to be strong and determined enough to tackle the problem. There are two areas to address.  First, we are not doing enough to combat coastal erosion.  There has been substantial funding available at EU level, but Ireland has not participated and has not taken up the funding available there for coastal erosion.  I said here in the House on another occasion that I saw an excellent case being made for coastal erosion funding by a Scottish local authority.  I urge the Minister to involve the local authorities and to have fairly strict limitations on the consultancy work to be carried out.  The Minister has the machinery available in most local authorities, where there are engineers capable of undertaking an assessment. Second, most of the trouble arises largely from the fact that we have many tributaries and rivers that have not been cleaned.  There are fallen trees and silt gathered where many rivers have not been cleaned for years.  It does not take an expert, a consultant, a hydrologist or other highly qualified person to do a drainage survey.  I believe local authorities have the expertise to conduct such studies themselves.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="778" /> The Minister may take a simple example.  Any farmer who has drains on his land &mdash; and that includes most farmers except the lucky ones &mdash; cannot allow them to go unattended.  Every farmer provides for cleaning drains every year or two.  There is an example in my own county of a valuable farm, which, unfortunately, is now in receivership. The drainage of the Slab at Burt in County Donegal created a highly valuable farm of a few thousand acres. It was fertile, but there was no flat land. It depended on drainage to the extent that the water on the farm had to be drained into a sump and pumped out over the sea wall.  It is a very good example of how care and attention must be given to the problem of drainage.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister not to get carried away.  He will impress neither the people in this House nor those affected by the flooding if at the end of the day he does not deliver.  Intelligent people are observing the introduction of the legislation and asking what the follow up will be and what will happen on the ground.  The Minister must be seen to be delivering something.  I strongly urge him not to spend the funds on consultants' fees, because the local authorities have found this to be unproductive. Local authorities used to employ consultants to design schemes, roads and bridges but these could not be financed and had to be re-examined.  Following their sad experience local authorities no longer throw large sums of money to consultants.  That day is gone.  If the Minister relies on consultancy work, the people affected by flooding will realise that he is falling into the same trap. Local authorities have long since learned not to travel in that direction.</P>
    <P>A predecessor of the Minister's, the late Noel Lemass, was an excellent Minister in charge of the Board of Works because he was practical.  We brought him up to Donegal to look at a serious drainage problem which the Board of Works told us was either 19th or 22nd on their drainage list, meaning it would never have been reached.  The late Noel Lemass's practical approach <Col N="779" /> was to offer the assistance of the Board of Works.  We formed a local committee and helped by the local authority, the banks and the marts, we undertook the drainage of the River Finn in the Ballybofey/Stranorlar area, where houses and property were being continually destroyed every year.  That was 25 years ago and we have had no flooding damage in the area since, thanks to the late Noel Lemass and his practical approach.  He did not tell us to get a consultant.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister not to spend the available funding on employing consultants, because the average community affected by the flooding realises that a consultants' report does not mean much if there is no follow up and no implementation.  It is not our job to be destructive.  Our job as Opposition spokespersons is to encourage the Minister to get results and to have a practical approach, and that is what I am doing this afternoon.  I sincerely hope the Minister succeeds, but many people will be disappointed if he thinks consultants' reports will satisfy them and tackle this serious ongoing problem.  I recommend that the Minister adopt a more practical approach and involve local authorities. He should not employ engineers to do work which the local authority has sufficient capacity to carry out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on introducing this legislation. I hope it will finally alleviate the serious problems encountered around the country. There was talk about draining the Shannon earlier.  As long as I can remember, there has been talk about draining the Mulcair in my area.  I am pleased that Newport and Cappamore, the relevant areas of the Mulcair, are listed in the priority listing that has been published.  I thank the Minister for including that area.  I was there a couple of months ago when his predecessor, Deputy Hogan, visited.  There were particular problems this year, but there have been severe problems in the past. I am delighted that this legislation <Col N="780" /> updates the 1945 legislation and will allow for relatively small schemes to be carried out.  The cost was always a factor in the past because of the expense of draining a full basin as opposed to a specific area.</P>
      <P>I can understand Senator McGowan's point about not wasting too much time on consultants' reports, but it is a very complicated area.  I accept that sometimes local authorities will have the necessary expertise, but I note that the Minister mentioned the problem of adverse impact in other areas.  Drainage in one part of a river basin can cause a variety of problems in other parts.  I would not totally rule out expert advice from both local authority personnel and consultants, because it is a very complicated area and there might sometimes be a need for outside expertise.</P>
      <P>There are other areas in which I had a particular interest, but I suppose we should not all be too parochial.  There are specific problems in Limerick city, where the tidal aspect is relevant.  An area known as the Sand Mall is the subject of fairly regular flooding when a high tide, heavy rainfall and winds in a certain direction combine to cause flooding to a number of houses.  It happens on a regular basis.  I know my local authority has certain suggestions in that area and I hope they will be taken into consideration because families in that area are consistently affected.</P>
      <P>Section 8 of the Bill deals with areas where houses or industries have been situated and where there was not formerly considered to be a need for drainage but where work can now be done in those areas.  Westbury, which is in County Clare but close to Limerick, has that problem.  New houses have been built and flooding has resulted.  While formerly there was no need for drainage, there is now because of the presence of new houses.</P>

    <P>I am a member of the Midwest Regional Authority.  We were given an interesting presentation two weeks ago by an ESB hydraulics engineer at Ardnacrusha. He gave us the statistics of the amount of rain we had this winter, last <Col N="781" /> winter and in 1991.  They were inordinately higher than that experienced for many years before that.  The Minister cannot do anything about the rainfall, but obviously it has been a major contributing factor.</P>

      <P>An interesting point which arose in the course of the presentation was what the ESB has done in Ardnacrusha with the canal and control of the flow of water in the river.  There seems to be some confusion about whose responsibility it is to maintain the river, particularly the stretch where the ESB has intervened.  I noted that other Senators were concerned about clearing silt.  I would like some clarification as to exactly whose responsibility it is.  In many areas there is one local authority on one side of the river and another local authority on the other side of the river.  There is much confusion as to whether the Office of Public Works or the local authorities are responsible and, if the local authorities are responsible, which local authority it is.  It may even be the Minister or the ESB in my area. I do not know whether the Minister can clarify that point.  That would be one of my main concerns.</P>
      <P>I am glad the legislation refers to wildlife, fisheries, landscape and so forth.  Obviously, we must preserve those aspects of the environment while we are concerned with the drainage issue. One matter of concern in that area is hogweed, a plant that grows along the edges of rivers.  This is probably not directly related to drainage but it is of concern to the Central Fisheries Board and probably to the Office of Public Works.  In talking about clearing rivers it is worth mentioning hogweed which might be impeding the flow of rivers also.</P>

      <P>The Minister arrived in Kilkenny yesterday and gave us the good news that Kilkenny will receive the money necessary to deal with its flooding problems.  I take issue with my colleague from Donegal who advised against involving experts, outside surveyors and engineers.  I was involved for a long time in discussions on the problem of flooding in the Kilkenny area. When we received our first detailed set of remedies it appeared that it might cost about £5.5 million to deal with flooding in the city and its environs.  As a result of many discussions with people in the Office of Public Works and others it has been suggested that we can deal with the five, ten or 25 year flood by spending about £390,000 &mdash; it was £350,000 yesterday.  We will accept the £390,000 &mdash; if not £400,000 &mdash; from the Minister to deal with the 25 year flood. There is no way we will be able to deal with the 100 year flood.</P>
      <P>In 1947 my aunt and uncle were taken out through the roof of their house in Green Street in Kilkenny because the floods were so bad they could not get out through the top window.  However, there was compensation in a sense for a number of people living in the flooded area because they were given first place on the waiting list for houses in a new housing scheme being built in Kilkenny at the time so my aunt and uncle received some benefit for being taken out through the roof of their home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="783" /> Kilkenny has always been subject to flooding.  The floods are not unexpected; they occur on a regular basis.  The area experiences ponding floods, pipette floods and other types of flooding. Sometimes the land around the river just ponds and the size of the river is not adequate to cope with the amount of water flowing into it.  In various places we have found that rebuilding the banks of the river to help the river to flow results in the pipette where the river flows much faster through the area and it does not create much damage downstream. In this Bill we want to ensure that if we create an effective damage resolution in one area we do not cause the same problem downstream.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Minister, uniquely, thanked Senator Daly for his work.  The Minister also recognised the work of the former Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and said that this legislation is not an immediate reaction to the problems of the last six months but is the result of extensive work that has been carried out by the Office of Public Works, the Department of Finance and former Ministers.  It is important when we deal with legislation to solve problems in any area that we acknowledge the fact that work does not simply start on the day the Minister is appointed but that it is the result of a long term approach.</P>
    <P>I am delighted we are not dealing with only river basins in this legislation, in other words, the Bill does not simply deal with the River Shannon from Clare to the Shannon pot, an area familiar to Senators who visit in search of votes. There is no point in thinking that any country could drain the land and eliminate problems on the Shannon, from the Shannon pot in Cavan to its estuary. The Minister has stated that in Galway some of the flooding problems have nothing to do with rivers.  He was referring to areas that, in Kilkenny, would be called &ldquo;bottom land&rdquo;.  There are no rivers to drain such land.  The water just sits on the bottom land until it evaporates in the sun's heat.  There is no other natural means of removing it.  The Minister <Col N="784" /> must ensure that the ingenuity of modern technology is used to tackle this problem which has been a cause of major concern in County Galway.</P>
    <P>Long before the Dutch thought of building dykes, there were dykes in south County Kilkenny as far as New Ross.  The land lies far below the level of the river but there are no major floods because a properly built dyke can prevent certain types of flood.  I wish to acknowledge the work of Harry Shine, an engineer who worked for the Office of Public Works in Kilkenny for many years.  He was very effective in predicting when the smaller tributaries of the Nore would rise, thus causing the Nore to rise and leading to flooding in Kilkenny city and its environs.  He was a dyke man in many ways; some want to build concrete walls but Harry Shine proved that in certain areas dykes are effective.  The Minister acknowledged yesterday that his work is of importance when we are trying to deal with localised flooding in Kilkenny.  However, localised flooding is not unique to Kilkenny; it occurs elsewhere.  The reasons for the problems in Kilkenny can be applied to other areas as well. We must acknowledge the work of the Office of Public Works on drainage throughout the country.  We see its results in the increased farming potential of land.</P>
    <P>The Bill acknowledges that in increasing the farming potential of land in many areas we have eliminated much of the wildlife and the reasons it would wish to stay in certain places.  The present world environment goes against this process, as does the economic advantage in Ireland, because EU legislation dictates that we take a certain amount of land out of production. Therefore, we are not going to attempt to get rid of areas which have been environmentally useful and important, especially boglands.</P>
    <P>The Bill is an amalgam of thought by many Ministers over a number of years on how to deal with specific flooding problems and on the best solutions required.  Do not go for a 100 per cent <Col N="785" /> solution to anything; try and solve minor problems in certain areas and in so doing major problems all over the country are eliminated.</P>
    <P>Amendments are required, which will be considered on Committee Stage.  The legislation will resolve certain problems in areas of the country.  It will not solve all of the problems of flooding throughout the country.  Nevertheless, it is welcome. The Minister acknowledged the input of Senator Daly, a former Minister, together with that of the former Minister, Deputy Dempsey, and the work of the Office of Public Works.  I also pay tribute to those in the Office of Public Works for the tremendous work they have undertaken throughout the country in maintaining and bringing back what we need.  They are apparently told that they do not work fast enough, but I would prefer to see somebody work nice and slowly and get the job done.  In this respect I acknowledge the expertise of the Office of Public Works in this area, as in many other areas of life in Ireland.  It should be thanked by the Irish people for the amount of work it has undertaken.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the Minister has produced this Bill and has acknowledged that it is not a start up Bill of his own, but an amalgam.  His acknowledgement of this is appreciated, and if more Ministers attended the House and said the same thing, the public and the generality of politicians would equally appreciate it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I hope it will be helpful, especially to those who have suffered much in recent months, not alone in the west but in other parts of the country also.  Hopefully, the Bill will be flexible enough to resolve other problems, problems which have been created by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Coillte and so on.  Flooding in villages and towns has resulted from farm developments which have taken place in the past ten to 15 years, and floods are now affecting villages, towns and public roads where flooding never occurred previously.  This <Col N="786" /> has arisen because all the ditches and such like have been removed, aided by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Teagasc and Coillte, through the harvesting of the State forests, where irresponsible contractors have created all kinds of problems.  It is another issue for the Minister to address.</P>
      <P>Local authorities feel helpless.  Their roads are torn up, there is flooding in their areas and they cannot take action. For example, if a stream is the cause of problems, they cannot address the problem because it is the responsibility of the Office of Public Works.  In addition, Coillte is untouchable.  Their contractors appear to be allowed run amok, causing havoc and problems for local authorities and the public.</P>
      <P>I have my doubts, but hopefully the Bill will be flexible enough to allow local authorities, in conjunction with the Office of Public Works, to attempt to resolve these problems, because they will not go away.  It will take much work to rectify the rivers, streams and roads which have been damaged by the heavy machinery in harvesting the timber.  In addition, there will have to be more thought put into farm development plans undertaken by Teagasc and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  For example, one can see two farms side by side, where one farmer has developed paddocks and the other farmer has left his ditches.  While we should not allow overgrown ditches, one farm has no flooding, but there is much flooding on the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is broad enough to address most problems.  However, I must refer to the serious situation on the River Suir at Ardfinnan, where terrible problems are created when, twice, every winter, all the houses in the area are flooded.  There are even greater problems in Clonmel.  My colleague, Senator McGowan spoke of consultants.  We spent £1.5 million to £2 million on the development of the first stage of the sewerage scheme, which was greatly needed.  At the same time, work was also undertaken, in conjunction with the <Col N="787" /> Office of Public Works, on the Mall. Yet, although weather conditions were extreme, the flooding of property was more severe than in the last 50 years.  A complete mess was made.  This does not say much for modern thinking in regard to resolving such problems.  As the project was not properly planned, parts of Clonmel were flooded which old people said had not happened in 50 years.</P>
    <P>I pity those, especially in the west of Ireland, who say they will never go back to live in their new homes.  Most of these people have not received a brass halfpenny from anybody, whether it is the Red Cross or any other organisation. All they have had over the past four or five months is the cross of a damp home, destroyed furniture and upset families. While their holdings are covered in water, we waffle on, with red tape and regulations telling us why we cannot do this or that.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister, as a country man, to cut out as much red tape as possible.  It is great growth industry, with lorry loads of reports and commissions piling up every five years.  In the meantime, members of the public are trying to survive and we need to think of them when their homes are in such a state.  Three former Ministers &mdash; Senator Daly, Deputy Dempsey and Deputy Noel Treacy &mdash; worked on this issue, which the Minister has acknowledged. This is an area which has operated under Victorian laws for far too long.  The people of Ireland will not sit through years of inquiries, investigations by consultants and reports piling up.  They cannot sit around when their homes are involved and their holdings are under water.  I appeal to the Minister to have as little red tape as possible involved in the administration of this Bill so that the people who have suffered most will have their problems solved quickly, they will not have heavy hearts next autumn, thinking that their holdings and homes will be destroyed by water and that they face another long winter.  If a person is stuck in a flood in a car it is a frightening experience, not <Col N="788" /> to mention having their home submerged in five or six feet of water.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to bring some commonsense into sections of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and also Coillte.  We have enough problems without a body like Coillte creating more.  Surely they must be well aware of that.  As I stated two months ago, my own local authority is taking Coillte to court because they destroyed our roads with machinery and simply left them in an untouchable state.  The bosses who employed the workers did not want to know.  They were untouchable also.  What would this country come to if we were to set up bodies like that?  We have faceless people who do a particular job but the buck does not stop anywhere.  Most local authorities are short of money. They try to do the best they can, but have an extra burden laid on them.  I am sure this problem is not confined to south Tipperary but is experienced in other counties where State forests are harvested.  I appeal to the Minister to look into this issue.  It is a grave problem. I wish the Minister and his staff every success with the Bill and I appeal for speedy action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. I welcome the introduction of the Bill. It is an important piece of legislation which will enable the Government to solve this most serious problem.  The present situation is limiting the power of the Commissioners of Public Works, because the Office of Public Works can only introduce drainage schemes where the flooding problem encompasses the entire catchment area of a river.  These schemes are usually very expensive.  The present limitation does not allow for the relief of local flooding.  I welcome the fact that the Bill will enable the Office of Public Works to undertake such schemes for the relief of localised flooding, while maintaining its powers under the present Act for the draining of an entire catchment area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is right that any scheme to relieve localised flooding must have regard to <Col N="789" /> the effect the work will have throughout the entire river.  Localised flooding has always been a problem.  There have been examples of this in my own area of Foynes village and in Shanagolden village in West Limerick, where there was extreme flooding damage.  There is also the ongoing Mulcair drainage issue. I welcome the fact that the work can be done jointly in certain areas with local authorities and other bodies.  This would enable work to be completed in areas of low priority on the Office of Public Works's list.  Areas which may be waiting for years, or which might never be dealt with if this provision was not in the Bill, can now be dealt with.  It will allow people in an area to assist and allow local authorities to create an initiative to have work done which might not be carried out otherwise.</P>
    <P>I welcome the section catering for the situation where, due to further development of land subsequent to the completion of a scheme, works are required to be carried out.  There are many cases where works which were once regarded as unjustifiable are later considered necessary if there have been housing developments etc..  This is now catered for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Mulcair drainage scheme, different sections can now be done each year.  The total cost of the Mulcair drainage scheme is in the region of £30 million to £40 million.  That is an impossible figure, but £1 million or £2 million in one year is not impossible. The work could be carried out over a period of years under this legislation. That might be the prudent way to tackle a problem, which if not tackled in this way might never be tackled.  I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. J. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all Senators for the varied and positive contributions they have made during the debate.  I will deal with the individual contributions in a moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious, from what has been said here and during the lengthy debates on this subject in February and March, that <Col N="790" /> we share a common aim of dealing with the serious problems arising from flooding which continue to plague us and have become even more pronounced in recent years.  I am confident that the Bill, as drafted, meets our current needs to deal with these problems in a positive way and will cover the various suggestions made by Members.  There will be more to be said on the subject when we deal with Committee Stage of the legislation. The introduction of the necessary drainage legislation is only one of the issues which have held our attention in recent months.  There has also been the Government's response to the immediate problems of those individuals who suffered most during recent floods in south Galway, Clare, Carlow, Kilkenny, Cork, Offaly and nationwide.</P>
    <P>What action was taken?  Senator Fahey's bout of self-righteous indignation, when he made the allegation that literally nothing had been done to address the problem, was probably one of the most ill-founded statements ever made in this House.  Collectively, between both Houses and a Minister of State appointed a mere three months ago, we have done more in the past three months than was done during the previous three, possibly the previous 50 years.  I would like to illustrate the exact position.</P>
    <P>On 7 February 1995, the Government established an interdepartmental committee, chaired by myself, to co-ordinate a response to the effects of bad weather. A national response plan to the effects of future occurrences of bad weather is now being prepared through this committee. The Government also decided in principle, at its meeting on 14 March 1995, to make funds available for the relief of hardship and distress for victims of severe flooding.  It is the intention to channel these funds through the Irish Red Cross Society.  An assessment of the extent and the scale of funding required is currently available.  I received a report this week headed &ldquo;Flooding 1995&rdquo; from Mr. Des Kavanagh, treasurer of the Irish Red Cross Society.  It lists the applications for flood <Col N="791" /> relief as follows: Carlow, 28; Clare, 38; Cork, one; Dublin, two; Galway/Gort, 134; Kilkenny, seven; Kerry, one; Leitrim, two; Limerick, six; Laois, one; Offaly, two; Roscommon, three; Tipperary, nine, and Wexford, two.  That represents a total of 236 applications. Mr. Kavanagh goes on to say: &ldquo;We have carried out some inspections of the damage.  We hope to complete visits early next week when the processing of all applications will commence and we will be in touch with you in due course.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As a voluntary organisation with the expertise and know-how to carry out these jobs with a minimum of fuss and red tape the Irish Red Cross Society has done a tremendous amount of work in a short period of time.  We can rest assured that the money will be in the hands of the people who need it in a short period of time, just as it was in 1993 and on previous occasions.  Until a complete picture is received, the cheques cannot be sent out.  Until the exact cost is determined, in terms of the liability from insured, non-insured and partially-insured properties, the cheques cannot be sent out.  Until we discover the number of houses that are repairable, refurbishable or that cannot be reoccupied, we will not get the complete picture.  We are determined to have the complete picture in a matter of days.</P>
    <P>I am happy to report that, through my own initiative, a sum of 325,000 ECUs in humanitarian aid was made available from the EU Commission for the relief of such distress in Ireland.  These funds will also be disbursed by the Irish Red Cross Society and applications are currently being assessed.  One of the key factors in influencing Secretary General Williamson and the European Union to include Ireland in the disaster fund &mdash; Ireland had not been included; the Dutch and the Germans were there ahead of us &mdash; was the fact that it had already been decided that the Irish Red Cross Society would be the administrative and executive agency to disburse the funds.  This was on the basis that it was <Col N="792" /> an international organisation which did the work effectively in the past.</P>
    <P>The Government has also made available, as has already been said on numerous occasions, a £2 million compensation fund to cover agricultural losses of stock and fodder arising from the bad weather and payments to date under this scheme have been made to over 500 farmers.  A sum of £50,000 was allocated from this fund to Galway County Council for the repair of roads and a further £4 million has been made available for the repair of county roads countrywide.</P>
    <P>Approval was given to the commissioning by the Office of Public Works of a special multi-disciplinary investigation into the causes of flooding in the south Galway area and which will recommend remedies to the problem.  A number of submissions have been made by consultants who are interested in carrying out the study and it is expected that a commission will be put in place shortly.  It has already been possible to carry out one scheme for the relief of flooding in County Galway and design work of two further flood affected areas has been initiated.</P>
    <P>An emergency co-ordination centre or one-stop-shop was established in Gort, County Galway, staffed by representatives of the Western Health Board, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Galway County Council, the Irish Red Cross Society and the Office of Public Works.  Some 500 callers have been assisted in relation to claims for compensation, rehousing and humanitarian aid.</P>
    <P>Army vehicles have been deployed for the transport of school children to and from schools and to provide other assistance as required in the south Galway area.  The Army Air Corps, using helicopters, have carried out over 200 cargo sorties, transporting almost 100 tonnes of fodder, fuel, foodstuffs and medicines to stricken householders.  The Government decided to provide a Supplementary Estimate this year to enable specified drainage works to go ahead. These will commence after the enactment of the new Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="793" /> Notwithstanding all these measures which I think the House will agree reflect the extent of our commitment to the resolution of the plight of all those affected, the physical remedying of the causes of the problem must now start. With the enactment of the current Bill, we will be able to commence work on the ground in selected areas.  In this connection, I have noted with interest the representations made in respect of the many areas around the country which have suffered most.  In drawing up our future programme of work, all these will be considered and be taken into account and the majority of them will be got to in due course.</P>
    <P>However, for the immediate future it has been decided to concentrate on a number of areas.  The Commissioners of Public Works are at present undertaking the necessary survey data, collection and design work in these areas under its existing powers and with the goodwill of the landowners onto whose land they have had to go.  It is, however, essential that they be given the powers proposed in this Bill before any substantial work can commence on site.  The criteria used in selecting the priority areas were primarily the severity of flooding and the availability of most of the necessary data, for example, where flow measuring devices have been installed for a period of years or where previous studies have been made.</P>
    <P>In Galway, there are a number of areas where the hardship is particularly obvious.  I have already referred to the proposal for the study in the south Galway area.  In the town of Gort itself, it has been possible to identify likely solutions and these are being examined.  At Belclare near Tuam, excavation to lower the level of existing flooding has already been undertaken successfully while a scheme for the Williamstown area is also been considered.  This, like the south Galway region, is a highly sensitive area and detailed examination of the likely impacts of the works on the environment have to be, will be and are, necessary in advance of work commencing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="794" /> Consulting engineers have been appointed to design a flood release scheme for Carlow while in Kilkenny, designs prepared by consultants engaged by the local authority are being examined as a matter of urgency. Designs for schemes for the Cappaghmore, Newport and Sixmilebridge areas of Counties Limerick, Tipperary and Clare, respectively, are well advanced and the necessary data is being collated at Duleek, County Meath.  Options for flood relief in Dunmanway, County Cork, will also be assessed shortly.  As can be seen, the areas involved are geographically widespread and it is hoped to commence further work during the year.</P>
    <P>I will now return to the Bill itself.  The House will note that I have not included a provision for payment of compensation to people who may have suffered loss or damage through flooding.  I do not consider it appropriate to make such a provision for a number of reasons which I will outline briefly.  I would also point out that the heads of the Bill, which I inherited from the present Opposition, did not contain any such provision.</P>
    <P>It would be normal, and I submit entirely reasonable, to expect that people and businesses would insure against loss due to exceptional events such as flooding and it would be entirely inappropriate for the State, on behalf of the taxpayer, to say that we are going to assume all that responsibility.  Furthermore, there is a duty on people to take reasonable precautions to protect their property from damage.  I recognise that there are some areas where it may be difficult to reinsure property which has been damaged by regular flooding but I must emphasise that the objective of this Bill is to provide for the removal, elimination or alleviation of flooding and the elimination for all time of the risk in the selected areas that I have already decided to announce.</P>
    <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is operated by the health boards on behalf of the Department of Social Welfare, has provision to cater <Col N="795" /> for emergencies such as severe flooding. The Government has shown by its response to the most recent flooding incidents that the State does have the capacity to provide assistance, in monetary and practical terms, when and where it is most needed.  The House will be aware of the many measures that have been implemented already and the Government has promised to establish a further humanitarian aid fund, the nature and extent of the need for which is currently being examined.</P>
    <P>A statutory scheme would be extremely difficult to frame.  It may end up being too rigid, too inflexible, and there would also be the apparent risk of excluding some deserving cases that could be assisted far more satisfactorily under the existing regimes.  In the circumstances and in the light of all that has been said, I look forward confidently to the continued support of the House in completing the remaining Stages.</P>
    <P>I want to pay a special tribute to Senator Daly because he initiated a Private Members' Bill in this House.  We gave a commitment in good faith that enshrining the sentiments and spirit of this Bill would be taken on board and we have enshrined vast tranches of the Bill in this regard.  Indeed, we have taken one section of that Bill <i>in toto.</i>  I hope that the constructive atmosphere that has prevailed throughout the debate since the flooding crisis came to a head in February will prevail for the remaining Stages of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I want to reply to the provision that Senator Daly seeks to enshrine as part and parcel of his previous Bill before the House.  The thought that one could go in without preparing a scheme on an emergency basis is fraught with danger. The time constraints have been so considerably removed and reduced that we will be able to move.  The Local Authorities (Works) Act, 1949, is already in place and provides a mechanism for a local authority to go in immediately on its own initiative and tackle a problem. Emergency flooding in a small area, the <Col N="796" /> release of gullies and so on, can be dealt with.  All the local services which come under the ambit, remit, powers, scope and jurisdiction of the local authority can go in there.  However, to embark by way of enshrining in legislation a provision that one can go in willy nilly with Hymacs and JCBs without conducting a design is not on.  We cannot, and will not, provide for it, the EU will not allow it and, as has been said by Senator Henry, when one tackles a scheme like that without taking due cognisance of the downstream effects, one is obviously taking on board a number of dangerous possibilities in terms of tampering with water schemes and other services there, apart altogether from the environmental considerations.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to combat, cope, deal with, alleviate and eliminate flooding.  If the Bill is effective, and it will be, there will be no need for a compensation proviso.  I am determined that once this Bill is put in place, the tenets, teeth and action enshrined in it will be acted on immediately and the misery suffered by the people in the areas affected this year will no longer be a feature of their day to day lives in winters to come.</P>
    <P>Therefore, pressing this aspect of the compensatory element and putting into legislation that we, as legislators and taxpayers, must provide for fundamental statutory compensation is not on and is not needed.  We did not need it this year; we acted immediately and we are in the process of putting a compensation scheme in place.  People will be rewarded on the basis of their needs so that what is <i>in situ</i> now will be in place for the future and can be acted on under the new legislation.  As I said, this provision was not in the heads of the Bill we inherited from my predecessor, the former Minister for State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Dempsey.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Taylor-Quinn for her keen appreciation of the difficulties of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, and the legislative constraints it placed on me.  I also thank her for spelling out in clear detail what is intended by section 6 of <Col N="797" /> the Bill, which has been generally welcomed. Under that section we can now undertake joint ventures with local authorities and individuals, and with Iarnród Éireann if there is a railway line involved.  The Senator mentioned a place called Ballycar where a railway line is involved and we can now act. From now on we can go in as the need arises, as resources permit, where there is a willingness on the part of the communities to act of their own volition in conjunction with us, and work out a multiplicity of arrangements to relieve flooding.  I thank the other Senators whose contributions were extremely constructive.</P>
    <P>Senator Fahey was gracious in thanking me for bringing forward the legislation but that is where the rapport between us ended.  I have seldom heard such a litany of bile, most of it highly erroneous, misleading, unfounded and unfair.  He said that not a single thing has been done for the people of south Galway.  I have visited south Galway with my officials on numerous occasions.  I have been in the houses in Glenbrack that were shown on &ldquo;Six One News&rdquo; tonight.  I have seen at first hand the trauma, tragedy and devastation that is the lot of those people and I am determined that they will be looked after and whatever provision is needed will be made.</P>
    <P>There has been a general acknowledgement that we have done everything possible within the constraints upon us and the resources available to us.  I was very happy to be the recipient of an award from the local community in Gort at the beginning of May when people buried the political hatchet and were prepared to come together to say that a job was well done, and to thank the State and the State services for the manner in which they tackled the problem. Unfortunately Senator Fahey was not present for this gala occasion.</P>
    <P>The people of south Galway are top of our agenda when it comes to compensation. We have set up a one-stop-shop there to which 500 people have called. At present the assessment is being carried <Col N="798" /> out and will be completed within a matter of days.  We have already paid several hundred farmers in south Galway up to £4,000 compensation for the loss of livestock and fodder.  As a result of the strong representations made to us by the people of south Galway, we have extended the scheme to include not only loss of livestock and fodder but grassland which, because it was so long under water, will not be available for summer grazing.  There is a general acknowledgement in south Galway and in Senator Fahey's immediate neighbourhood that a good job has been done.</P>
    <P>Senator Fahey made the point that not a single act or initiative will be possible under this legislation.  I was delighted to be in Kilkenny yesterday to listen to representations from Kilkenny Corporation and Kilkenny County Council and to receive, as in Senator Lanigan's very constructive contribution tonight, the acknowledgement that Kilkenny's difficulties for the last number of years will now be ended because the necessary work will start this year. Work will also start in the following nine areas: Carlow, Dunmanway, Belclare, Williamstown, Sixmilebridge, Duleek, County Louth, and in Newport, Tipperary and that is just the beginning. Work could not start up to now because our hands were tied by the 1945 Act.  It was a fine Act in its day but it has run its course and no longer meets the exigencies of the current situation.</P>
    <P>We are in the process of drawing up our priority list and while there are nine schemes this year, there will be more schemes next year and the following year.  People have asked whether the funds will be available.  I have already received the assurance of the goodwill of the Cabinet on this issue.  There is a commitment on the part of the Government that this legislation is not simply an empty formula, it is a legislative process which will end once and for all the flooding difficulties in many areas.  As Senator Lanigan said, no legislation is perfect.  Rome was not built in a day and we cannot tackle all the problems together.  We are establishing the <Col N="799" /> priority list and are according priority status to the areas which have flooded households.  We will then move on to other categories of building.  However, flooded households and dislodged families have to be our primary concern and that is why we have begun with the nine schemes announced this week with this Bill.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Magner who rebutted the allegations that the memorandum contains some kind of dilution of our commitment.  Anybody who knows about the preparation and presentation of legislation knows, as Senator Magner rightly put it, that one fights one's corner for legislation first.  When the Bill is in place, then one fights for funding.  We have already fought for these resources. I thank Senator Henry for her very constructive contribution and for putting the situation in perspective.  This was an unusual year in that rainfall was 250 per cent higher than normal.  It cannot be said with certainty that widespread flooding is over, that next year will be any different or that we are in a cyclical pattern that is now ended.  Unfortunately, four of the last six years have recorded rainfall levels above the average.</P>
    <P>There is an ominous indication that the experience this year could well be the experience for years to come.  That is why we have decided to amend the legislation.  I share the Senator's concerns about the possible environmental impact.  That is why it is vital that we appoint consultants.  It is very easy to denigrate consultants, to say that the money should be spent at the coal-face, but it is necessary to go through the consultative process to get the best professional expertise because if we get it wrong the costs will still be high.</P>
    <P>I can assure Senator McDonagh that south Galway is a priority.  Some 31 companies, experts from Ireland, Great Britain and the European Union, have made substantial submissions in relation to their interest in carrying out a geological hydrological study of the south Galway area.  We are confident from the <Col N="800" /> level of expertise indicating an interest in this area that at long last a solution will be found.</P>
    <P>I am amused at Senator Fahey's homespun solution to the problem.  I wonder where it has been for the last seven years.  Would that there was an easy homespun solution to the problem; there is not.  A maze of factors must be considered, elements so diverse that nobody has yet managed to make a recommendation.  However, we are determined to find the best solution to deal with the problem and I am confident that the necessary recommendations will be made to enable us to find a long term solution.  Judging by the expertise and commitment evident in the expert submissions made so far, we are confident that we will be in a position at some stage in the near future to find a solution to the problem.</P>
    <P>I take on board the points made by Senator Dardis, although he seems somewhat confused.  On the one hand he wants a quick, effective and efficient response, while on the other hand he wants the potential for environmental consequences to be taken into consideration. We cannot have it both ways.  If we are to go in, we must do so after due consultation and consideration of all the consequences.  Senator Dardis also asked what was meant by &ldquo;substantial compulsory interference.&rdquo;  This means &mdash; it is also in the Principal Act &mdash; something which is part of the scheme, or substantial works which are part and parcel of what is going on at a particular point.  It must be differentiated from other works which are accidental, such as where in the process of carrying out the works a pillar or a pier is knocked down.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis asked about vesting notices and what exactly was meant by &ldquo;on or near the site.&rdquo;  This part of the Bill has been cogged from the Shannon Navigation Act, 1990, where that was the terminology used.  We are talking about putting notification of the intention to vest the land &mdash; compulsory acquisition &mdash; as near as possible to it. Often that may be determined by <Col N="801" /> whether or not the land is flooded.  If it is flooded there is no point putting a sign in the middle of a flooded field because it would not be legible&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or float away. Senator Dan Kiely sought clarification in relation to section 6, which is one of the novelties in the Bill.  As I said when acknowledging Senator Taylor-Quinn's contribution, it enables the Office of Public Works to enter into agreements with landowners, householders, agencies, organisations or local authorities to put particular schemes in place.  He also said that nothing was included for County Kerry.  Nothing has been included for that county because unfortunately it did not figure in the division A list of grave or serious cases, although it will in due course.  He made a point about roads being washed away. That is a matter which would be better addressed by the Minister for the Environment and the county council.</P>
      <P>Senator Sherlock mentioned the Blackwater catchment scheme.  He seemed to be under a misapprehension that that scheme had fallen out of consideration. It has not.  It is listed No. 18 on the priority list.  He also asked for elucidation on what was meant by &ldquo;must have regard to the possible effects of the proposed works on the entire river basin&rdquo;.  It is obvious what is meant by that.  It was one of the points raised yesterday when I addressed Carlow County Council, which did not want to eliminate Carlow's problems by moving them downstream to Loughlinbridge. It is obvious when one goes into an area to carry out a scheme that preparation, consultation and evaluation must take place first.  There is no point transferring the misery of Carlow down to Loughlinbridge.  That is what we mean by taking into consideration the entire river basin.  There is noting sinister contained in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="802" /> I thank Senator Townsend for his complimentary contribution.  He made the point about the Loughlinbridge situation very effectively.  Senators Finneran and Mullooly said there was a lot of anxiety and anger in County Roscommon because it was not included.  I visited County Roscommon and the public representative from that area and we had a convivial chat in a Mrs. Earley's public house.  There was an appreciation that this was the first time officials from the Office of Public Works had stood in that area, although it was not the first time it was flooded.  That point has been well made.  We will deal with County Roscommon, provided there are solutions to its problems.  We do not know whether there are solutions.  It is like the south Galway conundrum in that there are basins, reservoirs and trapped waters which must be removed.  How we do this will be the subject of much consideration and study.  Since we visited County Roscommon officials from the Office of Public Works have taken water and land levels on a regular basis. I assure Members that we are actively considering the dilemma of the Castleplunket, Ballintober, Bushfield and other areas which have suffered in terms of what those in south Galway suffered, but at least households were not flooded.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators Naughten, McGowan, O'Sullivan, Lanigan and Byrne for their contributions.  I thank Senator Neville for giving a succinct analysis of the legislation and the constraints imposed by the 1945 Act and a crisp presentation of the more salient sections of the Bill.  Senator Lanigan was extremely positive and constructive. He showed a commonsense approach, which should be characteristic of such a Bill, to tackle a problem which crosses and transcends county boundaries, county divisions, party political allegiances and prejudices.  I thank Senator Lanigan for looking at the Bill <i>in toto</i> and the downstream effects and consequences.  I thank him for putting down a salient solitary reminder that while we might with the best will in the <Col N="803" /> world enshrine legislation to deal with the problem, we will never get it 100 per cent right.  I believe that this Bill is 98 per cent right and I am determined that as soon as it is enacted and on the Statue Book before the summer, we will tackle the nine areas and the swallowholes in south Galway and we will look at other areas and prioritise them.  We will put in place a regime so people in those areas, who have been neglected in the past, will look back and say it all began in 1995.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for Health for coming to the House tonight. The matter before the House is the need for the Minister to set up a commission to bring forward best practice in the area of medically assisted reproduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The advance made in the past 20 years in medically assisted reproduction has brought the joy of children to many couples who in the past would have remained childless.  Initially, the procedures were quite simple; but during the past 20 years treatments have evolved which have medical, ethical, social and legal implications.  Irish centres for medically assisted reproduction have a success rate which compares <Col N="804" /> with the best international ones. However, despite our long experience in this field we have not, as pointed out by Dr. David Tomkin and Dr. Patrick Hanafin in their recent book on Irish medical law, any legislation in this area. At present we rely on doctors, counsellors and scientists following the extralegal guidelines set down by The Medical Council.  These have mainly been put forward by the Council of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and most of the doctors involved in the fields of medically assisted reproduction would be members of the institute.</P>
    <P>Without any legislation in this area we must rely on these guidelines and foreign legal decisions as to what the law here would be if we had any.  This is an unsatisfactory situation and I suggest that the Minister for Health set up a commission to advise him on legislation which is appropriate in this area.  As well as legal and medical input, it should include lay people, particularly those who have been involved in treatment. Assistance from the members of the Association for the Improvement of the Maternity Services would also be invaluable.</P>
    <P>Legislation in this field varies from country to country and from restrictive legislation, which is often brought about by a call from the public for legislation when something startling happens &mdash; for example, in Italy the extension of motherhood to those well beyond the menopause, to little legislation in other places.  Without going into details about the legislation in other countries, the report by the committee chaired by Dame Mary Warnock in Great Britain is well known and led to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act, 1990.</P>
    <P>The application of assisted contraception techniques, such as <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation, gamete interfallopian transfer, surrogate motherhood, etc.  are complex, social, emotional and ethical problems. Questions must be asked about some of the procedures &mdash; for example, are they safe and ethical?  Should &ldquo;can&rdquo; necessarily mean &ldquo;should&rdquo; or &ldquo;ought&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="805" /> While there are few legal prohibitions on aspects of assisted reproduction in the United Kingdom, other countries are more restrictive.  France and Norway, neither of which are known as illiberal countries, have quite restrictive legislation.  The various treatments are evolving so rapidly that the legislation needs to be kept under constant review.</P>
    <P>I suggested a commission because a wide range of views are needed on this subject, which not only concerns the couple involved and the medical team but also the child born following treatment, and society.  At present we are failing to accept responsibility for regulating treatments, although we are aware they are being carried out here, or for Irish citizens in clinics in Northern Ireland or Great Britain.  The revelation in the press recently that an Irish woman had gone to England to have treatment to enable her to act as a surrogate mother for an Irish couple who live here should make us realise that the use of advanced technology highlights the legal difficulties which could occur in such situations.</P>
    <P>The lack of financial equity as regards treatment is important.  An initial costing exercise was carried out years ago in St. James' Hospital and a submission was sent to the Department of Health regarding the funding of a national unit. However, little has been heard from the Department.  At present the overall cost of a treatment cycle is approximately £1,500.  Medical card holders are treated free because the fees of private patients are increased sufficiently to enable this to happen.  While infertility may not be regarded as an illness, it seems inconsistent not to facilitate treatment for those of less adequate means, given our emphasis on the value of the unitary family.  Private patients can reclaim fees against income tax and money spent on drugs is refunded by the health boards. However, the huge financial cost for young couples means that the State has a responsibility to carefully monitor the clinics where this treatment is carried out.  Who is measuring the take home <Col N="806" /> baby rate, as it is called?  Is self-monitoring suitable?</P>
    <P>Issue Ireland was formed last December by Irish couples with infertility problems to try to improve the situation. The main concern is that information should be easily available about what is on offer here and where treatment can be got abroad and its cost.  A licensing authority is urgently needed. While I have no evidence of malpractice, we are dealing with vulnerable people who require the State to monitor the clinics they attend.  The extra legal guidelines of The Medical Council should be replaced by laws.  These guidelines exclude unmarried couples which causes great difficulties in a State without divorce.</P>
    <P>Egg donation is forbidden, but we have approximately 700 women with Turner's Syndrome in this country who cannot produce eggs but could otherwise become mothers if donated eggs were available.  Donor sperm appears to be available to help married and unmarried couples for artificial insemination, but cannot be used by married couples for <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation.  Freezing of embryos is not allowed, but eight or nine eggs are normally produced by hyperstimulation.  Since three is the optimum number to put in the uterus to allow for implantation, the rest must be placed in the cervix because it is essential that they are used.  This is a waste of the fertilised eggs.  This means that the woman must undergo further hyperstimulation which is medically dangerous and costs £1,200 or £1,500 for another cycle.</P>
    <P>This area of medicine should be regulated here for ethical, medical, physical and legal reasons.  I urge the Minister to set up a commission to assist him to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I listened carefully to Senator Henry's contribution this evening and she has spoken to me previously on the problems and opportunities which arise from dramatic developments in this particular area of <Col N="807" /> medical science.  I thank her for her constructive and thoughtful contribution.</P>
      <P>Major developments have taken place in recent years in medical science's ability to control the human reproductive system.  <i>In vitro</i> fertilisation and allied techniques are, in particular, a significant advance for the treatment in certain cases of human fertility.  <i>In vitro</i> fertilisation is governed by guidelines issued by the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland and approved by The Medical Council.  As with other medical procedures, I consider that the regulation of medically assisted reproduction is a matter for the hospitals and consultants concerned in accordance with the guidelines set down by The Medical Council and the principles established by the relevant professional bodies.  As a general rule, these bodies are best qualified to regulate the activities of fertility clinics in Ireland.</P>
      <P>
        <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, the policy document of the Government, contains a commitment to publish a plan for the development of health services for women.  The discussion document on women's health which will be published shortly will, <i>inter alia</i>, comment briefly on the question of medically assisted reproduction.  This document will form the basis for consultation with all those interested in improving the health and welfare of Irish women and is to be circulated to all relevant bodies in the near future.</P>
      <P>Following this consultative and participative process, consideration will then be given to seeking the best way forward in relation to the many issues raised in the document, including the question of medically assisted reproduction. It is appropriate to await the outcome of this process before deciding on the further steps, along the lines suggested by Senator Henry, which may need to be taken in order to guide and regulate practice in this sensitive and rapidly developing area of medicine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this matter on the need for the appointment of a remedial teacher to service the primary schools at Ballingarry, Granagh, Kilmeedy and Banogue in County Limerick.</P>
      <P>These schools have a large number of multiple classes and the children are in need of remedial teaching.  There are 95 children in Ballingarry girls' school, 35 in Ballingarry boys' school, 95 in Granagh national school, 93 in Kilmeedy national school and 59 in Banogue national school, a total of 377 children. Pupils of the schools have been assessed by the Brothers of Charity at Bawnmore and remedial help has been recommended for them.  Consequently, pupils have had to transfer outside the school area where remedial help is available. Some of the parents are forced to pay for private tuition for children in need of this assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the nation's children should be treated equally.  Children in smaller rural schools should have the same facilities and opportunities as those in large urban areas.  However, the children in Ballingarry, Granagh, Kilmeedy and Banogue schools requiring remedial help are being deprived of it.  This is unfair and discriminatory.  I appreciate that the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Jim Higgins, was not in office when previous decisions were made, but I ask him to convey to the Department of Education our wish to ensure that the situation is <Col N="809" /> corrected and that a remedial teacher will be appointed for the commencement of the next school year to the areas I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>When a child is in need of remedial teaching, it is important that he or she gets help at primary level.  The problem of educational disadvantage must be addressed at this stage.  It is important that the identification of problems is made at an early stage in a child's school life.  Children who are unable to cope with school must be professionally assisted and the inability of schools to cope with these children must also be addressed.  Children with problems in Ballingarry, Granagh, Kilmeedy and Banogue do not have a remedial teacher and are thus being discriminated against by the Department.</P>
    <P>Under-achievement in school is not unique and is present in all communities. With the expectations and pressures placed on children to perform, it is essential that remedial teaching is available to all who require it.  Learning difficulty is viewed as the gap between the attainment by pupils and their potential. Remedial teaching aims at closing the gap by providing additional specialised teaching on an individual or small group basis.</P>
    <P>In the schools I am discussing there are children in need of this assistance and until it is available to them the education system will have failed them.  The absence of remedial teaching is clearly identified in the transition of pupils from primary to secondary schools. Such pupils experience extreme difficulties and many do not complete secondary education.</P>
    <P>Some months ago we discussed long term unemployment.  People who need remedial teaching and do not receive it are more likely to be in the category of the long term unemployed because of their failure in the education system and because they do not reach their potential as a remedial service is not available to them.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for State for coming to the House and I look forward to his reply.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Neville's call for a remedial teacher in the schools he mentioned.  I am familiar with them; one of them is in my parish. Rural schools are as deserving of remedial teachers as urban schools.  I have an interest in these neighbouring schools with which Senator Neville is very familiar.</P>
      <P>I received a letter last year from the Minister for Education.  Although there has been a change of Government, she is still Minister for Education.  In her letter she said there would be adequate funding and that she was interested in providing remedial teachers.  I trust she will give a positive reply to the need for remedial teachers in these schools.  It would be interesting to know the number of remedial teachers in rural schools in her county.  I have pleasure in supporting the matter raised by Senator Neville about the need for remedial teachers in these schools.</P>

      <P>I apologise for the inability of the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Currie, to come to the House. Unfortunately, he was already committed to another engagement and could not be here.</P>
      <P>As has been indicated to the House in the past, remedial education at primary level is a matter in the first instance for the ordinary class teachers.  The majority of pupils with remedial needs would, therefore, be helped within the scope of the normal teaching service. However, it is acknowledged that remedial teachers constitute the main additional resource for addressing the problem of under-achievement in primary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Substantial additional resources have been allocated to this area in recent years.  In 1994 an additional 100 remedial teachers were appointed to primary schools and 350 schools with approximately 34,000 pupils benefited from this allocation.  This brought the total number of remedial teachers in place to 1,133.  Of the 3,209 ordinary <Col N="811" /> national schools throughout the country, approximately 2,061 now have the services of a remedial teacher, either on a full-time or a shared basis.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education recently announced her intention to appoint an additional 55 remedial teachers in the current year.  Decisions in relation to the allocation of these posts will be made shortly following the collection and analysis of information from schools by the Department's primary inspectorate. The posts will then be allocated on the basis of priority of need, as indicated by the information collected.</P>
    <P>Of the 148 ordinary national schools in County Limerick, 103 now have the <Col N="812" /> services of a remedial teacher, either on a full-time or shared basis.  This includes 23 schools allocated a remedial service in the current school year as part of the recent distribution of posts.  This means that 85 per cent of the pupils attending ordinary national schools in County Limerick currently enjoy a remedial service.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Senator that the needs of Ballingarry, Granagh, Kilmeedy and Banogue national schools will be considered in the context of the allocation of remedial posts in 1995.</P>
