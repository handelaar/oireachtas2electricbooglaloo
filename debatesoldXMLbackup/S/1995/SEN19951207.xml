      <P>I have notice from Senator Sherlock that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Justice if she is satisfied with the criteria that apply to the granting of lottery licences.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Enright of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to look into the threatened withdrawal of the Circuit Court from Birr, County Offaly.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Farrelly of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to consider the possibility of increasing the number of permanent gardaí in the Meath coastal area.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Rory Kiely of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to provide assistance to the Neodata plants in Newcastlewest and Kilmallock, <Col N="1070" /> County Limerick, which are due to close at Christmas.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to ensure that State agencies immediately find replacement industries following the closure of the Neodata factories in Newcastlewest and Kilmallock, County Limerick.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Daly of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to indicate the funds available for small local sports and recreation projects; and if she will sanction funds for such projects in County Clare.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Sherlock's and Senator Enright's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I announce the Order of Business for today I would inform colleagues that it is proposed to sit three days next week and two days &mdash; Tuesday and Wednesday &mdash; the following week.  Today's business is items 1, 2 and 3.  Item 3 will be taken at 1 p.m. for 30 minutes.  It is proposed that the Tánaiste will speak for ten minutes, each speaker thereafter will have five minutes and the statements will conclude at 1.30 p.m.  If the morning's business has not concluded there will be a sos from 1.30 p.m. to 2 p.m. and we will recommence at 2 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader of the House for indicating the sittings for the next two weeks.  I referred yesterday to two motions under item 14, motions 2 and 21.  With regard to funding for Border areas, we are concerned about the <Col N="1071" /> funds available from Structural Funds, the Delors package, the Clinton package and Exchequer funds. We would not wish these funds to be subsumed into Exchequer funds; they are important for the development of the Border counties.  Would the Leader find time to discuss this matter between now and the Christmas recess or make it a priority for the new year?</P>
      <P>Senator Finneran will refer to motion 21.  As we understand newspaper reports on the Minister for Health's discussions in relation to this matter, we are not happy with the state of affairs. We would like the matter discussed in the House as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the issue of the Intergovernmental Conference. We discussed the Reflection Group last week but the time was probably too short for the number of speakers who wished to contribute.  Few of the Members had access to information about the Intergovernmental Conference. Some speakers felt they were not kept informed.  The Institute for European Affairs, which is a non-partisan group, has issued an accessible and comprehensive document on the Intergovernmental Conference.  Consideration should be given to supplying each Member of the Oireachtas with a copy of that report.  It is an accessible document which covers the issues. Senator Lanigan, among others, made the point last week that we need more information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Reflection Group did not deal with the common European currency which, for most people, is the crucial issue.  Having got information for people, I ask the Leader that we address the implications for Ireland of a single European currency and whether the UK will join, which was not addressed last week in any comprehensive way.  I am trying to keep a debate going on this important European issue.  Members of the Joint Committee on European Affairs are kept reasonably up to date but other Members of the House are <Col N="1072" /> not aware of the issues.  I propose that each Member should receive, if possible, a copy of the Institute of European Affairs' significant study, which was led by former Senator Dooge.  We should have a further discussion on European currency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the remarks made by Senator O'Toole in respect of the Intergovernmental Conference, which is coming quickly.  It is important for us to discuss its impact.  The future of the Defence Forces has been brought up on almost a weekly basis for many weeks, dating back to the last session. It is important to address and allay, if possible, those concerns.  I recommend to the Leader to make time available to consider defence issues between now and the recess.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, the Leader indicated that many economic concerns could be dealt with under the Appropriation Bill.  Is he confident that we will have a Book of Estimates to consider when we come to deal with the Appropriation Bill? Should we congratulate the Labour Party Minister for Finance on putting spending constraints on the Fine Gael Party?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that he is trying to put constraints on the Minister, Deputy Proinsias De Rossa, at the moment.  Has the Leader's attention been drawn to the report of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland which has issued disturbing facts in relation to radiation accidents and the problems in relation to radon in private dwellings? Could the Leader indicate when we will have an opportunity to discuss the report?  Could the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, who is responsible for these matters, give the House some indication of what will be done about this report?  The report pointed to very <Col N="1073" /> high levels of radon in houses, which indicates the necessity for Government finances to deal with the situation.  Radiation accidents are even more disturbing. Can we have an explanation of the licences which allow people to use radiation in order to ensure that people are protected from the dangers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader convey to the Government the support of the House, which I hope comes from all sides, for adhering to the fiscal discipline which has been an essential component of the economic wellbeing which we now enjoy?  I was privileged to be a member of the Government in 1987, which took difficult decisions and laid the foundation for the economic growth which we now enjoy.  Will the Leader convey, on behalf of the House, our commitment to maintaining that programme, which is linked with the Maastricht guidelines?  If we let it go now, all that we have achieved in the last number of years will be forfeited.</P>
      <P>If there are to be controls on public expenditure &mdash; with which I agree entirely as I was part of the Government which did it &mdash; I suggest looking at the growth in the number of agencies in recent years and, at the same time, maintaining the social programme which is a vitally important element of our society.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House ask the Minister of Health to come here to respond to the matter mentioned by my leader, which is the report that he has made an offer to those infected by anti-D products and who are suffering from hepatitis C?  This scandal occurred as a result of the negligence of a State agency whereby 1,300 women were infected.  What has been reported does not meet the demands of the women involved.  They have demanded that the tribunal be set up on a statutory basis, which I understand is not part of the Minister's proposal.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader and the House are aware that my party withdrew a motion in this House some time ago on the basis of allowing discussions between Positive Action and the Minister for Health.  Those discussions are now complete, according to the reports, but they have not met the demands of Positive Action or of the motion which we withdrew and which is still on the Order Paper.  Will the Leader provide Government time, possibly next week or the week after, to discuss the Minister's proposals?  Otherwise, my party will be forced to move its motion on the matter.  However, I would prefer if the Leader allowed Government time for this serious matter which we have held on the agenda in order to allow the Minister to finalise his discussions and reach agreement.  That has obviously not taken place, according to today's reports.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House request the Minister for Justice to get out her starting blocks in order to be ready for the British move towards Central European Time, as I understand that a Private Members' Bill on Central European Time is coming before the House of Commons in the very near future?  I brought this up on a number of occasions and received a good hearing from the Minister in the past.  We are afraid to leave the nursery unless nanny comes with us &mdash; we should be willing to leave the nursery now, even it nanny does not come with us.  If we move now, before the British do, it will help to push them in the direction of the benefits which we will get from Central European Time.  It would <Col N="1075" /> be a shame for us to be seen once again to follow rather than lead.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to be aware of the threat and opportunity posed by the BSE threat to beef in the British market?  Steps have been taken in the last 24 hours which threaten the whole beef industry.  It is a serious threat to us but it is also an opportunity for Ireland to single itself out as Irish beef is different and consumers can be confident of its quality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that Senators O'Toole and Dardis raised the matter of the reflection group on the Intergovernmental Conference.  I raised that matter yesterday and suggested that there was not enough information in order to have a debate.  The Minister made a minor attack on me and suggested that if I had telephoned his office he would have given me any information he had on the matter.  However, all that was on offer was a preview of the script which he was going to read to the Seanad.  The Dooge report is an excellent report on the review group and the Intergovernmental Conference.  I join with the other Members in asking, as I did yesterday, for a full debate on the reflection group's work.  The Minister suggested that I was wrong in saying that we did not have enough information, but obviously the other Members agree with me.</P>
      <P>Can we have a discussion with the Minister on the role of the Office of the DPP, the rules on bail and the release of defendants pending a DPP report? People are committing crimes in this country and it takes up to 12 months in some cases and sometimes up to 18 months&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just asking the Leader to ask the Minister to come here to discuss this matter.  A convicted murderer <Col N="1076" /> left Ireland for 18 months and came back of his own volition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not discussing the matter now.  The Senator has put his question to the Leader, who knows quite clearly what the Senator wants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister to come here to discuss the role of the DPP?  He suggested before that perhaps the Seanad was not the right place to discuss the role of the DPP, but I ask him to ask the Minister for Justice to come here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also wish to raise the issue of women affected by hepatitis C. I spoke to members of Positive Action last night, who were disappointed that their negotiations with the Minister had ended without agreement.  They acknowledge the health proposals offered are what they wanted; their difficulty is with the tribunal.  They were willing to set aside the demand for a statutory tribunal if agreement could be reached with the Minister and there are only a few outstanding matters relating to the permanency of the tribunal and interim payments.</P>
      <P>The Supplementary Estimate for the tribunal will be before the Dáil Select Committee on Social Affairs today but this House has never had an opportunity to discuss the issue.  It is essential that the Minister for Health come here by next week at the latest, especially since this scandal first came to our attention in February 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1077" />
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I call for a debate on the committee set up by the Taoiseach on devolution of powers to local authorities. The vast majority of Members of this House are on local authorities and it is appropriate that the issue be debated here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Later today the UK immigration authorities will announce their intention to deport a 19 year old Nigerian student &mdash; today happens to be his birthday.  His father has already been deported and has disappeared into the jails of the Abacha regime.  I ask the Leader to pass our concerns about the human rights implications of this extraordinary decision to the Tánaiste.  Is it possible for him, as our Minister for Foreign Affairs, to contact his British counterpart as a matter of urgency to offer asylum to this young man, the second member of his family to be deported to this odious, pariah regime? I am sure the Leader shares my horror at this news.</P>
      <P>Second, is it possible for the House to debate in the near future the need for an independent inspectorate for all closed institutions, particularly child care institutions, State funded nursing homes, State care institutions of any kind and prisons?  Across this wide range of areas we do not have an independent inspectorate.  There is a continuing outcry about the revelations we here almost daily about institutions of one form or another.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter I wish to raise was discussed here yesterday.  The Minister for Justice and the Taoiseach are studying the comments of a High Court judge who felt unable to impose a life sentence on a person convicted of <Col N="1078" /> a number of rapes and serious sexual assaults.  I am pleased it is being examined.</P>

      <P>A question for the Leader.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>We should have a debate in the House to discuss the problems which have arisen so that the Minister for Justice will know the feelings of people across the country who were shocked that the judge could not impose a life sentence.  We should also discuss whether the name of the person convicted of such serious assaults should be published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when those who have been convicted of these crimes are released after five years and re-enter society.  There is a danger that people may not be aware why they have been convicted.  I think this is of importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Wright asked for a debate on the moneys for Border areas.  That will be a priority in the next session.  Senator O'Toole and Senator Lanigan raised the Intergovernmental Conference debate last week.  The question of absence of information is a difficult one.  Due to the way we organise <Col N="1079" /> our budgetary affairs I am not in a position to order copies of the excellent Dooge report from the Institute of European Affairs, which should be available to us for such an important debate.  One possible approach is to invite the former Senator and former Minister, Professor Dooge, to speak to the House in the next session on the implications and for a question and answer session.  This could be useful and I will put this on the agenda for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. It would probably have support from all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>There will not be a debate on defence before the end of this session but we will try to have one early next session.  I am happy to inform Senator Dardis and Senator O'Kennedy that the Estimates debates are proceeding responsibly, amicably, calmly and, as always, with the public good at heart.  I can assure them the outcome will be to the advantage of the country, but I will convey the Senators' support for fiscal rectitude to the appropriate quarters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not only start supporting fiscal rectitude today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I know of the Senator's ongoing support for that aim, but I am pleased about the support he has offered the Government in its deliberations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Finneran, Senator Wright and Senator Honan raised the serious matter of hepatitis C.  My understanding is that a great deal of agreement has been reached, there is much common ground and some of the outstanding difficulties may still be resolved.  I understand the concern of Members from all sides.  We had a debate on this issue early this year in Government time.  I ask Members to wait until we get an official clarification from both sides.  It would not be helpful if we rushed to debate an issue which has not finally been resolved, especially one as emotional and sensitive as this.  I will keep the matter under review and we <Col N="1080" /> can talk about it next week as events unfold.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn asked about Central European Time.  I do not see an immediate possibility of a debate on that subject in the House, but many feel he has a good case.  I will see that it is kept under review.  Perhaps a more important issue, raised by Senator O'Kennedy yesterday and Senator Quinn today, is BSE.  There are concerns about the damage it can cause and mixed and confused signals are coming from the British administration at present.  This is an opportunity to stress the quality and BSE free nature of Irish beef, to turn what looks like being a catastrophe into an opportunity.  I am grateful to the Senators for raising the matter in a positive way.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with Senator Lanigan's point about a debate and information on the Intergovernmental Conference. The question of the DPP is under review at present but next week both Senator Lanigan and Senator Enright will have an opportunity, during the Courts and Courts Officers Bill, to raise the issues they have brought to the attention of the House, such as sentencing policy.</P>
    <P>I strongly support Senator Burke's proposal for a debate on the devolution of powers to local authorities and there would be strong support in the House for an informed debate on that topic.  I thank him for raising the issue.</P>
    <P>Senator Roche raised the human rights issue in the UK.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs will be in the House later today and perhaps we can pass on our concerns in this regard to him then.  I have taken note of the other points the Senator raised as a possible topic of debate and will talk to him about that later.  Senator Enright raised valid and important questions, as he always does.  Most of them can be dealt with under the Courts and Courts Officers Bill.  Otherwise I urge him to use his special relationship with the Minister to raise the issues there.</P>

      <P>This is a Seanad Bill amended by the Dáil and, in accordance with Standing Order 82, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage.  On the question &ldquo;That the Bill be received for Final Consideration&rdquo;, the Minister may explain the purposes of the amendments made by the Dáil and this is looked upon as the report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad.  The only matters, therefore, that may be discussed are the amendments made by the Dáil.  For the convenience of Senators, I have arranged for the printing and circulation to them of those amendments. As Members are aware, they may speak only once on this question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the absence of my colleague, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, who is involved in urgent Government business in relation to the Estimates.  I am very pleased to have the opportunity of taking this Stage of the Bill on his behalf.</P>
      <P>On 15 June 1995 this House passed the Civil Legal Aid Bill, following which it was debated in Dáil Éireann.  In the course of the debate in the other House a total of 27 amendments were made to the Bill as passed by this House and I now wish to report on behalf of the Minister to the House on such amendments.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 1 is a minor drafting amendment and involves the use of capital letters in the reference to the chief executive in the section.  Amendment No. 2 is again a technical amendment which is intended to ensure that solicitors are classed as officers of the board once they have been designated as civil servants in the Civil Service of the State.  Amendment No. 3 to section 4 (4) (e) provides that the Minister may remove a member of the board from office.  In the Bill as passed by the Seanad the power to remove was without any express conditions attaching to it, although the principle of fair procedures would of course have applied. Amendment No. 3 provides expressly the circumstances in which the Minister may remove a member of the board from office.  The amendment is along the lines of similar powers given to Ministers to remove members from State boards.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 4 is again a technical amendment.  Section 7(1) of the Bill empowers the Minister to issue, by order, general policy directives in relation to legal aid and advice to the board and the board must comply with such directives.  Under section 7(3) of the Bill which was passed by the House it was provided that</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nothing in the section [that is to say section 7] shall be construed as <Col N="1083" /> enabling the Minister to exercise any power or control in relation to any particular case with which the board is or maybe concerned.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 4 substitutes the word &ldquo;at&rdquo; for &ldquo;section&rdquo; in subsection (3) and makes clear the extent to which the independence of the board is free from the interference of the Minister of the day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to be of as much assistance as possible.  If Senators want me to go slower I will.  The issue of ministerial policy directives is at present provided for in paragraph 226 of the existing scheme of civil legal aid and advice.  Over the years of the board's operation it has been necessary for successive Ministers with responsibility for the Legal Aid Board to give policy directives to the board, all of which have in one form or another helped to clarify positions for the board where necessary. In many cases the directives were of direct benefit to legally aided persons. I think it important that a Minister has power to make policy directives.  There are precedents in other legislation and there is no reason whatever to depart from precedent in this case.</P>
      <P>It may be suggested that for a Minister to have such power will enable him or her to interfere with the independence of the board in its day to day dealings with individual cases and that is certainly not the intention.  Section 7 (3) makes that absolutely clear.  The amendment makes the point even more clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In summary, most of the amendments I have spoken on so far have been technical. <Col N="1084" /> One other dimension has been that of ensuring the autonomy of the board, clearing the boundary of ministerial interference and the third dimension which I have discussed is those circumstances in which the policy directives of Ministers can satisfactorily find their way without interfering with the operation of the board.  The great majority of the early amendments were technical.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 5, 6 and 7 are technical amendments.  Amendment No. 5 to section 11 makes provision for designation by ministerial order that the staff of law centres be civil servants of the State.  Following consultation with staff representatives this section is in line with similar legislation where the establishment of a board on a statutory basis is concerned.  The purpose of amendment No. 5 is to make clear that solicitors appointed after the date of the ministerial order provided for in section 11 also shall be civil servants of the State. The purpose of this amendment is to manage the transition.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides for the appointment of staff of the board and provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that staff currently employed by the board be made civil servants of the State.  It also provides that staff currently employed by the board who are not civil servants may be made civil servants of the State should they so wish. To ensure an orderly transition of the board from administrative to statutory status and to ensure that the board retains the highly experienced and capable staff that it has at present, the board and the Minister's Department, in consultation with the Department of Finance, engaged in a long series of meetings with the trade unions representing solicitors and administrative staff.  As a result of those meetings detailed provisions acceptable to all parties have been agreed.  The framework of these agreements is contained in section 11 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 8 is again a technical amendment, as is amendment No. 9. Amendment No. 9 enables the board to provide legal aid in respect of a conveyancing <Col N="1085" /> matter connected to a matter for which legal aid or advice has already been granted.  The only effect of amendment No. 9 is to make similar provision in so far as the giving of legal advice is concerned.  The amendment helps to remove any doubt that may arise on the matter.</P>
    <P>Section 26 of the Bill sets out criteria for the grant of legal aid.  It specifies the circumstances under which legal aid may be granted and it reflects generally what is contained in the scheme of civil legal aid and advice as its stands now. Section 28 (6) of the Bill provides that the board may require a person to whom it has granted a legal aid certificate to comply with such requirements as it reasonably considers expedient to enable it to satisfy itself that it is reasonable for the person to continue to receive legal aid.  The effect of amendment No. 10 is to make similar provision in so far as the giving of legal advice where the board is concerned.  It also enables the board to cease the grant of legal advice where the applicant fails to comply with requirements, in particular the requirements which are specified in section 29 and in any regulations which might be made under section 37.</P>
    <P>Article 177 of the Treaty establishing the European Community provides that the European Court of Justice may give preliminary rulings concerning the interpretation of the Treaty.  Any court or tribunal of a member state may, if it considers a decision on a question is necessary to enable it to give judgment, request the European Court of Justice to give a ruling under Article 177 of the Treaty.  Amendment No. 11 makes clear that legal aid will apply where there are proceedings before the European Court of Justice arising out of a reference made to that court by any of our courts or a tribunal in accordance with the provisions of Article 177 of the Treaty.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 12 is a technical amendment.  It is intended to improve the wording of section 28 (1).  As the subsection was originally framed, there is the remote possibility that it requires an individual to have already been <Col N="1086" /> granted a legal certificate before he or she can qualify to obtain one.  The amendment helps to remove the possibility of any such perverse interpretation of the subsection.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 13 is a technical amendment to section 28(2).  It makes clear that the granting of a legal aid certificate by the Legal Aid Board shall be subject to section 24 as well as the other sections referred to in the subsection. Section 24 sets out the general criteria for the granting of legal aid.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 14 provides for the insertion of a new subsection in section 28.  The new subsection makes clear that the board may revoke a legal aid certificate under certain conditions which are specified in the subsection.  The conditions in particular are those specified in section 29 and in any regulations under section 37 concerning financial eligibility.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 15 deals with section 28(8), which sets out a number of matters in respect of which legal aid shall not be granted by the Legal Aid Board. One of the matters referred to is debt collection.  The effect of amendment No. 15 is to provide that in all proceedings involving debt collection, legal aid may be granted subject to the normal criteria for granting legal aid.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 16 and 17 will have the combined effect of enabling the board to provide legal aid and advice to engaged and cohabiting couples in respect of disputes concerning rights and interests in or over land. The board is not empowered to do so under the schemes that stand and this has left it helpless to assist in respect of disputes which may be of major importance to those individuals concerned including, perhaps, children.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 18 and 19 are minor drafting amendments concerning punctuation.  Amendment No. 20 is a technical drafting amendment, only it makes clear that information which can be got from law centres by the Legal Aid Board under section 32 may include information in any form.  It may, for example, be in computer form.  The <Col N="1087" /> information will enable the board to discharge its function in so far as finance, personnel and general administration are concerned.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 21 and 22 are minor drafting amendments.  Amendments Nos. 23, 24 and 25 are technical amendments.  Section 33(6) as it stands provides that the Legal Aid Board shall be entitled to recover costs incurred by it in providing legal aid and advice.  The costs may be determined by the board. In the case of legal aid, the costs may be measured by the court or tribunal in accordance with section 34 of the Bill or taxed in accordance with any rules of a court or tribunal.  In the case of legal advice, the costs may be measured by the Taxing Master as solicitor and client costs.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 24 is the main amendment.  It provides that in default of agreement between the board and the client, costs in respect of both legal aid and advice may be measured by either the Taxing Master or the court or tribunal concerned as may be appropriate, in the same way as if no party was in receipt of legal aid or advice and all the parties had respectfully obtained the services of a solicitor, barrister or both at their own expense.  The measurement of costs by the court or tribunal are in accordance with the rules of any of the court or tribunal.  Amendments Nos. 23 and 25 flow as consequential amendments.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 26 is a consequential amendment which is related to amendments Nos. 23, 24 and 25.  Amendment No. 27 is also a consequential amendment which is related to amendments Nos. 23, 24 and 25.</P>

      <P>Many of these amendments are technical in nature and I would not be fully conversant with the reasons as to their necessity.  However, we attempted to put many amendments into the legislation during its passage through the House.  While we were successful in having it amended, unfortunately that decision was reversed by the Minister at a later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of our amendments attempted to expand the membership of the board but section 4 did not take them on board.  It appears the Minister's amendment is simply technical in nature and does not refer to any of the members of the board, which is a pity.  If the Minister had taken our amendment on board, he would have had a better board composition.  To have the board simply consisting of legal practitioners is a wrong decision.  The decision to put civil legal aid on a statutory footing gave much scope to the Minister to do many innovative things but he missed the opportunity to do that in many instances.  Putting a member of the Combat Poverty Agency or the users of <Col N="1089" /> the service on the board would have been a good idea.  It is a shame, now this Bill is to become law, that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what you are saying, Sir, but it is a technicality for the Minister to bring this part of the legislation before us because little or nothing can be achieved by us.  We are also restricted to what is before us.</P>
      <P>Can the Minister tell me what is meant by the amendment to section 27? The amendments we tabled to this section attempted to give people access to civil legal aid in specific circumstances. What exactly is intended by amendment No. 11?  The Minister may have described it appropriately and accurately but I found it difficult to grasp much of what he said.</P>
      <P>If I understood him correctly, amendment No. 14 means the board can decide, having granted civil legal aid, to discontinue it if the financial circumstances of the person change.  Is that legally possible or appropriate?  If I have been granted a civil legal aid certificate at the time I undertake a legal action, surely I should be entitled to pursue that action as long as it takes?  Regardless of a change in one's financial circumstances, there is scope within the legislation to apportion costs, or to make a charge after the completion of the action where a civil legal certificate aid has been granted.  The legislation provides for the possibility that the board may put a charge on whatever services it provides.  Would this not be better than discontinuing eligibility for civil legal aid, as provided for by amendment No. 14?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1090" /> With regard to section 28, the amendments the Minister has mentioned do not take on board the kind of extension to the service we were seeking.  Amendment No. 16 allows for cohabiting couples to avail of services.  Is this a technical amendment?  I was not aware that they were prohibited from being represented by virtue of the fact that they were cohabiting couples.  The amendments to section 29 are technical. It is unfortunate that none of the very positive proposals put to the Minister have been taken on board in any of these amendments.</P>
    <P>As there is not the scope to make the kind of comments I thought it was possible to make, I can only say that it is a pity that we did not get the kind of legislation we hoped for when the Bill was initiated in the House.  As it appears that most of the amendments the Minister has introduced are technical, I will simply note what has been brought before us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Bill is to become law.  It has been debated over a long period in the House.  The Minister has introduced an amendment regarding the autonomy of the board.  It is important that the board be free, as it sees it, to operate in the best interest of its clients, the people who need free legal aid.  It is also important that the board has the freedom to develop the service because, as debated at length in the House, it is necessary to develop the service in many areas and this costs money.  The amendment to give more autonomy to the board gives the opportunity and the incentive to the board to develop itself and not be looking over its shoulder at its political masters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the amendment on policy directives qualifies, to an extent, the autonomy of the board but it is important that those who pay for free legal advice &mdash; £6.2 million in 1995 &mdash; have an input into the way the board is developing.  The piper who pays must call some of the tune but, as amendment No. 1 makes clear, it does not call all of the tune; there is a balance between this <Col N="1091" /> and what the Minister can influence by way of policy directives to ensure that this does not interfere too much in the autonomy of the board.</P>
    <P>These two amendments are, therefore, complementary.  It is important that both the Minister and the board itself looks towards developing the service. The amendment ensuring that the Civil Legal Aid Board is in a position to give legal advice is a development of this theme.  We discussed this at length on Second Stage.  The development of the board should be such as to ensure that it can give the full range of legal advice, from writing letters to bringing cases into court, and that it is fully inclusive of all the services that are required by people involved in the civil legal aid area.</P>
    <P>This area was discussed on Second Stage and an amendment was passed to extend legal aid to areas of social welfare, the employment appeals tribunal and to the labour area.  This would have cost approximately £20 million at the time but I understand from previous debates that this can be done and that the area of legal advice can be developed by way of ministerial order at a later stage.</P>
    <P>As the European Courts are increasingly involved in Irish law, it is important that legal aid be available to people who are obliged to bring cases and defend themselves in the European Court.  This is dealt with by amendment No. 11.  Amendment No. 6 deals with staff who are to be civil servants.  This issue is discussed whenever we are changing a voluntary body into a statutory body.  This happened when we were discussing the milk board approximately 18 months ago; this is a similar amendment in that it seeks to ensure that there is an ease of transfer of the staff from what one would now regard as the private voluntary area to become employees of the State.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 15 deals with the debt collection included in legal aid. The fact that this provision is available is welcome.  It complements what we <Col N="1092" /> said earlier with regard to legal advice and the autonomy of the board.  It is a development of the service available under the civil legal aid scheme.  The common theme in many of the substantive amendments is the development of, and an opportunity to develop and improve, the service of the board and to improve the areas in which the Legal Aid Board can assist its clients, people of modest means.  I welcome the amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister proposes amendments to section 10 regarding the chief executive.  The chief executive is defined in the definitions section &mdash; section 1.  I am at a loss to understand why this amendment is necessary.  What is its purpose given that the role of the chief executive is clearly defined under the section and under section 1?  In the absence of the chief executive, the person can nominate staff to undertake the functions of the chief executive and the board can authorise staff to undertake work of the chief executive when the chief executive is not available.  There is nothing to say that any of the staff who may be appointed, either by the board or the chief executive, will be suitably qualified to carry out the work.</P>
      <P>The position of chief executive is very important.  The main function of the board is centred around the work of the chief executive.  He or she whoever they may be may decide to put somebody into his or her position in their absence, but such person may not be suitably qualified.  The section should be amended to ensure that suitably qualified staff would be appointed and not somebody who may be, for example, a clerical assistant or, perhaps, an usher. There is nothing in the section to say that the person nominated by the chief executive or the board would be suitably qualified to carry out the work. This is essential.</P>
      <P>There is a section which allows for the dissolution of the existing board, and there is a section&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to discuss amendment No. 10. During earlier Stages of the Bill we sought to make the provisions of this legislation applicable to employment tribunals and so forth.  We had some success in having such bodies included. However, they were removed again and that has restricted the power of the boards to deal with and provide legal aid for some of the matters for which we believe legal aid is necessary.  I am not convinced that what the Minister is proposing will not further unduly restrict the provisions and the authority of the Legal Aid Board to give legal advice in certain cases.  Could the Minister indicate if this amendment was introduced by the Minister or by somebody else? This amendment appears to give the Minister wide powers to restrict legal advice in cases where there might be a <Col N="1094" /> difference of opinion as to whether legal advice should be continued or not.  This would unduly restrict the board.</P>
    <P>There was also a discussion about the establishment of law centres throughout the country.  I suggested that the headquarters for the chief executive and the board should be located outside Dublin. It is necessary to discontinue the practice of locating headquarters of bodies such as these in the city.  That is in line with Government decentralisation policy. There is provision in the Bill for the board to establish centres at different locations throughout the country but there is no provision about where the headquarters of the board should be located.  It is an important office and it would be in keeping with Government decentralisation policy if it were located outside Dublin.  I am sure the Minister who is present would be favourably disposed to having it located in Ennis.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made amendments to section 32 which could change the original objective of the section quite substantially.  What is the Minister's intention here?  With regard to the provision of information in these cases, much if not all of the information is sensitive and confidential in nature.  We should ensure that such information cannot be passed on to unauthorised people, but under the Minister's amendments there is the capacity to have information provided to people who might be unauthorised.  Can we prevent that?</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty with the amendments except that in some respects they restrict the availability of legal advice to people who might be entitled to it and, second, they might unduly provide information on sensitive and confidential matters to people who would be unauthorised to have such information. The effect of the Minister's amendment to section 32 might be to provide an opportunity for unauthorised people to get confidential and sensitive information about cases.  It would be most undesirable if that were to happen.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister.  I had expected the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, and I was looking forward to congratulating him on the passing of the divorce referendum. I am sure the Minister, Deputy Higgins, will pass on my good wishes.</P>
      <P>This Bill was debated at great length in this House.  We presumed we had passed the Bill but obviously there were technical amendments made to it in the other House.  I presume these amendments will improve or clarify some matters that were still unclear when the Bill left this House.  I had some reservations about the Bill but I am pleased that the Civil Legal Aid Board has been put on a statutory footing.  I support the amendments.</P>
      <P>Many of the amendments are technical. I welcome amendment No. 9.  Legal advice can now be given in relation to conveyancing matters on which legal aid had already been given.  That had to be clarified.  Amendment No. 12 relates to section 28.  The fact that a person might have to get a legal aid certificate before they could prove that they were entitled to one was of some concern to us earlier and this amendment clarifies that.  I also welcome amendment No. 17 under which free legal aid is available for disputes about the rights and interests of cohabiting couples in land or property. That is important because children are involved in many of these cases.</P>
      <P>All our concerns have been gone through in great detail.  All of us accept the need to place the board on a statutory basis.  In view of the large number of family law cases that are dealt with by the Civil Legal Aid Board, we welcome the increase in the number of offices that have been opened around the country and the increased funding the Government has allocated for this service.  The scale of marital breakdown was discussed during the divorce referendum campaign and it is most important that the board is placed on a statutory basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We appreciate the work the Minister and his officials have done in bringing this Bill before the House.  I am glad the <Col N="1096" /> Bill will be passed and I hope the board will be successful in the many challenges that lie ahead of it.  We hope&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Senator McGennis raised queries about amendments Nos. 11, 14, 16 and 17.  I am bound by the rules of this House to confine my remarks to the amendments as tabled.  This falls heavily on me and it must be a great burden to the Senators who have spoken.</P>
      <P>The right of a citizen to refer a matter through a court system is affected by European legislation.  Amendment No. 11 deals with the institutional referral provided by our entry into Europe.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 14 deals with the revocation of legal aid certificates.  If somebody acquired an immense amount of resources, by for example winning the lotto, they could pay for the case or the certificate could be revoked.  The amendment takes account of the position of people who might be able to finance their own actions.  They would be given the option of hiring their own solicitors or paying the board the costs involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank Senator Neville for this thoughtful comments about amendments Nos. 6 and 11.  He spoke about a balance which must be struck.  The <Col N="1097" /> board, which is being put on a statutory footing, enjoys an autonomy which could be construed as independence with responsibility.  This is the essence of the Senator's comment.  If one law centre had a large block of arrears and another centre was not under strain, the Minister could make an order providing for the two centres to be regarded as one until the backlog of arrears had been cleared.  I am satisfied that the right balance has been struck between the necessary autonomy of the board and the right of the Minister and the Government to articulate policy.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly suggested that the Minister could interfere with the board. Amendment No. 4 specifically seeks to achieve the opposite because it prevents the Minister from interfering in individual cases.  The Senator raised a point about information.  It is the Legal Aid Board rather than the Minister which may collect information from legal aid centres.  Amendment No. 20 deals with the flow of information from the centres to the board and not to the Minister. The Bill establishes a distance between the board, which acts autonomously, and the Minister, who is responsible to the Government.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan spoke on amendments Nos. 9, 12 and 17.  She concluded by ceding the principle that she had no real or philosophical difficulty with what the Seanad wanted but was not contained in the Bill.  Amendment No. 9 removes the remotely possible perverse interpretation with which I have already dealt in my opening remarks.  Amendment No. 12 is technical and we are not in disagreement about it.  The combined effect of amendments Nos. 16 and 17 is to take account of engaged and cohabiting couples in respect of disputes. It enables the statutory board to deal with areas with which the board as presently constituted cannot deal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important Bill.  The Minister for Equality and Law Reform is at a meeting dealing with the Estimates and I hope this goes well for him.  The success of this and all other legislation depends on the necessary finance being provided.  On Second Stage the Minister pointed out that £6.2 million had been provided in the 1995 Estimates for civil legal aid and that this was a 25 per cent increase.  Even this modest improvement of putting the civil legal aid scheme on a statutory basis will require additional funding.  I know the Minister will fight his case at the Estimates meeting this morning and I hope he will not give up until he is satisfied that he is given an appropriate financial allocation for his Department, which will have to carry a considerable burden in the next 12 months.  On the basis of last year's increase, the Minister proposed additional law centres and staff and there is no doubt that he will require substantial additional funding from the Government to try to achieve the targets he set and indicated to the House when he introduced this Bill here.</P>
      <P>In this Bill we are simply placing on a statutory basis a scheme which has operated since 1979.  The Pringle report on civil legal aid listed a number of barriers which impede people from availing of existing private legal services.  One barrier is the cost to the person using such services.  This is why we have civil legal aid and I hope there will be improvements in the scheme when it becomes statutory.  Another barrier is lack of information.  Do people have sufficient information to know there is a legal remedy available?  There is also a psychological barrier.  Will people be able to use private services even though such services may be outside their experience?  There may also be a geographical barrier.  Is there a private service operating in a person's locality?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recognising the barriers led the Pringle committee to state that although the cost barrier is the major one, the introduction of a legal aid scheme would not lead automatically to the removal of the <Col N="1099" /> others.  Each barrier would have to be dealt with and this is why the report stresses that a comprehensive legal aid and advisory service must be concerned with more than providing the public with the means of access to legal practitioners and the courts.  That is the basis on which this legislation has fallen down.</P>
    <P>During my Second Stage speech I quoted from a submission to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights about violence against women.  It stated: &ldquo;For there to be effective access to justice, legal services must include education to counter this lack of knowledge.&rdquo;  One of the things we tried to do during the passage of this Bill through the House was to break the barriers which the Pringle report identified.</P>

      <P>I only want to note the Bill's shortcomings.  I acknowledge the good work done by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, and the great improvements he has made in terms of funding and staff for civil legal aid.  However, the Bill does not address the needs and the identified improvements which could have been put on a statutory basis.  This legislation will not come before either Houses for a long time.  It is a pity we did not take this opportunity to improve membership, access, eligibility and the other issues raised on Second Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill's passage through the House because it is important to put the Legal Aid Board on a statutory basis.  I welcome the Minister's decision to introduce this Bill in the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Natural justice determines that people have access to the courts and to legal advice regardless of their means. We should remember Mrs. Airey who created the springboard for the establishment <Col N="1100" /> of civil legal aid in the State by taking her case to the European Court in 1979.  She made it possible to put the Legal Aid Board on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>It is important that the service is all-inclusive. The Bill contains a provision to allow the Minister to extend the scope of legal aid by ministerial directive. Senator McGennis was concerned that an opportunity has been missed. However, the Bill allows services to be extended through ministerial order without having to come back to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That gives the Minister scope to develop civil legal aid, which was the theme of the discussions on Second Stage and on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>It is important that means are now tested on disposable, not gross incomes. As politicians, a lot of our work deals with means testing.  The Bill puts the Legal Aid Board on a statutory basis and it will look at disposable income, that is, income after rent, mortgage, hire purchase and other allowances are taken into consideration.  Means testing should be done on disposable, not gross incomes.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Government for increasing the contribution in 1995 for civil legal aid by 25 per cent, which brought it up to £6.2 million.  I also congratulate the previous Government for increasing it in 1994.  I congratulate the Minister for more than doubling the amount of money available for civil legal aid in the State.  It is important to recognise the services and advice provided by the free legal aid centres, FLAC, on a voluntary basis.</P>
    <P>The extension and improvement of civil legal aid will continue.  Two years ago there were 16 civil legal aid centres in Ireland; today there are 26.  We hope the introduction of this Bill will continue the momentum for the expansion of civil legal aid in terms of funding for the development of the service and the number of advice centres throughout the country.  While most civil legal aid is directed towards family issues &mdash; 99 per cent of the funds available are used in the family law courts &mdash; people with <Col N="1101" /> limited incomes must also be considered. Debt collection was mentioned today, but other areas were mentioned on Second Stage.  We must ensure that areas other than family law issues are developed because those with limited incomes have a right to civil legal aid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>We spend our time in both Houses of the Oireachtas bringing in laws which mean nothing to those who cannot afford them.  That is why this is a crucial Bill.  It is important, particularly since the passing of the divorce referendum, that people who need the law to protect them and enforce their rights have the financial means to use it.  The Minister has worked hard to ensure that legal rights are accessible in this country.  I congratulate him for establishing at least one legal centre in each county, which did not exist when I first entered the Seanad.  By doing so, the Minister has ensured that those who require the assistance of the law are able to avail of it.</P>
      <P>It is disingenuous of those on the other side of the House to say this is a missed opportunity when they had almost 20 years in Government, from when the Airey case was first taken, to introduce this Bill.  I am pleased that a Labour Party Minister has delivered on this matter.</P>
      <P>This Bill does more than just putting the board on a statutory footing.  While that is important, the scheme has been improved, debt collection has been extended and one can now bring a case through the legal aid system to the European Court.  The fact that law clerks may be apprenticed through the legal aid system and qualify as solicitors is another practical way of improving the board's morale.  The board is happy that its concerns and work are now being recognised and facilitated in this legislation.  It is important that the people in the system are happy with it and, from my experience of talking to those in the legal aid centres, that has been achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1102" /> There are other areas such as the fact that we can now look at disposable income which is the only income available to people in determining whether they can go to court.  That is a welcome provision.  There have been many practical and comprehensive improvements in this legislation.  The Minister has done the people a great service by introducing it, as he has with many other pieces of legislation which were put on the back burner by the Legislature for many years.  They have now been addressed by the Minister, Deputy Taylor, who deserves to be complimented on it.  I hope the Cabinet recognises his role in achieving a lot for many people at very little cost.  He should be facilitated in that regard.</P>

      <P>On Final Stage, I want to make some concluding comments on behalf of my colleague the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor.  Since the establishment of the Department of Equality and Law Reform just over two years ago and Deputy Taylor's taking over responsibility for the scheme of civil legal aid and advice, there have been a number of significant developments.  At that time, just over two years ago, it was a scheme operated by the Legal Aid Board without sufficient staff or law centres and there were long waiting lists.  In the meantime those problems have been eradicated by extra funds allowing for the doubling of staff numbers and law centres.  Waiting lists now bear no comparison to those of earlier years.  Staff are highly motivated and there is a new board, comprising a representative gender balance, operating under the chairmanship of Ms Clare Connellan, a solicitor who is also a skilled administrator.</P>
      <P>For the first time the board includes two staff association representatives. The new board, law centres and staff are operating effectively and efficiently. There is an air of enthusiasm and no little excitement about a dynamic organisation that is gearing itself to the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1103" /> Senators McGennis, Neville and Gallagher spoke on Final Stage and I thank them for the warm regards they conveyed to the Minister, Deputy Taylor, for his work on this Bill.  These remarks, which I am reading on his behalf, about the atmosphere which prevails in the law centres is based on the Minister's visits to these law centres and from his interaction with those who work in them.  When I first knew the Minister, Deputy Taylor, long before he was a Deputy, he was providing legal advice. His commitment is shown in the achievement of this legislation and in the dedication of his departmental staff.</P>
    <P>The Civil Legal Aid Bill is a landmark Bill which puts the scheme of civil legal aid and advice on a statutory basis while allowing at the same time some degree of flexibility to set out more specific details by means of regulation.  The perception can now be that the board is not only permanent but is organised and being developed strategically to deal with the future and with the consequences of marriage breakdown.  The Bill implements the Government's commitment to legal aid.  Amendments have been made to the Bill during its passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas, which as far as possible have taken into account the fine contributions made by Members of both Houses.  I will convey to the Minister, Deputy Taylor, Senators' appreciation of the fact that this legislation was introduced in Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <P>This Bill should be seen as part of a <i>corpus</i> of major family law legislation which has been initiated over a period of just two and a half years by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, both in this Government and the previous one.  On the basis of the Maintenance Act, 1994, the Family Law Act, 1995, the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1995, the Domestic Violence Bill, 1995, and the Civil Legal Aid Bill, 1995, we will have an updated code of family law to match that of any developed country. As I reel off the titles of these Bills one gets an idea of the <i>corpus</i> of family law <Col N="1104" /> that is now in place.  That code of legislation represents a Government which cares about people involved in marital breakdown.  It is a response which society itself quite rightly expects from Government and which society will, frankly, be the better for.</P>
    <P>On my own behalf and on behalf of my colleague the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, I thank Senators for their support on this important Bill to establish the scheme of civil legal aid and advice on a statutory basis.</P>

      <P>This is a drafting amendment.  In its opening words, section 13 (2)  protects the attorney who <Col N="1110" /> acts without knowing that the enduring power no longer exists.  However, paragraphs (a)  and (b)  fail to refer to the non existence of the power but refer to it being either invalid or ceasing to be in force.

The intention was that all instruments creating powers of attorney need not be made under seal.  This drafting amendment makes that intention clear.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for dealing with the technical amendments. I welcome the Bill as it brings the law relating to powers of attorney up to date.  Members are aware of the previous situation and the Bill will enable family members or lawyers to take a power of attorney for a person of unsound mind or who is going senile so that their affairs can be properly managed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is incumbent on the Law Society, the Department of Justice and the Garda authorities to ensure that the provisions of the Bill are never used or abused by criminal elements which might dupe people into giving a power of attorney and signing away their assets or property.  I raised this concern on Second Stage and I re-emphasise that point.  We are aware of the A1 Capone syndrome in American and continental <Col N="1112" /> jurisdictions where the power of attorney is, unfortunately, widely abused.  People abdicate responsibility for their actions and criminals use it as a way to effect their ends.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to pass on my comments to the Department of Justice.  The Bill and its provisions must be strictly monitored; nevertheless, I welcome it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">

      <P>I also welcome the Bill. As Senator Mulcahy said, it updates the law and allows the affairs of people who have difficulties with their cognitive abilities, such as Alzheimer's disease, to be managed.  It is important the position is addressed and on that basis I welcome the Bill.</P>
      <P>For the second time today I congratulate the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, for initiating this Bill and the Civil Legal Aid Bill in the Seanad.  It is a welcome development. This Government is more open to introducing Bills in the Seanad than any previous Government, irrespective of the parties involved.  Bills were introduced during the previous Government's period in office but this Minister, Deputy Taylor, has positively examined the role this House can play.  The initiation of Bills in the Seanad is welcome and I look forward to many more in the future.  I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on his continuing good work.</P>

    <P>On behalf of the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, I thank the Senators for their constructive contributions on the Bill.  I am working as an agent for my colleague, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, this morning.  I thank the Members, particularly Senator Mulcahy, for facilitating the speedy consideration of the legislation.  The beneficiaries of the Bill already exist and as soon as the legislation is enacted, it will <Col N="1113" /> interact with the lives of those who are vulnerable.</P>
    <P>I will convey the good wishes of the Seanad to the Minister, Deputy Taylor. The Bill is important as it lays a legal basis for an enduring power of attorney. It also changes the circumstances and conditions for giving a power of attorney.  These are positive aspects of law reform.  I agree with Senator Neville regarding the advantage of introducing this type of legislation in the Seanad where it receives compassionate, deep consideration and also, where necessary, an expeditious passage.  As Senator Mulcahy said, the sooner the Bill is enacted and brought to the notice of the implementing authorities, the better. For the people in situations of vulnerability, with which the Bill deals, a moment longer is a moment too long.</P>
    <P>On behalf of my colleague, Minister Taylor, his Department and officials, I thank Senators for their thoughtful contributions and co-operation in passing the legislation.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on East Timor. It is 20 years to the day today since the invasion of East Timor by Indonesia.  It is, therefore, opportune for me to express again on this occasion the Government's deep concern over the continuing violations of human rights in East Timor.  The continuing problem of East Timor has been highlighted once again by the occupation of the Russian and Dutch embassies in Jakarta overnight by what I understand to be 100 East Timorese and other Indonesians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From recent reports I have received I understand the increased presence of Indonesian military forces in East Timor is still creating a general climate <Col N="1114" /> of fear, mistrust and intimidation.  A large section of the population of East Timor considers the behaviour of the Indonesian security forces as the main obstacle in the way of reducing tensions. The security approach currently pursued by the Indonesian armed forces seems to be contributing to a growing sense of anti-Indonesian resentment and to heightened nationalistic East Timorese feelings, especially among young people.</P>
    <P>The difficult economic and social situation in East Timor, which is characterised by high unemployment rates as well as by social tensions created by the influx of newcomers from other parts of the Indonesian archipelago, provides a sense of hopelessness about their future for the indigenous population of East Timor which is especially acute in the case of young people.  This is one of the understandable reasons they are becoming more radical and aggressive and why a number of them try to leave East Timor, sometimes in a dangerous and precarious fashion by sea and in other instances, as we have witnessed in recent months, by applying for political asylum at various diplomatic missions in Jakarta before departing for Portugal.  I would pay tribute to Portugal for the alacrity with which these asylum seekers have been accepted for settlement in Portugal.</P>
    <P>Members of the House will probably be aware that during this week the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr. José Ayala Lasso, is visiting Indonesia and East Timor.  I welcome the direct involvement of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and I await his report with great interest following his fact finding mission there.  I understand that Indonesia has also taken steps to invite the Special Rapporteur on the Question of Torture and the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention to visit East Timor when it is necessary for them to do so in order to fulfil their duties.  The Government will continue to support initiatives taken by the UN to ensure respect for human rights in East Timor.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1115" /> Members of the Seanad will be aware of the article on East Timor which I contributed to <i>The Irish Times</i> on 13 July 1995.  In that article I outlined the following objectives which remain valid: Ireland wants to see a political solution for East Timor based on the principles of international law and justice; Ireland wishes to see the people of East Timor enjoying their full human and political rights; Ireland calls for a halt in the supply of arms to Indonesia which could be used as instruments of oppression in East Timor; and, Ireland calls for the release of Mr. Xanana Gusmao and other political prisoners in East Timor.</P>
    <P>Overall we want Indonesia to cooperate fully with the UN, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, the UN Commission for Human Rights and with international non-governmental organisations.  As I stated some months ago, I believe these objectives have overwhelming public and political support in Ireland, including in this House, where the plight of the people of East Timor has evoked a concerned and sympathetic response.  As Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs I will continue to work to ensure that concern and sympathy are translated into effective action at international level.</P>
    <P>The Government has supported and continues to attach importance to the ongoing talks between the Foreign Ministers of Portugal and Indonesia which take place under the auspices of the UN Secretary General.  The next round of talks is scheduled for mid-January 1996.  The Government has also welcomed the first all inclusive intraTimorese dialogue meeting which took place in Austria last June and we hope that further meetings of this new forum will take place.</P>
    <P>It would be appropriate for me to state in the Seanad, in the light of recent events, that I deplore unreservedly that a Member of this House, Senator Norris, together with a Member of the European Parliament and others were prevented from visiting East Timor last month on what was a mission of goodwill, <Col N="1116" /> peace and prayer to commemorate those killed a the cemetery in Dili over four years ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this issue today, the twentieth anniversary of the illegal attempted annexation of East Timor by the Indonesian Government.  I compliment the Tánaiste for the work he has done on behalf of the people of a country far from us.  I join with him in complimenting Senator Norris on the work he has done on behalf of the East Timorese people and I also compliment the East Timor Support Group led by Mr. Hyland.</P>
      <P>It may appear inappropriate to some that we in a troubled island should discuss problems in places as far away as East Timor, but we must at all times respect the value of human life.  Some people call them Christian values but they are human rights values which have nothing to do with Christianity or any other religious values.  They concern the demands of people to be treated as individuals with the rights they should have.</P>
      <P>We are approaching the end of the era of the colonial system.  The Portuguese have been praised by the Tánaiste for their efforts but we must acknowledge that East Timor was a Portuguese colony.  The Portuguese were the instigators of the problems.  They stepped aside and allowed the Indonesians to invade, murder and kill.  If what we have seen and heard is true, the world should be sad and remember what was done in East Timor.  Mr. Gusamo, even from jail, is suggesting the way out of this impasse.  I heard Mr. Jon Pilger describe him as the Mandela of East Timor.  I hope he will be able to lead the East Timorese people into a renewal of the statehood which they had many years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week the Seanad criticised Shell for its unbelievable attitude in Nigeria and it has not yet bowed to international public opinion on what it has created in areas of Nigeria.  In this debate, we must look at the role of Exxon, an American company which <Col N="1117" /> has the economic strength to do something. In 1995, an agreement was signed by the Indonesians with the United States based Exxon group which provided for an estimated US$40 billion dollar investment in an offshore gas project, a joint effort between Australia and Indonesia, in a Timorese area.  If Exxon, Shell and other multinationals were not involved in such disputes, these situations would not occur.</P>
    <P>Ireland can join in a small way with the other members of the international community in showing our abhorrence of the genocide which the Indonesians have carried out on the East Timorese. I thank Senator Norris and the Tánaiste and, although we can do very little, our voice in criticising what is being done to the East Timorese people will be heard in the international community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Today is a very important day and I am delighted that the Seanad has this opportunity to discuss what is happening in East Timor. People living under democratic Governments throughout the world must remember 7 December 1975 with a sense of disgust, shame and outrage. This is the date on which the invasion of East Timor by Indonesia commenced. The attack on Dili that day saw the commencement of acts of brutality towards the people of East Timor which have continued over the past 20 years.</P>
      <P>At the time of the invasion in 1975, over 2,000 people were murdered by the Indonesian army and there have been similar slaughters in the intervening period. At Lakmanas in 1976 over 1,000 people were killed.  Huge numbers of people have been publicly executed in villages and towns on an ongoing basis in the meantime.  The massacre which took place at the Santa Cruz cemetery in 1991, where between 200 and 300 people were gunned down, showed the outrageous conduct of the Indonesian armed forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The United Nations is carrying out an investigation and Mr. Ndiaye visited East Timor in July 1994.  His report was submitted to the 51st Session of the <Col N="1118" /> United Nations Commission on Human Rights.  That report outlined two options &mdash; a consensus or a motion criticising what was happening in East Timor.  I regret to say that consensus was achieved; it would have been much better if a critical motion had been put forward, which I am confident Ireland would have supported.  I do not wish to criticise the United Nations but it is not good enough to get consensus when such brutality, murder and slaughter are being carried out.  Nations such as Ireland should be much more critical and forceful remembering what we suffered as a nation.  I am glad that small nations such as Ireland have been to the forefront while some of our neighbours have stood idly by as these slaughters continued.</P>
    <P>This is an important day and I am pleased that the Seanad took the opportunity to discuss what is happening in East Timor.  I hope our views will be conveyed to the Indonesian Government as we greatly oppose its conduct.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Leader of the House for making time available today, and also to the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, for attending today's session.  I am also very pleased &mdash; if I am correct in identifying him &mdash; to see a senior adviser from Iveagh House who has had a long and distinguished career with special expertise in the area of Far Eastern affairs, which shows the seriousness with which the Department of Foreign Affairs is taking this matter, for which I am grateful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste in his confrontation with Dr. Ali Alatas provoked a great deal of favourable comment among those committed to human rights around the world.  It was rather entertaining that Dr. Alatas, in hectoring the Tánaiste, asked him how he could possibly know anything about East Timor never having been there.  That line was also parroted in an outrageously foolish letter from the Indonesian Embassy in London which made the same point about Patricia McKenna, MEP, and <Col N="1119" /> myself.  On the one hand they will not let us in and, on the other, they ask how could we possibly know anything because we have not visited.  They also said that the presence of persons such as myself and Patricia McKenna, MEP, is likely to excite the local people to acts of violence.  This has never been my experience in any other country and it suggests that something very odd indeed must be going on in East Timor if my presence would excite the population to acts of violence.</P>
    <P>Today is the twentieth anniversary of the invasion and illegal annexation of East Timor by military agents of the Indonesian dictatorship.  The matter has been the subject of numerous United Nations resolutions, starting with the general resolution 3485 of 12 December 1975 &mdash; which was immediately after the invasion and shows the international community reacting with great speed and concern &mdash; and including both Security Council and General Assembly resolutions.  All these make absolutely clear the condemnation of the international community and the fact that the Indonesian Government is in clear, flagrant and continuing breach of international law.</P>
    <P>Moreover, over the past 20 years, the crime of genocide has been committed by the Indonesians against the Timorese people.  Out of a population of 600,000, one third have died through mass executions, famine, forced labour and the operation of concentration camps. To all this, until recently, the West has turned a blind eye in pursuit of its own perceived economic self interest. However, due to the work of popular movements, such as the East Timor Ireland Solidarity Campaign, this conspiracy of silence can no longer be maintained.</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago, to coincide with the fourth anniversary of the Dili massacre, on 12 November a small international group, which included myself and Patricia McKenna, MEP, attempted to enter East Timor to be present at a peaceful commemoration ceremony.  In <Col N="1120" /> an act of air piracy, the Indonesian Government acting, according to officials with whom we dealt, on direct instructions from Dr. Alatas removed us from the scheduled flight to Dili when it landed at Bali in transit to Timor.</P>
    <P>Our purpose in going to Dili was to ensure the massacre would be commemorated in a peaceful and dignified manner by lighting candles in memory of those slain.  The entire might of the Indonesian army was brought out against a group of peace campaigners, armed only with candles to prevent the simple and gentle ritual of lighting a flame of peace.  Despite their advantage of might they signally failed, as some of our group got in and brought back the candles which had been lit, one of which I have with me today.  The bullying action of the Indonesian authorities not only failed to extinguish the light we sought to ignite but fanned it into a bright flame, transmitted across the globe by the interest of the news agencies.</P>
    <P>One of my tasks had been to read a message from the distinguished Irish musician Bono of U2 and although prevented from reading it on East Timor I read it to the passengers in the international transit lounge of Denprassar Airport where we were detained. The message was simple, powerful and moving:</P>
    <P>To the good people of East Timor on behalf of myself, Bono, and the band U2, on behalf of most scribes and poets, most music, film and object makers, both here in Ireland and around the world, please be sure that we know of your struggle and that even if we are not allowed to see you, know that we hear of you and that when we don't hear of you, we think of you all the more.  There is no silence deep enough, no black out dark enough, no corruption thick enough, no business deal big enough, no politician bent enough, no heart hollow enough, no grave wide enough to bury your story and keep it from us. Love from a short distance, Bono.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1121" /> I appeal to the Tánaiste to give a commitment in three principal areas: first, to direct the Irish Ambassador in Australia, who is also accredited to Indonesia, to visit the East Timorese leader Xanana Gusamo illegally imprisoned in Jakarta; second, to get the EU Council of Ministers to establish an independent international inquiry into the situation in East Timor; and third, to examine the possibility of Ireland co-operating with Portugal in arraigning Indonesia under the genocide convention of the UN &mdash; this can be done to no cost to the Irish taxpayer as a result of an arrangement arrived at during a conference on East Timor held in Portugal last spring.</P>
    <P>It became clear to us during our stay in Indonesia that violence against the Timorese has not abated.  Young men are routinely and brutally interrogated, in particular being beaten on the lower back and stomach in such a way that visual evidence of brusing is kept to a minimum.  This tactic has signally failed to break the spirit of the Timorese people.  They constantly approached our members in Dili with the slogan &ldquo;Independence or Death&rdquo;.  In Singapore a young Timorese gave me a copy of this poem which reflects the continuing situation:</P>
    <P>We talk with our eyes</P>
    <P>Inside East Timor</P>
    <P>We all know each other</P>
    <P>Our sufferings are the same</P>
    <P>Our eyes tell it all</P>
    <P>Twenty years of death</P>

      <P>It is important that we mark this day, the 20th anniversary of the invasion of East Timor and the assault on Dili.  We should not underestimate the power of small nations like ours or of public opinion on issues like these.  It has taken a long time for notice to be taken of East Timor but there are indications that some progress is being made.  We should pay tribute to the actions of the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, Senator Norris and others in highlighting the importance of East Timor so that the world would take note of what is happening.</P>
      <P>Since the invasion there has been a subjugation by terror of the East Timorese people by the Indonesians, including public executions, massacres and other acts of terror.  There have been repeated condemnations by the UN General Assembly and other bodies but, as Senator Enright said, the bigger nations did not take action which could have been effective; the smaller nations have taken up the case, making it a world issue and giving it its current prominence.</P>
      <P>The actions of the UN General Assembly and its officers have been frustrated on many occasions by the unwillingness of the Indonesians to yield control.  I welcome the fact that the UN Commissioner on Human Rights, Mr. José Ayala Lasso, is in Indonesia at present trying to pursue the issue.  I also welcome the ongoing discussions between the Indonesians and Portuguese which will be continued in January.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nonetheless there are still difficulties with intervention on these issues.  Atrocious, appalling, violations of basic human rights have happened in East Timor, yet the world does not seem to have made much of a difference.  This must be confronted at UN level.  The UN is examining its power of international intervention in issues like East Timor.  There have been a number of examples in the recent past where the power of world opinion has not made a difference &mdash; one is French nuclear testing, <Col N="1123" /> another is Nigeria, where, despite proposals from all over world, Mr. Ken Saro-Wiwa and his colleagues were executed.  The basic question to which we must return is that protests are made, countries like Ireland make statements on the world stage yet these atrocities continue.  I hope there will be a genuine effort to improve the power of intervention on these issues.</P>
    <P>Small nations can make a difference, as was shown when the Tánaiste confronted Dr. Alatas.  The intervention of Mr. Jon Pilger and others, who are willing to go into the country, take risks and confront the situation, makes a difference also.  We must continue this.  It must be frustrating for people like Senator Norris who attempt to find out what is going on and are turned back. The fact that he made the effort and despite being turned back, was able to make his statement and read Bono's moving message, attracts attention and affects world opinion.  This appears to be the most effective way this small nation can make a difference.  We must continue working and marking events, as we are today, continuing to impress upon the world that such human rights violations must be confronted effectively. I hope these efforts will continue to bring about changes and enable the nations of the world to intervene when human rights are being grossly violated and take the necessary action.  I also hope the ongoing talks between Indonesia and Portugal yield fruit and that people continue to protest so that there will be a change for the better in East Timor sooner rather than later.</P>

      <P>This debate has shown solidarity with the Timorese people on this, the 20th anniversary of the invasion of East Timor by Indonesia.  Regrettably, Europe has so far not chosen to make East Timor its business.  Although there have been honourable exceptions, the nations of Europe make distressed noises while continuing to export arms, conclude trade deals and maintain diplomatic relations with Indonesia.  In <Col N="1124" /> 1996 Ireland will hold the Presidency of the EU and I and my party, which is now in Government, will be seeking to use that Presidency to put East Timor at the top of the European political agenda and to ensure the EU adopts a resolute and unified position in this matter. It is appalling that over 200,000 have been killed and many others maimed.  I am glad of the opportunity to make this contribution.</P>

In raising this matter on the Adjournment, I am asking the Minister for Justice to consider whether or not the criteria are adequate for the granting of a licence under the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956, in view of disclosures made at Mallow District Court on Wednesday, 29 November 1995, when North Cork Community Radio was granted a renewal licence to run a weekly radio lottery on the application of Mr. Jack O'Rourke.</P>
      <P>This licence was granted despite the objections of Superintendant Frank McDermot who told the court that, contrary to legal requirements, North Cork Community Radio had consistently failed to submit required reports to him under previous licences.  The Superintendent told the court that Monsignor Denis O'Callaghan had given an undertaking in the early 1990s at a special sitting of Kanturk District Court that all necessary returns would be made to the Garda.</P>

      <P>Tá go maith.  Despite this, no returns had been made.  It was further contended in court that North Cork Community Radio had also breached the terms of its licence by paying an undisclosed sum of money to a private company, County Sound Radio Ltd., and that this had continued up to two months prior to the application for the renewal of the licence.</P>
      <P>The applicant told the court that up to the previous evening he had not realised that North Cork Community Radio had not been complying with certain requirements of the licence over the pevious four years.  He confirmed that NCCR were obliged to pay a sum to Radio County Sound Ltd.  It later emerged that the amount involved had been as high as £7,000 per month, although I understand and have good reason to believe that charities which were supposed to benefit from the lottery got something in the region of £100 per month.  Mallow General Hospital was used widely in literature promoting an NCCR draw two years ago, yet to my knowedge, no contribution of any significance was made to the hospital. Judge John Clifford, who granted the licence despite the objections of the Garda, said &ldquo;That is the way the law is &mdash; returns can be fudged&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>At the annual general meeting of NCCR, held recently, a shareholder told the meeting that he had received correspondence alleging that two people in west Cork had received £98,000 for running the lottery draw.  The chairman said NCCR had made great money from the draw and that it was a good business decision to run it.  NCCR currently holds a 9.7 per cent shareholding in Radio County Sound, Ltd., which has a licence to broadcast in north Cork, west Cork and Cork city.  There is currently a proposal for a management buy-out at County Sound.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This case raises a number of important issues which need to be addressed by the Minister.  Is she satisfied that lottery draws are being genuinely used for charitable purposes and not as some sort of a hidden subsidy for <Col N="1126" /> private business?  Most people subscribing to these lotteries believe that they are assisting deserving causes and would be angry if they knew their money was being largely used to benefit private businesses.</P>
    <P>In view of the disclosures in court, is the Minister satisfied that there are adequate arrangements for ensuring that recipients of licences comply with the law?  What levels of supervision are in place?  Have the Garda adequate powers?  It seems extraordinary that legal requirements could be ignored in the way indicated in the court and that the applicant could simply say that he was unaware of legal obligations.  Is the Minister satisfied that a District Judge can overrule the objections of the Garda and renew a licence, particularly where gardaí have given evidence that legal requirements had been totally ignored? On the basis of what emerged in Mallow District Court in this case there is a strong argument for a complete review of procedures by the Minister.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Sherlock for giving me an opportunity to speak to the House and to inform it about the situation relating to the criteria for the granting of lottery licences. I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, who apologises that she could not be here today as she is attending to other urgent business.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware of the case which has led the Senator to raise this issue.  She has obtained a report from the Garda about this particular case and I know the matter is being looked at closely.  I acknowledge that this is a matter of concern to Senator Sherlock, particularly as the case in question occurred in his home town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me say at the outset that the role of the Minister for Justice is in relation to the regulation of the particular type of lotteries which have been operated for many years.  The Minister has no role in regard to the national lottery and the Adjournment Matter debated here <Col N="1127" /> today is not concerned in any way with the selling of tickets for the national lottery or national lottery scratch cards. The primary legislation governing local lotteries is contained in the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956.  Under section 28 of that Act, the District Court is the authority empowered to grant a licence for the promotion of a periodical lottery.  A periodical lottery is one which is conducted over a continuing period, generally at intervals of one week.  The procedural requirements are set out in the Periodical Lottery Regulations, 1961.</P>
    <P>In the particular case referred to by the Senator, the District Court granted a licence on condition that all of the existing regulations will be adhered to in future and it is understood that the applicant has given a commitment that this will happen.</P>
    <P>In making a decision on any case, the courts are subject only to the Constitution and the law and they are, therefore, independent in the exercise of their functions.  It is not open to the Minister to comment or to intervene in any way in the conduct or outcome of any particular court case, whether it is a criminal case or any one of the various types of licensing applications which come before the courts.</P>
    <P>However, the Minister is aware that during the court hearing concerning this case, various factors were commented on and the District Court judge, having taken all the factors of the case into account, decided to grant the application for the periodical lottery licence. The Senator will appreciate that the granting of lottery licences in individual cases is solely a matter for the court and the Minister for Justice is not empowered by the legislation to interfere in any way.</P>
    <P>In raising this topic, Senator Sherlock asked if the Minister is satisfied with the criteria that apply to the granting of lottery licences.  The House will be aware there is a commitment in the Government policy agreement to reform the law relating to the administration and regulation of charities along the lines of <Col N="1128" /> the report of the committee on fund raising activities for charitable and other purposes.  The report, known as the Costello report, includes recommendations relating to the law on lottery licences.</P>
    <P>The committee, under the chairmanship of His Honour, Judge Declan Costello, concluded that more efficient controls are required over lotteries and made recommendations.  Occasional lotteries should be better regulated by requiring greater details at the time of application for a permit, controlling the maximum level of expenses, regulating sales, requiring returns and accounts to be submitted and ensuring the public are able to ascertain the outcome of the lottery.  A periodical lottery licence should operate only in the District Court district in which it was granted and, in addition, there should be provision for nationwide periodical lotteries by means of a scheme, approved by a central body which would set out details surrounding the conduct of such a lottery.</P>
    <P>More efficient controls are required over periodic lotteries and these should include: notice of intention to apply for a licence to be published in a newspaper; controlling the level of permitted expenses; only certain types of bodies could apply for such licences and the licence holder would prepare professionally audited accounts.  Organisations required to submit accounts following the promotion of a lottery should make them available at their local registered office for public inspection.  The House will appreciate that the report also contained a wide range of recommendations about other aspects of charities legislation.</P>
    <P>In June of this year the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Deputy Burton, chaired a seminar which was attended by a wide range of interested bodies as part of the process of examining what legislative changes are needed in this area.  The Department is now examining written submissions which were received following the seminar, and consultations with representatives <Col N="1129" /> of fund raising and charitable groups are continuing.</P>
    <P>I can inform the House that the Department of Justice is working to reform the law relating to the administration of charities along the lines of the report of the committee on fund raising activities for charitable and other purposes and it is the Minister's intention that proposals for amending legislation on these issues will be brought before Government as soon as possible. In this context, I assure the House that I will arrange that the points made by Senator Sherlock will be brought to the attention of the Minister for Justice and taken into account as part of the process of bringing forward legislative proposals in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I thank the Minister for Justice for granting the moneys to extend and renovate Birr Garda station.  It was welcome and the people and gardaí in the town are pleased.  I also ask the Minister to examine Tullamore Garda station because it is also in urgent need of renovation.</P>
      <P>I am raising this matter because I am concerned about continuing rumours concerning the withdrawal of Circuit Court sittings from Birr.  The Circuit Court has been sitting in Birr since the foundation of this State.  Indeed, superior courts sat in Birr for many years before that.  It would be a great loss if this existing facility, which serves both Birr and its surrounding area, was withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was delighted to see Birr courthouse renovated and refurbished.  It is now one of the finest courthouses in the country.  It has a proper courtroom and consultation room for client and their legal advisers, excellent judges' chambers, accommodation for the press and a fine public gallery.  A Circuit Court review committee was set up in 1994 by the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, and perhaps the <Col N="1130" /> Minister could let me know if its report may have been sent to the Department.</P>
    <P>It is in the interest of litigants to have courts sitting in venues close to where they reside so they do not have to travel long distances.  It is only proper and fair that a local court is available to people and we should ensure this is maintained.</P>
    <P>It is also an advantage not to have long court lists.  Huge numbers of cases are listed on them at present.  The list is circulated and all on it have to attend. Their cases are called out and these people must come back on following and subsequent days.  This practice brings the law into disrepute.  Solicitors, barristers and judges get blamed for it. There should be a better way of distributing work with regard to the organisation of these lists.  Although a major effort was made to improve this, having a large number of existing venues is much better than nothing and I am anxious to see this continue.  It is better for the judge and registrar to attend a town such as Birr rather than have people from the locality travel long distances.</P>
    <P>Birr is not the only town involved; other areas are also under threat from these rumours.  The existing facilities are already there and they pose no additional cost to the State.  It is false economics to close the Circuit Courts in Birr and other towns.  The primary priority for the Minister for Justice is to take the ordinary citizen into account and it is our duty to facilitate them in every way.</P>
    <P>Offaly is a large county.  Rather than having people travelling from Moneygall to Tullamore, it would be much better to keep the existing Circuit Court in Birr.  Similarly, people from Edenderry can go to Tullamore Circuit Court to have their cases heard, and I am certain I speak on behalf of many people.</P>
    <P>While judges should maintain control over the running of the courts and not have the Minister for Justice interfering with its workings, deciding on their venues should be a political matter and I bow to nobody on that.  We, in this House and in the Dáil, should make a <Col N="1131" /> decision about where our courts are to sit.</P>
    <P>To withdraw a service, such as a court sitting, from a town is something about which many would be very upset.  Court sittings provide facilities, even for business people in an area, such as for hotels, guesthouses, restaurants, licensed premises, etc.  They generate business for two to three weeks every year for many towns, which is of benefit to them, given the economic situation.</P>
    <P>Above all, we must think about the person who wants his case heard, and wants it heard in his local town.  We should ensure this happens.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the fixing of sittings of the Circuit Court is a matter for the judge of each circuit and the President of the Circuit Court.  The Circuit Court rules provide that sittings of that court shall be held at the places within each circuit as the judge of such circuit shall, from time to time, direct and appoint.  Section 10 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1947, provides that the President of the Circuit Court may, from time to time, by order, fix in respect of any circuit, in consultation with the judge of the circuit, the places <Col N="1132" /> therein at which sittings are to be held. This is a matter in which the Minister has no function.</P>
      <P>As mentioned by Senator Enright, the previous Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, established a Circuit Court Review Committee in March 1994 under the chairmanship of the President of the Circuit Court to review the circuits of this court in order to determine the optimum size and number of circuits and the optimum number of venues with a view to ensuring the efficient working of the Circuit Court in all areas.  The committee has submitted its report to the Minister and she is considering the report in the context of the Government's commitment to carry out a fundamental reform of the courts.</P>
      <P>The Working Group on a Courts Commission, which the Minister established recently, is to carry out a major reappraisal of the organisation and structure of all courts, and any decision she might take on the Circuit Court Review Committee's report will, of course, be made in the context of this reappraisal.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 1.55 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 12 December 1995.</P>
