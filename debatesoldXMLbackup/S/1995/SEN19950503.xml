      <P>I have received notice from Senator Wall that, on the Adjournment of the House today, he wishes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to ensure that where FAS initiate or assist with special schemes or projects with the Department of Justice that persons under the qualifying age be granted equal payment with qualified members.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse the sentiments expressed by the Leader to you, Sir.  The Order of Business is agreed.  In view of the expertise available in this House of television and the print media I ask the Leader for an early debate on the Green Paper on Broadcasting.  This House should have an opportunity to discuss the social housing document produced yesterday.  I note from some of the phrases used throughout the document that a script writer of days gone by is still in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On a number of previous occasions I raised the need for a regular debate on foreign affairs.  It is now time to get definite dates for this debate.  I also suggested that foreign affairs issues might be discussed once a month.  If this is not acceptable to the Leader, we will have to raise issues, say, on the Order of Business.  Over the last month I have raised a number of issues with the Foreign Affairs Committee.  If we can deal with issues at a particular time each month rather than raise matters piecemeal in the House, that would be a more ordered approach.  I would like a clear position on that.  Today I met with some people from a country where one sixth of its population are refugees.  This is an instance of the kind of thing that is happening in certain parts of the world but we are not aware of it because it has not received even one line of newspaper coverage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also ask the Leader for the date of the debate on the White Paper on Education. This document will be discussed in the Dáil tomorrow; he indicated previously that it would probably be discussed in this House some time this month.  The earlier it is discussed, the better.  Last week Senator Mullooly put forward the case that the debate should be held over a number of days and I support that.  However, in his response the Leader gave the impression that it might roll over a number of days.  I would prefer if it were structured in such a way that specific aspects of the debate were dealt with on particular days &mdash; for instance, the political <Col N="215" /> relationship with education, third level education, primary education and the involvement of parents in education &mdash; rather than simply spread over a number of days.  By putting a structure on it the Minister will be able to respond in a cleaner way.  I would like to hear the views of the Leader on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise two matters with the Leader.  First, what is going to happen to our Defence Forces?  Since Christmas there have been repeated requests for a debate on the Defence Forces.  There have been leaks about the EAG report, the Price Waterhouse report and now we have phase three of the leaking when we read in the papers what is proposed for the Defence Forces. The appropriate place to have this matter discussed is here, not in the press.  The Minister should come here and tell us clearly what is proposed for the future of the Defence Forces.  I am under the impression that I had a commitment from the Leader before the House adjourned for Easter that we would have such a debate, but my impatience is not yet such that I have checked the record.  I ask the Leader to arrange a discussion on that matter at an early date.</P>
      <P>The House also needs to discuss banking.  There were several requests from the other side of the House for a discussion on this matter.  Given the excellent document produced by Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, it would be interesting to tease out the unanimity or otherwise of views on the Government benches about banking and the possible need for a third force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>That is unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps this matter could also be discussed at an early date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I also wish to raise the issue of banking.  As I understand it, legislation which was promised did not include any measures to reform the banking system.  There are reports in <Col N="216" /> newspapers today that such matters are being considered.  I join Senator Dardis in the call for an early debate on banking. This will ensure that we get the Government position, rather than separate views being discussed in newspapers which undermines the system and confidence in it abroad.</P>
      <P>I hope the Leader of the House will arrange a debate on the Government proposals, as distinct from the different and diverse views which are being floated from Government.  This does nothing to establish confidence in the banking system.  Senator Dardis and I are of the one view on this matter and I hope a debate will be arranged soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>When is it proposed to introduce the legislation which was promised before the end of last month to amend the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945?  If it is not possible to introduce this Bill as a matter of urgency, I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the lack of action to deal with arterial drainage problems throughout the country, particularly in south Galway.</P>
      <P>To date, householders have received no money, even though some of them have been out of their houses for up to 16 weeks.  There has also been the unusual situation where a Minister of State promised money for drainage work carried out in south Galway, but the Secretary of the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht wrote to the local paper and stated that no approval had been given for any such project by the Department.  Ministers are criticising one another while people are suffering.  The situation has reached crisis point.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want a debate on this issue or the introduction of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a certain degree of sadness and concern regarding the Arterial Drainage Bill.  While I use terms such as &ldquo;concern&rdquo; and &ldquo;sadness&rdquo;, <Col N="217" /> I am tempted to use the word &ldquo;outrage&rdquo;. I do not have much experience in this House.  However, approximately eight weeks ago, Senator Daly introduced an Arterial Drainage Bill, which received quite an amount of support.  At that time, when the Minister, Deputy Higgins, asked the House to delay accepting Senator Daly's Bill to facilitate the introduction of a Government Bill, I stated:</P>
      <P>It comes down to speed.  I went to the Minister today and put it to him how important I felt this matter was. He has told me the heads of the Bill went to Cabinet yesterday, [1 March] and were approved, and to the Parliamentary Draftsman today.  He has given me a commitment and asked me to pass it on to the House that the Bill will be published before 30 April...</P>
      <P>Last week, I asked the Leader of the House when the Bill will be published. As far as I am concerned, a solemn undertaking was given to the House, but I heard nothing until I checked with the Leader today.  This is a serious breach of trust; the House is being treated with a lack of respect.  We were given a solemn undertaking by the Minister that it would be published.  Therefore, a number of us, on a very tight vote, decided to vote against Senator Daly's Arterial Drainage Bill and to support the Government's undertaking to publish a Bill before 30 April.  We have heard nothing since then.  This House is being shown a lack of respect and we should not accept such a standard.  I put it to the Leader that I will have great difficulty in supporting the Order of Business unless we ate given an undertaking which will explain to me why this House is being shown such a lack of respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator O'Toole that it is time that the House discussed the White Paper on Education. It has to be said that the introduction of the White Paper, which was a watershed in Irish education, has been somewhat overshadowed by the ongoing dispute over early retirement <Col N="218" /> for teachers, which is very important in its own right.  I sincerely hope that this White Paper will come before the House in the very near future.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senators Fahey and Quinn with regard to the Arterial Drainage Bill.  However, I am sure that there must be a genuine reason why this Bill is not before the House because the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Higgins, has shown a commitment second to none and has gone far beyond the call of duty in his dedication to bringing about a solution to the terrible problems facing householders, particularly in the Gort area of County Galway.  I am sure there is a reason which will be explained to the House and that the Bill will be in the House in the very near future.</P>
      <P>However, it would be remiss of me, as someone who comes from that area, not to pay tribute to the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Higgins, for his commitment and dedication in trying to find a permanent solution to the problems of the people of east Galway, a problem which has been ongoing for many years and about which very little has been done up to now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I support my colleague, Senator O'Toole, in relation to the presentation of the White Paper, which contains a huge amount of information. Could the Leader give us some indication of the format of the presentation? I suggest that we should divide it into three areas &mdash; primary, post primary and adult education &mdash; because there is too much involved.  I ask the Leader to take that into account.</P>
      <P>The White Paper has not been circulated yet to every school and teachers are very conscious that it is a very important document which they would like to read.  Before we discuss it here, there should be knowledge about it outside this House.  I ask the Leader to be aware of that and to give an indication of when the Minister is likely to discuss the White Paper here and how long it will take.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Leader of the Opposition in his call to the Leader of the House in relation to the Green Paper on Broadcasting.  I hope that there will be early opportunity to debate that.</P>
      <P>There have been recent media reports of a growing sense in the community of a level of intolerance and racism which is beginning to express itself in our society.  This is unacceptable.  In that context, could I ask the Leader if his Government colleague, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, would come into this House to listen to a debate on the whole area of the lack of laws in this country to outlaw discrimination on the grounds of race, colour and creed?  I know that this has been an ongoing matter over the last couple of years, but it has come to the fore today because of two incidents which happened over the last week.  These incidents angered me greatly, as they did many other people.</P>
      <P>The first incident was the media reports on the relatives of those who were tragically killed in County Kerry. On whether there is truth in the comments made by the survivors about the attitudes of their neighbours I do not wish to comment, but the matter was raised and statements were made.</P>
      <P>The second and more relevant matter is the inquest which took place this week with regard to an 18 year old Irish national of Vietnamese origin and the reports of his relatives who talked of the manner in which they had been subjected to racial abuse due to their origins. A great welcome was given to the Vietnamese boat people some years ago and it is totally unacceptable that these people who had to flee from persecution are now being subjected to racial abuse in this country.  It does not sit rightly with our image as a caring and compassionate society.</P>
      <P>In that context, I ask the Leader to find out from the Minister for Equality and Law Reform what stage he has reached in formulating laws which will outlaw such unsavoury and unacceptable practices in our society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat my request of last week to the Leader as to whether it is possible for the Minister for Justice to come to the House to update us on the drugs situation in Cork.  I have no objection to having a discussion on the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte's ideas on the banking system.  We should have a debate in the near future to broaden out our ideas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader has promised several Senators there will be a full debate on Northern Ireland.  In the light of the important conference on the development of the Border regions and Northern Ireland which will be held in Washington towards the end of this month, will the Leader make time available for this House to have an input into the economic progress needed for the Border regions and Northern Ireland? Approaching developments in Northern Ireland from an economic point of view would be a positive step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support my colleague, Senator Quinn, in his comments on the failure of the Government to produce the arterial drainage legislation.  He was given an undertaking; but I cast my mind back some years to a session of this House when my colleague, Senator O'Toole, was given an undertaking which was not met.  The then leader of Fianna Fáil when questioned on this replied that it was an undertaking but not an absolute undertaking.  Perhaps what was given to Senator Quinn on this occasion was not absolute.  It is important that we press for an answer from the Leader on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the debate on this issue I made that point that I was an Independent Senator who sometimes voted with the Government and sometimes against it.  On this issue I had three requirements which I had discussed with Senator Manning and Senator Cosgrave: first, that the most valuable suggestions made by Fianna Fáil in the Bill would be accepted and introduced by the Government in its legislation; second, that this legislation would be introduced in the <Col N="221" /> Seanad; and, third, that there would be a realistic timescale within which the legislation would be introduced.  I said at the time that I had been satisfied as to all three criteria.  It appears that I was inadvertently misled and I look forward to the Leader's explanation.</P>
    <P>I support Senator Mooney's call for a debate on the question of discrimination. I imagine he was leading up to asking the Leader of the House for a timescale.  I understand there has been a commitment given to the introduction of an anti-discrimination Bill.  I am most interested in this legislation, which is overdue.  It will now be supported by Fianna Fáil, which is a pleasant alteration of the previous position.</P>
    <P>Finally, I ask the Leader for a debate on a survey published today which those of us who are committed Europeans would find most worrying.  It shows that 30 per cent of Irish businesses experience serious difficulty in dealing with our European partners, especially Germany, France and the UK.  They experienced discrimination against Irish products in favour of goods domestically generated within these countries, obfuscation by the authorities, and deliberate delays in processing documentation.  It is worrying that 30 per cent of our business people are experiencing these problems when the internal market has been completed and that we are still being discriminated against by our partners in Europe in this fashion when there is supposed to be a free flow of labour, services and goods.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I call for a debate on tourism. There is enormous potential for the expansion of this industry, especially when the peace process in Northern Ireland is taken into account.  I ask the Leader to arrange such a debate at an early date.  I support the call for a debate on banking and the control of banks in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also support the call for an immediate debate on the Arterial Drainage Bill, which is supposed to come before this House.  I raised this issue last week and the Leader gave me a guarantee <Col N="222" /> that the Bill was near publication.  The Minister, Deputy Higgins, must be complimented for trying to find a solution to a serious problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I look forward to the Leader's explanation why the Arterial Drainage Bill is not before us today.  As has been said already, the Bill I introduced, having been examined in detail, was broadly accepted on all sides of the House.  Senator Quinn is right to say he was misled because contrary to what was said by other speakers, a firm commitment and a firm date was given by the Minister.  That is on the record of the House.</P>
      <P>This is a serious situation and I ask the Leader to make a clear statement now.  It is not acceptable to say this is still with the draftsman and has yet to go back to Government.  We were given solemn undertakings that this legislation, which will be broadly similar to the Bill I produced, as the Minister has since acknowledged, would be introduced at the end of last month.  This is most unsatisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I too support the call for a debate on banking institutions, which has been mentioned here for the last number of months.  I also support Senator Fahey's comments on the Arterial Drainage Bill.  It is of major concern both in Galway and in my county, Kerry.  Members are asked daily when the legislation will be introduced.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister of Social Welfare to come to the House for a full debate on cutbacks in FÁS schemes.  This is a serious setback to local and community groups which have done tremendous work throughout the country, showing great spirit and enthusiasm.  The Minister should explain what he intends doing with FÁS in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I will begin by replying to the questions on the arterial drainage Bill.  I, too, regret that it was not possible to meet the commitment to publish the Bill by the end of April.  The position is that the Bill has been completed. <Col N="223" /> There was a last minute legal question which has been sorted out, but not in time for yesterday's Government meeting. It is on the agenda and will be cleared at next Tuesday's Cabinet meeting and will be available next week.</P>
      <P>There were three parts to the commitment. The second and substantial part was that the Bill would be taken in this House and that will be the case.  It was also said that the Bill would be in this House before the end of May.  I can guarantee that the Bill will not just be in this House before the end of May but, if I get co-operation from all sides, the Bill will be through this House well before the end of May and whatever time is needed will be made available. There was no attempt to mislead the House.  There was a genuine last minute legal hitch in the drafting of the Bill.  I have been pressing very hard to ensure that the Bill is given top priority as has the Minister of State, Deputy Higgins, and the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>The Bill will be through Cabinet next Tuesday and it will be published straight away.  I will make time available at the first possible opportunity in the month of May to have the Bill debated in this House.  I will give it as much time as is needed to ensure that we are on schedule from this House by the end of May. That is the substance of the matter at hand.  I apologise that the Bill was not published as indicated but that is the position at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Wright raised the Green Paper on Broadcasting.  We would all welcome a debate on that fairly soon. Senator O'Toole raised the question of foreign affairs.  I propose that we would make a couple of hours available on a Thursday afternoon once a month for a foreign affairs debate.  I would be happy to start that regular series of foreign affairs debates tomorrow week.  I would like an input from the Members of the Foreign Affairs Committee to ensure we are not reinventing wheels or doing work that is being done by that committee. <Col N="224" /> We can start that debate tomorrow week.</P>
    <P>When a debate on the White Paper on Education was raised by Senator O'Toole, it was originally intended that it would just be a one off session of about three hours, with the Minister replying, as we have had in two recent debates.  I now realise that will not be sufficient and I am happy to meet with Members of the House.  The debate will be open ended and will go on as long as people need to speak on it.  I would be happy to talk to Members of the House who have an interest in the debate to see if we could structure it under headings of first level, second level, third level and so on.  Perhaps we could talk about that after the Order of Business.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis raised the question of defence.  I gather the Minister will be happy to come in and talk about defence and I will convey the Senator's invitation to him.  I think his mind is clear on what has to be done and that can be arranged.  We must have a debate on banking.  We tried briefly at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges last week to find a structure for the debate on banking so we would not be covering old ground and could debate it in a structured way.  We did not come to any great agreement as to what we should do.  I will try again to get some sort of agreement on that and the debate can then go ahead.</P>
    <P>I share Senator Mooney's sentiments regarding discrimination and I will convey what he has said to the Minister.  I am not sure if Senator Mulcahy was urging that we have observers at the conference in Washington.  There is a debate on Northern Ireland due soon and it will include the point made by Senator McGowan on a number of occasions that we look at the question of cross-Border aid, co-operation and development.  I will convey to the Minister for Justice the question of drugs in Cork.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this short Bill is to amend the provisions of the Road Traffic Acts, 1961 to 1994, dealing with the imposition of consequential disqualification orders following conviction for certain road traffic offences.  The Bill arises from a review of the operation of the drink driving and other enforcement provisions of the Road Traffic Act, 1994, which came into operation on 2 December of last year.</P>
      <P>Before dealing with the specific provisions in the Bill, it would be helpful to outline for the benefit of the Seanad the developments which gave rise to the new proposals.</P>
      <P>The principle of consequential or mandatory disqualification is that the courts must, on conviction for specified offences, impose a minimum period of disqualification from holding a driving licence.  This has been a feature of our road traffic legislation for many years and experience shows it to be a very effective deterrent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1994, a new Road Traffic Act was enacted following detailed consideration in both Houses of the Oireachtas. That Act was comprehensive in its scope and included a general updating <Col N="226" /> of the law governing drinking and driving. It also included a range of new measures which had been recommended by an inter-ministerial group which had been looking at ways to reduce the cost of motor insurance.</P>
    <P>Prior to the 1994 Act, legislation governing drinking and driving was set out in the Road Traffic (Amendment) Act, 1978.  Under the 1978 Act, the maximum permissible blood alcohol level for drivers of vehicles was 100 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood.  A person found guilty of exceeding the blood alcohol limit of 100 milligrammes was liable at that stage to the following penalties: mandatory disqualification from driving for a minimum of one year; a fine of up to a maximum of £1,000 and imprisonment up to a maximum term of six months.</P>
    <P>The new drink driving provisions in the Road Traffic Act, 1994, were introduced by the previous Administration as a road safety measure and were part of a much wider road safety campaign which has been ongoing since 1991.  The new provisions reduced the blood alcohol limit from 100 milligrammes to 80 milligrammes, increased the mandatory disqualification period to two years and introduced a new requirement to pass a driving test before a licence is returned.</P>
    <P>The 1994 Act did, however, give some discretion to the courts in this area.  It allowed the court to apply a one year disqualification and to decide not to apply the driving test requirement where the court is satisfied that there are special reasons to justify such a course.  The other penalties were not changed.  The maximum fine of £1,000 and the maximum term of imprisonment of six months were not altered. Subject to those maxima, the level of any such penalty is entirely a matter for the court itself.</P>
    <P>The drink driving and related enforcement measures of the 1994 Act came into operation on 2 December 1994.  The commencement of the provisions coincided with the launch of the annual Christmas road safety campaign <Col N="227" /> which traditionally involves intensified road safety publicity and enforcement.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that the new measures introduced last December had an immediate impact.  In December 1994 there was a major reduction in road casualties, both deaths and injuries, compared with the same period in 1993.  In December 1994, 28 people were killed on the roads and 729 were injured compared with 41 deaths and 965 injuries in December 1993.</P>
    <P>While it cannot be claimed that the reduction in road accident deaths and injuries was directly or solely achieved by the new legislation, it is clear that a combination of the new legislation, the intensified enforcement and the publicity campaign had a very positive impact from a road safety perspective.</P>
    <P>However, there was also a negative reaction to the Act.  It is fair to say that the new measures were controversial and that they gave rise to significant media and public interest.  There were claims that the new measures were placing the livelihood of those employed in the drinks industry at risk and that there was a negative impact on social life, particularly in rural areas.  It was claimed that the penalties were excessive and, in particular, that a single minimum disqualification period, irrespective of the level of alcohol in individual cases, was unfair and resulted in penalties being imposed which took no account of the severity of the actual offence committed.  The House will recall that there was a vigorous demand for change, but there was also a strong campaign seeking to ensure that the stringent measures were kept in place.</P>
    <P>These developments were monitored and the Government decided that a review of the provisions should be undertaken.  On 4 January last I announced that I would meet with a variety of interest groups to hear at first hand their views on the impact of the new measures.  The groups I met included representatives of vintners, restaurateurs, hoteliers, the insurance industry, Mothers against Drink Driving <Col N="228" /> and the Campaign against Drunken Driving.  In addition to the oral submission, I received written submissions from a wide cross-section of opinion.</P>
    <P>During the consultation process, a number of interest groups sought an increase in the blood alcohol level from 80 milligrammes back to the former limit of 100 milligrammes.  The limit of 80 milligrammes now applies in eight member states of the European Union and the limit in the other states is lower. The Government is in full agreement with the blood alcohol limit of 80 milligrammes in force since 2 December 1994.</P>
    <P>All the evidence available to us indicates that the risk of accident rises sharply when the blood alcohol level exceeds 80 milligrammes.  At that level, the risk of involvement in an accident is significantly greater than the risk of a driver with zero alcohol and it would be a negative step to amend the law to increase the limit.  The Government has no intention of taking such action.</P>
    <P>As part of the review, I also sought advice from the Attorney General on the feasibility of introducing a range of disqualification periods to be linked to the amount of alcohol consumed in individual cases so as to match the disqualification period to the gravity of the offence committed.  Most of the interest groups which made written or oral submissions to me had argued strongly that such a system of graded disqualification periods would be more equitable and more likely to attract the support of the public, particularly the motoring public.</P>
    <P>The desirability and feasibility of introducing graded penalties has been considered on a number of occasions in the past.  I understand the former Minister considered the issue during the passage of the Road Traffic Act, 1994, but that he was advised, following consultations with the Office of the Attorney General, that there were difficulties arising from the operation of a tolerance which resulted in borderline cases not being prosecuted.</P>
    <P>However, I have been advised that, on the coming into operation of the <Col N="229" /> 1994 Act, the Director of Public Prosecutions has reviewed the need for that tolerance and that he decided, on the basis of assurances given to him about the accuracy of analysis, to discontinue the tolerance and to prosecute borderline cases.  The Attorney General has advised me that this decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions removes a major obstacle to the introduction of a graded system of penalties.</P>
    <P>A further element of the Road Traffic Act, 1994, which I reviewed was the requirement to pass a driving test before a driving licence is returned following conviction for drink driving offences. The courts have had a discretionary power since the early 1960s to impose such a requirement, for example, where the court was of the opinion from the evidence given that the convicted person was not competent to drive.  This requirement to pass a driving test, following conviction for certain offences, was made mandatory in the 1994 Act. While it may have a deterrent value, the Government believes that an obligation to pass a driving test is not an appropriate penalty for drink driving offences and has decided that the provisions should be amended.  Accordingly, such an amendment is before the House today.</P>
    <P>I would like to outline details of the proposed amendments in the Bill.  The changes to the disqualification requirements are set out in section 2.  This section proposes to substitute two new subsections (3) and (4) of section 26 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, as inserted by the 1994 Act.  The new subsection (3) outlines the changes to the provision which currently requires persons convicted of certain offences to pass a driving test in addition to the minimum period of disqualification before the driving licence may be returned.</P>
    <P>Under existing provisions, set out in the 1994 Act, the requirement applies where a person is convicted of any drink driving offence, of dangerous driving or of leaving the scene of an accident where death or injury was caused.  The amendment now proposed will confine <Col N="230" /> the requirement to resit a driving test to two serious offences &mdash; section 53, dangerous driving where death or serious bodily harm is caused, tried on indictment; and section 106, hit and run where death or injury is caused.  The courts will retain a discretion not to apply the driving test requirement where the court is satisfied that special reasons exist to justify such a course of action.  The effect of this change is that the requirement will not apply in the future to drink driving offences or to offences of dangerous driving tried summarily.</P>
    <P>The new subsection (4) sets out the proposed new disqualification requirements for drink driving offences.  Consequential or mandatory disqualification will continue to apply to all drink driving convictions, but the subsection proposes minimum periods of disqualification for certain drink driving offences depending on the level of alcohol found in the arrested person's breath, blood or urine.</P>
    <P>The Bill restates the offences to which a two year disqualification for a first offence and a four year disqualification for second or subsequent offences are to apply.  These include the old drunk driving offence, that is, the offence of being under the influence of an intoxicant to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of the vehicle.  Those periods of disqualification will also apply to all offences of refusing to provide a specimen for analysis.  The Bill proposes that where people refuse to give a sample, the maximum penalty provision will come into force.</P>
    <P>For the purposes of offences of exceeding the alcohol limit, the Bill proposes three different grades or penalty bands, each with a different minimum period of disqualification.  The lowest band will be drivers convicted with a blood alcohol level in the range of 81 to 100 milligrammes.  This is the new offence category introduced last December.  There will be an automatic three month ban for a first offence and a six month ban for a second offence in this category.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="231" /> The middle band will be drivers with blood alcohol levels in the range of 101 milligrammes to 150 milligrammes. There will be an automatic one year ban for a first offence and a two year ban for a second offence in this category.  A one year ban has applied since 1978 to all drivers with blood alcohol levels over 100 milligrammes.  That is restoring it to the position prior to last December.  The highest band will be drivers with blood alcohol levels over 150 milligrammes. There will be an automatic two year ban for a first offence and four years for a second offence.</P>
    <P>I previously described these proposals as tough but fair.  The three month ban for a conviction with a blood alcohol level between 81 and 100 milligrammes is a significant penalty, with the usual consequences including a motor insurance loading.  At the other end of the scale, people with blood alcohol levels over 150 milligrammes will face an automatic two year ban.  The provision in the 1994 Act which allows the court to impose a one year ban where special reasons exist is to be dropped.  As a result, people with alcohol levels over 150 milligrammes will, in practice, be subject to longer disqualifications.  The statistics of the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, which analyses the blood and urine specimens, show that 75 per cent of people who provide a blood or urine sample are in this top band.  The import of the three bands are to make it less severe at the lower end, to retain the middle ban as it was prior to last year and to increase the penalty so as to make it more severe than the new legislation for those who are well over 150 milligrammes.  People will welcome this as a tough but fair system.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill contains transitional provisions and applies to offences committed since 2 December 1994, when section 26 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994, came into operation. Some drink driving offences committed since 2 December 1994 have already come to trial and persons convicted have been dealt with under the 1994 <Col N="232" /> Act.  Other offences committed in the same period have not yet come to trial, but when they do they will also be dealt with under the 1994 provisions.  To do otherwise would introduce an inequality before the law, with harsher penalties applying simply because a case came to trial more quickly.</P>
    <P>However, section 3 of the Bill before the House today will allow all persons who committed relevant offences since 2 December 1994, and who are dealt with under the 1994 Act, to apply to the court seeking to have disqualification orders amended so as to have the provisions in section 2 of this Bill applied to them.  Transitional provisions on these lines are not strictly necessary.  The penalties which apply to any offence are those prescribed in the law which is in force at the date of the commission of the offence.  However, I believe that the transitional provisions in this section are desirable and that they will be recognised as being fair and equitable.  I did not want a situation to exist where for a period of time between December 1994 and the passage into law of the current Bill, people would be dealt with more harshly for the same offence than they would subsequently.  So the help of the Attorney General was sought in devising a mechanism where people can go back to the courts and have the provisions of this new Bill applied to them when it is enacted.</P>
    <P>In drawing up the proposed changes in this Bill I was anxious to ensure that the efforts of my predecessor.  Deputy Michael Smith, to whom I want to pay tribute, and the progress made in recent years with our road safety campaigns would not be undermined.  Statistics of road deaths and injuries in recent years have shown a steady improvement and we must continue to take firm action to secure the maximum level of safety for road users.</P>
    <P>During my extensive discussions with all interested parties it became clear to me that various groups have a role to play in achieving the common objectives of allowing rural life to flourish and at the same time to ensure that our roads <Col N="233" /> are safe.  These proposals represent my best effort at striking that balance and I exhort all others to play their part in achieving this important objective.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I want to stress again that the new measures should not be interpreted as a licence to drink and drive.  The purpose of these amendments is to ensure that penalties are appropriate to the offence.  They are certainly not intended to give comfort or succour to the drunken driver.  The penalties provide the basis for effective and ongoing enforcement of the anti-drink driving policies well into the future.</P>
    <P>There is evidence that the majority of the public increasingly supports the notion of not driving after drinking.  We will continue, through the ongoing national road safety campaign, to educate and inform road users of the dangers of mixing the two.  However, if our road safety campaigns are to be effective we need public support, and it is essential that this support is not lost through measures which are perceived as draconian.  I believe that public support can best be built on through a measured campaign which includes enforcement and penalties which hit hardest at the serious and persistent offenders.  This Bill sets out to do that in the best way that I can see, and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>For a long number of years successive Ministers for the Environment, and Governments, have campaigned vigorously to reduce the number of deaths and injuries on the roads. Road safety campaigns, public advertising programmes, new legislation &mdash; updated from the early 1930s in 1961, 1965, 1978, 1984 and again now &mdash; and many other methods were used and adopted in an effort to minimise the number of road deaths and injuries. Each new campaign was publicly promoted, but nevertheless the toll of death and injury continues to bring tragedy, misery and pain to thousands of families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every year over 400 people die on the <Col N="234" /> roads while 10,000 more are injured, many of them being permanently incapacitated. The continuing high level of death and injury on our roads is a cause of deep concern and no effort must be spared to reduce that carnage.  While all these deaths are not alcohol related, many of them are and, as everybody in the House knows, one death is one too many.  It was against this background that the Houses of the Oireachtas passed the Road Traffic Act, 1994. After a discussion in the Dáil, a special committee discussed it in detail and there was a fairly long deliberation on its Second and Committee Stages in this House in early March 1994.  A record number of amendments were tabled in the House and Members had an opportunity to discuss the issue in detail, which I do not propose to do now.</P>
    <P>While the 1994 Act has been the subject of much criticism, nevertheless it focused attention on the danger of driving with excess alcohol, perhaps more than any other initiative which has been taken over the past 20 years.  The early signs of reduced road fatalities since the introduction of the legislation indicated that the new law was having a marked and significant effect.  In introducing the legislation the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith, and the Government were convinced that the measure was necessary to make an impact on the increasing number of tragedies on our roads and that the legislation was necessary and essential to bring about a significant reduction in the toll of death and injury.  It may transpire that the 1994 Act may have brought about a turning point in the spiralling number of road tragedies and it may have already had an important influence in changing attitudes nationally to drinking and driving.</P>
    <P>The international trend today is towards a situation where those who drink, regardless of how little, will not be encouraged to drive.  The Minister indicated the European standards and the situation which prevails in most states in the European Union.  Even in the short time since the 1994 Act was <Col N="235" /> passed, there has been an increasing level of awareness, especially among young people, of the dangers of driving while under the influence of alcohol. Since the Act was introduced more and more young people have refrained from drinking so they could drive to facilitate their friends.  There is a far greater understanding among young drivers, in particular, of the dangers involved and I hope this will help to reduce the numbers of young drivers who drink.  I have had personal indications of this, especially at Christmas, when groups of young people in my locality, which is a rural area, made the necessary arrangements to ensure that on their nights of entertainment there would be somebody who would not drink and would drive.  Perhaps the 1994 Act will have a very big impact on young people, change many of their attitudes and have an important impact on the effort to reduce the number of fatalities on our roads.</P>
    <P>It would be true to say &mdash; and the Minister acknowledged this &mdash; that the public reaction to the new measure was not favourable.  It has been demonstrated on many other issues that public acceptability of any legislation is essential if the law is to be effective.  The general view that the penalties were excessive and needed to be adjusted and looked at more carefully in the light of the discussion which took place and that there was a necessity to have some amendments and changes made was generally widely accepted throughout the community.  A change in the law was demanded and I believe the Minister was wise to examine the penalties.  He acted very expeditiously and I compliment him on the way he met with the various organisations and representatives who went to see him and on the speed with which he took action and introduced this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is a sizeable number of people who believe that the present law should not be changed.  Many of them feel that the law should be stronger in this area. Many of them have suffered the trauma <Col N="236" /> of having children, parents and relatives killed on the road by drunken drivers. No words could adequately express our deepest sympathy to those who have lost relatives and friends in tragic road accidents.  However, laws and penalties alone will not bring an end to such tragedies.  There must be general acceptance in the community that drinking and driving is a recipe for catastrophe and must be ended.</P>
    <P>During the past year there has been an organised campaign by the Licensed Vintners' Association to secure changes in the 1994 legislation.  When I and other public representatives had meetings with the representatives of the Licensed Vintners' Association they were courteous and understanding and made their representations in a fair and frank manner.  I accept that licensed vintners in Ireland are equally concerned at the appalling number of road fatalities.  The Licensed Vintners' Association is a responsible body and fully recognises that it is not in its interest &mdash; no more than anybody else's &mdash; to see the number of road fatalities from alcohol related accidents increase. The vintners would accept, however, that there is a connection between death on the roads and drunken driving and that while the penalties have been adjusted, their continuing co-operation is essential and must be forthcoming to assist in the campaign to keep Irish roads clear of drunken drivers.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil will not oppose this measure.  However, we would not wish to send out a message, or a signal, that we will go easy on drinking and driving. On the contrary, in the event of an escalation of drinking and driving and a continuation of the appalling tragedy of death and injury on our roads, we will not be slow to support further measures and controls to end the slaughter on the roads if the situation warrants it.  The Minister has been fair in this Bill.  It is not our intention to propose any amendments at this stage.  I am sure the Bill will have the widespread support of all Members of the House.</P>
    <Col N="237" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and particularly the measure he is bringing before us.  I join in the observations he made in the concluding part of his speech when he said that the new measures should not be interpreted as a licence to drink and drive.  He also said that the purpose of these measures was to ensure that the penalties are appropriate to the offence. There is widespread acceptance of those sentiments in the House.</P>
      <P>Senator Daly complimented the Minister for responding to the difficulties that arose following the implementation of the legislation last December.  I concur with Senator Daly.  I compliment the Minister on proposing a regime that can be described as fair, just and balanced in dealing with what emerged as a sensitive issue.  The approach adopted by the Minister reflects common sense and understanding, qualities that had to be applied to the situation that had developed.  I am satisfied that the Minister is applying those qualities in this Bill.</P>
      <P>I welcome the graded penalties.  A number of us campaigned and argued for such penalties during the passage of the 1994 Act.  I also welcome the elimination of the mandatory requirement to pass a driving test except in the two circumstances outlined by the Minister in his speech &mdash; section 53, where dangerous driving causes death or serious bodily harm and is tried on indictment and section 106, where death or injury is caused as a result of hit and run.  That is a fair, balanced and appropriate approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that the penalties in the 1994 Act were perceived as being draconian.  He is correct; that would also be my description of the penalties.  In addition, I would say that they were unbalanced and that they caused a degree of social upheaval in rural Ireland that we have not witnessed previously, certainly in my lifetime.  As a result of the implementation of the 1994 Act countless thousands of law abiding people became virtual prisoners in their homes over the Christmas period.  Compliments <Col N="238" /> are due to the Minister and to his colleagues in Government for recognising that fact and for responding to it reasonably quickly.  Compliments are also due to my colleagues in both Houses of the Oireachtas who recognised that mayhem was being caused and who lobbied to prevent a recurrence of such mayhem over the coming months.  While the Minister is responding to and dealing with that situation fairly effectively, he is also retaining safeguards in the legislation to protect the community from drunken driving.  He has the support of all sides of the House in doing that.  He has the support of probably all the organisations that campaigned for a more enlightened approach to the effects of the 1994 Act.</P>
    <P>I have a special interest in so far as I am a licensed vintner.  I make no apology for the occupation in which I am proud to be involved.  I wish to make a few points about the social role, as it were, of the pub in rural Ireland. However, before I do that, it must be pointed out that the dispersal of population in this country is unique in the European context.  People in Europe mainly live in towns and villages.  There is a greater dispersal of people in rural Ireland.  The pub has emerged all over the island and certainly in the rural areas as being the centre of social activity.  Indeed, the rural pub is more than that.  It has helped, more than any other source, to preserve and develop our unique culture that is expressed through music, singing, dancing and so forth.</P>
    <P>The contribution the pubs of Ireland make to tourism is enormous.  Figures show that a visit to an Irish pub is visitors' second choice of activity.  They enjoy the atmosphere and find it unique.  The spread of Irish pubs throughout Europe and the United States is an example of a unique institution finding its way, developing and prospering on both sides of the Atlantic. Pubs are a most valuable asset to our economy.  In another way &mdash; and I say this with the utmost care &mdash; in rural <Col N="239" /> Ireland and particularly in winter the rural pub is often the medium that preserves the sanity of an aging population.</P>
    <P>While in a general way I support the Bill, it is only natural that a Member of the House will examine the Bill and wonder if there are ways in which it could be improved.  The Minister might consider an amendment giving the courts discretion when dealing with people with a blood alcohol level of 81 to 100 milligrammes to impose a fine rather than the three months driving ban.  I will outline the circumstances later in which that might apply.  The argument for this amendment can be made under three headings.  The first is that, as a matter of principle, discretion in all circumstances, and not only with regard to this measure, should rest with the courts.  No two cases are ever the same, and I argued this when we last debated this issue.  I said then that, in general terms and not solely with regard to drink driving, the imposition of mandatory penalties and the compelling of courts and judges to impose these penalties reflects on the integrity and confidence of the Judiciary.  As a general principle I am in favour of giving discretion to the courts, having examined and considered the facts of each individual case.  With regard to drink driving, this suggestion should apply to people whose blood alcohol level is in the low category.  I would prefer to see it applied to all categories, but I am satisfied that there is no hope of achieving this.  The Minister should, therefore, consider this improvement to the legislation.</P>
    <P>The second argument has been put forward to all of us in a letter dated 21 April 1995 from the Drinks Industry Group.  The letter deals with the effects of the legislation on the social drinker, including the costs of insurance, especially when an accident is involved. The letter begins:</P>
    <P>The Drinks Industry Group has noted with approval the proposals of the Minister for the Environment to <Col N="240" /> introduce certain amendments... in relation to the graduation of penalties and the deletion of the mandatory requirement to pass a driving test...</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding these improvements, the Group remains concerned that a conviction for a first offence where a blood/alcohol count is between 81 and 100 mgs. carries with it a minimum disqualification period of three months.  We believe this to be an unnecessarily severe penalty particularly when no other offence has been committed.</P>
    <P>Reliable information obtained by our Group from the insurance industry indicates that where no other offence or accident has been involved such a disqualification would result in a loading of between 100-250 per cent on the basic premium.  [In his address, the Minister accepted this.]  Such a loading is, we are sure you will agree, excessive albeit that our statistics indicate the number of likely offenders would be quite small as evidenced by the Medical Bureau's analysis of specimens taken during December 1994 as set out below &mdash; [these figures bear out the Minister's remarks]:</P>

    <P>We believe that such a loading. having as it would a five year life, would be an excessive economic penalty even greater than that imposed by the law.</P>
    <P>... This being stated we believe that it would be equitable to give the courts the discretion to impose a fine without the necessity to order an endorsement of licence at the 81-100 mgs. blood/alcohol count level where a first offence is involved.</P>
    <P>The Drinks Industry Group has a reasonable argument in this instance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="241" /> The third argument can be made under the heading of those on an errand of mercy.  The Minister has recognised the situation in rural Ireland, and coming from a rural county &mdash; County Clare &mdash; I can testify that there are parts of west County Clare which are 70 miles from a general hospital and up to 98 miles from a maternity hospital.  A sudden illness, accident, threatened miscarriage or whatever may arise, but since an ambulance is, equally, 70 miles away, a good neighbour can be pressed into service, and perhaps having consumed a pint or two he is stopped at a check point.  It is now down to the discretion of the garda at that check point, because once the driver, on an errand of mercy, blows into the bag, a court cannot, even if a life, or a number of lives, have been saved, exercise discretion once the bag and the sample have shown that the person concerned is over the level of 81 milligrammes.  The errand of mercy argument, therefore, is one the Minister should accept.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other points which could be made with regard to this argument, some of which I have first hand knowledge.  In the rural areas in my county, doctors can live ten miles apart and they operate a rota system. Last Christmas, one doctor, who was off duty for the night, threw a party for his family and friends in his home.  The doctor on duty was attending an emergency and following a traffic accident the doctor off duty was called and asked to attend.  He reluctantly did so.  The gardaí arrived in due course, both drivers were breathalised and the doctor said to me later: &ldquo;I was damn lucky they didn't try me as well&rdquo;.  He approached me, because I am a Member of the Oireachtas, to explain the kind of dilemma which face him and others like him in isolated rural areas.  I discussed this matter with a vet and he said they have the same problem.</P>
    <P>We are not dealing with human lives, but this is a factor that people who do not understand what living in rural Ireland is like and the effect such measures can have, often ignore.  I know <Col N="242" /> of a case where the fire alarm went off and the fire crew assembled.  The driver, having been in the local pub, got into the cab.  There was a Garda check point a couple of hundred yards down the road, but because the blue light was flashing and the siren was sounding they were waved through.  The vehicle arrived at the farm and the fire was extinguished, but the driver was not prepared to drive the vehicle back to base, with the result that the fire chief had to be contacted to find another driver. Luckily, no other fire broke out in the area at that time but, if it had, there would have been consequences because of that man's fear of being stopped at the checkpoint which had probably been moved.  The driver got a fright. When driving to the scene of the incident, in his anxiety to participate in an errand of mercy, he did not realise that he was approaching a Garda checkpoint. A similar experience &mdash; about which I do not have first hand knowledge and can only mention in passing &mdash; occurred in another county with regard to relief ambulance drivers.</P>
    <P>However, I do have knowledge of the following case &mdash; and it occurred in a county adjoining to my own.  There were two elderly neighbours who usually drove the two miles into town to have a few drinks.  One of them was very worried about the new law.  He asked the local Garda sergeant how many pints he could safely drink.  The sergeant knew this man and told him to park the car at the end of the village, facing towards home, to have the few drinks as usual and to go home, quietly and carefully as he always did and he would be all right. That arrangement was fine until the sergeant was off duty one night and the squad car from the city &mdash; I live between two cities and I will not identify the city more closely than that &mdash; set up a checkpoint. The man of whom I am speaking rolled down the window and explained that he had an arrangement with the sergeant but he was breathalysed.  The rest is history.  Now under section 3 the Minister is providing the opportunity to rectify this to some degree.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="243" /> These are my reasons for inviting the Minister between now and Committee Stage to consider providing that element of discretion, particularly where an errand of mercy is concerned, in the legislation to enable the court to judge each case on its merits.  I leave that in the Minister's hands.  The Bill is titled the Road Traffic Bill, 1995.  We are dealing with road traffic and while the inclination is to discuss the measures solely connected with drink driving, the fact that it is titled the &ldquo;Road Traffic Bill&rdquo; gives it wider scope.  For that reason I will refer to a number of other aspects of road traffic.  I have taken my information from two documents published by the National Roads Authority &mdash;<i>Road Accident Facts in Ireland, 1993, and National Roads Authority Report, 1988 to 1992.</i>  Both documents come from the Library.  I have examined them and made some notes.</P>
    <P>In 1993 431 people were killed on Irish roads, an increase of 4 per cent over the number killed in 1992, but there were more vehicles on the road in 1993 than in 1992 and the fatality rate per licensed vehicle on the road was actually unchanged.  I understand that road accidents fell in 1994 by 6 per cent. As the new regulations only came into force in December 1994 we cannot say that they were entirely responsible for that 6 per cent reduction.  Ireland has the fourth lowest number of road deaths per 100,000 of population in the European Union.</P>
    <P>The analysis of persons killed in 1993 on a percentage basis shows us that car users at 43 per cent and pedestrians at 33 per cent are the two highest categories, followed by motorcyclists at about 12 per cent.  An interesting statistic here relates to the hours most associated with accidents.  The six hours between 9 p.m. and 3 a.m. represent 25 per cent of the time available.  It might be assumed, therefore, that 31 per cent of the accidents which occurred during this period might in some way be linked with driving but the hours between 3 p.m. and 9 <Col N="244" /> p.m. had a higher accident rate of 34.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>Another interesting fact has emerged from these publications; I am putting these facts on the record because of statements made by people outside the House in relation to the influence of alcohol in driving accidents.  In the 1992 publication it is stated that in 6 per cent of road accidents, alcohol was a factor; in 64 per cent, it was not a factor, and in the remaining 30 per cent the driver's condition was not known.  From these statistics it is obvious that to blame most road accidents on drunken driving is incorrect.</P>
    <P>The reasons for fatalities on our roads are many.  A great deal could be done to reduce the accidents without reducing alcohol limits or increasing the penalties for those who are over the limit.  I will refer to a number of other statistics. It is known, for example, that other factors have a part to play in road accidents, for example travelling in excess of the speed limits, the failure to wear safety belts, the failure of pedestrians in rural areas to wear reflective markings on their clothing at night, inadequate protection in cars, such as side impact bars etc., the mechanical failure of cars, pedestrian carelessness or mistakes, the failure of cyclists to wear helmets, poor roads and road engineering and weather conditions.  During winter time the weather can be a big factor in road accidents because drivers have to contend with frost, ice, snow, fog, mist or high winds.  Of the total number of fatal accidents, 61 per cent occurred in daylight or on well lit roads and 37 per cent occurred on dark roads with no lighting.</P>
    <P>Certain actions could be taken by the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Justice to reduce road accidents, apart from changing the alcohol limits.  The Minister could ensure that, before obtaining a driving licence, each person sits a written test on the rules of the road and the cause of accidents; all persons with provisional licences should be required to drive with a fully licensed driver; there should be an annual test of roadworthiness for all cars; attempts <Col N="245" /> should be made to ensure that all imported second hand cars have undergone a roadworthiness test on entry to the State; incentives should be given for accident free driving; an attempt should be made to reduce the speed limits to the United States levels and to enforce these limits accordingly; penalties for exceeding speed limits should be increased; year-round consistent enforcement of traffic regulations should be ensured; a special division of the Garda with its own resources should be established to specialise in this area and pedestrians should be required to wear reflective clothing in unlit areas at night.  Another proposal that might be considered, especially for learner drivers or for those who have been convicted of exceeding the speed limit, would be to legislate for the fitting of speed governors to cars, as happens in the United States.</P>
    <P>I have made these points because the title of the Bill enables us to deal with aspects of road traffic regulations that extend beyond those relating to drunk driving.  I welcome in general the proposals the Minister has put forward in this legislation and I invite him to consider making additional amendments on the basis of the arguments I have made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I also welcome the Bill. I am glad the Minister paid tribute to his predecessor, Deputy Smith, who was most courageous in introducing his Bill in the face of much opposition.  I stated at that time that some of the Bill might require further examination.  The present Minister has taken the opportunity to do so, although perhaps sooner than I would have liked.  Nevertheless, most Senators had a certain amount of unease about points in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must also pay tribute to the Mothers against Drink Driving, an organisation which for many years pushed for a more much serious attitude towards drunken driving.  For too long, it was far too acceptable for people to <Col N="246" /> leave our homes or pubs and drive with excess alcohol in their blood.</P>
    <P>A section of the Bill deals with consequential disqualification and proposes that a person must resit their driving test.  This was a rather harsh measure in the original Bill, especially in view of the fact that there is a considerable delay before one can take a test and punishment had already been imposed. Has the Minister considered those people who may be convicted of a drink driving offence but who have never taken a driving test, such as those who got driving licences under a general amnesty?</P>
    <P>I recall one such amnesty where thousands of people got full driving licences without taking a test and I think there was a further amnesty.  Perhaps these people should be required to take a test. Most drivers are reasonably good, but there must a considerable number of drivers who have never taken a test.  In addition, some people appear to be able to get temporary licences on a continual basis, although they have failed the test on several occasions.  One hears very little about these people until somebody is involved in a fatal accident, which may not necessarily involve drink. These two groups must be examined when the Minister is considering the implementation of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard made an extremely good point when he said that drivers with provisional licences should be accompanied by a person with a full licence.  This was the case and I am sure it was as inconvenient for people with young adult children as it was for me. We must examine this area again, given that so many fatal accidents involve young people.  I agree with a great deal of what Senator Howard said about accidents.</P>
    <P>The Minister made the important point that the Bill must be considered in the context of a continuing national road safety campaign and not in isolation. The original Bill shook everybody up and must have done a great deal for taxi drivers in Dublin over the Christmas period.  It is almost impossible <Col N="247" /> to gather from statistics the effect of various factors in accidents.  The closest I could get to statistics on fatalities and injuries on roads show that 27 people were killed and 278 injured in February compared with 29 fatalities and 699 casualties in February 1994.</P>
    <P>For the first two months of this year. the figures dropped to 55 people killed and 1,402 injured compared to 59 fatalities and 1,443 injuries last year. However, as Senator Howard pointed out, it is very difficult to pinpoint significant factors in such statistics.  For example, one does not know the vehicle usage or the weather conditions &mdash; whether it was frostier in February this year or last year.  Although it is difficult to make comparisons, we must acknowledge that there was an improvement.</P>
    <P>The benefit of graduated penalties, in terms of the level of alcohol in a person's blood, is that it appears to be more just, especially when the person was not involved in an accident.  Various statements have been made as regards how much it is safe to drink, whether one should eat beforehand and what type of people are more likely to be affected by drink.  However, we must be careful about setting down definite guidelines.</P>
    <P>I was interested in the item on the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; at Christmas when Gay Byrne invited four people, two men and two women, to a dinner party during the show.  They all had a drink before dinner and each consumed approximately half a bottle of wine during the meal.  I do not think any of them had over 60 milligrammes blood alcohol when they were tested.  In general, a considerable amount of alcohol must be taken &mdash; although I am not recommending that people consume a considerable amount to see how much they can take before they are charged with drunken driving &mdash; before the limit is reached.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned an interesting statistic &mdash; that 75 per cent of those tested were over 150 milligrammes; this means they were quite drunk.  The problem with the limits <Col N="248" /> arises when it is not just one person who has taken an excessive amount of drink, weaving around the roads, but several people in the same condition.  The accident rate in those circumstances, which could also involve pedestrians, cannot be examined in the context of statistics, but it could be of importance.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been as fair as possible with regard to the penalties.  Perhaps it is as well to leave them as mandatory sentences, given the recent court judgment in relation to the possible abuse of the appeals system and the reduction of sentences and fines.  I am fully aware that no two cases are the same, as Senator Howard said. However, as regards a doctor who goes out to an accident but who is unfit to drive, he or she could be in even more trouble with the medical defence union. A good Samaritan act in such a situation could land a doctor in very serious trouble.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, we must consider the Bill as part of a comprehensive national safety campaign.  I agree with Senator Howard that other legislation must be enforced.  Senator Howard mentioned seat belts; I gather the level of compliance in this regard is approximately 60 per cent in urban areas and 40 per cent in rural areas.  I must declare an interest in this area.  As a doctor, I see so many serious injuries which could have been avoided if people involved in accidents had been wearing seat belts. In fact, many fatalities would not have occurred if seat belts had been worn.</P>
    <P>In this regard, I point in particular to the lack of compliance with the regulations concerning the seating of children. We still see tiny children and children under the age of 12 years sitting in the front seats of cars and they can be seen as projectiles when they sit between the two seats in the back.  If parents are not prepared to make some effort to take care of their children, further action must be taken to enforce the legislation in this area.  I am sure most Senators recently read a report of an accident where a child was killed when it was thrown from a car.  It was <Col N="249" /> under no restraint whatsoever and the adults in the car, who were restrained, stepped uninjured from the wreckage. This area must be considered again.</P>
    <P>I am glad vehicle inspection tests will be introduced next year.  It is dreadful that the introduction of these tests took so long.  With any luck, they should be self-financing.  I was in Hungary last year and I noticed the condition of the cars worsened the further I travelled east.  I sometimes think that cars, which are not in good conditions, are sent to peripheral parts of Ireland.  This issue must also be examined.  There is legislation dealing with tyres, but I do not notice people being prosecuted in this regard.</P>
    <P>As Senator Howard said, there is a great deal which we could deal with in addition to this legislation, such as speeding and going through red lights. All of us in this city must be aware of the number of times that red lights are broken.  It is quite impossible to say to children that it is safe to cross when the lights change because people go through the red lights at every crossing.  One of the most notorious places for this is the corner of Merrion Road.  Why have cameras not been brought in to put a stop to that?</P>
    <P>Concentrating our efforts on those who drive after taking an excess amount of alcohol is not all that is needed; we must look at the whole perspective.  I hope that the tenor of the Bill will be reflected in enforcing legislation.  Bringing in legislation is one thing, but do we have the ability and the will to enforce it?  If we do, although the legislation has been modified, it will be very useful.  We also need to enforce the existing legislation and to not look at every accident as being a one issue matter: it could be speed, bad driving, bad weather conditions and alcohol.  The whole perspective must be looked at rather than singling out this one area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, to the House and the Minister, Deputy Howlin, who was here earlier.  I compliment <Col N="250" /> them on meeting the various groups after the controversial Bill was published in 1994.  The new measures, which were published just before Christmas 1994, were the most controversial for a long time.  They received significant media and public interest and became the most talked about topic at county council, urban council and town commissioners meetings and in pubs and clubs.  People were wondering if they would ever be able to drive again if they drank.  It created a great deal of controversy, which I am very glad that the Minister met head on, and he has come up with a solution which we hope will be acceptable.</P>
      <P>I am glad to see that the periods of disqualification have been graded.  It was not fair for a person with a driving licence with the letters A, B, C, D and E to lose their licence for having 81 or 85 milligrammes of alcohol.  The new graded system of three months disqualification for 81 to 100 milligrammes; one year for 101 to 150 milligrammes and two years for over 151 milligrammes is much fairer than the previous blanket disqualification.</P>
      <P>The Minister has amended the requirement for a driving test to offences where death or serious bodily harm is caused and tried on indictment, or leaving the scene of accident where death or injury was caused to a person. The element of discretion left to the court on this is very welcome.  The requirement to sit a driving test after a simple offence of having 85 or 105 milligrammes of alcohol was very unfair and a very severe penalty, considering that many people's jobs depend on driving.</P>
      <P>There is also the problem of people having to drive in an emergency the morning after they have been drinking. Some people, having taken all precautions the night before, at a wedding or whatever, thinking that they would not have to drive the next morning. receive a call from their boss that an emergency job has to be done.  I hope that proper discretion will be used by the people who have the power in that instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="251" /> Jackie Healy-Rae in Kerry portrayed the situation in regard to pubs very well when he said that the only DART he saw in Kerry was the dart thrown at the dart board.  The scene in rural Ireland is quite different to that of the cities where it is possible to get a taxi for a few pounds or a late bus.  In rural areas the pub is the social centre for many people who live on their own in isolated areas, not within walking distance of the pub. A scheme to make taxis and hackney cabs more easily available should be looked at.  The opening hours should be left to the discretion of the pubs, as happens on the Continent.  If some pubs closed at 9 p.m. and others closed at 10 p.m. people would not be rushing to get a last drink before closing time.</P>
    <P>Disqualification at 80 milligrammes is in line with other EU members.  Eight members have a limit of 80 milligrammes, one has a limit of 70 milligrammes, four have a limit of 50 milligrammes, one has a limit of 40 milligrammes and one has a limit of 20 milligrammes.  If we retained a limit of 100 milligrammes we would not be in line with the rest of Europe.</P>
    <P>Drink driving is only one aspect of road safety and we need to look at many other aspects.  For example, on many long distance, good roads I have frequently encountered slow drivers in the middle of the road.  One is told to keep into the left as far as possible and if that was adhered to it would stop a great deal of frustration which often leads to accidents.  Bad signals or no signals and small vehicles pulling out in the middle of the road to turn left &mdash; of course, large vehicles have to do that &mdash; will also have to be looked at if we want to save lives on the road.  The junior school warden scheme is an excellent scheme which works very well and it should be extended to post primary schools.  Television and the newspapers can also play a large role in road safety.</P>
    <P>With regard to drink driving, it is very unfair to have such huge insurance loading when no accident is involved.  A person should be penalised in the courts by <Col N="252" /> being disqualified from driving or fined. However, even where there is no personal injury or damage or insurance claim, a person's insurance is doubled. That is a second penalty about which something will have to be done.  If young people are caught over the alcohol limit they can be refused insurance or the premium is made so high that it is as good as refusal.  It is not fair to penalise a person twice for an offence.</P>
    <P>Many people who live near rural pubs walk there at night, especially in the winter nights, wearing dark clothes, which makes the roads treacherous. People walking to and from pubs on a wet or foggy night wearing dark clothes are endangering their own lives and those of drivers.  We need to stress this.</P>
    <P>Young people racing cars in built up areas, doing hand brake turns, spins and so on, is very frightening and will have to be clamped down on.  There are often speed traps on wide open roads where there is not a great deal of danger. However, in built-up areas speeding and dangerous driving need to be tackled to protect lives.</P>
    <P>A pedestrian crossing in a rural area may not always be noticed.  Children often think they have the right to run across them.  I wonder if zebra crossings are appropriate for rural roads; in rural villages they can be a hazard.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on dealing with the difficulties in the law encountered before Christmas.  The previous Minister, Deputy Smith, had a terrible time and members on the Government side also had difficulties.  The Minister has recognised that the graded system is better and that taking a person's licence was not right in all cases.  I hope he will examine the insurance issue because it is not right to doubly penalise people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EddieBohan" hpid="Mr. Bohan Mr. Bohan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bohan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, to the House. The Minister for the Environment is to be congratulated for introducing this legislation, which represents a fair and commonsense approach to the vexed question of drink driving offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="253" /> While it is clear the 1994 Act was well intentioned, it is equally clear in retrospect that it signally failed to make the punishment fit the crime.  In so doing it caused severe disruption in the public's normal social life as well as creating unnecessary hardship for the drinks industry &mdash; one of Ireland's most important industrial sectors, employing more than 60,000 people in the manufacturing, distribution and retailing of alcohol.</P>
    <P>While accepting that the permitted blood alcohol levels introduced in the 1994 Act bring Ireland largely in line with the rest of Europe, it is true that the social implications of the related penalty system had a more far-reaching effect on customers than was originally intended.  The rigid and quite severe system of penalties under the Act gave rise to very high levels of uncertainty as to how much alcohol could be consumed by drivers and, therefore, responsible consumers, who represent by far the majority of drinks industry customers, were forced in many cases not to drink at all.  Successive Governments and their enforcement agencies, not only here but in other countries, have been notoriously coy about defining what sensible drink driving limits are.  A level of 80 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood may mean a lot to a police sergeant but not to a motorist.</P>
    <P>Over the past ten years or so drink driving has become a steadily less socially accepted practice.  The practical experience of the implementation of the 1994 Act, particularly over the Christmas period last year, reversed this desirable development and brought the law into public disrepute.  The Irish drinks industry has consistently encouraged consumers to find alternative ways of travel to and from their place of alcohol consumption and this policy is emphasised annually by the industry's funding of pre-Christmas national and local radio advertising campaigns which advocate such an approach.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="254" /> The grading of the penalty system, particularly at the marginal levels of infringement, combined with a higher degree of discretion granted to the Garda and the Judiciary in the implementation of these penalties will overcome many of the adverse public reactions directed at the 1994 legislation by the public and the retail trade.  I am glad the Minister has recognised this in the new legislation.  It has been suggested by members of the anti-alcohol lobby that the new amending legislation was introduced due to publican pressure.  It was not publican pressure but public pressure and the Minister sensibly recognised this.</P>
    <P>In graduating the penalties and dispensing with the obligation to do a driving test after a drink driving conviction the Minister has adopted the right approach.  For many people, particularly the elderly, having to do a driving test before having their licence restored would mean they would be permanently off the road.</P>
    <P>Much has been written and said in recent months on the issue of drink driving.  A problem with the debate is that in Irish circumstances there seems to be little reliable research upon which to base conclusions.  The result is that many of the arguments put forward rely on emotional statements rather than on hard facts.  The same does not apply elsewhere.  In the United Kingdom in 1994, for example, of 105,932 drivers breathtested after road accidents only 6.6 per cent were found to be in excess of the 80 milligrammes limit.</P>
    <P>Evidence from the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Finland indicates the blood alcohol count among fatally injured drivers or those arrested for impaired driving is not low.  It is much higher than the legislative minima and the average count was in the region of 170 milligrammes. The overwhelming majority, about 80 per cent, of fatally injured drinking drivers had blood alcohol counts well over the national limits: 65 per cent had blood alcohol counts in excess of 150 milligrammes and nearly 50 per cent <Col N="255" /> exceeded 200 milligrammes.  In those countries many fatally injured drivers had blood alcohol counts between 300 and 400 milligrammes.  Research also indicates there are not many high blood alcohol count drivers among the motoring public and corresponding policies and programmes that target the offending group can produce significant results.</P>
    <P>There is no strong case for disassociating drinking and driving as a general policy; but in Ireland, as in other developed countries, only a small core of people are responsible in one way or another for the majority of road deaths where alcohol is involved.  Evidence also suggests this small core does not respond well to broad based conventional enforcement systems, such as random police checkpoints.  A selective rather than a broadly based enforcement policy may be more effective in dealing with this small group of individuals as a long term and ongoing process.</P>
    <P>It must be recognised that drink driving is not the only cause of deaths, accidents and injuries on our roads.  Speed and poor road design must also assume an important part of the blame.  Joyriding and car theft are other factors about which little has been done.  Between 1985 and 1994 over 87,000 cars were stolen in the Dublin area alone.</P>
    <P>I, like my colleagues in the industry, am concerned that a conviction for a first offence where the blood alcohol count is between 81 and 100 milligrammes carries with it a disqualification period of three months.  This is unnecessarily severe, particularly where no other offence has been committed or no accident has taken place.  Disqualification for many may mean the loss of a job or livelihood, a related penalty which carries a cost that far exceeds the relative importance of the offence.</P>
    <P>Reliable information from the insurance industry indicates that where no other offence or accident has been involved, such a disqualification would result in a loading of 100 to 250 per cent on a basic premium.  Such a loading is <Col N="256" /> excessive, albeit that official statistics indicate the number of likely offenders will be quite small.  For example, only 5 per cent of those tested during December last at the height of the drink driving crackdown had blood alcohol counts between 81 and 100 milligrammes. Such a loading, as it would have a five year life, would be an excessive economic penalty, even greater than that imposed by the law.  The ongoing policy of the Irish drinks industry is to use every possible opportunity to promote the sensible use of alcohol at all levels and on all occasions.</P>
    <P>Broadly speaking, the Minister's new proposals will restore public respect and confidence in our drink driving laws. Once again, he is to be congratulated for the steps he has taken.  That said, I request him on grounds of equity to go further and give the courts discretion to impose a fine without the necessity to order a suspension of licence at the 81 to 100 milligramme blood alcohol account, where a first offence is involved.</P>

Molaim an bheirt agus an Rialtas faoin iarracht atá siad ag déanamh an réim slándála a chur i bhfeidhm do na sluaite atá ag baint usáid as na bóithre sa tír seo faoi láthair.</P>
      <P>In welcoming the Ministers, Deputy Howlin and Deputy O'Sullivan, to the House I compliment them.  After much soul searching and discussion the Minister has recommended to the Government certain amendments to the Road Traffic Act, 1994, and the Bill to that effect is now before the House.  The Minister has taken the view that it is not fair that a driver barely over the 80 milligramme blood alcohol level should be liable to the same penalties as someone driving with twice or more the legal limit.  This makes good sense.  The Minister is to be strongly commended for his decision and the stance he has taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="257" /> The decision will also command more respect from the driving public than the law which existed heretofore.  To apply the law as rigorously to someone just over the 80 milligrammes limit as to someone who is over the 150 milligrammes level is grossly unfair and totally unacceptable.  It makes no sense.</P>
    <P>This Government is not advocating drinking and driving; no Government has or will do so.  Too many accidents have been caused by people who have taken it upon themselves recklessly to sit behind the wheel of a car in a condition which endangered not only their lives but the safety and lives of others. A campaign against drink driving will reduce the number of accidents, save lives and reduce claims on insurance companies.  One hopes that in the future it will contribute to further reductions in premia.</P>
    <P>The connection between alcohol level in the blood and the likelihood of accidents is now well known and has been established and confirmed by international studies.  Many of us here have too often stood beside open graves and grieved with relatives and families. These things might not have happened if more care had been taken with the consumption of alcohol.</P>
    <P>There must be no relaxation of the campaign to reduce accidents and slaughter on our roads.  Our accident figures are still much too high.  While we all recognise and accept alcohol can be and is a major factor in road accidents, speed is the chief factor.  Due to my geographical location in the far west of Galway I have to travel across the country on a weekly basis to the Seanad.  I see how speed limits are broken and the ruthlessness with which drivers are using our roads.  A clampdown on speed is imperative if we are to reduce the level of accidents.</P>
    <P>Possibly the greatest offenders on our roads at present are drivers of large trucks.  The current speed limit for such vehicles is 50 miles per hour, but many lorry drivers are not obeying that limit. It becomes increasingly difficult to get <Col N="258" /> past these large trucks &mdash; it is like a nightmare at times.  The Minister and the Department should examine this area.</P>
    <P>As the years go by stronger and more powerful cars come on the market and people endeavour to get from A to B at a quicker pace.  There is a major problem on the national, secondary and regional roads in rural Ireland.  These roads were not built for speed and are unable to take the huge volume of cars travelling on them at high speed.  A major campaign is needed to discourage speeding; perhaps the existing campaigns could be relaunched as we come into summer.</P>
    <P>The 30 miles per hour and 40 miles per hour speed limits signs in towns are welcome but they are no longer effective in many instances.  Drivers have got used to the signs and they make no impression on them.  The only reason drivers slow down in speed limit areas is the fear of being caught.  I must say <i>mea culpa</i> in this instance.  New signs should be placed in villages in small towns, stating the area is subject to Garda speed checks.  The danger of overtaking on a continuous white line should also be brought home to drivers.  This happens regularly &mdash; many times when driving along part of the road marked with single or double white lines cars have sped past me.</P>
    <P>In any discussion on a Road Traffic Bill it is important to refer to the dangers of speeding and the need for drivers to slow down and obey the regulations. I trust when this Bill becomes law and people accept the limits for consumption of drink while driving, the Minister will turn his attention to the major killer on our road, which is speed.</P>
    <P>This Bill should not be interpreted as a licence to drink and drive.  The measures proposed are designed to link the penalty to the severity of the offence and not to give leeway to the drunken driver.  As the Minister has said, the measures are tough but fair.</P>
    <P>The current law had a profound effect in pubs, particularly those in rural Ireland, during the Christmas period <Col N="259" /> last year.  The tougher laws meant empty pubs, massive financial losses and job cuts.  In the big cities this led to a culture change, with people staying at home and drinking there.  It led to there being fewer cars on the road.  As has been said, that was fine for people in large cities where one could catch a bus or DART but in the rural countryside the effect was devastating.</P>
    <P>I live in the heart of the countryside and am happy to do so.  The nearest public house is one mile from my house and many Members would say the walk would do me good.  I am currently the only Fine Gael Oireachtas Member in County Galway who is known to take a drink.  After the constituency revision announcements yesterday, I am not sure whether I am in East or West Galway but I am definitely in County Galway. However, that is a discussion for another forum and another day.  If I were to walk to the nearest pub I would have to walk on the N63, which is the road leading from Galway to Roscommon and ultimately to Belfast and the North of Ireland.  One could not risk walking on that road because of the speed of the cars travelling on it and its terrible condition.  There has been a major campaign for a number of years to upgrade this road from national secondary to national primary status so we can have a proper road to cater for the huge volume of traffic.  I will not go into that issue at this time.</P>
    <P>In general in rural Ireland the people cannot walk on our roads at night for safety reasons.  If people were to set out to walk in large numbers, it would cause a major problem and lead to many more deaths and killings on our roads.  People have a major problem going for a drink or two in rural Ireland.  It has to be accepted that, particularly at the end of the week, people who have been working like to go for a game of cards or darts and have a drink or two.  The low limit and frightening penalties virtually made many people prisoners in their own homes, particularly during the Christmas period last year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="260" /> Like every other married person in this House, I have great affection, respect and love for my wife.  However, over the Christmas period I think she felt I was growing over amorous because every day I asked: &ldquo;Ger, are you available for the Corrib Great Southern tonight, Ballinasloe tomorrow night or Tuam the next night?&rdquo; She does not take a drink and I do.  Much as I love to have her with me on these occasions, it was very handy to have somebody to drive me home at the end of the night having had two or three pints.  Extra pressure has come on the wives of politicians who have to be on the road with their spouses almost every night of the week.  We all know the strains on politicians to attend different functions.  This could also be the case for a lady politician who takes a drink and perhaps uses her husband, if he is a non drinker, to drive her home.</P>
    <P>I welcome the change in the driving test regulations.  The requirement to pass a driving test following conviction was made mandatory in December 1994.  While it may have a deterrent value, the Government now believes &mdash; and I welcome this decision very much &mdash; that it is not an appropriate penalty for drink driving offences.  It has been decided to delete that requirement and of course retain such a requirement for two serious offences &mdash; dangerous driving tried on indictment, where death or serious bodily harm is caused, and hit and run, where death and injury is caused.  This is a sensible decision and I commend the Minister and the Government.</P>
    <P>The basic purpose of the measures is to ensure that penalties are appropriate to the offences.  I do not think anybody can quibble with that.  The penalties provide a basis for effective and ongoing enforcement of our anti-drink driving policy in the future.  I also believe that the terms enshrined in the new Bill will help to allow rural life to flourish and at the same time ensure our roads are safe. Quite a good balance has been achieved.  It would be remiss of me and others in this House not to commend <Col N="261" /> the Minister for the Bill before us.  Like everybody else, I appeal to drivers to adhere to the stipulations contained in the law.  I also appeal to the Minister to accept what I have said about the terrible effects of speeding on our roads, particularly on national secondary, county, regional and rural roads which are built for the accommodation of traffic moving at a reasonable pace and not for speed.</P>
    <P>In general I welcome the Bill.  There are certain stipulations which have already been referred to by my colleague, Senator Howard, and on which I will not elaborate.  He made a strong case that in certain instances discretion could be used to great effect.  I support what Senator Howard said and I hope the Minister will take cognisance of it.  I welcome the Bill and I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire Stáit, Deputy O'Sullivan, go dtí an Teach seo agus go dtí an Aire maidir leis an Bhille seo.  We all thought the Bill was a little too severe in ways.  While listening to the contributions here, it struck me that the biggest criminal in our society today seems to be the motorist.  A person can steal a car, rob a bank with it and crash it.  When he goes to court he is brought before a psychiatrist and a psychologist for assessment and ends up doing community work.  The poor man coming home and doing a few miles more than he should within a specific area or who has taken a wee drop over the limit is the criminal and is put off the road practically for life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the last 20 years or so we introduced speed limits to make the roads safer and reduce insurance.  There are speed checks everywhere and I sometimes think they are more of a danger than anything else.  Very often, the gardai rush out of a gateway with what I call the hairdryer and a person driving fast has to slam on the brakes.  This can cause more harm than good.  I appeal to the gardaí on those checks to stand out on the road and be open and honest <Col N="262" /> about it and not hide in gateways as it is a danger.</P>
    <P>I was speaking to a policeman in England last year.  They were using all available power to prevent accidents at a certain roundabout but accidents were still occurring.  They decided to simply put up cameras.  Anyone driving in England recently will have seen that it there is a speed check ahead there is a notice saying &ldquo;Police Speed Check Ahead&rdquo; and everyone slows down. There are also signs saying &ldquo;Cameras Ahead.&rdquo;  People are driving much more carefully.  The policeman told me that since they introduced this new system they have a better relationship with the people and fewer penalties.  He said they were too busy to be out on the road stopping cars.  They had too much crime on their hands and wanted all their men on crime and detection.  Since they brought in this new system, everybody has slowed down.  There is no longer any mad speeding on the motorways.  The police may or may not be on duty when the camera is there.  They came out in the open and it is a far better system.</P>
    <P>We introduced the insurance disc which was supposed to be the greatest thing since the sliced pan and would guarantee that every car would be insured and insurance costs would drop. We have insurance discs and still a big percentage of cars are uninsured.  What has the disc done?  We then stipulated that tyres had to measured and have a certain thread or else one was committing an offence.  We all have new tyres now and great cars, but the number of accidents and insurance cases are still increasing.  Now they are talking about testing the safety of motor cars.  How many times does anyone see an old banger involved a crash?  Very few.  It is big cars like Mercedes, MG's and Porsches that are involved.  The person driving the ten year old car will be driving between 35 to 40 miles per hour inside the yellow line.  Bringing in safety tests for cars is not the answer either, but the Department should introduce it in such a way that it will be <Col N="263" /> implemented without any garage being involved.</P>
    <P>It is a bonanza for the garages doing the testing as far as trucks are concerned. They will find many problems with a truck if it is brought in for testing. They will say that they cannot pass it and that it should be traded in. However, if it is traded in, it will be on the road a month later.  If these laws are introduced, their implementation must be taken out of the hands of those involved in the trade.  If this provision is implemented, it will put a lot of small garages out of business.  I was involved in that business at one stage.  Indeed, I maintained that I was the only one armed mechanic in Ireland.  Only the bigger garages will have the DOE regulations and he will not pass any truck without a fault.  Many of the smaller truck garages have gone out of business because no matter how well they tested a truck, it is easy for another garage testing it to find faults with it.  There is no appeal and one does not have a choice. If the Minister is bringing in safety testing for cars, I ask him to have it done by a local authority tester in a similar way to the driving test.  Nobody in the trade would then be giving him a list of the things to be fixed for the sake of making money.  If this testing is ever brought in, that would be the only fair way to do it.</P>
    <P>I drove for years without taking a driving test.  I then decided to get a hackney licence and did a test.  After my accident, I also had a test for competency and a medical test for fitness. However, was there ever any research done to find out how many of us who started driving without any test were ever involved in a motor accident?  It would be interesting to do a survey to see how many, if any, of those who were driving under the amnesty were involved in accidents.  When people pass a driving test they think they are great drivers.  However, those of us who have been driving for many years know that only experience and practice makes a good driver.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="264" /> I see pedestrians as a major problem and something needs to be done about them.  How many times, when the traffic lights are green, do people walk across in front of a car and ignore the fact that the driver has the right of way?  The driver then has to stop and let them walk across in front of him.  I guarantee that one would not get easily onto Pearse Street with a car.  A driver has to slowly edge out onto the street because the pedestrians will ignore him.  This matter needs to be examined because they too are often responsible for accidents.</P>
    <P>I have said for many years that there should be no bar extensions.  Pubs should be allowed to stay open until midnight and after that time the shutters should come down, irrespective of whether the bar is in a pub, club or hotel.  The existence of bar extensions is one of the main reasons for accidents, especially in summertime.  People may decide to go there instead of going home after the pub closes.  If there were no bar extensions, there would be a more balanced drinking regime; the small pub would have a better chance of competing and nightclubs would be less of a den for drugs and drink.  A young person recently told me that the reason many people took drugs was that they were far cheaper to buy than drink.  If the breweries decided to decrease the price of alcohol, there might be a corresponding decrease in the use of drugs.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refer to the serious matter of endorsements.  The Minister should bring in a clause, either in this or in some other Bill, to deal with this matter.  It has already been said that if one gets an endorsement on their licence &mdash; they were in no accident and did no injury to anyone; they were just caught at a checkpoint &mdash; although they may have their car insured for only a small period, they will not get their money back for the reminder of the period for which they have paid.  They can suspend their cover, but if it is not reintroduced before the time of renewal it will be lost anyway.  One would have paid their insurance but it would have <Col N="265" /> then gone down the swanny; the insurance company would have it.  If people want to get insurance after having their licence endorsed &mdash; I was told this by a man who had his licence endorsed &mdash; they have to get five refusals from five different insurance companies and then go to the Insurance Federation of Ireland.  The Federation will instruct a company to give them a quote, but it could give any figure.  If having car insurance is mandatory, there is a need for a law to make it compulsory for insurance companies to give insurance at a reasonable rate when one does not cause them any costs or expenses.  Endorsing licences and taking people off the road for a year is nothing compared to getting back on the road. The Minister should seriously examine that point.  Often a person who is only slightly over the limit is caught and the penalty they pay is horrendous as far as insurance companies are concerned.</P>
    <P>I have always campaigned against alcohol abuse because I believe it has caused more hardship in this country than anything else.  There is a great outcry against smoking, but it does not do half as much damage to health, the people or the community as alcohol abuse.  Using alcohol in moderation is okay but it is not all right to abuse it. There is a high rate of abuse in this country and something should be done to try to stop it, but that is another day's work.</P>
    <P>As far as this law is concerned, I am delighted that the Minister has brought in a graded system of fines. It is unfair to impose the full penalty if one is only slightly over the limit.  That is one thing I will never be caught for because I do not intend to get involved with alcohol at this stage.  However, it is criminal that insurance companies should be this hard on drivers with an endorsement; they are being treated too severely.  Motorists face penalties like parking fines everywhere and the reason for imposing these penalties is that everyone knows he will pay.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="266" /> A new speed limit system has been introduced in some villages forcing cars to drive in single file.  It is a great system. If it was implemented in all of our villages, it would stop speeding through our villages far better than any garda with a radar.  This system prohibits speeding.  The 70 mile an hour speed limit on dual carriageways is too low. The speed limit for modern cars with ABS brakes, good suspension and new tyres should be at least 75 to 80 miles an hour, which is not fast today.  I would like to know how many Ministers' drivers keep within the speed limit; I guarantee that few do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Who is in charge of the car?  The speed limit on national primary roads should be at least 65 miles per hour.  There would be traffic jams if everybody drove at 55 to 60 miles per hour.  As a Member said, slow drivers are often a greater hazard on the road than fast drivers.  There should be a happy medium.  I would like the Minister to increase the speed limit slightly on dual carriageways.  We could all live with a 70 to 75 mile an hour speed limit and few would exceed it.  I welcome the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  This is a good Bill which deals with reservations expressed in the House when the previous legislation passed through.  It is a pity that the Bill was not amended at the time and that the then Minister, Deputy M. Smith, did not respond to the arguments made to him.  During Committee Stage on 3 March 1994 I said to the Minister that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the idea of graduation.  I listened to the Minister's response in terms of the legal challenges which might arise about the level being 101 milligrammes as compared to 100 milligrammes.  The law has set minimum limits which are established at, for example, 80 milligrammes per millilitre <Col N="267" /> of blood.  If we have a minimum limit, why can we not have graduated limits?  What is the difference between a minimum limit and graduated limits when one is establishing what the level of alcohol is through scientific procedures?</P>
    <P>The Minister in his reply said:</P>
    <P>I am advised in the strongest way possible by the Attorney General that if we were to have graduated penalties ... the question of mounting a legal challenge would certainly be on the cards in circumstances where there was a very considerable difference in the penalty range between offenders and where the difference in alcohol levels was just one milligram.</P>
    <P>I get worried about lawyers and the advice given by them to Government and Ministers.  In my experience in this House the greatest refuge for a Minister at any time is to cite the advice given to him by the Attorney General or by some eminent legal person.  From my experience of lawyers, one not only gets an opinion for and against but a range of opinions in between, all of which are argued with tremendous cogency and are regarded as valid.</P>
    <P>The Minster dealt with this point and he made the observation about the Director of Public Prosecutions and said that this had changed the situation.  He said:</P>
    <P>I have been advised that, on the coming into operation of the 1994 Act, the Director of Public Prosecutions had reviewed the need for that tolerance and that he decided on the basis of assurances given to him about the accuracy of analysis [something we debated at length here] to discontinue the tolerance and to prosecute borderline cases.  The Attorney General has advised me that this decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions removed a major obstacle to the introduction of a graded system of penalties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="268" /> On 3 March 1994, the former Minister, Deputy Smith, spoke about the tremendous obstacles involved, while Minister Howlin told us today about the removal of all these obstacles.  What a wonderful world it is.  It demonstrates that if one has the political will to frame the law in the way one desires, one can actually find a way of doing so that will accommodate reservations expressed, although we are as always constrained by the Constitution and what it says as regards things that are overriding on the legislation before us.</P>
    <P>Over one year ago the point about graded penalties was made vigorously by Members of this House.  We were told that it was not possible and that amendments would not be accepted. When the law was introduced there was public outcry, which was understandable. As a result of that outcry and representations made by the vintners and other parties, the law is being amended.  It is being amended to the degree it should have been.</P>
    <P>During the past few weeks I, like other Members of the House, received literature from various interest groups, including vintners from Galway and the drinks industry group.  The question of raising the level from 80 back to 100 milligrammes per millilitre of blood arose at the meetings.  I believe the level should be left at 80 milligrammes.  This legislation is reasonable and has responded to representations made. Graded penalties should be introduced to deal with those whose blood level is between 80 and 100 milligrammes and above.</P>
    <P>I take the point made by the drinks industry group, which I believe is in the Minister's speech, about the majority who are tested for blood alcohol having alcohol counts in excess of 150 milligrammes. I believe that when one reaches that level penalties should be severe.  It is not right to remove penalties at the lower end.  The only argument is about the degree of the penalty.  The degree of the penalty is dealt with effectively in this legislation and from that point of view it has my support.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="269" /> My experience of the vintners &mdash; I am sure it is that of other Members also &mdash; is that they are a well organised lobby group.  I do not say that as a criticism, but as a compliment.  When they met public representatives at the time this matter was very controversial, they did so in a responsible way.  To my mind, they put their case coherently and explained the implications for their business and for employment in a reasonable and constructive way.  I, and I am sure other Members, have no difficulty with lobby groups coming to see us because that is our job as public representatives. I said to the vintners at the time that I would not be in favour of changing the limit upwards &mdash; if anything, the trend internationally and in Europe is downwards.  However, it could get to a point where one might wonder if there is enough background alcohol in one's blood to cause a problem without even taking a drink.</P>
    <P>I understand from the legislation as passed that it is open to the Minister to change the blood alcohol level.  The Minister must come to both Houses of the Oireachtas to have that passed, but it is not a matter for new legislation.  I am open to correction on that.  I am sure the Minister's advisers will tell him the answer, so we may hear it at the end of Second Stage.  As I recall, the Minister is allowed to alter the limits because there was a dispute about whether he should be given that power.  The Minister argued that he should not have to come back to House repeatedly with changes in legislation.  I do not see anything wrong with that, because the function of the Houses of the Oireachtas is to pass legislation even if it means coming back to change legislation.  At the time I would have argued that that was the correct thing to do.  I understand the Minister is allowed alter the limits subject to confirmation by both Houses.  In those circumstances it is almost routine that confirmation is given, because it is not a question of legislation.</P>
    <P>We must be conscious of the victims of drink driving and the ultimate sanction that somebody loses their life in a <Col N="270" /> car accident caused by the consumption of alcohol.  The question of whether one is fit to drive at 80, 100 or 120 miles an hour is irrelevant in terms of the law. The law must set a level and I believe this level is correct.  We must be conscious of the effect alcohol has on someone who drives a car, and I say that as someone who consumes alcohol.</P>
    <P>Debates have taken place on the quality of rural life <i>versus</i> city life and it has been suggested that there should be a different standard for the country compared to the city.  I live on a farm. Last Saturday evening I went to my local sporting club where I had two pints.  I then drove home on my tractor, not in my car.  If someone hit my tractor the consequences would be more serious for them than if they hit my car because it is weighty equipment.  We should not be deceived into thinking that because someone lives in the country there is less risk of an accident if alcohol has been consumed.  Accidents are as likely to happen in the country as in the city given the number of people driving cars.  I would be interested to see the statistics in this regard, if they are available.  Accidents in the country are no different to those in the city and in some cases they may be more severe because people drive more quickly in the country than in the city.</P>
    <P>I have no sympathy for the urban-rural debate other than to accept that the pub is central to the social life of the rural community and that in many areas there is no other social outlet.  In the west the pub is the only place people living alone or who are getting old or who do not have another mode of transport, can go.</P>
    <P>When this matter was debated at functions around Christmas someone told me they had no sympathy for the publicans.  I asked why as they should have been aware that it is difficult to make a living in the country pub.  They realised that but they wanted to know if the country publican drove these people, about whom they were concerned, home.  Perhaps they do.  If their level of concern for their clients was <Col N="271" /> matched by their actions, they might have received a more sympathetic hearing. This person did not get worked up about anything.  He took a drink, but he wondered about the level of commitment of some country publicans to the local community.  I am not saying they do not contribute significantly to their local communities, support fixtures, etc., but would they provide a service to drive these people home?</P>

      <P>Senator Farrell mentioned the speed limit on dual carriageways.  I drive home on the Naas dual carriageway and it is impossible to drive at the 70 mile speed limit because of the people who travel at 45 miles an hour in the fast lane.  They are a menace on the road.  People are now passing on the inside because the slowcoaches are in the middle of the road.  I would love to see the Garda Síochána dealing with such driving which I am sure is careless under the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My farm is bounded by the motorway which bypasses Newbridge.  It is an education to be in the field beside the motorway and to watch people's behaviour. Large signs on each end of the motorway tell people that mopeds, tractors, invalid carriages and learner drivers are not allowed.  However, people picnic on the motorway adjacent to my farm beside the River Liffey.  Kildare County Council is introducing a contraflow system and it has erected bollards around which people do U-turns, I saw <Col N="272" /> a tractor and sprayer, tractors with cattle trailers and bicycles on it.  It is fascinating to watch what happens on the motorway.  I am sure regulations can be enforced in this regard.  Perhaps alcohol is not the only culprit in terms of causing difficulties on the roads.</P>
    <P>I welcome the thrust of this legislation which deals with the reservations and difficulties with the original Act.  I will not oppose this Bill.  I commend the Minister on his efforts, particularly his reasonable approach to driving tests.  He dealt with the extreme cases where death or serious injury is caused and the case is tried on indictment or where death or injury is caused by a hit and run.  In those cases it is legitimate to throw the book at these people and make them take a test.  He has struck the right balance in this regard.  I am in favour of leniency for a first offence, provided it is at the bottom of the scale. However, second and subsequent offences must be severely dealt with and the Minister has my support in this regard.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, at Christmas and during the period when people were most sensitive about this matter, sensible people who always had a social drink stopped drinking or, if they took a drink, found, as Senator McDonagh did, someone to drive them home.  However, people who drank large quantities of alcohol did not change their behaviour. They still drank the same amount and then drove home.  These people must be severely dealt with if they are caught.</P>
    <P>The Minister has found the right balance, therefore I support this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I welcome, with some reservations, the measures he proposes in this legislation.  I spoke strongly on the original Bill when it was going through the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If someone in France, Italy or Spain decided to stop drinking wine, spirits or beer and introduced legislation in their Parliaments, it would be argued that we should follow suit.  It is no argument that eight European countries have lower <Col N="273" /> levels than we have.  If other countries want to introduce such legislation, that is their business.  We must introduce our own measures.  The Irish are known throughout the world for being able to hold their drink and for drinking too much.  However, that is wrong.</P>
    <P>I have been involved in the drink trade for most of my life.  I thought that the people in the business were always very sensible and cared for their customers. I ran pubs in New York City for a number of years and here also.  If I felt that one of my customers was over the limit I always ensured that they were taken home safely by a friend or neighbour, or I took them home myself.</P>
    <P>My father was a garda and I remember they used to take drivers out of their cars and make them walk a white line. If they were able to walk along the white line it was felt that they were capable of driving but if they could not walk the line they were brought to court for being intoxicated.  Now, however, you can have two pints and be able to walk as straight as a rule along ten white lines, yet in certain cases you would be over the limit.  It is very serious in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis said there was no difference between rural and urban Ireland but there is a vast difference.  In Dublin, you can get home after work by taxi, train or bus but in my part of the country you get one shot at catching the train or bus and that is it because there is only one train or bus in and out per day.  In fact, there is no bus service from where I live, in Tarbert, to Ballybunion, and you would be lucky to get one or two buses a week from Ballybunion to Dingle.  The situation is ludicrous.  If you expect a rural family, celebrating their child's Holy Communion or whatever, to hire a minibus for the day, it is just not on.</P>
    <P>Highways and speedways were mentioned earlier.  I would love to have them in my part of the country but the reality is that I have often driven behind a tractor for a half an hour before being able to pass the vehicle.  You have to compare like with like.  I compliment <Col N="274" /> the Minister on scaling the original fines downwards but he will have to go a small step further.</P>
    <P>Others can speak for urban areas but I will speak about rural life.  Take the example of a young man who goes out and drinks two and a half pints.  He is not too heavy and since he has not eaten he is slightly over the limit.  He might be on top of the world after getting a new job as a courier, and be dating a girl whom he is planning to marry.  But that man's life can be destroyed, even though he is only barely over the limit, if his licence is endorsed and he is put off the road for three months.  His employer will tell him: &ldquo;Sorry, you are out of work&rdquo;.  There should be a first offence system to cope with such cases where a fine is imposed.</P>
    <P>I am talking about a person with a blood alcohol level between the 80 and 100 milligramme limit, and I have no regard for a person who is at the 150 or 200 milligramme level.  I have said publicly in this House that anyone who wants to drive with that amount of drink should have their car keys taken for good and should never be given a second chance by the courts.</P>
    <P>However, there must be second chances for people in the lower limits between 80 and 100 milligrammes and from 100 to 150 milligrammes.  For a first offender there should be a severe fine which is a penalty that would neither interfere with their insurance nor put them off the road.  If a young person receives a three month driving ban for a first offence, the insurance company will drive their premium through the roof.  I know of young people under 27 years of age who cannot get insurance for less than £1,400 a year, even with clean licences.  That is wrong because it makes it far more difficult for people to live and to survive.</P>
    <P>The insurance companies will have to be taken to task because some of them are going for the lucrative centre market, providing cover for people aged from 27 to 55.  They have no interest in people under 27 because they think they are not able to drive, nor those over 55 <Col N="275" /> who are considered too old or even senile. That is all wrong because if a young person can pass a driving test they should be given the same rights as someone over 27 years of age.</P>
    <P>The number of drink-related accidents was mentioned but I would like to compare that with the number of accidents caused by people stealing cars who are involved in high speed chases and other criminal acts where alcohol is not involved at all.  In the case of a road accident the first thing people say is that drink was involved, but that is totally unfair.</P>
    <P>The entire social structure of our society is being taken away.  We are driving young people to drugs; they are turning away from alcohol and taking drugs to get their kicks.  If a young person is taken to a Garda station following a road accident they cannot be bagged for having taken too much marijuana, cocaine or Ecstasy, yet the use of these drugs is rampant.  Ireland seems to be the gateway to western Europe for all kinds of drugs.</P>
    <P>It is unfair to link drinking to every accident; if we do so, we might just as well close down all licensed premises. The social life of the pub is the one bit of relaxation after a hard week's work when one can play cards, darts or pool as well as listen to music and have a few drinks.  The pub business is under pressure and is in serious trouble.  Many rural pubs now only open for an hour or two per day &mdash; between 9 and 11 o'clock at night.  Some people are afraid to go into a pub while others are afraid to be seen coming out of it because the phone may be picked up to inform that &ldquo;Johnny was drinking&rdquo;.  It is unfair.</P>
    <P>Credit is due to the Garda in urban areas.  They are busy people who are more interested in investigating stolen cars, break-ins and other crimes.  That level of crime does not exist in rural areas because of the Community Alert schemes.  Life is that bit easier but it can be more difficult as well when it comes to somebody having three pints.  A man who lives five miles from me, in <Col N="276" /> Ballylongford, used to drink three pints every Sunday night in the local pub.  He has two small farms, one of which is two miles out of town and the other 25 miles away near Limerick city.  When the new law was introduced that man gave up the one pleasure he had, which was to have three pints on a Sunday night, because he was afraid that if he was caught on the way home to Ballylongford having had three pints he would not be able to run his small farm outside Limerick.  That man is a social drinker. I know him well.  No matter who drank with him, whether it was the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste or Pope John Paul, he would not take a fourth drink.  Many people are social drinkers like this.</P>
    <P>I am sure that vintners, when compiling their figures at the end of the year, will prove that the level of alcohol consumed has dropped.  In Listowel there are five pubs for sale, as are many other pubs in rural Ireland.  They cannot survive. They are hit by one law after another.  The Irish Music Rights Organisation charges them for playing radios. It is more difficult for them if they decide to put in juke boxes or have a guitar player on a Saturday night.</P>
    <P>I admire what the Minister did and the pressure exerted by groups.  I know people have had bereavements and have lost loved ones.  I would like to know whether these deaths were due to the levels of alcohol in their systems or because they were high on other drugs.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about moderate drinkers who may have two drinks or have an extra one at social functions and would be slightly over the limit.  They would be penalised by being disqualified from driving for three months. They should be given a fine and a second chance at their livelihoods.  Once one is bitten and gets a bad fright, one will not repeat the offence.  The relevant district judges should have discretion after hearing the facts of a case.  This point was made by the vintners.  This is reasonable.  Garda and other authorities dealing with cases in rural areas usually know the persons and circumstances involved and the damage that can be <Col N="277" /> done to a young person.  I fear that people may be picked on the morning after the night before and get into trouble, which may affect their jobs. This must be looked at, because jobs are difficult to come by.</P>
    <P>A speaker said that 30 miles an hour speed limits should be introduced.  If there are three houses in a place there is a 30 miles an hour speed limit.  A garda may pull in a person who is barely over the limit.  In small rural areas, with perhaps a half a dozen house, the maximum speed limit should be 40 miles an hour.  I have said this at meetings of Kerry County Council when speed limits were recently reviewed.  Speeding is a major factor in many accidents and I would hate anybody to blame alcohol for all such problems.</P>
    <P>Many of those who cause serious accidents should be tried for the amount of drug substances in their systems.  At a public seminar in Dublin 20 years ago I spoke about the abuse of drugs I saw in another country.  I felt the problem was slipping into this country, and how right I was.  Pupils in our primary schools are being interfered with and threatened. Fly by nights and smart alecks are giving youngsters ecstasy pills so they can become hooked on drugs.  I have a family of four.  I would prefer to see one of my children going into a public house to have a few drinks with their friends and living a normal social life rather than these people giving them pills and ruining their lives.</P>
    <P>I appreciate what the Government and the Minister have done already but I implore them to go one small step further.  There would be nothing to be ashamed of in doing this and they would have the support of most of the nation. Everybody knows that the difference between 80 and 100 milligrammes, which would amount to about half a pint of beer or stout, will not make a difference.  The Minister referred to the fact that somebody with a zero level of alcohol in his system can drive more effectively and efficiently than somebody who has drunk one or two pints. On a television documentary some time <Col N="278" /> ago I saw four expert drivers doing a test which involved driving between cones after drinking three pints.  They hit the cones.  They are expert drivers who examine cars.  There is something very seriously wrong with them and their licences should be looked at, because in my experience two or two and a half pints never seriously affected a person's ability to drive.  If somebody is not capable of driving after a few pints, they will not drive.  People know the responsibilities they face.  The Minister should leave the limit at 80 milligrammes but should remove the three months automatic disqualification from driving.  Everybody would appreciate and admire him if he did this.  People should be fined and given a second chance and their insurance should not be affected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State and the Minster on having the courage to introduce this amending legislation.  It took a considerable amount of courage to do so.  I believe a great deal of time was spent weighing up the correctness of what they are proposing to do.</P>
      <P>A very strong lobby is against drunken driving.  An example is the Mothers Against Drunken Driving group.  One must respect their views and attitudes to drink.  They have suffered at the hands of people who when driving motor vehicles have caused the deaths or serious injuries of beloved members of their families.  Most people have tremendous sympathy for their approach and attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important when bringing in legislation to weigh up all aspects of what is proposed.  I think the approach in this Bill has been correct.  There has been a major change in attitude towards drink in Ireland.  The change extends back over a number of years.  People have changed their attitude to fitness, health and recreation and are reducing their consumption of alcohol.  The attitude of people to driving has also changed. Young people in particular are very <Col N="279" /> careful.  Most young people I know will not drive a vehicle with any drink taken.</P>
    <P>However, some people take a drink for social reasons and they are the people who were hammered by the previous legislation.  I discussed this matter at length when we last debated this issue.  I am referring to those people who have one, two or, perhaps, three drinks at night.  They went to their local licensed premises to have a drink and enjoy the company, perhaps to play a game of cards or discuss the day's events, both local and national.  The previous Bill was too heavy handed.  It went too far and if it had continued in force would have seriously damaged life in both rural and urban areas.</P>
    <P>Most speakers have talked about only rural life being damaged.  The city of Dublin was also affected.  It is all very well to advertise on television that people should take the DART or a taxi. In most areas of Dublin inhabited by ordinary working people and people on low or middle incomes there is a poor DART service.  In fact, the service is non-existent in many areas in Dublin.  It is beyond my comprehension how one can tell somebody to take a taxi home who is on a retirement pension or the dole, on disability benefit or on an income as low as £68 per week, and who goes for a few pints to his local, which might be a couple of miles away.  That legislation was framed for people living on Ailesbury Road and people who are well off.  However, what about people in Dublin on middle and low incomes? Many of these people are afraid to walk in Dublin after 10.30 p.m. at night.  They are afraid of being mugged or robbed. They are ordinary, respectable, decent people whose only outlet from sitting in at home and watching television is to go to the pub, meet a few people and socialise.  That was being destroyed by that legislation.  Many of these people live humble lives.  However, their lives are equally important to them.  That legislation was affecting their lives.</P>
    <P>The legislation, however, was hammering rural Ireland.  I am referring to <Col N="280" /> villages and small towns.  Without any assistance from the Government through legislation of this nature, the lifeblood is being squeezed out of rural Ireland with the closure of small shops and businesses.  They are experiencing enough difficulty.  However, this legislation was framed in such a way that in the long term, if not in the interim, it would have closed many pubs across the country.  In seven to ten years' time companies such as Guinness and other suppliers will cease deliveries to small country pubs because of lack of business. Many of the tourists who visit here like to go to country pubs and see what life is like in rural Ireland.  Although many country pubs are attractive to tourists, there are also many pubs which do not have a passing trade and whose sole business is dependent on the people living in the pub's hinterland.  Most of those people, since the introduction of this legislation, are not moving out of their homes at night.</P>
    <P>What is taking place today is welcome. I would like the Minister to have the courage of his convictions and go one step further.  The courts have served Ireland well.  The Judiciary has shown at least as much courage as the Legislature &mdash; and, on occasions, more &mdash; in the decisions it has made which affect the social and economic life of this country. It made those decisions on occasions when this House failed to take the necessary steps and to enact the necessary legislation.  Far too many laws are being introduced which make our courts rubber stamps.  All the legislation dealing with taxation and excise duties have made the courts a formality or a rubber stamp.  It is the same as charging a person with offences and putting the charge sheet into a computer.  That is wrong.</P>
    <P>It would be unwise of this House to continue to pass legislation which provides for mandatory sentences.  We have a good system of government at present. There has been a change of Government and that is desirable.  However, continuing to pass mandatory legislation over a period of time would have adverse consequences if an extreme <Col N="281" /> Government came into power.  That can happen and at that stage we would see the effect of mandatory legislation.</P>
    <P>The argument put forward in favour of mandatory sentences is that they are a deterrent.  Certainly, they are helpful in their value as a deterrent.  I do not expect the Minister to make a huge change in the Bill before us.  However, I will make one suggestion.  In cases where there are between 80 and 135 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood, the Minister should at least allow the courts the discretion of deciding whether to impose a disqualification from driving.  It is not a revolutionary change but it will at least show that this House trusts our courts to do what is right in individual cases.</P>
    <P>I am not seeking a change in the penalties. There is a three month disqualification and a six month disqualification for up to 100 milligrams of alcohol. There are one year and two year periods of disqualification for having up to 135 and 150 milligrams of alcohol.  The Minister should consider making the change I have suggested for levels of alcohol up to 135 milligrams.  It would be an important and welcome change.  If that change were made, the judge, after listening to all the facts outlined by the garda, can make a decision in a case where the person has consumed this amount of alcohol and where there is no evidence of dangerous driving.  I ask the Minister to give strong consideration to this option.  This legislation will be all the better for such a change.  We should have faith in and trust our courts.  That is the main point I wish to make on Second Stage and I ask the Minister to pay particular attention to it.</P>
    <P>The Minister's approach to the driving test is welcome.  When people pass their driving tests at 20, 25 or 30 years of age they are active and have no problems with the test.  However, it is much more difficult for a person of 55 years of age who must retake a driving test to pass, and it becomes increasingly difficult with every passing year because reflexes are not as fast and the ability to do things is not the same as it was when <Col N="282" /> the individual was ten, 15 or 20 years younger.  The requirement to retake the driving test would have been harmful for many people and the Minister's proposal to amend the regulation is important and welcome.</P>
    <P>The level of insurance premium which a person must pay who has 85 or 90 milligrammes of alcohol is outrageous. It is a minor offence, yet the individual concerned will probably have to pay an annual insurance premium of £1,500 to £2,000 for five years.  This is unacceptable and the Minister should consider allowing the courts some discretion because a person who has one pint and a whiskey or two pints is not a criminal.  He is an ordinary person who goes out for an evening with his wife or attends a local hurling, rugby or soccer meeting, or a farmer's meeting or a trade union meeting.  Social life in Ireland is very important, especially with regard to tourism, where social contact is essential, but the legislation as drafted is damaging life as we know it.</P>
    <P>Ordinary, law abiding citizens are now compelled to carry driving licences because joyriders are stealing cars.  A person may have his driving licence stolen from his pocket in a pub tonight and, under the legislation, he will commit an offence if he drives home.  Similarly, a person who leaves his licence somewhere commits an offence if he drives without it.  Matters have gone too far in this instance and they require reexamination.</P>
    <P>There was a great deal of good in the 1993 Act which I supported, for example, with regard to the speed limits, traffic control and so on.  However, there were many undesirable aspects also.  The development of legislation in this area reflects the attitude of people towards care on the roads.  Like all in this House, I am very much against people driving having consumed a large amount of alcohol.  Since most people are in favour of a social drink allowing the courts an element of discretion would be welcomed.  I wish this legislation every success in both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the welcome which has been given to the Bill and wish to be associated with the tributes paid to the Minister for having moved expeditiously and in a positive way to respond to the concern, widespread public unease and resentment which had manifested itself with regard to certain provisions of the Road Traffic Act, 1993.</P>
      <P>The Act addressed a number of key areas of road traffic law where it was felt that changes were necessary and desirable.  The main objective of the Act was to improve road safety and to bring about a reduction in the numbers killed and injured in traffic accidents on our roads every year.  This was a laudable objective and, accordingly, there was general support for the main thrust of the 1993 legislation, both in the Oireachtas and outside, because of the very high level of death and injury on Irish roads.  We are all aware of the statistics.  Over 400 people are killed and more than 10,000 are injured in accidents on our roads every year.  It therefore goes without saying that any reasonable measures which might help to bring about a reduction in these numbers would have a very high level of support from politicians and the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem with the 1993 Act was that it was perceived to have put an undue and unbalanced emphasis on the degree to which alcohol, even in very small quantities, is a contributory factor in road deaths and injuries on the roads and while we could argue as to whether or not the Act put this undue emphasis, this was the perception.  I must emphasise that I am not discussing drunken driving and I would not like anybody to think that I am soft in any way on this issue.  Drunken driving, or driving with high blood alcohol levels is something which no responsible person could, or would seek to condone.  Ever since the offence of driving a vehicle with a blood alcohol level exceeding a legal limit was first introduced in 1968, the penalty has always included a mandatory disqualification and people accepted this.  The level introduced in 1968 was 125 milligrammes <Col N="284" /> per 100 millilitres of blood.  In 1978 the limit was reduced to 100 milligrammes which was the situation until the reduction set out in the 1993 Act.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt but that, since its introduction, the mandatory disqualification has been a very effective deterrent.  Not alone that, but it has changed significantly attitudes and the attitude of the vast majority of motorists to drink driving.  Throughout Ireland, and especially in rural Ireland there is now a very responsible attitude to drinking and driving.  This is obvious on many fronts, for example, whereas 10 years ago people travelling to a wedding would all go by car, nowadays coaches or mini buses are organised to transport people to and from such events.  The same applies to groups travelling to sporting events, and young people, especially, are adept at making transport arrangements for discos and such like which ensure that the drink driving factor is eliminated.</P>
    <P>There is no question or doubt but that over the past number of years, there has been a significant cultural change with regard to drinking and driving.  That is not to say that there is still not the occasional individual who will persist in driving even when he or she is unfit to do so because of the amount of alcohol consumed.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann condemns the Minister for Finance for his attitude towards public representatives in relation to their suitability for membership of State Boards and calls on the Government not to proceed with any action against members of such boards solely because of their political affiliations.</P>
      <P>In a sense, history has caught up with this motion in that the Minister has, as we all know, somewhat ignominiously backed off the extraordinary decision which he made two weeks ago to approach certain members of the board of ACC to try to browbeat them into withdrawing their membership from the board of ACC simply on the basis that they were public representatives, councillors democratically elected by the people in this State.</P>
      <P>The actions of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, in attempting to force two county councillors to surrender their position on the board of ACC simply because they were councillors is totally reprehensible.  It is anti-democratic. It marks a new high point in pork barrel politics in which the Minister and his colleagues in this Government have wallowed.  The Government parties here tonight will be trying to persuade the House that the Minister had some reform in mind.  The Minister himself last week showed a breathtaking disregard for the intelligence of the Irish people when he tried to put forward the view that he was not actually asking anybody to resign.  They had simply misheard him; there was something wrong with the acoustics in the room.  That particular piece of deliberate deception has no more credibility than the amendment which is put before us tonight.</P>
      <P>I feel a certain sympathy with my colleagues on the Government side in this matter, because they are having to draw the fat from the fire in this matter.  The Senators on the Government side share with me a very wide held respect for councillors of all parties and none throughout this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely, I am glad that the Senator includes Councillor Lawlor. I am sure he will be appreciative of that. The reality of it is, however, that Senators on the Government side are stuck with this particular issue.  They are stuck with a Minister who went on a solo run and who made an ass of himself in this regard.</P>
      <P>It is worth examining briefly the role we ascribe to the boards of State-sponsored bodies before analysing who is and who is not suitable to sit on them. Nine specific roles have traditionally been performed by the boards of State-sponsored bodies.  First, they are charged with the general task of implementing the Government policy of the day with regard to the State body in question.  Secondly, they are charged with the task of appointment of top management.  They are charged thirdly with the task of exercising overall financial control, with the responsibility of stimulating development and maximising effectiveness.  They are required to supervise the overall staffing practices and personnel policies of the company, to measure and encourage management performance and to liaise with the Minister and the parent Department.  They are required to protect the interests of the shareholder and, finally, they are traditionally required to ensure that the company observes the law.</P>
      <P>In more recent times a tenth objective has been added to that list.  That is to ensure that the company, particularly a monopoly company, does not operate in a way which is inimical to the customer, to the company's employees and staff, or to the public interest.  None of these roles is in any way in conflict with the holding of public elected office, particularly not at local level.  In the matter of representing consumers' interests, as Members on all sides of this House know, a competent local councillor would seem in a company such as ACC to be ideally suited to the task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="287" /> Certainly, when the Agricultural Credit Corporation operated policies a few short years ago which were damaging to the interests of borrowers, among the very first to highlight those deficiencies were local elected representatives, who daily in the course of their constituency work witnessed at first hand the problems caused over the years by an excessively liberal extension of credit by that State company.  For my own part, I gained more insight into the nature of the relationship between client or consumer of ACC's products and the company from the reality of constituency work than I did over a very considerable period reading through the academic literature, which is abundant, on the power and status of State enterprises.</P>
    <P>It is also worth examining the quite extensive literature which has grown up over the years on the composition of the boards of State-sponsored bodies.  This is far from a new topic.  As far back as 1972 the Institute of Public Administration sponsored a major conference on the role of boards.  Inevitably, at that conference the issue of board composition came up.  The topic was addressed by the then Secretary of the Department of Finance.  Mr. Murray, noting the problem in getting suitable people to take the large number of places on State boards, addressed the question of who should and who should not be appointed.  The only political exclusion &mdash; the only political reference, in fact &mdash; he made in his speech at that time was to refer to the general policy which had existed since the foundation of the State of excluding Oireachtas Members from the boards of State-sponsored bodies. He was silent on the issue of councillors. Indeed, the law establishing State sponsored bodies over the last 70 years has been silent on the issue of councillors.</P>
    <P>Councillors have served over the years in a variety of capacities on a variety of boards and under a variety of political administrations in this country without any particular problem.  The silence in the law and in the academic literature on this is interesting and one <Col N="288" /> would imagine that any change to the long established custom and practice would be accompanied by some well argued and publicly presented case.  The absence of any well argued case, or indeed any case at all, is one of the hallmarks of this rather sordid and sorry story.  The Minister, Deputy Quinn, a man who has developed a certain panache in recent years for head hunting, sought to do his dirty work behind closed doors.  That was because no real principle is involved here, only expediency.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, the reality of this sordid issue is that councillors of all parties and political people of all parties serve this country well and have served this country well on a variety of State boards, management committees and commissions.  It is reprehensible and indefensible of the Minister for Finance to start enunciating, without giving his basis and principles for doing so, some form of policy which would regard local councillors as somehow unworthy to serve on State boards simply because they are local councillors.</P>
    <P>The amendment to the motion is as vacuous as the Minister's arguments in this case.  Members on that side of the House should show some sign of honesty on this matter and that they share our sense of condemnation of the Minister's action.  As all Senators on that side are aware, local representatives, who have been democratically endorsed by the public, are eminently suitable for positions on State boards.  They should not be excluded from the boards simply on the basis that they have chosen to serve the public through elected office. The Minister and those around him should rethink this policy and reject it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  It is a grossly unfair to imply that councillors are incapable of representing people on State boards.  Many Ministers and Ministers of State are insulting themselves if they believe that councillors are incapable, given that many of them came up through councils.  I am convinced that councillors are capable and <Col N="289" /> that the best Ministers are those who come up through the council system.</P>
      <P>The impression has been given in recent years that councillors should not be recognised in any area.  There is a big swing in favour of voluntary groups, but county councillors represent all strata in society.  They are elected and are therefore the only group which should be on boards.  Elections are held every five years, during which councillors must answer to their electorate.  If they are not doing their jobs, they will not be reelected. To whom do the people who are selected answer?</P>
      <P>There are many good voluntary organisations, but money is either missing, lost or unaccounted for in others. However, if all that money came through local authorities, I assure the House that every penny would be accounted for and results would be visible. It is almost impossible for county councils to function at present because Governments do not appear anxious to give them money.  Other sectors receive funds, but not county councils.  This is grossly insulting to county councillors, who are elected and who voluntarily give a very good service.</P>
      <P>Many people from the voluntary sector who are appointed to boards receive very good wages and large expenses. They receive much more than county councillors.  Where will we end up if this attitude of portraying councillors as inadequate, incapable and unworthy of being on State boards continues? Democracy will go out the window and those whom we expect to keep the country afloat will suffer seriously.</P>
      <P>One has only to consider the example of the county enterprise partnership boards and the area partnership boards to which no county councillors have been appointed.  Why is this the case?  It is time all county councillors got their agendas in order and started asking such questions. It is grossly unfair to accuse councillors of being incapable.  They are most capable and worthy of those positions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should not ask county councillors to resign from boards.  On <Col N="290" /> this occasion, thankfully, he saw reason before it was too late.  However, it will still have repercussions for him because councillors from all parties are annoyed that anyone would imply that they are incapable.  The Minister should give more power to county councillors.  It is time their work was recognised and county councils were given more authority.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I guarantee that all moneys which come to county councils are accounted for.  Given the work of county councils in terms of roads, sewerage and housing and the poor financing they receive, what would happen if this work was handed over to voluntary outfits?  I am sure they would not do as good a job.  I appeal to the Minister and the Government to reconsider this policy.  The Minister of State was a councillor before he was appointed to his portfolio and I am sure he is aware of the quality of county councillors.  He knows their capabilities and I appeal to him to use his influence in Government to bring to heel the behind the scenes promoters of this anti-county councillor feeling.  I ask him to ensure that councillors' rights and capabilities are respected.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;notes that the Minister for Finance considers that the case for having members of local authorities being members of State banks should be reviewed, and that it is Government policy, consistent with the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, that the primary considerations which should apply in the appointment of members of State boards are the experience and expertise of the individuals concerned.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many crocodile tears are being shed in the House this evening regarding the appointment of councillors to various <Col N="291" /> boards.  In the last Government, the Fianna Fáil Minister for the Environment showed little regard for any Fine Gael public representatives when appointing councillors to regional committees. Only one from a total of nine who were appointed was a Fine Gael councillor.  Given that Fine Gael is the second largest political party in the country, it should have received proportional representation on those committees. The former Minister for the Environment was not complimentary to Fine Gael public representatives during the last Government.</P>
    <P>The amendment requests the Minister for Finance to examine the appointments to various State boards and the experience and expertise of the individuals concerned.  It is a worthy amendment and this area should be examined. Appointments to State boards is a serious matter and it should not just be a case of jobs for the boys.  For example, a number of Fianna Fáil Ministers acted disgracefully in appointing people to State boards in the period before the formation of the new Government. They appointed people to boards at random.</P>

      <P>If they have a vested interest, they should have to declare it in the same way that Members of the Oireachtas must declare their interests. We do not see many appointees to State boards declaring their vested interests. If they did, I am sure there would be many inquiries into a large number of <Col N="292" /> people who have been appointed to State boards over the years.</P>
      <P>The amendment is worthy of discussion. We, on this side of the House, are calling on the Minister for Finance to look at it and to use his offices to come up with criteria which are acceptable to everybody in relation to appointments to State boards.  That is all I have to say in relation to this.</P>

      <P>The motion and the amendment are very important because membership of State boards is often taken lightly by appointees.  It would be very hard if, in selecting board members, Ministers only considered the political affiliation of the proposed members.  I have had the privilege of being appointed to two State boards &mdash; once by a Fianna Fáil Minister and once by a Fine Gael Minister.  I do not know whether they thought I was independent or malleable and could be easily got to do whatever was wanted.</P>
      <P>The public does not realise the importance of the composition of boards until there is a problem.  A large number of those who accept positions on boards do so for altruistic reasons because generally there is no payment and people located in the Dublin region do not even get expenses.  It can be quite an expensive activity.</P>
      <P>One factor which has not come up yet, and which I think is even more important than the fact that two county councillors of one political allegiance were appointed just before the last Government fell, is the fact that there was such a delay in making any appointment at all&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Forgive me, I apologise.  I thought there had been a delay.  This can cause a great deal of trouble.  For example, with regard to the Blood Transfusion Service Board there was criticism by the expert working group that there had been long delays in appointing various members of the board.  This had led to a situation where there was often trouble getting a quorum.</P>
      <P>Rather than torturing ourselves about people's political affiliations and so forth, it would be much better if we concerned ourselves with the fact that it is most important that those appointed to boards should, if possible, have an expertise and interest in the board.  For example, I have seen some members of medical boards, which are the ones to which I have been appointed most, not being given sufficient information by the bodies involved to be able to do their work on the board efficiently. Members' interest and expertise are much more important than their political affiliation, and boards should not be left in the position of the Blood Transfusion Service Board which was weakened because appointments were not made.</P>

      <P>This is probably the only Private Members' motion in the history of the House to arise from a private conversation.  This conversation, as I understand it, took place between the Minister for Finance and the Fianna Fáil appointed chairman of ACC Bank.  This motion was triggered by a private and, presumably, confidential conversation. Senator Farrell spoke about the action of the Government, but could I remind him that the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat arrangement only allowed the chairpersons of councils to be members of the enterprise boards?

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister pointed out, in a private conversation, to the chairman of ACC Bank that he felt there was a possible conflict of interest between their membership of the board and the sort of work in which the bank is engaged.  He went further and said that perhaps they should be asked to consider their positions. It was a private conversation.  If one has a concern and wants to arrive at an amicable solution, if that is possible, then one does it privately, which is what he did.  As I understand it, it was the two members of the board who decided to go public.  The Minister made his position very clear when he voiced <Col N="295" /> his concern to the chairman and asked him to convey his view to the two members but he said he had no intention of trying to remove them.</P>

      <P>There are boards on which local elected representatives are not allowed to be members &mdash; An Bord Pleanála and others &mdash; for very good reasons.  It is the same concern which the Minister expressed about the banks &mdash; there is a danger of a conflict of interests or people being put under pressure.  I suggest that it was nothing more than that, a storm in a tea cup.  The suggestion was that a witch hunt of Fianna Fáil council members had been orchestrated by the Labour Party.  The last Government was not that bad&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There was a good relationship between the two parties and to make that type of suggestion is gilding the lily somewhat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The coincidence of the removal of the chairman of CIÉ by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, and the actions <Col N="296" /> of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, happening side by side obviously gave colleagues cause for concern. However, let me reassure them that nothing is further from the Minister's mind than to start a witch hunt of his colleagues in Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>As I said, this is the only time I can remember when this House was subjected to a Private Members' motion on the basis of a private conversation. There is not a great deal one can say about it; it is a storm in a tea cup, an over-reaction.  When this debate is finished we will all gather up our traps and have a little sense.  The Minister, Deputy Quinn, was entitled to make the observation in private.  If he feels strongly enough that there is a conflict of interests he has the power to remove them.  He has already said that he does not intend to do that, so he must have some justification for believing they will act in a proper manner, as indeed they have done.</P>
    <P>This is a storm in a teacup.  On reflection, the Fianna Fáil Members would prefer it not to be on the Order Paper but we forgive them their trespasses on this occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with much of what Senator Magner has said.  I concur with his observations on the Minister for Finance.  I was one of a number of Senators who lobbied strongly when the original proposals published by a Fianna Fáil Government paid only lip service to the membership of local authorities on county enterprise boards.  When Deputy Quinn became Minister for Enterprise and Employment the level of representation for county councils was increased. There was a lobby within my party which was difficult and not always responsive.  As a result of the lobby those in my party who might have been reluctant to see the light eventually did so with the help of their Labour Party colleagues at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="297" /> I agree with Senator Magner that there is no question of the Minister, Deputy Quinn, being against councillors. I am concerned about an increasing drift towards the marginalisation of councillors as elected officials.  It is like an unstoppable Juggernaut that started following the abolition of rates, effectively removing the revenue raising capacity of local authorities.  From that time until recently, successive Administrations had tended increasingly to isolate local authorities and their members by not devolving sufficient power to them or funding them effectively so that they could carry out their duties.  Therefore, councillors are increasingly being seen as irrelevant.</P>
    <P>As a result of changes in attitude over the last few years whereby councillors are now acceptable persons for inclusion on State boards, is it surprising when two are approached, albeit in an informal way, and asked to consider their positions as if they were potentially guilty of something that there should be a row?  I agree with Senator Magner that as it is now history and amends have been made to some degree, it is a storm in a teacup. However, knowing how the political system works and accepting that this was perhaps a personal observation on the part of the Minister, I must set that admission of culpability against the last 20 years of successive administrations which have paid little more than lip service to the status and role of county councillors.  For that reason this motion is timely, not necessarily in its wording but in that it gives us an opportunity to ask about the future of local authorities and local councillors.</P>
    <P>Councillors are increasingly viewed as irrelevant due to a lack of proper financing of local authorities.  In recent years the European concept of providing funding and power to the voluntary sector at the expense of the elected sector has meant that instead of the voluntary sector developing in parallel and sympathy with the local authority system, battle lines have now been drawn.  In recent weeks attacks were made at conferences <Col N="298" /> in the Border counties by representatives of the voluntary sector on elected representatives, saying that they were largely irrelevant in the context of EU funding and that the Delors package should be given directly to the voluntary sector, not to locally elected representatives.</P>
    <P>The European &ldquo;bottom-up&rdquo; concept which influenced the Leader programme is fine in a European model where there is already a highly sophisticated and developed local and regional government.  That is absent in this country. Since the collapse of communism we have the most centralised Government in western Europe.  My county council must rely for practically every penny of its budget on central Government because of our small population and because we do not have the capacity within our administrative area to raise revenue to influence the issues we would like to influence.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry touched on the issue of the ability of people appointed to State boards.  For some time there has been an attitude that as a county councillor one is somehow not capable of functioning on a State board, that one somehow lacks the expertise.  What expertise have local authority members?  We will all agree that the overwhelming majority of locally elected representatives are decent, honourable and fully committed people who want to do their best for their community. Their agenda does not extend beyond that.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, a minority on all councils which we can identify as only being there for the ride and which does not seem to realise it has an important function to discharge.  In the main, that can be applied to all spheres of human activity.  There will be rotten apples in every barrel.  We should not focus on those negative elements.  The overwhelming majority of locally elected representatives are capable and have proven to be effective members of State and semi-State bodies, irrespective of party persuasion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="299" /> The vast majority of the approximately 2,300 appointments in the gift of any Government come from the non-elected sector.  Many of those have been pitchforked into State and semi-State boards because of their political connections. They are little more than party hacks who have had sufficient money to fund parties and have then been paid off.  One rarely sees them when the real issues are debated.  One will certainly not see them at election time when the rest of us have to put our records before the electorate &mdash; that is democracy.  A significant number of people have served on State and semi-State boards who have been appointed by all Governments and one would question their ability and whether they have furthered the interests of the board or their own interests.</P>
    <P>In that context the motion is timely. It is unfortunate that the two councillors &mdash; both of whom I have known for many years &mdash; should have been put in this difficult position.  It is embarrassing for the Minister for Finance, a senior member of the Labour Party and of the Government, that this informal, non-public approach should have come into the public arena.  It raises the issue of the serious drift that has been developing toward the continuing marginalisation of local authority members.</P>
    <P>By 1998 people who would have contemplated opposing me at local elections will no longer consider the option of going before the electorate for the next local elections because by then they will have had themselves installed on local area partnership boards, Leader boards or county enterprise boards, all of which have been granted substantial funding, have real power and influence in their communities and no public mandate other than accountability to the respective Departments which have funded them.</P>
    <P>This is not to castigate the individuals who in a voluntary capacity take part on those boards, but the Government must grasp that local authorities are going down the drain.  If they are not properly <Col N="300" /> resourced and given the status and role originally envisaged for them, I will not be surprised if we are in this House in the future criticising a Minister for wanting to remove local councillors from a State board and deprive them of power and influence.  That is fundamentally wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion is before us because the Minister for Finance holds the strong view that local authority members should not be on the boards of State banks.  He gives his reasons for this quite clearly.  As a Minister, he appointed local authority members to other boards, such as the enterprise boards.  He believes local authority members can serve at local level on certain bodies where there is a legitimate need for county council or public representation.</P>
      <P>I have been a member of the premier local authority for the last 16 years. Never in that time has any member also been a member of a State board, to my knowledge.  It would be incompatible with their duty as a local authority member to belong to the board of a State body, company or bank.  Having said that, a number of members have been members of different local groups. I am a member of the board of the East Link Toll Bridge and represent Dublin Corporation's views on that body.  I was previously a director of Dublin Tourism. There is a role for local authority members in bodies outside their local authority and the Minister wants to see local elected members play such a role. Senator Roche may laugh, but his party, along with the Progressive Democrats, decided there would be no public representation on county enterprise boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for Finance to the House.  I do not want to go into the specifics of the case in which he was involved; rather I will deal with the principles behind the motion, which I support.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to get people of quality to stand for election to local authorities. Everyone should be encouraged to stand for election if he or she so desires, because our democracy should be as participative and inclusive as possible. Things which tend to discourage people of quality should therefore be avoided. That is not to say that where conflicts of interest may potentially arise, precautions should not be taken to ensure they do not develop.  However, the precaution should be taken by law rather than any other way.  No one should be disqualified by virtue of political affiliation from sitting on a board or serving the State in whatever capacity the person may be called on to do.  The Minister will know from his experience that it is difficult to get certain people to serve on State boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we suggest by inference that members of local authorities are not good enough to be members of State boards, that devalues politics and politicians. <Col N="302" /> It confirms a feeling which may exist among the public that politicians are not to be trusted and cannot be regarded as suitable to serve on boards. That is regrettable.  We should say that what we do is important.  Politics is a proper profession and in a democracy it must be regarded as important.  There is nothing wrong with proclaiming that in the face of the derision of those who say politics is undesirable.  It is at the heart of our democracy and we should be thankful we have party politics and people who are prepared to enter politics and serve the State.</P>
    <P>People of merit should not be discouraged from participating in the political process, whether by standing for election or being supporters of political parties.  I see nothing wrong in known supporters of political parties serving on State boards; it is preferable than concealing their allegiance under a cloak of secrecy and trying to be all things to all men.  That is not to say there are not people of integrity who belong to no political party, and would not wish to, who would not be prepared to serve the country.  We accept there are and that they would be desirable people to serve on State boards.</P>
    <P>The question arises as to what is permissible and what the Minister might or might not do under law.  When I first became a Member of this House I had reason to examine the Unfair Dismissals Act and can recall that political allegiance was not grounds for dismissal. That is one dimension of this matter.  Without going into the specifics of the case, from what I know, which is not a great deal, the two people on the ACC board are people of quality who have served for a long time, have a knowledge of farming and farming finance and from that viewpoint could be regarded as suitable.  Having said that, in certain circumstances a conflict could arise.  Someone in farming might be in financial difficulty, someone who happens to be a neighbour or political associate of a board member, and asks the board member if he can be of assistance and a financial settlement is discussed <Col N="303" /> with bank executives.  It would be entirely inappropriate for a board member to interfere with that process.</P>
    <P>That conflict of interest might arise irrespective of whether the person had a political affiliation.  There is potential for that conflict of interest and in those circumstances the person should state their association with the client and not participate in any decisions which might be made at board level.  These matters should be dealt with by law.  It is right that Members of the Oireachtas should be disqualified from serving on boards, and if it is deemed correct that members of local authorities should not serve on a board, that should be defined in the Act which establishes it.  That is how we should deal with the matter.</P>
    <P>When this matter arose I was thinking about my colleagues on Kildare County Council and whether I would appoint any of them to State boards.  The answer was yes, there were people in all political parties and indeed on the Independent benches whom I would regard, by reason of their expertise and experience, as suitable for appointment to State boards.  They include auctioneers, trade unionists and the chairman of the regional authority, who has wide experience in European affairs.  They are people who would have much to contribute to public life and I have no objection in principle to them serving on boards.  If precautions are required, they can be instituted by law under the Acts establishing the boards.</P>
    <P>In this country everybody supports some political party.  We are a political society and I do not see anything wrong with that as it is what our democracy is about.  We need to say that quite frequently. It is regarded in some quarters as being highly undesirable that some people should have anything whatsoever to do with this particular business. The consequences of not having a participatory political democracy are, to my mind, very serious indeed.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to accept Senator Magner's point that perhaps the particular incident is a storm in a teacup.  It does <Col N="304" /> make for very good sport.  It makes good reading in the paper and is part of the craic of public life.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment put down by Senator Manning. This is quite a useful debate.  The system of appointments to State boards and so called &ldquo;looking after people&rdquo; is nothing new.  At the end of the day the system has served this country well.  As Senator Dardis said, there is no point in thinking we can find a bank of people who have never had any dealings with any political party or have no view on anything. If such people existed they would not be the type we would want to appoint to some of these boards anyway.</P>
      <P>Various Governments have appointed people to boards, most of which have been very well served by those appointed.  Great tribute should be paid to them and the work they have put in.  When one considers recent discussions about what executives in certain banks are getting, some of us should be considering our position in this House if we could be appointed to such jobs.  Down the years, good people have been appointed to boards and successive Governments have been prepared to reappoint them to ensure continuity.</P>
      <P>It has been traditional that Members of both Houses have not been appointed.  In some cases members of local authorities have been appointed.  I do not know the individuals who recently made the news.  They appear to have been decent people who did nothing but work in the interest of the board.  Obviously, one must have precautions for certain boards; but, by and large, the party in Government should ensure that the best people are brought forward.  Some or most of them will have some allegiance; some may even have different allegiances from time to time.  When some appointments come up, it is amazing to observe who comes out of the woodwork canvassing on behalf of certain people, because the other side may have appointed them originally.  That is part of the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that we look at this objectively.  There may be certain guidelines for particular boards as some are more sensitive than others.  People must <Col N="306" /> be careful and precautions must be taken where there could be undue influence or where people may have sensitive information.  This is a very useful debate.  In the Programme for Government we undertake to ensure we get the best people who are qualified to do the job, so that at the end of the day good old Mother Ireland will be the winner. It must be remembered that people are not exactly going to set up a retirement fund on the stipends for serving on these boards.  I fully support the amendment. It is a useful debate and I look forward to the Minister's reply.</P>

      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirleach, for the opportunity to speak and I welcome the Minister.  I am sure he did not particularly welcome this motion, but I am sure he welcomed the amendment.  The principle I would like to put forward is that semi-State boards should reflect and, even more important, should be seen to reflect the expertise that a board needs if it is going to do its job effectively.  I have no doubt that many elected representatives have the expertise that would be useful to various semi-State boards.  The problem is that if they are put on boards, they will be perceived, rightly or wrongly, as representing that particular political allegiance rather than their own technical expertise.  That certainly is not the image of semi-State boards we want to project.  Perception is vitally important in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think we can draw the line between TDs, MEPs and Senators on the one hand and other elected representatives on the other.  There does not appear to be any logic in drawing a dividing line between certain elected members and others.  There are only two places one can draw the line and base it on a particular principle.  The first is to adopt the principle that all elected representatives can serve on boards and the second is to adopt the principle that no elected representatives can serve on boards.  At the risk of making myself unpopular in this part of Kildare Street, I believe we should follow <Col N="307" /> the first principle and draw the line that excludes all elected representatives.</P>

      <P>We should make our legislation even tighter, which is the reason I support the amendment in this case.  Letting councillors on to State boards while excluding everybody else is an anomaly, but letting everybody in would soon create a situation where political parties would be looking for party balance on every board.  The boards would be seen as places for politicians rather than for people who have special expertise to offer to that board.  We, as elected representatives, should stay well away from this area.  It will mean that some of our talents will go unused, but the cost of doing it any other way would be far too high.</P>
      <P>Of course people will say that whatever happens, these appointments are politically motivated and the people who get these positions are supporters of whatever political party happens to appoint them.  That does not matter a great deal, provided that those who are appointed are always up to the job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This has not always been the case in the past and it was a justifiable cause for complaint, but matters have improved in recent years.  From my own experience, not all the appointments have a political connection.  I served for ten years as chairman of An Post and its predecessor.  I was appointed by one Government and reappointed by another, but I was asked by at least one Minister to suggest names of suitable people to go on the board of An Post.  I <Col N="308" /> suggested some people without knowing if they had any political allegiance or affiliations &mdash; it turned out that they did not have any &mdash; and a number of them were appointed.  I make this point to illustrate that things are not always as they are painted.  It seems from my experience that the vast majority of members of State boards were appointed not because of any political affiliation but for their expertise.  That was much more common than the other case.</P>
    <P>As a country, we do not always have an overabundance of talent &mdash; this is certainly the case as far as State boards are concerned &mdash; but we do have enough talent to fill these boards without bringing elected representatives into the picture.  It is reasonable to suggest that people serving the State should do so in one way or another but not in both, at least not at the same time.  On this basis, I have no problem in supporting the amendment to the motion.</P>

      <P>The question that arises &mdash; I know the Minister is concerning himself with it and it was also raised by Senator Quinn &mdash; is the ideal composition of a semi-State board.  This would be difficult for anybody to answer but it is an important question in a country like ours, with a mixed economy and where, of course, the semi-State sector is important.  It is not only important in itself in that it may form part of the machinery for the development of the State, but also because it is primarily dealing with assets in the public domain. These company undertakings are under public ownership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legal status of these companies has changed somewhat from the pre-Senator Quinn days when special legislation was set up for An Post and An Bord Telecom.  They became statutory corporations with independent boards <Col N="312" /> that were more independent than they used to be when they were more rigorously controlled by Government Departments.  It is fair to say &mdash; I think the Minister will agree &mdash; that in the early to mid-1980s, some of these boards were given a power of independence and autonomy that they may not have enjoyed heretofore.  Many people at the time felt that this was a good thing because it would release the energies that could be applied to these organisations for the benefit of the State.  The status or the property rights of these organisations remains the same. They are bodies which are directly or indirectly owned by the State on behalf of the people.  In those circumstances and given that legal background, what is the ideal composition for these semi-State boards?</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that the ideal composition of these boards is not one of technocrats or experts.  We would all agree that the genius of politics or of those who represent the people is that they are able to say to the experts that something may be all right in theory but that they do not know how it will affect people in practice.  In the days of Columbus, if people had listened to the experts they would have believed they would fall off the side of the earth and would never have found out that the earth was round.  Numerous other inventions over time have shown that science was incorrect.  If these boards are filled with experts, they may make decisions which fly in the face of the people.  As Senator Quinn said, we do not want boards which represent one political viewpoint.  We want boards which will exercise their knowledge, commonsense and expertise and which will apply themselves freely for the good of that company.</P>
    <P>As far as I am aware &mdash; the Minister will correct me if I wrong &mdash; the emoluments or gratuities paid to people on these boards is supposed to be minimal.</P>

      <P>It is supposed to be a small sum of money primarily for expenses.  The reason is that people would not seek to be on such boards for selfish reasons but to do a good public service.  Membership of those boards should include a mixture of technical experts, people with a commercial background and commonsense and those involved in their communities, politics, etc.</P>
      <P>As I said earlier, I will not get drawn into the events of the past few weeks.  If the Minister and others were to come to a decision that no person involved in politics should be on any of these boards, it might be a sustainable proposition in the light of evidence or experience.  The Minister will agree that he may have rankled a tradition or sensitivities when he asked people to review their position in circumstances where they had no expectation of their appointment being terminated.  I do not know much about their backgrounds, although I vaguely know one of them. However, I accept the word of others who say they have ability and are competent. The Minister slightly ruffled the sensitivities of people, although he is not known to be an insensitive person. In fact, we always found him amenable on the city council.  What the Minister did was wrong and he knows that.  I hope a wide-ranging review is undertaken in this regard.  The Minister might even support what we said today.</P>

The motion states:&rdquo; Seanad Éireann condemns the Minister for Finance for his attitude towards public representatives in relation to their suitability for membership of State boards&rdquo;.  I do not believe he mentioned all State boards, but a specific one.  The amendment mentions the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i><Col N="314" /> which was introduced a few years before the Labour Party was involved in Government.  It was agreed then by the Government and the various parties that the experience and expertise of the individual concerned should be taken into account.</P>
      <P>As regards appointments to any State board, expertise, experience and qualifications are extremely important.  I appreciate the Minister's concern because when dealing with a State bank and banks in general we are dealing with a sensitive issue.</P>

      <P>I wish him well because he is doing a reasonably good job.  I have been a Member of this House for 14 years and I represent public representatives. These people have impeccable characters and one of them has his own business.  Another man has a long track record as a member of the board. These two gentlemen would not have been unacceptable on the board of a private company, given their ability and credibility over the years.  These are people of the highest calibre and it is unfortunate they were caught in the line of fire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what the Government's policy will be in the future, but I hope it will be the same as it was in the past in that appointments made by an outgoing Government will be honoured by the incoming one.  I am disappointed that <Col N="316" /> public representatives, county councillors, Senators and Deputies are barred from boards of semi-State bodies.  These people have good track records and experience.  Many are experts in their own field and they have come up through the difficult world of business and finance.  What would their expertise and experience lend to the boards of these bodies?  Regulations in this area should be considered by the Government.</P>
    <P>This is a Government of openness and opportunity and I would like to accept that at face value.  There is a lot of expertise in this Chamber which could be used.  I do not accept that public representatives should not be members of boards.  On the contrary, public representatives are answerable to the people.</P>
    <P>What in the Government's or the Minister's opinion is the definition of an expert?  Is it a person with a high level of education, or someone who has been successful in their line of business and has a proven track record?  These people are being penalised in relation to appointments.  One only has to look at the level of expertise and experience in this Chamber.  This is one of the best Seanad in which I have served in terms of work.  We should consider that in relation to appointments to boards.  For example, Senator Magner is on the Oireachtas Joint Services Committee and through his work he has improved the public's image of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to address three aspects of this motion, the facts in relation to the event which prompted it, my personal attitude to local councillors and the question of State boards.  At the annual general meeting of the ACC Bank the chairman, who had been appointed by my predecessor, was reappointed by me because he was doing a good job and his political allegiances were well known.  I learned, because it was not in the documentation in front of me, that two of the members were county councillors.  The officials were not aware to which party they belonged, but they knew they were county councillors.  I asked if that was the practice in the past and they said it was.  I then asked them to get me the facts and figures because we did not have them in the Department of Finance and that was remiss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I told them I thought it was inappropriate for county councillors of whatever party to be members of a State bank, not a State board.  I felt that view should be conveyed in private to the individuals concerned.  However, in <Col N="318" /> order to avoid intimidation, I asked the chairman of the board to convey that view to the members of the board in question and to ask them to consider their positions.  I did not want ambiguity and I felt that having considered their positions, they should choose to resign.</P>
    <P>Out of courtesy to the political and civic society in this country, I took the precaution of and felt obliged to contact the party leader, Deputy B. Ahern, to inform him on the Monday of the action which the chairman of ACC Bank was to take on Wednesday after the board meeting.  Since we are now discussing private conversations, Deputy B. Ahern did not indicate his attitude to me one way or the other.  He noted the fact that I was conveying this information to him. In fairness, he was then travelling to Brussels.</P>
    <P>The rest is history.  The matter became public and it became interwoven with other issues.  The Fianna Fáil Party came to the conclusion that there was a witch-hunt against Fianna Fáil appointees to State boards, either public representatives or others.  That was not the case.  On Thursday morning I dealt decisively with the issue and said that if these people made public what was a non-public conversation and clearly indicated &mdash; I have had no contact with either of these people &mdash; that they would not do anything, the matter would rest and I would not take any further action.  I could summarily dismiss one member now and I could direct or request the members of the board to vote the other person out.  I have chosen to do neither because I respect anyone who offers themselves for public service, either in an elected capacity or to serve on a State board.  I regret that this issue has been publicised to such an extent.  I would not give myself any credit for the way I have handled it.</P>
    <P>In the interests of brevity and time I will say three things about my attitude to councillors.  I served my political <Col N="319" /> apprenticeship on a local authority.  My first formal full-time job after training in this country was for a local authority.  I worked for over two and a half years with Dublin Corporation's housing architects department.  I have the utmost respect for both the officials of a local authority and, in the context of politics and civic society, for the serving members of all parties and no party on local authorities.  They have a unique role to play in certain areas.</P>
    <P>I share the view expressed by Senator Quinn as regards the conflict in principle between elected members serving on elected bodies and persons on appointed executive agencies.  With certain exceptions, that is my view.  County enterprise boards which are clearly specific to a county should have local representatives on them.  As Senators Mooney and Doyle said, I went out of my way to change the composition so that there would, in effect, be all party representation at council level on the county enterprise boards.  Also, in the upcoming ports legislation there is a role for elected representatives because of the interaction between an urban community and a port.  While one cannot be absolutely rigid about this, I would support Senator Fergal Quinn's view as a general principle.  However, if we are going to implement that it should be done clearly and in advance.</P>
    <P>I have been accused of many things in my life but being antagonistic towards local councillors is one that is new to me because on many occasions I have defended their skill and expertise as people who aspire to membership of this House or the Lower House.  In serving an apprenticeship for higher office it is a prerequisite to cut one's political teeth on a local authority.</P>
    <P>I have a substantial amount of experience in relation to appointments to State boards.  When I became Minister for Labour in 1984 I had the responsibility, <i>de novo</i>, of appointing a new <Col N="320" /> team for what became the board of Great Southern Hotels.  I sought three things from those who were appointed. First, I wanted people who had never been on a State board before because they would all be coming together. There were two worker directors who were nominated by the then Irish Transport and General Workers Union because massive change had to be negotiated with the co-operation of the workforce involved.  Second, while I wanted a team, in football parlance, I did not want 11 goalkeepers or 11 midfield players but a range of skill and expertise.</P>
    <P>We were clearly looking at people who would tend to be politically close to you.  It takes time to find the people you want and then to see if they are available.  You have to see if the company or organisation they work for will make them available and that is not an easy task.  I can readily identify with the question that was posed by a Minister, who was not named by Senator Quinn, seeking advice as to who might or might not be available.</P>
    <P>In round figures there are probably about 100,000 members of political parties in this country out of a population of 3.5 million.  There is a vast pool of people who have no form of political allegiance yet there is also a vast pool of people who do have political allegiance and who get the likes of us elected.  When you start looking for talent, whether it is expertise from experience or from education, it is logical, normal and reasonable that your first port of call should be to the group with which you have an allegiance, but it should not be confined to that.  You should be able to reach beyond that to complete the best team available.</P>
    <P>My track record is proven in relation to the other range of boards that I had responsibility for appointing when we replaced the boards of Eolas and the old IDA with Forfás, IDA Ireland and Forbairt. Anybody looking objectively at <Col N="321" /> the composition of those boards can see a regional, gender, technical skills and political balance.  There are people on all three boards who have no political allegiance that I am aware of and as citizens of this Republic they are entitled to conceal or to proclaim their political allegiance.  We do, after all, have a secret ballot.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of general concern that this debate has focused on the composition of State boards though not for reasons that might have motivated the tabling of the motion.  We do have a problem with the composition of our State boards and with the interaction between the State board, the Department to which it is attached, the Minister who appoints, reappoints or partially appoints that board, and the wider Oireachtas to which &mdash; through the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies &mdash; those boards or companies are accountable.  We have an uneven practice.  In some cases the chief executive is not automatically a member of the board, which is a major disadvantage. In other cases only the chief executive is a member of the board and you do not have executive directors.</P>
    <P>If you look at what is currently best practice in both private and public companies, there is a mixture of executive directors, chief operational directors, a financial controller, production manager and general manager &mdash; that triangle of expertise that is found in most organisations &mdash; and outside directors. We do not have that in our State boards. We have worker participation which in many cases, but not in all, has worked satisfactorily.  However, there is no clear policy on or attitude to nominated external directors.  In many cases, as Senator Mulcahy indicated, the amount of time they make available for the stipend or director's fees they get is extraordinarily good value for money from the point of view of the State.  In the vast majority of cases they are not on <Col N="322" /> those boards for remuneration or expenses.  The Senator may wish to explore this on another occasion and, if I am in order, I would suggest that this matter could be raised on the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies.</P>
    <P>What is the ideal relationship between the Minister, the Secretary of the Department to which that State company relates, the chairperson of the board and the chief executive?  Many of the problems which we as Oireachtas Members have had to deal with, and which all of us as citizens and taxpayers have had to bail out, could have been minimised or avoided if we had a better relationship between the four key players: the chairman.  Minister, Secretary of the Department and the chief executive. Certain examples come immediately to my mind and I am sure they come to everybody else's mind too.</P>
    <P>I hope that my presence throughout this debate will be an indication of my respect for all the Members of this House.  I was anxious to tell Senators what the facts were, as well as illustrating my own attitude to local representatives, and to give some of my own views on the philosophical question of the composition of State boards.</P>
    <P>I respect people who come out and vote, yet only 70 per cent of people do so.  I also respect people who work to get people elected, irrespective of who they are working for.  I respect people who stand for election, are defeated and stand again.  I am deeply committed to the political process which, I recognise, is not confined to the 60 Members of this House, the 166 Members of the Lower House, or to the 1,000 councillors, approximately, around the country at various levels.  As a percentage of the population that is the mere tip of the iceberg.  None of us would be where we are today but for the support of many others who get us into the positions we hold.  In that context I would include individual citizens who come together to <Col N="323" /> support the campaign of independent Senators or Deputies.  I am, therefore, acutely respectful of their role in society.  Because of that respect I see it as counter productive to the fabric of our Republic that, on coming into office, any new Minister would exercise powers of summary dismissal of members of a board simply because they were appointed by the other side. Not only have I not done that but in some cases I have reappointed people who were appointed by the other side.  I have to say that the Fianna Fáil Party also did this when it was in Government with the Progressive Democrats and reappointed the chairman of Bord na Móna, who manifestly came from a different political tradition, because that person was seen by all concerned as doing a very good job.</P>

      <P>I was one of the people who fought in this House for local representatives to be included on county enterprise partnership boards.  I believe in local democracy and feel local representatives have a great deal to offer.  At the time I was chairman of Kerry County Council.  I ensured that the four representatives from the council were from each party in the county so they would have a voice for the people they represented.  I feel strongly about this.  Local representatives are the people on the ground.</P>
      <P>Democracy is being totally eroded.  If one is a political animal one cannot be a member of anything.  New legislation is being introduced to prohibit Members of the Oireachtas from membership of harbour commissions.  This means that if one is an Oireachtas Member one is not good enough to be on the board of any harbour commission.  I do not agree with this.  The right person for a job should be given that job, regardless of anything else.</P>
      <P>Officers of local authorities, whether they are in planning or engineers' offices, are all very wary of politicians, whether they are aligned with one party or another.  As the Minister rightly said, that is wrong.  I admire people who say they support a political party.  This would not reduce their standing in my eyes.  I make representations on behalf of people I support and I am sure they act with integrity and honesty.  I never found any of the people I dealt with in local authorities or other bodies to be anything other than honest.  They did their job in a professional way, which they are supposed to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The removal of people from bodies because of their political persuasion is <Col N="325" /> totally wrong.  Membership of boards should be open to people who are worth their salt and can prove themselves in any field.  Former Taoisigh, Ministers and European Commissioners from this country are in the highest demand because they have expertise and knowledge and can do something for the betterment of the country.  It is totally wrong that people should be removed from boards because of their allegiance to political parties.</P>
    <P>I believe in democracy and local representation on bodies.  I have stood in elections and was both rejected and elected by the people on numerous occasions.  It is totally wrong that people who become experts in their fields are told they cannot become members of boards because they are aligned to parties. I am glad the Minister has come to the House to explain the position and I hope there will not be any more erosion in the present structures.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I can understand why the motion is phrased the way it is.  The Minister, in an honest and mature speech, had the courage to say that things could have been done better and differently, not just by him but by others involved.  It is possible that there could have been a suspicion that this was the beginning of some sort of a purge of people appointed by the last Government.  It is very clear from what the Minister has said that nothing of the kind was or is intended.  The Minister was acting for reasons related to public policy. Whether he was right or wrong is <Col N="326" /> another matter but there is no question of any sort of a purge.</P>
    <P>Members opposite should be fair minded enough to accept this is the case.  For that reason I ask them so show an extraordinary sense of maturity by supporting the sensible amendment in my name.  This meets the case to which everybody could subscribe.  It says that we should consider the case for having members of local authorities on the boards of State banks.  It does not say this is a good or a bad thing.  It calls on the House to consider the case for or against this.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis made the point that rightly or wrongly &mdash; I have an open mind on this &mdash; Members of this and the other House are debarred by legislation from being members of most State companies. There is almost a standard clause in most Acts which lays this down.  There is legal clarity on this.  We should look at the case of members of local authorities.  There may well be a strong case for saying they could or should be members of State boards.  If this is so, we should address it in law after a considered debate.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Senator Roche for proposing this motion.  The debate has been very useful and has raised major issues. My amendment proposes that we should consider the case and, having done so, clarify our minds and bring in legislation.  This is what the Minister is saying.</P>
    <P>The question of directors and the composition of State boards has been raised.  Unfortunately in recent times the public media have been dominated by the enormous unwarranted salaries paid to some members of the boards of building societies.  People have effectively parachuted in and paid themselves enormous remuneration with no enormous achievement or risk on their part.  We can all accept the case of a person who takes a risk, mortgages his or her house, works all the hours there are, creates jobs and is properly rewarded.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="327" /> There is a great sense of public unease about that sort of parachuting behaviour and the payments being made.  This takes away from the fact that a director in the current climate has an enormous range of complex legal responsibilities.  Being a director is not a part-time job.  Great care has to be given to the choosing of members of State boards.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been exemplary in the way he has tried to find a balanced composition for all the State boards under his control.  He has not sought to select 11 goal keepers or 11 half backs but to select a full team which will meet a whole range of requirements such as expertise, common sense, specialisation, integrity and the ability to work within the enormous restraints placed on directors today.  My amendment is sensible and, with the suspicion of a purge out of the way, my colleagues and friends opposite should be able to support it. We should begin the real debate from this point on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  The motion deals with what is essentially a non-issue.  Once again Fianna Fáil is seeking to reinterpret history.  Members of the House are perfectly well aware that this Government has no intention, and never had any intention, of taking action against members of State boards or against anybody else solely on the basis of their political affiliation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion refers to the issue of public representatives serving on the board of ACC bank.  I do not believe there should be a blanket ban on public representatives serving on State boards. However, I acknowledge the reservations expressed by the Minister, Deputy Quinn, with regard to the potential conflict of interest in the case of ACC.  It should perhaps be pointed out that the party affiliation of the individuals <Col N="328" /> concerned was never an issue until raised by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>While I question Fianna Fáil's approach on this issue I welcome the opportunity for debate provided by this motion.  For far too long appointments to State boards and other bodies have been regarded as part of the spoils of Government.  Such appointments are routinely handed out to loyal party workers and supporters, often regardless of their qualifications for the job in hand.  My party believes that appointments to State bodies should be made on the basis of capability and proven expertise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;rather than on the sole basis of political affiliation.  The State sector plays a vital role in our economy and appointments to State bodies are far too important to be treated simply as the perks of office. There will always be cases where the best qualified person for the position is known to favour a particular political party.</P>
      <P>Provided that political affiliation does not represent a potential conflict of interest, I see no reason why a person should not be appointed.  However, experience and qualifications must take priority over political affiliation.  The leader of Fianna Fáil accused the Government of seeking to conduct a purge of Fianna Fáil members.  He should revisit his dictionary.  At no time has the Government or any Minister suggested that a specific party affiliation disqualifies an individual from serving on a State body.  However, it is necessary to examine the system of public appointments with a view to enhancing transparency and efficiency.</P>

      <P>This has been an interesting debate and I acknowledge <Col N="329" /> the Minister's presence to hear all the contributions.  The Minister departed from his script to offer us an insight into his approach.  I smiled inwardly when Senator Sherlock spoke about purges. He would know more about purges than most of us in this House.</P>
      <P>I will make a few concluding points. There is a number of flawed arguments in the Minister's speech.  Anybody on the board of a State-sponsored body &mdash; whether it is a bank or other State body &mdash; who found himself or herself in a potential conflict of interest situation should stand aside and declare their interest in those cases.  There are specific rules in that regard.  The argument that there is a special circumstance in the case of ACC bank or ICC does not stand up.</P>
      <P>The debate has been broadened usefully into the issue of local authority members serving on the boards of banks.  The Minister raised that matter in a speech that was both thought provoking and provocative, in the proper sense of the word.  When we discuss the issue of the boards of State-sponsored bodies I am always reminded of a speech made many years ago by the late Deputy John Kelly.  It was the best speech ever made on the subject of the boards of State-sponsored bodies and I would commend it to anybody.  He argued that while political affiliation should in itself never be the sole reason for a person being appointed to the board of a State-sponsored body, political affiliation should also not debar talent from being appointed to those boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I disagree with many of the comments that were made tonight.  I regret the contribution by Senator Maloney.  We discussed the regional technical college in this House before and his attack was premeditated and unwarranted.  It did this debate no good.  Above all, I disagree with Senator Quinn's view that somehow local authority members <Col N="330" /> should be debarred from all boards of all State-sponsored bodies.  The point of the argument made by the Minister can be debated.  However, the fact that people put themselves before the people and enter local government should not debar them or their talent from the boards of State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to divide the House on this issue.  The Minister made a very useful suggestion that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies should come to a definitive view on the issue of board membership of State-sponsored bodies.  It has been a thorny issue and it is used as a political football throughout the country.  Some people love to haul down all democratic institutions in the State and to denigrate politicians and political activity.  By doing that they diminish democracy, the State and the institutions of State.</P>
    <P>Councillors of all parties serve this country well to the extent of their talents. They play a unique role.  I would have regarded councillors on the board of ACC as being useful.  At one time there were problems with ACC and its liberal attitude to dispensing loans and the first people to discuss that issue and the problems being stored for borrowers were local councillors.  It is interesting that in all the academic literature about State bodies and how they should be composed, in this country or any other country, there is no discussion about barring local politicians.  All Acts since the foundation of the State &mdash; and the Minister's speech refers to the 1927 Act that instituted the ESB &mdash; are silent on the issue of local authority members being members of boards of State bodies.</P>
    <P>We have raised an issue of principle in this motion.  I disagree with the Minister's views on board members of the ACC bank but I respect the fact that his views have now been stated.  The debate gave the Minister the opportunity to put the basis of his views in this case on the record.  I am also grateful for the sake of the two members in question that the <Col N="331" /> Minister put it on the record that their service to the State and to the State bank has been exemplary in every regard.  There was no suggestion that they had done anything which would bring dishonour on themselves or their party or that they have ever done anything improper.  I accept that this was an issue of principle with the Minister. There is a difference between us about the principle.  We could argue the two sides of the issue.  The Minister's concluding suggestion that the issue should be examined by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies was exemplary and would find support on all sides of the House.  The issue of how we decide who can and who cannot be on a State board is an interesting one.</P>
    <P>I take great solace from the fact that the Minister argues for the principle regarding membership of the boards of State banks from the point of view of the pressures that would be put on the individuals concerned.  I believe that individual councillors, regardless of what party they represent, would be capable of resisting those pressures. However, I accept that there would be a problem for public representatives on a borrowing authority.</P>
    <P>A general point is being made &mdash; and the Minister accepts our bona fides &mdash; that there is an erosion of respect for politicians evident at present.  One could be a mass murderer and be on the board of a regional technical college, for example, but one cannot be a Senator or Deputy and be on the board of a regional technical college.  There is also a suggestion that Oireachtas Members will be excluded from harbour boards. That is a fundamental mistake.  The exclusion from membership of the boards of regional technical colleges was carried out by my party and I argued at the time that it was a fundamental error.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="332" /> We should look carefully before we narrow further the range of services on which we are prepared to use the political talent of people who present themselves before the electorate.  It was not mean spirited point scoring that prompted this motion.  The debate which arose in the last few days, regardless of whether the issue was misconstrued, opens up the issue of the composition of State bodies and it is an issue we should argue.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning asked, with his tongue at the back of his mouth, whether we would support the amendment. We will oppose the amendment on a voice vote.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and call on Senator Wall.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for taking this matter on the Adjournment. The matter came to my attention when representations were made to me by a group called Athy Alternative, funded by the Department of Justice and FÁS. The group deals with young offenders aged from 16 to 25 years.  It attempts to help those involved re-enter society and become model citizens again.  A scheme <Col N="333" /> was established to develop the harbour area of the Grand Canal at Athy by the provision of flower beds, landscaping, berthing docks and so on.  However, it was found that those over 21 years of age were receiving a payment from FÁS while those under this age were not receiving any payment.  This created a problem within the group in that it was not allowed to develop as it was first envisaged, which was the reintegration of the young unfortunates back into being responsible citizens.</P>
      <P>The work of the scheme was a help in that the personnel involved were also learning gardening, blocklaying and so on.  As it was not possible for me to get a positive answer in representations I made to the Department of Justice and FÁS, I ask the Minister that a special case be made by FÁS to ensure equal payment for all concerned in such special cases.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  This is my first opportunity to address the House for many years and it is a pleasure to speak in the Seanad for the first time since 1986.  I do not answer for the detailed operation of individual schemes and am not familiar with the details to which Senator Wall refers. They are ultimately a matter for FÁS, however, I understand the background to the cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Essentially, the community employment programme is confined to certain participants.  To participate in a community employment scheme, a person must be of any, age and be in receipt of unemployment benefit or lone parent allowance for over one year, or be 21 years of age or over and in receipt of unemployment assistance.  In addition, persons referred by the National Rehabilitation Board are also eligible. These criteria were designed to target the programme at specific categories of people who were considered to be most in need of these kinds of opportunities. In this instance there are participants on <Col N="334" /> a scheme who are non-eligible and who are participating, as I understand it, on a voluntary basis, and as such would probably be qualifying for unemployment assistance alone, whereas the person on the community employment scheme would be getting the additional top up payments.</P>
    <P>The difficulty this matter would pose to me is that I cannot alter the eligibility criteria for one instance.  If I alter them, I alter them for everybody, as it is a national scheme and it applies nationally.  Despite the quality and worth of the individual programme, it is not at liberty for me to intervene and say that this is a worthy programme, but every other one is not.</P>
    <P>The rest of the reply which was prepared for me in my Department does not address the issue raised by the Senator.  It describes the programme and how it works and the fact that it has a training element in it and aims to try and produce people who at the end of the programme have gained something worthwhile and who will progress to other opportunities, be they training opportunities or opportunities in the open market place.</P>
    <P>The scheme is extremely expensive, even on the existing categories which it covers.  It is costing £255 million this year, which is an increase of £75 million on last year.  The Senator will be aware that even that allocation is causing acute problems as we attempt to manage a demand way in excess of what even a sum of £255 million will cater for.</P>
    <P>While this is not a satisfactory reply to the Senator, I must stick with the eligibility criteria.  It is not open to me to start identifying worthy projects where we would breach the criteria.  On that basis I am not, unfortunately, on my first visit to the House, the bearer of glad tidings.  However, hopefully the Senator will understand that these schemes are designed and the rules are established to target specific categories. There are other programmes specifically geared towards younger people who drop out of school without qualifications and there are, therefore, other <Col N="335" /> opportunities to which this young person could perhaps be directed.</P>

      <P>Thank you, Minister.  I was not aware that this is your first time to attend the House as <Col N="336" /> Minister, so I give you a very warm welcome. I recall another famous occasion when both of us were elected here some years ago.</P>
