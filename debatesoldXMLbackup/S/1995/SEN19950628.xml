      <P>I have notice from Senator O'Kennedy that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to implement the recommendations of the environmental research unit of his Department on the water quality in Lough Derg as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by Senator O'Kennedy as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take items 1 and 2.  There is no guillotine on item 1, but if it is concluded today we will, by agreement, proceed to the further Stages of the Bill.  It is proposed to take item 2 at 6 o'clock.</P>

    <P>As the funeral of our late colleague, Senator Gordon Wilson, is taking place at 2 o'clock tomorrow afternoon, the House will not sit tomorrow to enable Members and staff to attend the funeral. Thursday's business will be taken on <Col N="310" /> Friday, 29 June.  I thank the Opposition Whips for agreeing to these arrangements.</P>

      <P>Every time somebody builds a wall it appears to create some kind of difficulty for others.  I raise this matter as an Independent Member with no party interest in it.  It is worrying if political capital is made of the fact that security arrangements are made around the Taoiseach's home and if they also become a matter for political footballing across the House.  It demeans politics. As independent politicians we are required to take due care to ensure the security of elected public representatives. If, therefore, security personnel consider that security arrangements must be made on the Taoiseach's home it should be beyond question.  Those who question it and make political football out of it merely raise the normal kind of pub comment to a level that demeans politics.  I ask my colleagues on the Fianna Fáil benches to desist from this.  It does not matter who is in Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear that Senator O'Toole has no problems regarding certain colours of walls.  Will the Leader of the House ask the Minister for Finance to attend the House to explain why his Department has abandoned the arterial drainage scheme for north west County Roscommon with a loss of 70 jobs?  I understand that the scheme was not due to be completed for another three years as many outstanding works were to be done in that period. However, the Minister has now decided to abandon the project and make 70 staff redundant.  It is a serious matter for the area concerned.</P>
      <P>Many people fail to understand the Minister's action in view of the amendments that have been made to the arterial drainage legislation.  They consider that the area could have been a suitable location for the headquarters and staff to implement the provisions of the amended legislation.  If the Leader arranged for the Minister for Finance to attend the House we may possibly get a change on this decision as it would be in the interest of the whole region of County Cavan and north west County Roscommon.</P>

In view of the sudden death of Senator Gordon Wilson and the fact <Col N="312" /> that there is such concern in Britain, it seems that we are dragging our heels.  I would hate to think that, on humanitarian grounds, this Bill would be delayed in any way.  It is going through the other House and we should give an assurance that it will go through all Stages in this House before the summer recess.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two questions.  In view of the fact that the late Fr. Michael Cleary, who did so much good work in this country, is being vilified and scandalised in the media, is there any possibility&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness, a law should be introduced to protect the dead because this could happen to any of us. It is scandalous.  I believe the Government should set up an inquiry to prove whether the journalists involved were right or wrong.  They seem to be a law unto themselves when it comes to writing this type of article.</P>
      <P>My second question relates to drugs at discos.  A young man has died and a girl stated on radio yesterday that within ten minutes of entering a disco people are approached to buy drugs.  On several occasions when we have had debates on this subject I have asked why the legal authorities cannot arrest those responsible for pushing drugs; they are pushing death.  The Minister should come before this House to explain why drugs are so readily available and why so little is being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to raise the situation of the county roads and the Minister for the Environment every week.  However, the Leader has given undertakings that he would get some information on what action the Minister is proposing to take about the collapse of the county roads, and the provision of additional finances, as indicated in this House during the debate on the matter. If necessary we will endeavour to raise <Col N="313" /> this issue again by way of some other mechanism.  I would like the Leader to impress upon the Minister the urgency of dealing with the situation.  Many local authorities are now laying off staff.  The Government's attitude is in sharp contrast to the situation where they can readily find £500,000 to purchase new Mercedes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the point raised by Senator Wright, I should have stated at the outset that we would have 30 minutes for the first speaker and 20 minutes for each speaker thereafter. Since Senator O'Toole does not want to make political capital of the issue I will not either.</P>
      <P>Senator Finneran raised the question of the arterial drainage scheme.  He made a good case.  I will inquire to see if the Minister is available or if I can obtain some information on that issue.</P>
      <P>Senator Ormonde raised the question of the Transfer of Sentenced Prisoners Bill.  The matter is one of great urgency. It was intended to introduce the Bill to the House on Thursday next; if possible, it will now be introduced on Tuesday. We hope to put the Bill through all Stages by the end of next week for the reasons indicated by Senator Ormonde.</P>
      <P>Senator Farrell raised a number of questions.  On the question of drugs, there is an enormous problem.  It was heartening that real progress was made on heightening international co-operation against drugs at the summit in Cannes yesterday.  The problem is clearly an international one.  Most of the drugs are coming from outside and this country is being used as a transit area. The problem needs to be tackled internationally with the provision of major resources and a good start was made at Cannes.  On the other question raised by Senator Farrell, we would all like to see clearer guidelines and regulations laid down as to what is or is not appropriate for press coverage.  Perhaps there should be a wide ranging debate on that issue.  It would be in everyone's interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="314" /> The question of county roads has been raised more than once by Senator Daly.  I have conveyed his questions to the Minister who has assured me that there will soon be a major report on the matter.  I am simply conveying that message to the Senator.  If I may clarify one question, there will be a sos from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh. It is a pleasure to be here to deal with this Bill today.</P>
      <P>As set out in the explanatory memorandum which has already been circulated, the purpose of the Tourist Traffic Bill, 1995, is to enable Bord Fáilte Éireann to delegate to a contractor certain of its tourist accommodation inspection and associated functions and powers under the Tourism Traffic Acts, 1939-87, and the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988.  The functions and powers in question relate to the registration and grading of a range of tourist accommodation and the licensing of restaurants. The Bill provides also for an increase from £18 million to £22 million in the statutory cumulative limit for grants by Bord Fáilte for tourism capital development works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset, I would like to briefly outline the background to this Bill.  In the context of reviewing the effectiveness of existing arrangements to promote Ireland as a tourist destination, Arthur D.  Little Limited, London, were <Col N="315" /> commissioned as consultants by my predecessor in 1994 to carry out a fundamental review of Bord Fáilte.  The conclusion and recommendations contained in their final report &mdash; copies of which have been provided to the Seanad Library &mdash; were accepted by the Government in November 1994.  When I took up office at the Department of Tourism and Trade in December last, I reviewed the position and decided to press ahead with the implementation of the findings in the review.</P>
    <P>It is important to recall that the consultants recognised that Bord Fáilte had done a good job for Irish tourism over the years.  However, times change and there was a need for change in Bord Fáilte as well.  Because of its unstructured and organic growth over the years, BFE had developed into a multifunctional body and was undertaking more activities than were desirable.  In addition to marketing and promotion, it had become involved in the registration and regulation of a very wide range of tourist accommodation and services, it was making decisions on EU grant applications, it was publishing a wide range of brochures, it was running the Tidy Towns competition and was carrying out various other functions and activities.  Although important in their own right, those other activities were not necessarily supportive of the overseas marketing and promotion function which should be at the heart of Bord Fáilte's role.  In reality, they almost led to a significant diminution in the level of dedicated and focused team effort that should characterise a dynamic international marketing organisation.</P>
    <P>Moreover, it is clear that the Irish tourist industry has grown and matured in recent years and is now willing and able to take on more responsibility for its own future development.  It is accordingly less in need of the intensive hand-holding and paternal direction which characterised the role of Bord Fáilte in earlier times.</P>
    <P>The consultants concluded &mdash; quite rightly in my view &mdash; that Bord Fáilte, <Col N="316" /> in future, should concentrate on its core activities of selling Ireland as a tourist destination overseas, helping the less mature elements of the industry to develop and providing market intelligence to industry decision makers.  The review envisaged Bord Fáilte strengthening its marketing capabilities and, with a view to filling skill gaps, introducing new blood with industry experience. As an essential part of the change process, BFE would transfer or cease some of its existing activities and its overall staff complement would be reduced by about 70.</P>
    <P>The ADL review was well received by the Irish tourist industry, in political circles and by the media and this convinced me that it had general acceptance and should be energetically implemented.  In the Dáil, I paid due tribute to my predecessor, Deputy McCreevy, who was instrumental in commissioning the review.  While I did not agree with his, at times, confrontational style <i>vis-a-vis</i> Bord Fáilte, I believe he had at heart the interest of the continued and successful development of the tourism sector.</P>
    <P>Much progress has been made since the beginning of the year in implementing the ADL review.  A high level implementation committee is overseeing the change process and has met on 11 occasions.  We are now seeing clear evidence of the much desired internal organisational and cultural changes in the board.  A new mission statement and organisational structure has been put in place together with related senior staff changes.</P>
    <P>A new dynamic international marketing director with an impressive track record in private industry has been appointed.  An attractive voluntary severance package has been available to staff and will now enable the organisation to be revitalised and reinvigorated through staff movement and some recruitment of new blood.  The new Bord Fáilte will be progressively launched over the summer months and will see an exciting rebirth of the organisation and a new era in the marketing <Col N="317" /> of Ireland overseas as a first class holiday destination.</P>
    <P>As regards existing Bord Fáilte functions to be divested, the tendering procedure for the registration and grading has now been completed.  Subject to enactment of this Bill, I would hope that the new arrangements of which I will speak later could be put in place by September. In conjunction with the tendering process my Department has also completed a consultative round with the key groups of accommodation providers affected by the proposed changes to ensure they understand fully what is being done and to note their concerns.</P>
    <P>I wish to announce today that I have agreed to accept the recommendation of the implementation steering committee to appoint Tourism Quality Services Limited as the registration and grading contractor.  Subject to the enactment of this Bill, Bord Fáilte will enter into the necessary detailed contractual discussions with TQS.</P>
    <P>The selection of Tourism Quality Services Limited was made after an open and publicly advertised tendering procedure conducted in accordance with EU rules.  TQS was considered the optimal choice in view of its experience in conducting similar functions successfully for the Wales Tourist Board for the past five years and for its strong and dependable commercial and operational management. TQS intends to establish a subsidiary in Dublin to manage and operate the function and will employ locally recruited staff with the necessary qualifications and experience.</P>
    <P>The company is most anxious to work in close consultation and co-operation with the Irish accommodation sector and will be putting in place an appropriate programme to establish the fullest credibility with the industry.  The need for such consultation and co-operation was highlighted during the debate in the Dáil and, of course, I fully accept the point.</P>
    <P>On the product approvals, or the nonregistered tourist accommodation and services side, a number of the key associations, for example, in the bed and <Col N="318" /> breakfast sector, have now taken up the challenge of accepting a greater level of responsibility for enforcing their own standards.  A couple of weeks ago I had the pleasure of hosting a reception to announce the formal recognition of the Town and Country Homes Association and the Irish Farm Holidays Association as approving bodies for the Irish homes sector and the awarding of the shamrock symbol.  I do not rule out the recognition of further associations subject to acceptable standards being met.</P>
    <P>The tenders for Bord Fáilte's and Shannon Development Company's European Regional Development Fund product development grant assessment and administration role have been received and have now been appraised to determine if costs and other considerations justify this function being contracted out.</P>
    <P>I wish to formally announce today that I have decided that this function should be retained by Bord Fáilte and by the Shannon Development Company in the mid-west region.  I have taken this decision on the advice of the implementation steering committee for the following reasons: transfer of the function to a contractor would lead to a significant increase in costs which would have to be borne by grant applicants, the Exchequer or the technical assistance provision under the EU operational programme for tourism, or a combination of these; the concerns regarding potential conflicts between the different roles exercised by Bord Fáilte in carrying out the function, which gave rise to the initial recommendation by A D Little that it be outsourced, have been greatly ameliorated by the appointment of independent management boards to make grant decisions; and the management boards in the Bord Fáilte and Shannon areas, who are the users of the assessment and administration service, are very satisfied with the current service from the agencies in question and do not wish to have any change in the current arrangements.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware the Tidy Towns competition has been transferred <Col N="319" /> to the Department of the Environment and the &ldquo;Discover Ireland&rdquo; brochure series has been put out to private tender. The Gulliver computerised information and reservation system is being fundamentally reassessed to see if it can be satisfactorily reconfigured in the context of an external commercial arrangement.</P>
    <P>All in all, this is a series of dramatic changes which I honestly believe represents a new and exciting chapter in the history of Bord Fáilte.  I know that the chairman, the board, the director general, management, staff and unions, after some understandable initial reluctance, are taking up the challenge with enthusiasm and I am grateful for their support.  Much care has been taken to ensure a full and comprehensive dialogue with the unions and staff in view of the sensitivities involved.  No compulsory redundancies are involved.  I would also like to acknowledge the support and patience of the industry in regard to the changes being put in place.  Change is always unsettling and demands adaptability, intelligence and understanding to accommodate it.</P>
    <P>The Bill we have before us today does not constitute a major overhaul of the Tourist Traffic Acts which govern the operations of Bord Fáilte and the registration, grading and approval of tourist accommodation.  My objective has been to implement the ADL review with the minimum of legislative change and disruption to the industry.  Ideally, I would have liked to bring forward a consolidation Bill but that is something for a later time and is further down the road.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, one of the major changes recommended by the consultants was the subcontracting by Bord Fáilte to a commercial third party of certain inspection and associated functions in relation to the registration and grading of tourist accommodation.  As these are statutory powers and functions at present vested in Bord Fáilte, amending legislation is necessary to allow the board to delegate them to a third party. Under the current tourist traffic legislation, <Col N="320" /> the following categories of establishment require mandatory registration with Bord Fáilte: hotels, guesthouses, holiday hostels, youth hostels, holiday camps, caravan and camping sites, holiday cottages and holiday apartment group schemes.  The standards to be applied, together with the relevant fees payable, in the case of each of the categories are provided for in regulations made under the Acts by the board, with my consent.  Classification &mdash; or grading, as it is more commonly referred to &mdash; is not mandatory but is provided for under the current legislation and applies to hotels, guesthouses, caravan and camping sites and holiday cottages and apartments.</P>
    <P>The Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, provides that in order to obtain a special restaurant licence the proprietor must present a Bord Fáilte certificate.  The Act empowers Bord Fáilte to inspect restaurants for the purpose of issuing such a certificate.  The inspection criteria to be applied and the fee payable are laid down in regulations made under the Act by the Minister for Tourism and Trade with the consent of the Minister for Justice.  Indeed, it is my intention to review the criteria for certified restaurants, and other categories of accommodation at a later date, to see if they can be simplified somewhat while maintaining appropriately high standards.</P>
    <P>The Tourist Traffic Bill, 1995, will enable the board to delegate to a contractor the bulk of its inspection and associated functions in relation to registration and grading of tourist accommodation and in relation to special restaurant licences.  Under the new arrangements, the board will continue to retain ownership of the registration and grading standards, which means it will continue to set the criteria for registration and grading and to prescribe the various fees involved by regulation made under the provisions of the Tourist Traffic Acts, with my consent.  Bord Fáilte will also continue to retain responsibility for the operation of the final stages of the appeals mechanism provided for under the Acts, when <Col N="321" /> applications for registration and renewal of registration are refused and in the case of cancellation of registration. It will also be involved in the final stages of the appeals mechanism for grading of accommodation.  As there was some confusion during the debate in the Dáil on this point, I want to emphasise that there will be no change in the existing legal provisions and procedures for appeal other than provision for the contractor, rather than Bord Fáilte, to carry out the earlier stages of the appeals process.  Bord Fáilte will have a role also in monitoring the performance of the contractor and in the selection process.  All other aspects of the inspection process will in future be undertaken by the third party contractor.</P>
    <P>The key roles being retained by Bord Fáilte in the registration, grading and certification process will be critical in ensuring that the board maintains tight control on the standards and procedures to be used while relieving it of the more routine physical inspection procedures. I am acutely conscious of the importance of maintaining high quality standards for tourist accommodation and there is absolutely no reason to believe that the changes which are envisaged under this Bill will in any way adversely affect the current situation.</P>
    <P>In selecting the external contractor to undertake the functions to be outsourced, we were assessing tenders against a set of key criteria which included capability and experience to undertake the role; cost efficiency within the existing fee structures; financial offers to Bord Fáilte for the right to provide the service and collect associated fees; transparency and objectivity in the activities to be undertaken and accountability. The contract will be awarded for five years, subject to a yearly review clause.  Bord Fáilte will also have the right to cancel the contract in the event of unacceptable performance.</P>
    <P>The Bill is quite short and comprises ten sections and a Schedule.  The <Col N="322" /> explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill explains the proposed changes in detail.  Section 2 allows Bord Fáilte to delegate a third party, subject to contract, certain of its inspection powers and functions as set out in the Schedule.  Section 3 allows the board to make regulations governing the terms and conditions of any such contract. Section 4 provides for termination of a contract where this is deemed appropriate. Section 5 allows employees of the contractor to be designated as registration officers &mdash; or inspectors &mdash; subject to appropriate controls.  Sections 6 to 8 deal with certain legal consequences in relation to the holding of the accommodation registers and opinions of the board.  Section 9 provides for an increase from £18 million to £22 million in the statutory limit for grants by Bord Fáilte for tourism capital development works.  In recent years this expenditure has been used primarily to assist in the co-financing of tourism capital development projects, such as tourist information offices and amenity signposting.  I will be happy to deal on Committee Stage with any specific questions Senators might have.</P>
    <P>With your permission, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, I would like to give the House a brief update on developments in the tourism sector generally in the context of the present Bill.  The economic importance of tourism has grown enormously in recent years.  Earlier this month I launched a major consultancy study on the economic impact of tourism in Ireland by Tansey, Webster and Associates, under the auspices, of the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation. Some of the findings were extremely interesting.  For example, for the first time in 1994 the number of overseas visitors coming to Ireland, at 3.68 million, exceeded the size of the domestic population; tourism's contribution to gross national product has risen from 4.8 per cent in 1986 to close to 7 per cent in 1993; and tourism supports employment for over 90,000 at present and is closing the gap on primary agriculture as a source of jobs in Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="323" /> Tourism has been one of the major growth sectors in the Irish economy with continued potential for further development and job creation.  It is labour intensive, has a negligible import content and a strong regional development dimension.  I believe we can achieve continued growth while at the same time protecting our environment by careful management and a wider seasonal spread of tourist numbers.</P>
    <P>Nineteen ninety four was a good year for Irish tourism and continues a pattern of uninterrupted growth in revenue and visitor numbers since the late 1980s. Recently released CSO figures show that the number of overseas tourists is estimated to have increased by over 10 per cent in 1994.  Revenue spent by overseas visitors increased by 10 per cent also to £1.5 billion.  Much of the 1994 growth was attributable to especially improved performances in the American and British markets.  I am optimistic that 1995 will be an excellent year as well.  Figures released by the CSO recently show that the number of overseas visitors to Ireland in the period January to March represented an increase of nearly 17 per cent on the same period last year.</P>
    <P>In order to achieve the ambitious medium-term growth targets which are included in the EU Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-99, we have set specific targets for each of our principal markets in 1995.  The new structures and initiatives which we are putting in place within Bord Fáilte, in our international marketing effort, in this year's Finance Act and through EU development grants will provide an added boost for achieving our goals in 1995.  The ongoing peace in Northern Ireland is of tremendous benefit as well, I will touch on this later.</P>
    <P>Turning to the international marketing of Ireland, I have allocated £4 million to the OTMI &mdash; the Overseas Tourism Marketing Initiative &mdash; in 1995. When complementary finance from the tourism industry, North and South, is included, the total budget for this campaign <Col N="324" /> this year amounts to £6.3 million. The OTMI represents the continuation of a consumer marketing partnership between Government and the private sector which was pioneered in last year's US marketing initiative.  That campaign was extremely successful and Central Statistics Office estimates show that an overall increase of some 17 per cent in North American visitors was achieved by Ireland last year compared to an average 8 per cent growth by our European competitors.</P>
    <P>This year's OTMI campaign is aimed at increasing tourist numbers and revenue from four of our most important markets &mdash; the US, Britain, Germany and France.  An exciting new dimension is the involvement of the Northern Ireland tourism industry.  For the first time ever, all the tourism interests on the island have come together in a large scale programme to market Ireland as a single destination &mdash; one of the increasing number of marketing co-operation initiatives being pursued on a joint North-South basis.</P>
    <P>The OTMI strategy again consists primarily of generic &ldquo;Visit Ireland&rdquo; advertising on television and in newspapers and magazines.  Inquirers in each market receive a custom produced brochure which features the product of the participating companies and organisations, together with the Bord Fáilte and Northern Ireland Tourism Board literature. As Senators are aware, the peace process has added greatly to the ability to market Ireland internationally as a destination of high quality for tourism and we all support this.  It is ironic that I am here discussing the boost in tourism numbers particularly in relation to Northern Ireland on the basis of the peace process when the Seanad only yesterday lost a dear and valued friend in the late Senator Gordon Wilson.  Go ndéana Dia trócaire air.</P>
    <P>Work on the development of an international brand for Irish tourism was initiated in 1994 through the Tourism Council.  This is a very exciting project and is part of a total comprehensive relook at Ireland, the brand and its communication. <Col N="325" /> It has the potential to bring a new dynamism to our international marketing effort in co-operation with the industry.  Consultants were appointed to develop the visioning process of the brand development and have reported their findings.  Bord Fáilte's new international marketing director is now leading an industry partnership group to take the process forward with the objective of relaunching the Ireland brand progressively in 1996.</P>
    <P>The EU Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-99, under which investment of £650 million is envisaged with associated grants of £370 million, is now in place for six months.  I am glad to report that interest in the programme is very intense and over 1,000 applications for grant assistance have been received. The management boards, which decide on individual grant applications under the programme &mdash; to which I referred earlier &mdash; have already established an excellent record for independent and rigorous appraisal of projects.</P>
    <P>Under the product development subprogramme of the operational programme, more than 50 of the 250 applications received have been decided to date.  The approvals cover a wide range of tourism product, including visitor information, visitor centres, leisure and conference centres, tourism angling, cruising, walking and adventure sports. One of the major flagship projects in this subprogramme is the establishment of a national conference centre.  I intend to bring this matter before the Government soon in order to obtain clear support to proceed with the development of the centre at an early date.</P>
    <P>The marketing subprogramme of the operational programme is well under way also with decisions made on some 100 of the 400 or so applications received to date.  The most significant initiative undertaken in 1994 has been the OTMI campaign to which I referred earlier.  Almost 8,000 people completed training in 1994 on over 600 ESF sponsored training courses under the training subprogramme of the operational programme.  Of the 1,380 unemployed <Col N="326" /> persons receiving certification, almost 1,000, or 72 per cent, gained full-time employment with the balance obtaining part-time work or progressing to further education-training or to sheltered employment.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied with overall progress under the tourism operational programme. I am conscious of the need to ensure that EU funds are spent wisely with a view to putting in place the industry infrastructure which will carry us well into the next century.  This year's budget and Finance Act will help to strengthen the Irish tourism industry through a variety of both general and specific measures.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that the pilot renewal scheme for traditional resort areas was included and I am confident that this measure will have a revitalising effect on the specific towns and areas to be covered.  The scheme is based on the successful urban renewal scheme and it incorporates many of the features of that scheme, notably accelerated capital allowances, double rent allowances and rented residential accommodation relief.  As the House is aware, the details are set out in the Finance Act and the scheme will now be promoted by my Department and the tourism support agencies.  Ultimately, the success of the scheme will depend upon the commitment and energy of the investors and entrepreneurs who come forward with development projects.</P>
    <P>The tourism industry will also benefit greatly from a number of general taxation provisions under the Finance Act, 1995, such as PRSI reliefs and reduction in corporation profits tax.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the peace process in Northern Ireland has enormous potential for the further development of tourism on the island and has already resulted in a redefinition of our policies and strategies.  I referred earlier to the £6.3 million Overseas Tourism Marketing Initiative which for the first time ever brought the public and private sectors in Ireland and Northern Ireland together.  This is a unique partnership <Col N="327" /> which is selling tourism on the island of Ireland in our major markets abroad.</P>
    <P>I have met my Northern Ireland counterpart.  Baroness Denton of Wakefield, on numerous occasions in recent months and we have announced a range of cross-Border regional marketing initiatives as well as participating jointly in numerous events, most recently at the White House Conference on Trade and Investment in Ireland.  In Washington we were joined by the chief executives of our two tourist boards, who made an effective joint presentation to US business on the investment needs of the industry on the island.  Senators will also be aware that Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown, myself, as Minister for Tourism and Trade and Baroness Denton, on behalf of the American, Irish and British Governments respectively, signed a communiqué at that conference.</P>
    <P>The International Fund for Ireland, the new INTERREG programme and the forthcoming special support programme for peace and reconciliation are all creating new opportunities for North/South contact at governmental, tourist board, community and business levels.</P>
    <P>It is clear from what I have said that these are exciting times for Irish tourism. The industry has developed substantially in recent years and high levels of investment are being made to improve our product.  We have always had a reputation as a country of great natural beauty where, despite recent isolated crimes against tourists, a warm welcome is guaranteed.  These attributes have now been enhanced through a major improvement in tourist accommodation and visitor attractions together with a growing level of maturity and professionalism on the part of our industry.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Tourist Traffic Bill, 1995, is a reflection of the changes taking place in Irish tourism.  It will play its part in helping to reposition Bord Fáilte among the best of national tourist organisations, making its unique contribution <Col N="328" /> to the continued growth and development of tourism in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Thank, you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, for the opportunity to make these remarks on the Bill and I look forward to the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I appreciate the fact that the Minister is taking the debate on this Bill.  Tourism is one of our greatest areas for job creation and if the Minister was to ask a Minister of State to sit in on this debate, it would indicate to me, however eloquent that Minster of State would be, that this Bill was being taken less than seriously.  I am pleased that the Minister is prepared to take the Bill through the House.</P>
      <P>I would find it hard to accept the Minister's last remarks about Bord Fáilte being, or ever becoming, with its present structure, one of the major national promotion agencies.  For many years I have looked on Bord Fáilte as an old and out of date institution, heavily laden with personnel, pensions and an out of date structure.  I come from a county that has the potential to develop tourism.  Far be it for me to give the Minister a lesson on the value of tourism to the west of Ireland.  I would not contest or dispute the fact that the Minister knows about the value of tourism.</P>
      <P>Looking at the island of Ireland, North and South, the Minister is aware that tourism is the one area with the prospect of providing jobs for our young people.  For many years my county has clearly demonstrated its interest.  A hotel training college was established in Killybegs to accommodate up to 600 young students.  If I knew nothing about the value of tourism, that regional college in Killybegs would quickly provide me with the picture.  The 600 students trained there are booked in advance to the hotel industry on an allocation basis and this gives an indication of the demand for trained personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every Minister, including the current Minister's predecessor, Deputy McCreevy, went along with the system, tinkering, improving and altering something <Col N="329" /> that nobody in the country believes in.  I am not jumping on a political bandwagon and I hope to be constructive. Small potential developers in the tourist business in counties like Mayo and Donegal, or anywhere else in the west of Ireland, may have plans, for example, to add ten bedrooms for a self-catering tourist project, but can the Minister say where such people can get application forms that do not give them the run-around?  They hire an accountant and make a submission, including plans, at a cost of £4,000 to £10,000 before receiving anything.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte has neither the capacity nor the funding.  It has a heavy personnel structure involving inspections and examinations but providing nothing at the end of the line.  The bottom line is that no structures are in place.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the Minister has increased the provision for accommodation from £18 million to £22 million, but everybody knows that out of that provision will have to come overheads and ongoing pensions for 50 years.  Bord Fáilte is a big, heavy vehicle that is out of date, geared to an industry where you came in with a tea trolley and the morning newspaper.</P>
    <P>I made the same point to the Minister's predecessor when he launched the programme up in Monaghan.  I differed totally with him then, because while it is all very well to recognise the value of Bord Fáilte, which is a great flag to wave, the industry finds it impossible to get any benefit from it.  The Minister must know this better than anyone else because he has a great county, yet the people he represents cannot participate in any kind of development.  That is my argument.</P>
    <P>Many years ago a seminar was organised in Roscommon arising from concerns expressed by the late P.V. Doyle. The <i>Evening Press</i> headline at the time ran: &ldquo;P.V. Doyle sheds 200 workers&rdquo;. About 4,000 jobs had been shed in the west of Ireland, but no newspaper headlines reflected that fact.  These job losses were due largely to the troubles in the North, because of which English and <Col N="330" /> Scottish visitors, and many from other parts of the world, were reluctant to visit the Border counties.  We lost our tourist industry because of that.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have the courage to take the initiative in restructuring Bord Fáilte.  He should clean out the company's structures at Baggot Street Bridge which are costing the taxpayer a massive amount of money.  It is like sending a 40-ton vehicle to deliver a 2 lb. package; it is not on and nobody believes in it.  Firing money after them is money down the drain because they will deliver nothing.</P>
    <P>The current arrangement whereby the International Fund for Ireland is administered by Bord Fáilte is throwing money into a black hole, and I can prove it beyond doubt.  The International Fund for Ireland is given substantial money, thanks to the American people, the American President and the American Government.  They recognised that the tourist industry in Ireland should be developed, but they chose the wrong vehicle.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister why the Government is not providing funding for regional tourism structures.  Regional tourism has been in place for many years but with no funding other than to pay the wages.  There is a regional tourism office in Sligo with an excellent director, Dan O'Neill.  There is a suboffice in Letterkenny and an excellent person, Denis Doyle, but there is no money.  There is enough to attend festivals and appear on platforms, but not a pound to give to a single project.  It is laughable.</P>
    <P>No country in the world would run such a system unless they were out of touch.  One might think it would exist in the Soviet Union, where they do not have the structures, proper Government or any real administration in parts of the country.  In a small country like Ireland with 3 million to 3.5 million people, it is unbelievable that we set up and continue to support and pay for structures for regional tourism and yet give them no function.  I do not understand.  Does the Minister not trust them?  The people <Col N="331" /> who give the Government or Bord Fáilte funding have to trust the Government and the people in it.  If it is worth keeping regional tourism in place, it should be given funding and allowed do its job.</P>
    <P>We listen to much talk &mdash; the Minister must have heard it himself, coming from the west &mdash; about bottom up approaches, community involvement and western development.  They are all clichés, slogans and pious platitudes. There are regional tourism organisations in the country with potential, knowledge and personnel, but the Minister is not giving them a pound of funding other than to pay their wages and the light.  I do not understand it; I am mystified.  There is no funding for regional tourism, the Border region, the county enterprise boards, western development, Leader and cross Border organisations.  The National Roads Authority has no funding for the west of Ireland and County Donegal.  The national development plan totally excluded the west of Ireland and the Border counties.</P>
    <P>The IFI and Bord Fáilte have pooled their funding, and that in my book is enough to pay for the continuation of Bord Fáilte, which is a totally ineffective organisation.  I am anxious for the opportunity to put this on the record of the House.  I am not on a political bandwagon. I said the exact same thing to Deputy McCreevy.  I am sorry to say it did not get through and I wasted my breath.  The Minister is like a passenger on a bus; he is going with the system.</P>
    <P>I look at some of the structures and the eight subregions in the country.  I would like to direct the Minister's attention to a photograph which I will give to him.  That subregion covers Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth and it is about 150 miles around that circuit from Moville to County Louth.  That structure is not manageable at all and the Minister knows it.  County Louth and County Dublin are beside each other.  The people who decided on those divisions were people in an office <Col N="332" /> in Dublin who had never travelled the region.  Even if the Minister was to provide money for regional development, those divisions are unmanageable, but they are not cut in stone.  I ask the Minister to change the structures and to give some funding to regional organisations which promote tourism.  If he does that he will be recognised as a Minister who knows what he is about, whose intentions are clearly to promote and support the development of tourism.  The fact that no other industry can compete with the tourism industry in terms of potential for job creation cannot be disputed.</P>
    <P>We have nearly 30 overseas offices promoting tourism, all of them of a very high standard.  That is a sheer waste of money.  When the former Taoiseach opened Ireland House in New York, it brought together five major organisations, including CTT, Bord Fáilte and the IDA.  I thought then that we had recognised how to put our business on a proper footing.  Ireland House was the first such office.  The present Taoiseach has since opened one in Tokyo. Whether or not I am eloquent in presenting my case, I have no speech written out&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is very eloquent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister. I know that I am sincere and that those who expect the tourism industry to help them support what I say.  If I do not make a good enough case then I accept that I am less than adequate.  I have a gut feeling that the Minister will not be successful.  I say that not because of any lack of confidence in him, but because he has to fight the system and he does not have sufficient funding to support the tourist industry and to undertake the major overhaul that is so necessary and so long overdue.  The Minister who takes his courage in his hands and restructures the administrative section in the tourism industry will do the tourism industry a favour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have examined the industry in my own county.  Some of my very good <Col N="333" /> friends, like the McEniffs, have done a tremendous job, but only about five or six big players benefit.  Even the soft loans or the interest free funding that was made available to ICC meant that only those who were clients of a certain accountant were in the front line.  The ordinary people have never benefited from any of that funding because the small player is not considered.  The operator must be large enough to convince Stokes Kennedy Crowley or have somebody who has handled his business previously who can present his case.  If the operator is not in that league he is not going anywhere.</P>
    <P>Every aspect of the structure supporting tourism must be dismantled.  The Minister's speech was interesting.  I am particularly pleased that the Minister has decided not to farm out certain tasks.  I hope that legislation permitting the Minister to select an outside body to carry out examinations is never passed. I will strongly oppose such legislation if it is introduced in this House.  Although the group that was mentioned had a Donegal base, I will strongly oppose any private structure carrying out assessments on standards of accommodation. There are personnel and structures within the Department and there is no necessity for the Minister to farm out the assessment responsibility to private individuals.  That course of action would be fraught with danger and would not be accepted.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to examine all the agencies supporting the tourist industry. I received a paper two weeks ago called &ldquo;European Community Action Plan to assist Tourism, 1995&rdquo;.  There is one cover sheet for proposals.  This is confusing. It indicates that the EU will give direct support for the tourism industry. I have another letter that was received by a man who has a major restaurant at the entrance to County Donegal.  Incidentally, I welcome the benefits of the peace process for normal trade and traffic.  The man was offered some funding for his car park.  The International Fund for Ireland wrote: &ldquo;I am writing to inform you that the International Fund <Col N="334" /> for Ireland has decided in principle to assist by up to £9,450 in respect of proposed external environmental improvement works on your car park adjoining your restaurant.&rdquo;  However, the restaurant was converted from an old building and it has a tin roof.  Nobody will give him one penny to carry out work on the roof.  Nobody will give him an application form to improve his restaurant. That proves the point that we are badly organised.</P>
    <P>I could stand here until 9 a.m. tomorrow morning and plead with the Minister to put structures in place that will help the small individual operator and that will create jobs in a business that does not depend on the stock exchanges of London, Tokyo or anywhere else.  We have the potential to create jobs in this industry.  It is up to the Minister and others to get our act together.  I appeal to the Minister not to tinker superficially by spending an extra couple of million pounds here and there and accepting compliments for doing so.  He should not leave the regional tourism boards in a position where they must shrug their shoulders and say they are unable to help because they have no funding.</P>
    <P>I have plenty of information on this issue but I ask the Minister to do two things.  First, he must concentrate on foreign selling through the one stop shop as much as possible.  Second, he must look at the possibility of reorganising an unworkable regional tourism pattern and restructure Bord Fáilte.  The day the Minister does that he will regain the confidence of those who are prepared to join him in developing the country's tourist industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister on his first visit to the House.  I welcome him for a number of reasons.  First, I welcome him because of the subject we are discussing today.  The Minister is from the western seaboard, like myself and Senator McGowan.  He recognises the importance of the industry to that region.  One of his first actions on assuming the office of Minister was to <Col N="335" /> put in place the pilot renewal scheme for traditional seaside resorts.  He indicated from the beginning his understanding of the needs of the industry and its importance to the economy of the country, particularly to the economy of the western region.</P>
      <P>I wish to comment on Senator McGowan's contribution.  It might seem strange, but I do not disagree to a great extent with Senator McGowan.  He has given an indication of the frustration felt by many people involved in the industry. He has called, among other things, for the replacement of Bord Fáilte.  He has called for the establishment of new structures.  Frankly, an argument can be made for both.  However, I do not agree with him on that point today.  The timespan he mentioned is a little too short. Nevertheless, the issues he raised and the proposals he made are matters that may well have to be faced within the lifetime of the present Government.</P>
      <P>Before we try taking the drastic steps proposed by Senator McGowan we should, as the Minister said, establish a new Bord Fáilte with a new directive to concentrate on its core function of marketing and promotion.  Its work over the next year should be performance tested. In addition, a new element should be included &mdash; and if there is one weakness in the Bill it is that this element is missing &mdash; to provide for accountability by Bord Fáilte to the industry itself.  That accountability is not there and has not been there.  Senator McGowan spoke about Bord Fáilte being contented and too long on the job.  I agree with him to a certain extent.  Indeed, I would go further.  In dealing with Bord Fáilte I have encountered an unacceptable level of smugness in many people at the top of that organisation.  It is time that was removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that he intends to introduce more widespread and structured legislation on tourism. There must be proper accountability, not only to the Department and the Cabinet but also to the industry, which is so dependent on promotion and marketing. <Col N="336" /> There is no such accountability at present, nor has there been.  Indeed, in view of the attitude I have found within the organisation, there is no intention of providing it unless it is compelled to do so.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister stated: &ldquo;...it is clear that the Irish tourism industry has grown up and matured in recent years and that it is now willing and able to take on more responsibility for its own development.&rdquo;  We are rapidly approaching the point where the industry itself should be given the responsibility and the funding to carry out its own promotion and marketing. There are people in the industry doing a successful job who make criticisms of SFADCo which are similar to those I have made of Bord Fáilte.  They tell me that such organisations are only in the way and that they would do the job several times better if they were provided with their funding.  It is an argument which must be considered.  I accept the Minister's argument that the industry has matured and I suggest that it has matured almost to the point where it is in a position to take on this responsibility very successfully.  The vast sums being sucked in by organisations such as Bord Fáilte and SFADCo for the promotion of tourism should be looked at to see if better value can be obtained under a different system.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the purpose of the Bill is to contract out certain functions from Bord Fáilte to enable it to concentrate on its core activity, which is the marketing and promotion of the industry. There is no doubt that Bord Fáilte has done valuable work in the past, certainly in its early days, and has contributed to the existing very good range of products in the industry.  There is a widespread range of accommodation available from the top of the market to the very modest.  While the product and accommodation will always continue to improve to meet the demands of competition, we are seriously lacking in the area of the promotion and marketing of the product.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="337" /> Senator McGowan mentioned that there are a number of organisations involved in promotion, some of them with few or no resources; in my own region there are Bord Fáilte and SFADCo.  With regard to the promotion of tourism, I ask the Minister to spell out the precise relationship between Bord Fáilte and SFADCo.  Where are the demarcation lines?  Where do they complement one another?  Where do they overlap, if at all?  In addition, there is Aer Lingus, which is involved in tourism promotion in the USA, and the regional tourism organisations.  There is also an input from Leader and the county enterprise boards on various other aspects of the product.  Given this multiplicity of organisations involved in the industry, there is much to be said for Senator McGowan's argument for a one stop shop.  Many people have made substantial private investments and have taken substantial risks with regard to the provision of facilities and accommodation. They are frustrated at what they perceive to be a failure or a sloppy performance by the organisations charged with the marketing and promotion of the product.</P>
    <P>There is an emerging pattern of an imbalance in tourism growth with regard to the regions.  The most recent figures illustrate that there is a growth in tourism in the Dublin region in excess of 30 per cent.  The increase in the south-eastern region is 18 per cent while it is 1 per cent in the south-west and the mid-west.  There has been a slight growth in the other regions which have benefited from the peace process.</P>
    <P>By and large, the growth in tourism in recent times has taken place along the eastern seaboard.  We have lost potential tourism from along the western seaboard to the east coast.  A number of factors have contributed to this.  In the first instance, the figures prove that the decision by the USA air carriers to fly directly to Dublin has worked to the disadvantage of the mid-west, the western seaboard in general and the south-west. The fears expressed prior to the decision made in 1993 to allow for direct <Col N="338" /> flights to Dublin have, therefore, been confirmed.  Second, given the fare structure of Aer Lingus, it is four times more expensive to fly from London to Shannon than from London to Dublin.  In view of this, a substantial number of tourists from the USA now avail of low cost flights to London, then fly London to Dublin and stay along the east coast. There is a need, therefore, to examine the attitude by Aer Lingus to its flight costs from London and other parts of the UK to Shannon and to airports along the west coast.</P>
    <P>I do not begrudge the increased tourism that has come to Dublin and the east coast but we should recognise that this has arisen because of a number of factors, some of which I have mentioned, and that there is, therefore, a need to ensure that there is a corresponding growth and development along the more deprived regions of the west.  I ask the Minister to consider how this serious imbalance can be adjusted. I do not suggest that it be addressed by shifting those visiting the east coast to the west, rather that more people be encouraged to visit the west and expand the industry by so doing.</P>
    <P>I have asked the Minister to indicate to me, within a reasonable time, the precise role of SFADCo in the promotion of tourism.  In the annual report of the company, the chief executive outlines the position of marketing the tourism product and promoting the Shannon region under four or five different headings. No breakdown of how this is done or the cost is provided in the balance sheet of the annual report.  It is covered under one heading &mdash; Industrial and Tourism Promotion.  The amount stated under this heading is £7.434 million.  It does not say how much goes to tourism and how much goes to industry.  Therefore, in fairness to the tourism industry in the mid-west, I would like the precise role, the amount spent and the value obtained to be stated.</P>
    <P>I recently attended a meeting of the Clare Tourism Council with other Members of the Oireachtas.  We were told, in no uncertain terms, that the <Col N="339" /> indications within the past two weeks are that they are having a disastrous tourism season and the bookings situation is frightening.  Representatives of Shannon Development were present at that meeting.  Their response to a particular query in relation to marketing was that it is not their function.  It is a function for Shannon Marketing.  We now have a new quango on the scene with which few of us are familiar.  Not alone are we unfamiliar with the precise function in relation to the recent promotion of Shannon Marketing but there is an opportunity to pass the buck.  The observation I made about the need to ensure that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Senator mean marketing of Shannon Airport or marketing of the Shannon region?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>Shannon Development stated it is not their responsibility, it is the responsibility of Shannon Marketing. I am aware that Shannon Marketing relates to the airport.  What I am concerned about is the agility of people to avail of an opportunity to pass the buck. The comments I made about the need to ensure that Bord Fáilte is accountable to the tourism industry are made with equal force in relation to Shannon Development having a responsibility and being accountable to the tourism industry in the region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned the fact that the tourism figures for the mid-west and the south-west have shown growth of 1 per cent. Senator McGowan mentioned a hotelier in his area.  In the area of north Clare we are fortunate to have a man from Senator McGowan's county &mdash; they would not have shared the same political persuasion &mdash; Mr. Jim White, a former Member of the Lower House.  The White Hotel Group in Lisdoonvarna has accommodation for 500 people.  Mr. White carries out his own marketing.  At present he has 500 Austrians per night staying in his hotels for a period of six weeks from mid-May to the end of this month.  The same 500 bedrooms were <Col N="340" /> occupied from the St. Patrick's Day weekend to the middle of May by British tourists.  They will be filled with the normal influx of tourists during July and August.  During September and October, Mr. White will fill those rooms from sources on the continent.</P>
    <P>Much concentration has been placed on the tourism market in the United States.  Mr. White tried that market but later abandoned it.  He did so because only 5 per cent to 10 per cent of the population of the United States holds a passport and only 10 per cent of US citizens have ever travelled outside their native state.  Mr. White says that the opportunities for growth there are too restricted.  This is the practical experience of somebody on the ground, successfully marketing his own product.  If that is Mr. White's experience we must ask why our tourism bodies are concentrating so much on the American market. Mr. White transferred his marketing operation to Europe and the UK about five years ago and he fills his 500 bed-nights during the season from these two markets.  To use the jargon of the tourism bodies, he is responsible for providing in excess of 100,000 bednights per year in Lisdoonvarna.  If that figure were excluded there would be a minus percentage of tourists who visited the mid-west rather than 1 per cent growth.</P>
    <P>I have a certain concern about the operation of contractors in the licensing of restaurants under the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988.  I am satisfied with the Minister's comments that responsibility will rest with him, and through him, to set the standards and regulations in association with Bord Fáilte.  I welcome his comments on the monitoring of the performance of contractors and to regularly review that performance.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to the Overseas Tourism Marketing Initiative.  The Minister has stated that the Government is providing £4 million for the OTMI this year; when the contribution in respect of Northern Ireland is included the total amount available is £6.5 million.  It is an initiative between the Government and <Col N="341" /> the private sector.  Concern was expressed some years ago, when the initiative was being put in place, that this money was not being made available to Bord Fáilte.  The Minister provided a very convincing argument why it should not go through that channel and why it should be used in a separate way.  The comments made at that time, and the justification put forward for taking that particular route, are finding a certain echo in this House today.  The concerns that were beginning to emerge at that stage have since grown unmistakably. I welcome the initiative the Minister has taken in restructuring Bord Fáilte because there is a need to put in place a method of continuous performance testing and accountability of the industry.</P>
    <P>The peace process was mentioned and the country is thankfully enjoying the benefit of it in terms of tourism, etc. Perhaps this has not spread to my own area as effectively as it has to the Border counties.  I recently attended a conference in Cavan.  That county, with due respect, is coming from a low base in the tourism stakes but it is benefiting from the peace process.  Their optimism, on the basis of forward bookings, is one bright speck on the horizon.  I am sure the same is true of Donegal and possibly Sligo, we are all benefiting to a certain degree.  I am happy to say that there is an equal flow of tourists from this part of the island to the North also.</P>
    <P>I want to refer in passing to EU funds which are mainly available for facilities and upgrading the product.  We have a good product and we must continue to upgrade it.  There is little point in having that product unless it is effectively marketed and sold overseas to attract tourists to Ireland.</P>
    <P>I want to refer a certain matter I raised last week; I was told later that a number of my colleagues did not understand what I was talking about.  I will spell it out in more detail because the relevant Minister is present.  We all recognise the importance of the tourism industry to the our economy.  The <Col N="342" /> United Kingdom is our nearest market. There are many ties between the two populations and there is enormous potential in that market.  For that reason, I unreservedly condemn notices that have appeared in certain outlets saying &ldquo;No sterling accepted&rdquo;.  I think it reflects a damaging and small-minded anti-British attitude.  I have never seen a notice saying &ldquo;No dollars accepted&rdquo;. There is no problem where the dollar is concerned.</P>
    <P>I am in the retail business and I accept sterling without question.  The people who spend it on my premises are good and valued customers and I welcome their custom.  I have been paying at face value.  I changed sterling last week and my loss was 3.7 per cent.  For the business I received, I am quite happy to give that discount to the people concerned and they appreciated it.  I know that because of certain political developments in the UK the exchange rate has moved a little since then.  On checking it this morning, the cost of changing sterling into punts is still less than 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>I remember a heated debate here many years ago when I first came into the Seanad.  I was in Opposition at the time and certain Senators, who were in Government, talked of notices displayed in certain guesthouses in the UK which read &ldquo;No Irish wanted&rdquo;.  Now, we are effectively saying that through the narrow retailers who are putting up these notices.  I want the Minister to investigate whether there is an opportunity under our present anti-discrimination laws to ensure these notices come down.</P>
    <P>Another angle on this is that the people to whom I spoke, and whose sterling I accepted at face value, told me that the night before they were charged 10 per cent in a hotel to change sterling. That is a rip-off and should be denounced.</P>
    <P>The message is simple.  We are saying to people from the UK &mdash; we are saying it through these retailers who display these notices &mdash; that we do not want them and their sterling.  That message is <Col N="343" /> damaging to our country; it is damaging to the enterprise, risk and the efforts of the many individuals in the industry who have built it up and made it attractive to tourists from the UK.  It is damaging to the industry and to the peace process because through these notices we are conveying to the people on the other side of the Border that we do not want them or their sterling.</P>
    <P>This is the beginning of the tourist season and if the Minister or his Department can do anything to get rid of this unacceptable face of discrimination, I ask them to act on it.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to see the Minister here.  I have confidence in his ability, enthusiasm and energy to tackle effectively that which needs to be done for this industry.  In so far as the Bill is a first instalment I welcome it as such but expect more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and his Bill to the House.  I must begin by echoing Senator Howard's last point. I, too, have had experience of this very unfortunate situation regarding notices being put up, reading &ldquo;Sterling not accepted&rdquo;, in an area where I had organised a conference.</P>
      <P>I belong to several international medical organisations.  When we are abroad and the question arises as to where the next conference will be held, you can be sure everyone will look at us.  Organising a conference is a lot of hard work and it is extremely difficult to get out of hosting a conference in Ireland because people are most enthusiastic to come here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I organised a conference in early May in White's Hotel, Wexford, with people from the continent and Britain, and people came down from Northern Ireland too.  We had a banquet in Johnstown Castle, which is a splendid site for a banquet, and the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, attended.  To my horror, some of the people came back to tell me that there were notices on some tills in Wexford which said &ldquo;Sterling not accepted&rdquo;. <Col N="344" /> However, they were polite enough to laugh it off.  This was an appalling thing to see, and not just from the point of view of making tourists feel so unwelcome. I had brought people from Northern Ireland and Great Britain here and we had talked about the peace process at great length and the peace initiatives we could take in regard to health on an all Ireland basis.  To have this sort of thing happen was acutely embarrassing.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister should take this to heart.  He should send some of his officials to make spot checks because it is acutely embarrassing if you are organising hospitality here.  I received praise about the staff in the hotel, the standard of food at the banquet, the kindness of those who organised the walking and riding tours and then the embarrassment to see these notices, especially, as Senator Howard said, as they relate to one currency only.  If no foreign currency was being taken, it might be different but to see signs put up when I had welcomed people off the boat at Rosslare was extremely depressing.  I strongly support what Senator Howard said and hope the Minister will investigate it.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to see the Minister stress the need to promote an all Ireland tourist trade here.  I wish Senator Gordon Wilson was with us today because we had talked about this quite a lot.  I was joking with him last week, telling him that I was at a medical conference in Barcelona recently.  In my weak Italian, I spoke to a Spanish hairdresser who told me that her son came to Ireland three years running to learn English.  Of course, coming from south county Dublin, I had expected her to say he was in Bray, which seems to be full of Spanish students.  &ldquo;No.&rdquo;, she said, &ldquo;He loves Fermanagh.  He always goes to Fermanagh to learn English&rdquo;.  We have a tremendous potential to sell the country on an all Ireland basis.</P>
    <P>I remember Senator Wilson saying he was so pleased to see that the maps of Ireland were now all green.  He really got fed up looking at that desert brown we used designate to Northern Ireland <Col N="345" /> when we were sending out tourist brochures. I think that was most unfortunate.</P>
    <P>I praise the Minister and all those in the background who are trying to make all Ireland holidays acceptable, who are promoting the Giant's Causeway as much as the Lakes of Killarney, and Fermanagh as much as the sunny southeast. This is absolutely essential, not just from a commercial point of view but to aid the peace process.  I am delighted at the number of people from the Republic who tell me they have gone on day trips, or longer trips, to Northern Ireland. They were astonished that they had enjoyed themselves so well and that there was so much to see &mdash; the Glens of Antrim, the Mourne Mountains, Deny, etc.  This aspect of tourism must be encouraged and promoted.</P>
    <P>I know many of the functions of Bord Fáilte are to be removed but I would like to praise it for the work it has done over the years.  They have made an incredible difference in this country, with the Tidy Towns competition, etc. When we travel around Ireland now, we cannot but be filled with pride by the great improvements in the small towns and villages.</P>
    <P>As regards the conference in Wexford, I went there by train and the countryside looked terrific.  Wexford looks splendid.  Wherever you look great improvements have been made.  I hope the Department of the Environment manages to run the Tidy Towns competition as effectively, as enthusiastically and as energetically as Bord Fáilte.  At one stage, there was cutthroat competition to win.  I lived in Killiney before moving into town and Killiney and Ballybrack were competing with Malahide.  People tried to see where the best improvements could be made.  It was not just a case of winning but of making the best improvements.  I hope the Department of the Environment's stewardship of the Tidy Towns competition will be looked at closely.  It has been a splendid success and I hope it will continue.</P>
    <P>One of the Bill's most important <Col N="346" /> innovations is the change in the monitoring of the classification or grading of hotels, guesthouses, holiday hostels, youth hostels, holiday camps, caravan and camping sites, holiday cottages and apartment group schemes.  I have some anxiety about this going to private contractors. I would have preferred had this function remained the responsibility of the State.</P>
    <P>This a licence to print money.  When going abroad the first thing one does with regard to accommodation and sightseeing is to get a holiday guide.  It will have to be monitored very rigorously. One of the guides to Ireland which I read mentioned a restaurant close to here which had been closed for two years.  I also remember seeing a Chinese takeaway not far from here described as a good Chinese restaurant.</P>
    <P>I hope very rigorous monitoring of these contractors is undertaken.  High fees are charged and the various restaurants, hotels and guesthouses are naturally anxious to have as good a grading as possible given to their establishments as it is a key selling point to tourists.  I note the contract can be given for five years only and will be monitored yearly.  I cannot urge the Minister to employ spies, but I hope this will be most carefully monitored.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Minister is to review the criteria for certified restaurants with regard to the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988.  I always have to be careful when discussing this Act in the presence of the many knowledgeable vintners in this House.  The extension of that Act to restaurants has not been a success.  Only about 150 restaurants have taken up the licences which were extended to them because they carry with them strict criteria and are also extremely expensive. One has to put down £6,000 to apply for a licence which extends to a restaurant and about £400 per year for an inspection.</P>
    <P>A sum of £400 is not large for a major restaurant which is open all year. However, it is a great deal of money &mdash; never mind the £6,000 which has to be put down in the first place &mdash; for a small <Col N="347" /> restaurant in a small town or tourist area which is only open three or four months of the year but which hopes to expand and open longer.  My figures may be wrong, but I wonder if it is wise to have the same flat fee for all restaurants. Perhaps the Minister may consider grading the fee.</P>
    <P>There is a lot to be said for making the regulations for pubs which serve food and restaurants which serve drink more equitable.  The regulations seem to be based mainly on monitoring the restaurants more than the pubs.  Many pubs now serve good substantial meals. However, even the regulations regarding lavatories etc. are totally different as between the two.  I suggest the Minister might consider that matter.</P>
    <P>Some regulations only encourage people to break the law, one of which concerns the serving of drink in restaurants on Sundays.  Anyone trying to improve their lunch time trade on Sundays has to stop serving drink at 1 p.m., which is about the time people want to eat and have wine with their meal.  Sunday lunch is quite a celebration for families on the Continent and we will no doubt see increased prosperity under this Government.  I have not heard of any prosecutions in this regard but rather than allow the law to be flouted, which is never a good idea, the Minister might consider extending the regulations so they would be more equitable.</P>
    <P>The National Economic and Social Forum has considered the services industries to be one sector where there is room for expansion.  The restaurant trade is a large employer in the services categories.  Another regulation the Minister might examine is that regarding smoking in restaurants, whereby there have to be smoking and non-smoking areas.  It might be better to have a public policy of no smoking in public places where food is being consumed rather than having restauranteurs divide small premises into smoking and non-smoking areas, which is not satisfactory from their point of view.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="348" /> This Bill is important because there are great opportunities for employment in tourism.  I urge the Minister to further progress the training of people for the tourist industry.  More training is needed in foreign languages, even at a basic level.  One does not have to be a linguist to learn to cater for a tourist's basic requirements.  Proprietors should be encouraged to ensure people in their premises are capable of taking an order-in three or four foreign languages.  They do not have to learn dinner party Italian or how to translate great theses in German, but a basic command of tourist friendly foreign languages.  We should concentrate on the European languages; Japanese is a little more difficult but is not impossible as only a basic level of the language is required.</P>
    <P>More emphasis needs to be put on the training of front of house staff.  We have had a bad attitude towards service as a demeaning activity.  Having visited various establishments abroad, one notices the great pride taken by waiting staff or front of house staff.  I would like to see us develop a natural pride in this regard. One always notices the extraordinary friendliness and helpfulness of people in the tourist industry here, but more training in the services would not go amiss.</P>
    <P>I gather some of the CERT training courses for waiting, for example, are never filled.  CERT could be asked to adopt less rigid entry requirements.  It might sometimes be better accepting people with less high academic qualifications if they have experience in the industry and have shown they are responsive to the needs of tourists.  Age qualifications are also too strict.  People who have gone into the services sector from another industry should be encouraged to go on formal training courses.</P>
    <P>The Minister might encourage CERT to be a little more flexible.  In the universities we have taken in mature students and found them to be among the best students.  Perhaps CERT could also be more flexible in its outlook regarding the trainees who are taken <Col N="349" /> into the service industry.  I wish the Minister good luck with the Bill and, if he does not employ anyone to spy on the contractors, I will be keeping a careful one woman watch as I go around the country, which I do a lot.</P>
    <P>One can stay in historic houses in the &ldquo;hidden Ireland&rdquo; for incredibly little money and have a great time.  Again, I praise the Minister for Finance for having eased the residential property tax burden on owners of such houses, by allowing those that open their houses for bed and breakfast accommodation for a certain length of the year to qualify for tax relief. This has made a huge difference because if one opens a house to the public and no one will come to have a look at it, the security costs are so much greater than the tax advantages one might have and that is an impossible situation.  Therefore, the Minister for Finance is to be commended for that move.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House for the first time and I wish him well with this Bill.  I am pleased that the Minister, as one who comes from the west of Ireland, understands the problems and the hardship of rural areas and that he will be sympathetic to what I have to say.  I will be positive and I will be as brief as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tourism has played an important role in bringing much needed revenue and jobs to this country over the years.  Bord Fáilte Éireann, as the State agency responsible, has done an excellent job. We must always bear in mind, however, that tourism is the greatest growth industry in the country and will continue to be so for many years.  Therefore, it was essential to commission consultants to review the effectiveness of the existing arrangements for the promotion of Ireland as a tourist destination.  It was correct to select consultants from within the country to do this work.  The recruitment of new blood was necessary.  The appointment of a new dynamic marketing director and some staff changes will bring about a new and more vigorous Bord Fáilte.  An attractive voluntary severance package has been made available <Col N="350" /> to the staff and I am pleased that management, unions and staff alike have entered into dialogue in this sensitive area, as no compulsory redundancy is envisaged.  We can see at the moment that there are other areas of commercial Ireland where that position did not prevail. There has been much industrial trouble in recent times.</P>
    <P>Pilot relief schemes for certain resorts are welcome in the many areas which have fallen below international standards. I am pleased to see many resorts in the northwest, west and southwest of Ireland included in these schemes, as employment is not easily found in these parts.  Unlike my colleague.  Senator Howard, I believe that we have the strands and quality of water on the western and southwestern seaboard which can rival anything on the eastern seaboard. Many areas of this island have over the years become household names abroad through the great work of Bord Fáilte.  However, there are many beautiful areas in &ldquo;hidden Ireland&rdquo; which are awaiting funding and marketing.  To do this, we must firstly have a road infrastructure to reach into these areas.  The Minister will be aware of that on the western seaboard.  Co-operation between the Department of the Environment and Bord Fáilte is essential for this to be successful. In my home town of Kanturk, which is the capital of Duhallow and in the constituency of Cork North-West, there has been a decline in population of over 1,500 people over the past ten years. This is of great concern to the residents of the town.</P>
    <P>I have a friend in the barony of Duhallow who has promoted cultural music in the Sliabh Luachra area, which straddles both Cork and Kerry.  In that area, some 300 students of traditional music congregate in his establishment to learn the old tunes, the old styles and to preserve them for future generations. To date, he has not got one brass farthing from any Government agency, cultural or tourist.  Also in that area, we hosted the Eurovision Song Contest in the town of Millstreet, which is 12 miles from Kanturk.  In this small town of <Col N="351" /> Millstreet, for the first time outside of Dublin, we had a marvellous achievement. Recently, at the same venue, we promoted a world boxing title fight &mdash; Eubank <i>v.</i> Collins.  Many scenic and historic areas were shown on Sky Television to promote that area.  In recent years, through track and field and football pitch, many of our sportsmen and sportswomen have been tremendous ambassadors for this island in their activities throughout the world.</P>
    <P>With a stable and trouble-free six counties, this country is poised to receive a large influx of Northern and British tourists as well as the many tourists from mainland Europe, America and Australia.  Given the proper presentation in quality, variety, value for money, impressive training and quality standards in tourism, we will have substantial growth in tourism and those tourists will come back.  The projection of increased overseas revenue of £2,250 million by 1999 can be accomplished, as can the creation of up to 350,000 full time jobs between 1994 and 1999.  The new Bord Fáilte will, through marketing, spread the benefits of tourism to the most populated areas and to the most remote also.  In doing so, many areas suffering from decline and depopulation will benefit.  However, there are those who believe that in promoting rural Ireland we are promoting a reservation image.  We have nothing to hide from our past.  If some mud botháns still exist in Ireland, it is not out of choice.  I thank the Minister for his time and wish him well with the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  This is the first occasion on which I have had the opportunity of addressing the Minister in a debate and I wish him every success with his portfolio. It also affords me an opportunity to pay tribute to his father, the late <Col N="352" /> Deputy Henry Kenny, who as the then Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance in the early 1970s was the first Minister to provide funding for a survey of the Lough Allen canal.  This ultimately led to the reopening of two thirds of that canal in 1973.  Sadly, Deputy Kenny did not live long enough to be present for the official reopening of the canal, which has contributed significantly to the economic well-being of my home town of Drumshanbo &mdash; that is only the first time I will mention Drumshanbo in this speech.  It is one of life's coincidences that Deputy Enda Kenny, the son of the late Henry, should be Minister for Tourism and Trade in the year that the remaining portion of the Lough Allen canal will be reopened and so provide uninterrupted access for the entire length of the Shannon waterway and allow both visitors and residents alike a first opportunity in over 60 years to sample the scenic delights of one of County Leitrim's and Ireland's most impressive lakes.</P>
      <P>I note the Minister referred in his contribution to angling tourism and the funds that will be provided under the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-1999.  It affords me an opportunity to highlight a difficulty which has arisen between the Lough Allen angling club and a number of State agencies in relation to funding.  County Leitrim boasts some of the finest coarse fishing lakes in Europe, yet it is difficult to gain access to them.  I am sure the Minister is aware of such lakes in County Mayo and throughout the west and I am sure you, Sir, know some in County Kerry. Lack of funding from local authorities means that these lakes are only accessible because of the goodwill of local farmers who have provided stiles, gates and pathways in an altruistic way, without monetary compensation.  Many fishing lakes in rural Ireland would continue to be inaccessible but for their goodwill and far sightedness.  However, it is still difficult to gain access to a substantial number of these lakes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that the fishery boards, in conjunction with local authorities, are <Col N="353" /> doing what they can in this regard. Before this operational programme was put in place, angling tourism was never acknowledged in its own right as a contributory factor in the tourist economy. The inclusion of this sum of money under a specific heading means that I and my contemporaries in rural Ireland, who know that the development of our coarse fishing lakes will make a significant contribution to the local economy, will now be pressing hard for this money to be spent as quickly as possible and trying to ensure that more funding is made available under this heading. When the Minister's colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy E. Fitzgerald, was the Minister of State at the Department of Finance under the last Administration, she acknowledged that angling tourism had a significant impact on job creation.  The Government now acknowledges that angling tourism will make a significant contribution to the tourist economy.</P>
    <P>The local angling association in Drumshanbo, which has a keen interest in ensuring the development of Lough Alien and other lakes as fishing lakes, in conjunction with the Shannon Fisheries Board, submitted a development plan for a number of our premier lakes in County Leitrim, including Lough Allen, which was referred to as the jewel in the crown.  These lakes form the basis for the initial development of proper coarse fishing facilities in our area and were included in the Shannon Fisheries Board development plan which was submitted to the Department of the Marine. However, no decision has yet been taken on the allocation of funds to the various fisheries boards.</P>
    <P>I would be grateful if the Minister would address the issue of funding for angling tourism, as it applies to his brief. I appreciate that this issue covers two Departments and that the bulk of the money is being administered through the Department of the Marine, in conjunction with Bord Fáilte and the fisheries boards.  I am not trying to put the <Col N="354" /> Minister on the spot; he is the only Minister in the Administration who has a special interest in this area.  While he is not responsible for the bulk of the funding which will be expended under the operational programme for angling tourism, the fact that he refers to it in his speech and that it impacts on his wider brief as Minister for Tourism and Trade means that he has more than a passing interest in ensuring that this element of the tourist package is proceeded with as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I raise this issue because it is causing frustration in my area and I am sure the same is happening throughout the country. I appreciate that these matters move slowly, but the Shannon Fisheries Board and the Northern Fisheries Board, which impacts on part of my county &mdash; I can only speak for them &mdash; have fishery development programmes which include specific considerations as regards access.  I re-emphasise that there is no point having premier coarse fishing lakes in this country if people cannot reach them or if they have to climb across three stiles and walk through four fields and six meadows to get to them.</P>
    <P>Angling tourism, like other forms of tourism, is a highly competitive area and fishermen and women have easy access to continental fishing lakes.  Air travel to the Continent costs less from England than it does from here.  The vast bulk of our coarse fishing industry depends on the anglers, who constitute the majority of visitors to this country.  This vital component should not and cannot be underestimated in the development of angling resources in this country.  I hope the Minister forgives me for singling out this issue which impacts on his wider brief.  Perhaps he is now more aware of the difficulties in this area.  I hope the money is released and that the development plans, as agreed by the various fisheries boards, can be implemented.</P>
    <P>I agree that the activities of Bord Fáilte should be subject to review.  It is also important to put on record my acknowledgement of the outstanding contribution made by employees of Bord Fáilte since its inception in building <Col N="355" /> up Ireland as a premier tourist destination. The Minister said that for the first time in 1994 the number of overseas visitors exceeded the size of the domestic population.  Seven or eight years ago an article in <i>The Economist</i> on tourism referred to the fact that it would be a great achievement for a country if it could attract double its population.  We are fast moving in that direction.</P>
    <P>It is important to address the impact which the increasing number of visitors will have on Ireland as a tourist destination. I am sure the Minister is already looking at the warning signals as a result of the experience of other tourist destinations. Increased tourist traffic in a number of tourist destinations means they are now almost off limits and they are no longer an attraction because of the huge numbers who visit them.  We have not reached that point yet.  County Kerry, where Senator Fitzgerald comes from, is, traditionally, the premier tourist destination in this country.  I am sure the people of Killarney would not like me to suggest that fewer people should visit their lovely town and district, but Killarney is an example of what may happen throughout Ireland in the future.  The various flagship tourist destinations in this country are now attracting increasing numbers of people.</P>
    <P>The Minister's cultural, historical and physical background means that he will be more than anxious to ensure that the allocation of funding for the development of tourist facilities will be done on a nationwide basis rather than focusing on those areas which are already attracting visitors.  One could read that as a coded message for more money for the west.  In acknowledging Bord Fáilte for building up Ireland as a premier tourist destination, I welcome the statistics announced by the Minister which prove that tourism is a major contributor to the Irish economy.  I hope that continues for a long time.</P>
    <P>My late father, Senator Joseph Mary Mooney, had a lifelong devotion to <Col N="356" /> developing our tourism resources, especially in County Leitrim.  Consequently, I was aware from a very young age of the importance of tourism as a product and the necessity to develop our natural assets, such as our friendliness to visitors and our rich cultural and historical heritage.  It was no surprise that, when Bord Fáilte initiated the concept of An Tóstal in 1953, my father became honorary secretary of the Drumshanbo An Tóstal Council.</P>
    <P>An Tóstal &mdash;&ldquo;Ireland at Home&rdquo;&mdash; was an immediate success.  Although the name changed, it was an indication of my father's commitment to the original concept that, at the time of his death in 1988, Drumshanbo was and remains the only centre in Ireland to hoist the unique An Tóstal maroon and gold flag with its distinctive harp logo.</P>
    <P>Although An Tóstal councils no longer exist, with the exception of Drumshanbo, the ideas generated in those far off days have come to fruition with the outstanding success of events such as the festival of Kerry, which incorporates the Rose of Tralee contest, the Wexford Opera Festival, the Dundalk Maytime Festival, the Letterkenny Folk Festival and the Galway Oyster Festival.  The list goes on and on.  Many such events owe their existence to the creative energy unleashed by Bord Fáilte as far back as 1953.</P>
    <P>It is salutary to reflect on this point. We sometimes think that marketing. merchandising, logos, brand names and product identification are phenomena of the modern age.  However, as far back as the late 1940s and the early 1950s there were dedicated public servants in Government, and subsequently within the Bord Fáilte organisation. who saw the potential of Ireland as a tourist destination highlighting and emphasising our natural assets rather than imposing an outside culture.</P>
    <P>The whole concept of An Tóstal and the slogan &ldquo;Ireland at Home&rdquo; was to portray an island at peace and at rest with itself, which people could visit and see us as we really are and not as we think we should be.  It is due to this <Col N="357" /> natural inclination to hold on to the traditional aspects of our character that Ireland is now such a popular place to visit.  We are different; we are unique. There is diversity in our uniqueness and we should not tamper with the natural and national perception of Ireland and its assets &mdash; its friendliness and its cultural and historical heritage &mdash; within that diversity.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the updating of the hotel and bed and breakfast registrations procedures, I am surprised by the appointment of a Welsh based firm of consultants to carry it out.  I fully accept the Minister has followed proper EU directive procedures in recommending this company but I could not help feeling a certain amount of sympathy for another jurisdiction when I heard a little Englander referring to the sovereignty of his country and that he did not want any outside influences.  I could not help but reflect on whether we would have ended up with a Welsh company if we did not have to comply with the EU directive on competing tenders from across Europe.  However, this is a matter of conjecture.</P>
    <P>I have nothing against this company; I do not know who they are and I do not wish to give the impression that I am reflecting on their ability in any way. However, I was amused by the involvement of a non-Irish company in assessing the quality of Irish tourism. We may not have led the world in this area but our Welsh friends will have learned much more from us about how to market the tourism product than we ever learned from them.  I will be interested to hear about and monitor the development of this particular company. As the Minister pointed out, the company will be setting up an Irish subsidiary which will employ local labour. Despite the fact that the company is Welsh, it appears the operation will be run by Irish people.  I wish them well. This is an important development and I am sure the Minister will report on its progress as it develops.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister address the scourge of unregistered bed and breakfast <Col N="358" /> accommodation?  I refer to it as a scourge because I believe this is the case.  I accept it may not be a popular view because such activities provide valuable income for cash strapped families, who may have a spare room which they wish to use for bed and breakfast accommodation.  I do not suggest a witch hunt in this area, but it is grossly unfair to registered bed and breakfast owners who undertake the registration process, adhere to all the criteria laid down at considerable cost and then pay tax on the income generated.  Yet, they must compete with unregistered, fly by night operators in, usually, a small town or geographic area where there is intense competition for the tourist numbers involved.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister agree it is unfair that such unregistered bed and breakfast houses can, with impunity and without any responsibility in terms of developing Ireland as a tourist product, put up and take down their signs whenever it suits them, charge less than the agreed rate among registered owners and in many cases provide questionable standards of accommodation and food which can have such a damaging impact on our tourism image?  This is an old chestnut and reasons are put forward for it not to be stamped out but the Minster, even in his short time in office, will have borne the wrath of the existing organisations in this area, the town and country homes which offer bed and breakfast and Bord Fáilte who has been lobbying strongly for Government action in this area.</P>
    <P>I do not know how it can be stamped out and I am not sure it should be totally eradicated.  However, if the Minister who is charged with responsibility for developing this country as a premier tourist destination is putting forward various elements of a tourism package, this area should not be ignored.  It is not fair that people should decide, if they are going on holidays, that they will not provide accommodation for others.</P>
    <P>I must declare a vested interest in this matter.  My widowed mother relies to a great extent on registered bed and <Col N="359" /> breakfast accommodation to provide her with an income in her old age.  She is put in the position of having to compete with unregistered bed and breakfast operators in an area which is trying very hard to attract more visitors.  It is not Killarney or Galway, where there are countless numbers of people coming to the area and it does not really matter. This issue should be addressed in some way and there should be some form of registration.  Some sort of sanction should be placed on people who wish to go into this area rather than the current position where there do not appear to be any regulations.</P>
    <P>What are the Revenue Commissioners doing about this?  This question arises across the board; for example, it came up last week in the context of drug dealing.  Perhaps the Revenue Commissioners should be checking with the Motor Registration Office to see what size cars the drug dealers are using despite having no visible means of income.  The same might be applied to the lifestyles of people who own unregistered bed and breakfast accommodation.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Minister indicated that the increase in funding from £18 million to £22 million this year will include the financing of signposting and tourist information offices.  These are vital ingredients in the overall tourist package, as the Minister acknowledges. Although my local authority has an excellent record in signposting despite its limited resources &mdash; I am sure my colleague.  Senator Reynolds, would endorse this point &mdash; the Minister has a role in ensuring that a specific sum of money is set aside each year for local authorities, especially in rural counties where population levels are low, to upgrade their signposting policies.</P>
    <P>The Minister rightly placed great stress on the employment potential of the Irish tourism industry.  However, since the creation of the county enterprise boards, which were set up specifically to create local employment, I have become aware that their policy <Col N="360" /> guidelines do not allow them to grant aid tourism projects unless a specific job creation element is involved.  I refer to promotional activities which do not have a direct job creation element but which would have a downstream impact. For example, if a county, or an individual, decides to promote their area, surely the eventual impact of this exercise is increased tourist numbers which, in turn, provide jobs to service this increase.  The Minister should consult his colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, and review the guidelines in this context.</P>
    <P>I welcome the initiative which will seek to develop a specific brand for Ireland as a tourist destination and I hope it will not be narrowly focused. Ireland means different things to different people and I hope due recognition will be given to the enormous contribution made by Irish entertainers, such as Daniel O'Donnell, U2, the Cranberries and the collective talents embodied in the wonderful cultural organisation, Comhaltas Ceoltoirí Éireann, which has done more to attract visitors to Ireland than perhaps is acknowledged.  Entertainers of international status should be harnessed more effectively to sell Ireland, something which they are already doing in a voluntary capacity. The contribution made by Irish football supporters abroad in identifying Ireland as a fun place to spend a holiday should not be underestimated and Bord Fáilte is to be complimented in identifying Irish supporters as a valuable conduit during their visit to America for the World Cup last year.</P>
    <P>My last point relates to the renewal scheme for coastal resorts, an initiative taken by the Minister which I wholeheartedly endorse.  The Minister stated that this scheme is complementary to the urban renewal scheme.  I ask him to consider introducing a similar scheme for small inland towns and villages and identifiable tourism areas with particular reference to the west in a line from Dublin to Galway.  Falling population, poor infrastructure and the war in Northern Ireland have all contributed to <Col N="361" /> a decline in tourist activity in an area that few will disagree holds some of the most beautiful parts of Europe.  These areas &mdash; my own County Leitrim is an example &mdash; do not have the financial resources or the seed capital necessary to develop tourist services without some form of State aid.  The Government would receive the lasting thanks of the people of County Leitrim and the west if it would develop schemes complementary to the existing Leader programme and other rural development initiatives which have done so much in recent years to lift morale and provide jobs for the people of the west.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to you, Sir, for indulging me and I wish the Minister well.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome the provisions in the Bill updating the registration and grading of our tourist accommodation and giving an independent company the power to adjudicate. The role that Bord Fáilte has played for the last number of years in the development of our tourism industry has been very significant, but it has been too diverse.  The proper road to take at this stage would be to allow it to specialise in the development and growth of our tourism industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="362" /> I know that counties like Meath do not have a strong tourism identity but there are individuals in this House who are working strongly to ensure that it is put on the tourist map over the next number of years.  I hope the Minister, after he has looked after the west, and Counties Mayo and Leitrim in particular, will consider giving special incentives to tourists to visit County Meath. Some parts of that county are disadvantaged and I have no doubt Senator Farrelly will put that point across more than adequately.</P>
    <P>I now wish to refer to the independent company that will be set up to grade tourist accommodation.  Senator Mooney called unregistered accommodation the scourge of the tourism industry and, to some extent, I would agree with him.  However, Bord Fáilte may have played a role in the mushrooming of many of these unregistered accommodations. For example, an individual in my county built a house costing in the region of £90,000 but was not allowed to register it because it had an extra door in the kitchen.  That person has since started up an unregistered B and B and is doing tremendous business.  Bord Fáilte was not willing to take into consideration other facilities that were available.  If that has happened once, I assume it has happened numerous times around the country.</P>
    <P>While it is extremely important to have strict guidelines and first class accommodation, if there is no leeway in the criteria to help people to overcome these problems there will be a mushrooming of unregistered accommodation. This new body will have to take this issue on as a priority because it is very important.  B and Bs will have to register for VAT.  If there is a mushrooming of unregistered B and Bs, they would be unfair competition for the registered operators.  I have no doubt that this independent body will look into all these issues and have them rectified.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte could play a huge role in marketing this country.  It has done so over a long number of years but when <Col N="363" /> it is just given a specific criterion, it will do a good and worthwhile job.  There is huge potential for an increase in tourist numbers over the next few years and Bord Fáilte will play a large part in helping to develop, socially and economically, certain areas in this country.</P>
    <P>For example, £35 million was spent on the Shannon-Erne link, the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal, and it has been a tremendous success.  As somebody who comes from Ballinamore, I cannot give enough credit to the organisations and institutions that have been involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the, Senator includes Charlie Haughey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I always said that. However, Fianna Fáil got rid of him when Mr. Haughey gave money to County Leitrim.</P>
      <P>The reason I gave the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal as an example, and I hope Senator Mooney will support me on this, is that a pilot marketing scheme was set up there for three years; it will finish next March.  The role that Terry McGovern and his staff have played in bringing such a large number of tourists to the area deserves to be mentioned and I thank them for the role they have played.  Before that, Ballinamore and parts of County Leitrim were not seen as major tourist attractions.  Over the last two years we have seen the growth in the development of the area.  The amount of financial support that has been given to this scheme was tremendous and one can see the social and economic development of the towns.  I have no doubt that the opening up of the Drumshanbo canal to allow Lough Alien to become navigable will also have a tremendous effect on that area. It is taking a little longer than we anticipated but hopefully we will see the cruisers there shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also welcome the increase in the capital programme from £18 million to £22 million.  The only comment I would make here &mdash; I assume the Minster has taken this into consideration in this Bill <Col N="364" />&mdash; would be about the amount of bureaucracy that people or companies applying for projects have to go through before their project was accepted or they got financial assistance.  It took a long time because the Department, Bord Fáilte and other agencies were involved.  It is important to streamline this scheme.  Last week Senator Mooney had the House adjourned because of the objection made by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins, to a proposed Masonite plant in County Leitrim and the visual impact it would have on the River Shannon.  I raise this matter because the Minister rightly suggested that Leitrim has a tremendous role to play in the promotion of tourism.  As my colleague, Senator Mooney, suggested, the Minister should give serious consideration to Leitrim being included as a pilot scheme for special tax incentives so that we would be able to get the Masonite jobs as well as employing more people due to the county's extra tourism potential.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There were no by-elections then.  I wish the Minister every success in his portfolio.  I am extremely happy with the direction he is taking at present.  I would not be as complimentary about Bord Fáilte over the years. Nevertheless, I must recognise that they did an amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill does two things.  It increases the amount of money from £18 million <Col N="365" /> to £22 million and gives the supervising and grading of hotels, guest houses and so on to another agency.  Where did Bord Fáilte go wrong over the years? Some 20 to 25 years after Bord Fáilte was established we are still sending people out to bring tourists to Ireland. After that length of time one would think that the whole world would know about us.</P>
    <P>I was very disappointed one night in Dingle when a group of newspaper reporters from Europe visited on the invitation of Bord Fáilte.  I was talking to some of them and asked how they got as far as Dingle.  They told me that Bord Fáilte had been nominated the best tourist board in Europe that year.  It was a surprise to me and I said I had not realised we were that good.  I asked them how they would rate Bord Fáilte and they answered that it throws the best parties and that is why it was nominated the best tourist organisation in Europe.  That is not the way to sell Ireland.</P>
    <P>I hope that things will change a little after the restructuring of Bord Fáilte. The organisation needs to buck up and it will receive warnings.  Like everything else, it is not just Bord Fáilte's fault.  The hotels, guest houses and others involved in tourism do not complain when they have genuine complaints about Bord Fáilte.  It is up to people to complain to the Minister and he will take action. There is too much hush hush and whispering and nobody knows what is happening.</P>
    <P>I had a gripe with Bord Fáilte.  I had to contradict Senator Mooney when he was talking about unapproved guest houses.  In 1972 we applied to be registered with Bord Fáilte and in February of that year a lady from Bord Fáilte visited us.  I had a new house with four bedrooms.  There was no <i>en suite</i> at that time but there was hot and cold water in every room and carpets on the floor. I had a good house, but she complained about everything under the sun, including the absence of ashtrays, glasses and towels from the rooms.  I said: &ldquo;For God's sake, this is February.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="366" /> The same year houses in the town were passed and had the Bord Fáilte sign on their windows, but they had only an outside toilet.  I got cranky and told the lady to leave.  I did not join Bord Fáilte until two years ago.  I cocked my nose over that incident.  Another great restaurant and guest house in the town left Bord Fáilte because of disagreements over little things.  One cannot go to Dingle, Mayo or anywhere else and check a person's house in the middle of February.  The time to check is now when we are in business.  A spot check should be done at this time of the year.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte are losing out because they are not allowing the small operator or guest house to be registered.  I would contradict Senator Mooney again when he said that a person with one or two bedrooms is operating illegally.  They are not operating illegally because they cannot join Bord Fáilte.  One has to have either three or four bedrooms before one can join.  People, including my neighbours, have been turned down, not because there was anything wrong with the house but because they did not have enough bedrooms.  The new organisation, Family Homes of Ireland, has signs all over the country and they are more plentiful than the Bord Fáilte shamrock signs.  I suppose any sign of approval is better than no sign.</P>
    <P>People say there is something special in Kerry, Dingle and Killarney.  Maybe there is, but any part of Ireland which is properly sold, managed and looked after can be the same as Killarney, Dingle or anywhere else.</P>

      <P>It was full because of an angling competition.  I rang each of the three bed and breakfasts and they were full.  How can people go there if there is no accommodation?  One has to get going in this area.  If there is anything special in Kerry it is that the people involved in tourism in Killarney over the years promoted Kerry.</P>
      <P>One can travel up the west coast of Ireland and find that Clare is a beautiful county.  Galway is a beautiful county, although it is fairly good for tourism. Mayo is also a beautiful county and all people need to do is get out and sell it. Rather than Bord Fáilte doing all the selling, there is a lot to be said for giving a little money to local organisations and telling them to sell themselves.  That might be the answer.  Where will the £22 million be spent?  In his speech the Minister said that the money will provide tourist offices and signposting.  If £5 million was spent on tourist offices this year 50 could be built, that is two for every county.  If £1 million worth of signposts were erected they would be all over the place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>That figure is only an increase in the limit which can be spent over the period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That money also covers the running of the tourist information offices, but these offices have their own income as well.  We provide bed and breakfast and we are Bord Fáilte approved as well as being members of other organisations; Bord Fáilte charge a fee.  If two people are charged £30 for a room and they book through Bord Fáilte, the proprietor only gets about £26.  In a town like Dingle they take in a large amount of money <Col N="368" /> this way every day.  Some of the tourist offices are self-sufficient.</P>
      <P>It is very easy to sell Ireland.  Senator Mooney spoke about angling, and that is only one of the many aspects of Ireland that we can sell.  Senator Cashin spoke about our culture, Irish music and archaeology.  Many festivals are run to encourage people to come here.  We must target the European market more. We are targeting the American market too much.  The Americans who come here are pretty big spenders in the craft shops, they bring the dollar with them and take a lot of goods back, but we will attract the American tourists without going overboard to bring them here. Irish Americans come here every couple of years to see the old country and buy the báinín sweater and the cap.  We have not hit the European market.</P>

At the time I told him he was mad, that the worst thing people could do is to holiday at home and if we all stay in Ireland, people around the world will not find out how loveable the Irish are. I have been proved right.  Whenever I go on holidays, people from that area arrive in Dingle a few months later.  I make sure I chat with people wherever I go and suggest that they come to Ireland on holiday.  We should act as ambassadors for our country.</P>

      <P>The idea of staying at home for the holidays is nice.  We will stay at home for our weekends and travel around the country, but we should not tell people to holiday at home.  They will do that anyway.  We should tell people that when they holiday outside the country they should act as ambassadors for this country.  They should sell our country and tell the people what it is like and explain that if people do not support us by coming to Ireland on holidays we might not support them by going abroad.</P>
      <P>The weather does not matter.  Ireland is Ireland, the weather is beautiful now but it does not matter; we should not be selling the weather.  A person who goes to the Swiss Alps expects snow and that the weather will be cold.  A person who goes to Russia expects it to be cold. Information on the weather is included in every brochure.  A person who goes to Crete or the Canaries knows they will get scorched, and that is what happens. We should be honest about the weather and tell visitors to make provision for rain.  With luck, we will have fine weather and if not, too bad.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  Every year we get 3.5 million tourists.  Soon tourism will be our biggest industry, the industry on which we are most dependent.  Sheep subsidies will not last for ever.  We will not continue to receive money from Europe forever.  Fishing quotas have already been imposed on us.  We are at the end of the line.  We have our milk quotas but in 25 years much of that will have changed.  There will be too much land set aside and we will be restricted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should gear ourselves properly for tourism.  The industry should not be active for just a couple of months of the year.  It should be active all year round because people from different parts of the world go on holidays at different times of the year.  In Ireland it is now fashionable to go on holidays in February and March.  Why waste the bit of summer we get?  People go to the <Col N="370" /> Canaries for Christmas, in January or February.  We should encourage people to holiday in Ireland all year round. Already the tourist season has lengthened. It starts at Easter and it used to end about the middle of August but now it lasts well into October.  We need more support from Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>A couple of years ago in Dingle we met four Unionists from Belfast who were collecting money for Concern by sailing around Ireland in a yacht.  I am chairman of the harbour board in Dingle and on my suggestion they were well treated, they were not charged harbour dues and so on.  They stayed for two or three days and collected a handy bit of money for Concern.  When they were going one of them told me he would return the compliment as soon as he could.  One of the men was from Campbell Shipping, a company with offices in Dublin and in Belfast.  As a result of that chance meeting and our being so kind to them in Dingle, for the last two years they have brought luxury cruisers there.  They found it was an ideal place to which to come and this year they have changed the size of their luxury liners so that they can bring them right into the pier.  This is a major boost to the town.  The first year they came they had to stay outside the harbour and passengers were ferried ashore.  They went around Slea Head, did a tour of the town and went back to the boat that night.  Now, the luxury liner is tied up in the pier and they can have a major night out in the town.  They can go to the Skellig, where the Minister was.  I would hate to tell the House where he went.</P>
    <P>This will be a big operation.  Some 150 people will come off the liner and will stay for probably two days.  They will come on a regular basis every fortnight. I say to Senator Howard that the same could happen in Clare.  These people do not want to go to the big cities but like to visit smaller towns around the coast. We intend to follow up this.  An added advantage is that people from Tralee and Killarney will come to see the liner tied up by the pier, which will also result in money being earned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="371" /> I intend to have my boat ready to take people to see Fungi.  The rest of Ireland should learn from the cuteness of the way we operate in Dingle. Senator Howard should come to Dingle for a week to watch the way we operate. I asked somebody what will happen when Fungi dies.  He said even though &ldquo;The Islander&rdquo; is dead for 40 or 50 years and Peig Sayers is dead, the Blasket Islands are more popular now.  He said we will take people out to sea and tell them this is where Fungi was born and used to swim.  We must think of all these tricks.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  We should put down a marker to Bord Fáilte to put up or shut up, because many people are dissatisfied.  I would hate to spell out the grievances they have.  Established tourist areas such as Kerry and Galway are reasonably all right; but we should select several areas around the country, such as Blacksod, and give them grants and incentives to engage in tourism. Established places like Killarney and Dingle should be left alone and some money should be given to other areas to give them a break.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. In the short few months he has been Minister, he has had the opportunity to visit a number of counties and I hope he became aware of a number of problems which are not covered in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will some direction be given to local authorities or to Bord Fáilte about what will be done about unapproved accommodation? Yesterday I received phone calls from two people who provide approved accommodation in my county. For the first time Meath County Council will charge rates on their premises. Heretofore, this may have been the policy in other counties where such businesses have been developed over many years.  Under the law, the county council can charge rates on people who are registered and have Bord Fáilte approved signs.  However, it can do nothing about unapproved people.  A decision to grant second rate approval <Col N="372" /> to these people and to provide money for this is long past time.  People who provide unapproved accommodation should be rated in the same way as those providing approved accommodation. People are deciding to take down their Bord Fáilte signs and opt out of the approval register if they are charged rates.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the Minister's attention to disadvantaged counties which have serious problems in that they do not have enough accommodation. From a meeting the Minister attended some weeks ago in Trim, he knows the Dublin tourist industry is feeding off Meath, Wicklow and Kildare.  These counties have not had the major investment in hotel accommodation which Dublin has had because there is no need for major investors to invest in them.  Is there any possibility that the Minister would ask the Cabinet to consider in the next budget declaring parts of these counties to be disadvantaged and giving incentives to developers to provide badly needed hotel accommodation in these areas?</P>
    <P>I draw the Minister's attention to the overall position of the weaker counties as far as tourism is concerned.  The counties about which Senator Fitzgerald spoke have been depending on tourism for 25 years and have been successful in selling themselves.  Bord Fáilte has done an enormous amount of good work over the years.  However, I do not believe a county can be a real success unless it has an organisation up and running to help it sell itself.  County tourism boards have been set up and have been in operation for a year or two.  I am chairman of the County Meath board.  I ask that in the long term a certain amount of money be made available through Bord Fáilte for these boards to help them develop their own tourism markets.</P>
    <P>I visited holiday fairs this year in Belfast, Dublin, Cork and Galway.  A substantial number of counties were represented, particularly at the Belfast one.  This fair provided an opportunity for individuals to ask about where the counties were as against them being told <Col N="373" /> the counties were in the South.  As a result, there was a substantial number of inquiries and since then a substantial number of visitors visited the counties which were represented and sold their particular strengths as tourist destinations. I believe tourism companies in counties which are not long established as tourist areas will be successful and will attract a substantial number of tourists into Ireland and from Northern Ireland to the South.</P>
    <P>The recent Government decision to include the east coast of County Meath as a designated area for providing incentives for the provision of accommodation is welcome.  I know it will have a great bearing on and will be a flagship for the development of tourism in the county in the coming years.  I hope that as a result of the decision made by Government, a substantial number of people will become involved in developing different products, including accommodation, which will bring more tourists into the region.</P>
    <P>A decision must be taken to deal with the problem of unapproved accommodation and the decision by local authorities looking for extra funds to rate some of the approved accommodation. For as long as I have been in the Houses of the Oireachtas, which is 14 years, every Minister for Tourism has spoken about doing something.  It is not easy and no Government, including that which Senator O'Kennedy was part of, would bring forward a proposal to ban all unapproved accommodation.</P>
    <P>Having looked at this problem and having taken into consideration the amount of unapproved accommodation throughout the country, I believe there should be a second line of approval. Although unapproved accommodation is excluded and no income comes from it, it has benefited from the increase in visitors as a result of efforts made on behalf of approved accommodation by Bord Fáilte and the tourism companies and the money generated by them.  I am not saying that those with approved accommodation are not benefiting.  In many counties the surplus goes to unapproved <Col N="374" /> accommodation.  We are creating a vacuum by leaving this situation.</P>
    <P>As the Minister stated in his speech, 3.68 million people visited last year. More people are visiting because of the excellent work being done by all the agencies, including Bord Fáilte.  The Bord Fáilte manager in England, Margaret Cahill, who is from County Meath, told me that if the Prince of Wales visited Ireland, it would be worth £5 million of advertising.  Lo and behold, this has happened.  I have not been speaking to her since, but I am sure it is much easier to sell Ireland in England than it was heretofore.</P>
    <P>We must deal with the problems on the ground; we should not allow them to fester anymore.  We should allow local authorities, in conjunction with Bord Fáilte, to visit unapproved accommodation and to ask for a certain amount of money to have a second list.  If we do that, tourism companies looking for income to promote County Meath will be able to ask these people for some funds.  A few days ago I had a discussion about this at the tourism company meeting in Meath.  Even those with approved accommodation believe that something should be done because it is costing them more each day.</P>
    <P>Many counties need some incentive for the provision of accommodation. County Meath has 350 bednights while Killarney has 3,500.  This puts the situation into perspective.  We in County Meath must secure investment by major hoteliers with an interest in tourism. However, this will not happen because of the advantage of setting up in Dublin. Neighbouring counties can be visited by coach each day.  We must make an effort in that regard in 1996.  We could justify the reintroduction of the business expansion scheme on a limited basis to see if it would work.</P>
    <P>As regards the provision of tourism offices, I happen to be a member of Midlands East Regional Tourism, which is strapped for cash.  I hope that under the new proposals and with the extra money that will be made available, <Col N="375" /> counties which are only now setting up tourist offices will be given some help from Bord Fáilte or the Department through the Midlands East Regional Tourism to help them to get started and to provide a needed base for the tourism services.  I listened with interest to the Minister on the &ldquo;Pat Kenny Show&rdquo; yesterday morning.  People who asked questions had the same problems which I outlined.  In any county, town or village, we find tourists who are not familiar with the area asking the same type of questions.  All they want is a friendly reply.  An unlimited service should be available at tourist offices helped by Bord Fáilte, especially at this time of the year, in the evening and at weekends so people can receive help and can go about their business.</P>
    <P>The Minister should take on board some of those points because we cannot make progress as a country or as individual counties unless an incentive is given.  We must make a decision on disadvantaged areas as regards accommodation and on the introduction of the BES in counties like Kildare, Wicklow and Meath and other disadvantaged counties where there are few hotel beds. I spent some time over the past 12 months trying to convince major organisations to develop a hotel in County Meath.  Different types of grants are available to those in the Border counties, while Dublin has a wealthy population and people fly directly into Dublin Airport.  Those in between are in no man's land.  That is how investors decide to site their tourism developments.</P>
    <P>Substantial progress has been made in tourism development in many counties over the past few years, especially those with weaker tourism industries.  The extension of the Leader programme to all counties will be a major benefit.  I have seen the results of ADM and the allocation given to Trim Initiative Development a year or two ago.  I have seen the work it was able to achieve and the help it was able to give to tourism projects.  I welcome the extension of <Col N="376" /> that into other areas as we reach the closing date for applications.</P>
    <P>By the year 2000, with those incentives and with the help and decisions which should be considered in these areas, we could have a thriving industry not only along the coast and in the west, but throughout the country.  Counties can help each other.  I am delighted that Meath and Kildare have worked together on some projects.  We have been successful in putting together a few programmes to help develop tourism in both counties.  I look forward to the Minister's response to these requests. Coming from a county which depends largely on tourism, the Minister has an interest in this area.  If we go a little further in the type of development I am talking about, we could achieve a further increase in the number of tourists we can bring into the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister on his first visit to the House.  I also welcome this Bill, whose purpose I enthusiastically support and endorse.  I have a number of reasons for doing so. One is, perhaps, slightly personal.  The Minister has been kind enough to remind me that somewhere in the entrance foyer of the Department of Tourism and Trade there is a portrait of, among others, a young O'Kennedy who happened to be Minister for Transport and Power for a short period of four months between 1972 and 1973.  I do not know if I should wish that the Minister would have the same experience&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>He is there six months now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope his stay in that Department will be longer than mine.  I wish him personally, for many reasons, every success in this Department and in other Departments should the Irish people continue to be slightly misled in their preference for Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an opportunity for all of us to analyse our current priorities.  It is an <Col N="377" /> opportunity to support the direction of the Minister's proposals in so far as he seeks to maximise the effort to attract visitors to our country and to ensure that the contribution to our economy, which has been growing significantly in recent years, will not only be maintained but expanded.  My observations will be based to a large extent on some of the barriers to maximising that potential.</P>
    <P>I have had personal experience of those barriers over the years.  I encountered the first during my short stay in the Department of Transport and Power.  I immediately became conscious of a conflict of interest between Bord Fáilte and Aer Lingus.  The chief executives of both bodies sought to meet me separately and privately with a view to getting their message across.  I told each of them that I would meet them but I did not tell them that it was my intention to meet them together.  I named the same time and the same venue.  Both of them arrived and I was privileged &mdash; if that is the word &mdash; to be, first, a spectator at a dogfight and subsequently a type of referee.  It was quite clear that even in 1972 there were different priorities between the interests representing the promotion of tourism in this economy and the interests representing Aer Lingus and its employees.  Unfortunately, I was not in office long enough &mdash; the Irish people suffer from occasional aberrations in electoral choice and they did so again in 1973 &mdash; and I never had a chance to do what I had intended to do.  However, there are conclusions to be drawn and the Minister is moving in the right direction now.</P>
    <P>We must establish our priorities for the national economy and the contribution that tourism can and, we hope, will make.  That is why I welcome the Minister's proposals.  Our first priority must be to encourage and facilitate access to this country.  Our country is an island that is located some distance from the great population centres, excluding those in England.  It is most important that we make it as easy and as inexpensive as possible for people to visit our <Col N="378" /> country and to get a feeling for our great culture.  I must tell my distinguished colleague, Senator Howard, that I felt like a tourist in the lovely Banner County when I was plying my law trade there at the beginning of the week and afterwards when I travelled to Lahinch and along the coast.</P>
    <P>The culture of this country as one moves from region to region is one of the most stimulating and reassuring experiences one can have.  One can meet the people, talk with them and get a flavour of their values and style.  That is one of the great attractions of Ireland. No effort should be spared to maximise and market that attraction.  The attraction of Ireland is the fact that we have time for people and we want to help them.  I am not saying that we are greater than other people but in normal personal relationships the Irish &mdash; whether one meets them on the road, in a pub, at a hurling or football match or wherever &mdash; are anxious to help and please the visitor.  That is the general response one receives from people who have had the happy privilege of spending their holidays here.</P>
    <P>The first thing we must do to ensure that we maximise that potential is to remove any barriers &mdash; and they exist &mdash; to access to this country.  I can illustrate one or two such barriers from my own experience.  Belgium is not noted for being a golfing Mecca; there are about eight golf courses there.  The Minister, being a golfer, will understand what I mean.  When I was in Brussels, I recall seeing Japanese tourists going from one course to another, getting out of their limousines, bowing to the caddy master and asking if they could play.  In almost all cases the caddy master had to tell them: <i>&ldquo;Non, c'est impossible, c'est tout plein&rdquo;:</i> it is not possible, it is full.  The Japanese would bow and travel to the next course.  Meanwhile, back in Ireland I did not see sight nor light, as they say in the country, of one Japanese.  Mind you, they are slow on the golf course &mdash; one would want to get out there before them.  However, this is an area of huge potential.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="379" /> When I returned I asked the then chief executive of Bord Fáilte about it and I discovered &mdash; and this pattern has existed for years &mdash; that Ireland was the only country whose national flag carrier, Aer Lingus, was not part of what is called a common fare rating from distant locations.  That is unforgivable. Basically, if one were making a long distance booking in Tokyo, Yokohama, Melbourne or Sydney to travel to London, Paris, Berlin or Rome, under the common fare rating one could book to travel onwards to any other country within at least a 500 mile radius and more for the same price.  There was one exception &mdash; one could not book to travel onward to Ireland.  Once the tourist landed in Paris or Brussels or London Aer Lingus was going to have a slice of whatever one had to pay to travel further.  There have been minimal changes in that respect in the meantime but not nearly enough to remove that barrier.</P>
    <P>I have nothing but respect for the thousands of workers employed in Aer Lingus.  However, when one looks at the potential that could be realised one sees that it, as distinct from the protective approach, will actually secure their employment.  I hope the Minister will get the full support of his colleagues &mdash; which I always expressed in Government although I was not involved in that area subsequently &mdash; to open access to this country on every possible occasion through every possible facility.  People will tell one that the rates being charged by Aer Lingus on some of the busiest lines out of Europe are absolutely astronomical. That is not acceptable.  It is not good enough that a company which has a guaranteed market should increase the prices in that market.  There is no justification for that.  I hope that dealing with this issue will not result in restrictions in the future, as was the case in the past.  I am referring to increased fares and special monopoly lines that enable one company to secure itself at the expense of national development.  That is not acceptable in this day and age.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="380" /> I am happy to see Bord Fáilte focusing on marketing.  Believe me, it has a product to sell.  Why do we want to visit other countries?  We want to visit because they are different from what we experience in the normal course of events.  If we do not have the wonderful weather we have at present, we want to feel some heat in our bones.  We want to visit ancient historic sites in other countries such as Greece and Turkey. We want to play golf in different conditions. We want to speak French or Italian if we are interested in that.  We want to sample their wine and cheese. We want to do all the things that are characteristic of those countries and that make us feel we have been in a different place and culture and that we can relax.  We have so much of this that they want to come here.</P>
    <P>Perhaps of all the countries in Europe, Ireland is unique at present in a number of areas.  There are fewer of us, which is perhaps just as well.  A Dutch colleague of mine on the EU Council of Ministers used to tell me that if we lived in Holland we would have been poisoned years ago, whereas it was easy to imagine how the Dutch could have enjoyed themselves if they lived in Ireland.  The only response I could make was that visitors to Ireland would not have enjoyed themselves as much if they were there.  We must protect the precious asset we have in our environment, given that it is such a big factor in what attracts people to Ireland.  Even if the Minister's programme succeeds, Bord Fáilte can only sell the product.  We must ensure that the product is right and that we do nothing to spoil it.</P>
    <P>Visitors do not come here for the weather.  Some visitors will be disappointed today because they came to avail of the bracing Atlantic breeze.  I know some who love Ireland, have written about it and who spend all of their holidays here who think of that beautifully fresh, bracing breeze and the soft mist along the west coast.  This does not attract us.  I do not suggest that tourists will turn us down because of the present weather.  The weather is not a problem, <Col N="381" /> apart from the need for facilities for young people in bad weather.  In this respect Bord Fáilte, together with the other authorities, are doing much to remedy that problem.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other factors we must consider.  If we look at ourselves we will be presented with some problems.  Visitors come here for peace, quiet and relaxation.  They do not want problems of any kind that will cause tension, much less injury or loss.  We must recognise that while it is a problem in many parts of the world, the crime problem in the country and in the cities is serious in terms of tourism.  I know people who are much travelled who have written off more than three quarters of the globe, because they would not put themselves or their families at risk.  Fortunately, despite what we would rightly consider to be serious problems, we are still relatively crime free.  Given the network of smaller communities, villages and towns, with so many other Irish people meeting visitors and advising them accordingly, people know that it is harder to get involved in undercover crime.</P>
    <P>All of the conditions which bring about social problems are part of an overall package which we should consider in terms not only of solving the problems, but of being of vital importance with regard to our national economic development, especially to this industry.  In this respect the attitudes we hold in Ireland are looked to by other countries.  These include our values and our family stability.  Visitors value the feelings of security they derive from Irish homes.  The happiness they feel comes from the Irish people and aspects of society that are different here than in other places.  I do not suggest that others do not have these features also.  For example, because I fortunately speak Italian, there is nothing I enjoy as much as visiting an Italian family and enjoying their food and chat.  <i>Andiamo a casa.</i>  It is a beautiful experience.  They bring one into their homes.  It is special with us also.  We must be conscious that in all our policies we must not allow ourselves <Col N="382" /> to follow the road that has already been proven to give rise, not to predictable but to certain known consequences in other countries.</P>
    <P>In terms of dealing with the crime problem, the approach of Singapore, which I have visited, is one extreme.  It is trouble free and completely clean because it has a very rigid, authoritarian regime.  If one steps across the line one will know about it, even as a tourist. Perhaps there is a case for more intervention on the part of the police authorities, but I do not suggest that it should go quite as far as Singapore. Nevertheless, visitors can go to that country in the confident knowledge that it is safe to do so and that nobody will interfere with their property or money.</P>
    <P>We must be aware that family life in Ireland is a special attraction.  I know this because I have met and worked with people around the world who, when they think of Ireland, think of a happy, stable society and a happy, secure people.  We should, therefore, be very cautious and careful before we change the total direction of our social mores in view of the impact such changes could have on these matters. People do not want to visit this country to experience more of what they know already in their own places.</P>
    <P>Every country has its own culture, and culture is not only language and music.  It is wonderful that Irish music, song and dance and all that expresses our vitality, imagination, unpredictability &mdash; all that expresses the Irish character &mdash; is so much loved and enjoyed all around the world.  Our ambassadors of music and song and our ambassadors in terms of our football supporters &mdash; I was with them, happily, on some occasions &mdash; are irreplaceable. Bord Fáilte is lucky to have this to build on.  People want to visit to experience it on the ground, whether it is in Doolin, Kerry or wherever.  Some time ago, after we played in a football match in Stuttgart, I heard a Dub on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; say that the Government should subsidise the soccer supporters as they were doing more for tourism <Col N="383" /> than anybody else.  He went on to remark that if they were subsidised there would be flocks of visitors to the country.  Everybody laughed, but he was right.</P>
    <P>After we were beaten in the World Cup in Italy I listened to Italian commentators on their radio and television because I know, love and speak the language. The fact that Italy won the match by a freak goal against us made us even happier.  That evening every commentator spoke of <i>questo sportive Irlandesi</i>, these wonderful, sporting Irish, these happy Irish.  They then realised that I was one of the Irish and I made a contribution on a radio chat show.  The participation of Ireland in the World Cup in Italy made a huge impact on that country.  It led to the growth in the number of Italian tourists to Ireland.  When they visit us they can relax because they find that we are somewhat like them. This is a great compliment because they are a wonderfully civilised people.  They do not move in droves or on package holidays.  They are also big spenders.  It is often said of the Milanese that <i>i piu grandiosi d'Europa,</i> they are the big spenders of Europe.  They are wealthy and they spend their wealth.  We should continue to acknowledge the way in which Ireland has been promoted by our soccer supporters.</P>
    <P>Promotion by word of mouth is, in itself, perhaps more important than anything else.  When visitors return to their countries they promote for us and become our sales representatives.  In this respect, if the product is not right we have the responsibility to rectify some aspects.  An example is the pollution on our lakes and rivers.  It is regrettable that the farm pollution grants have been suspended.  This is a retrograde step and I can see the effects on my beloved Lough Derg.  The anglers have moved to the Minister's area.  He must be pleased about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister would not want anglers to visit his area at the expense of Lough Derg.  We are allowing the precious asset of water quality to be polluted.  It is the responsibility both of local authorities and of Government.  The process did not begin with the present Government.  Hopefully, in whatever review takes place we will make it clear that we will ensure that these precious assets will be preserved for everybody to enjoy.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I want to pay tribute to Bord Fáilte for what they have achieved.  I do not always agree with them in some areas.  I note they will no longer be dealing directly with &ldquo;Tidy Towns&rdquo;.  I hope someone else will assume that responsibility and the responsibility for standards and grading which Bord Fáilte has fulfilled in the past.  The growth of tourism to 7 per cent of an increased GNP in 1993 is only the beginning.  The potential in this area is enormous with the peace process underway.  I wish the Minister nothing but good luck.  Jack Lynch used to say that the important thing in politics is to be at the right corner of the right street at the right time.  Deputy Kenny is at that corner at the right time.  With that wind behind him he will probably go through more Ministeries and enjoy more success than I have since 1972.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators have made quite a number of contributions in relation to the Bill.  The points raised were also raised by members of the public and during the course of the Dáil debate.  I will deal with these points as best I can.</P>
      <P>I believe I told Senator O'Kennedy that his picture does adorn the long hallway in the Department of Tourism and Trade, which used to be the Department of Transport and Power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>It hangs at centre stage. The Senator made a number of very relevant <Col N="385" /> points.  I want to refer in particular to the issue of crime and the fact that the product should be right.  The Senator raised seven or eight serious points in this regard.</P>
      <P>The recent case of Catriona McCormack, the Australian girl who was attacked in Galway, was a completely isolated and very unfortunate incident. She received a large number of stitches in a wound suffered during an attack.  I have dealt with this in the Dáil at some length by way of parliamentary questions. We have given the Victim Support Group in Dublin £10,000 to continue their work.  They have received assistance from Dublin Tourism and a number of other bodies.  Ms McCormack herself stated that a person could travel in many countries where this might happen.  The fact is that the ratio is about one to 150,000 of visitors to Ireland who actually experience a crime involving violence.  There are other cases where petty crime, theft and bag snatching take place.</P>
      <P>We cannot stress strongly enough, in promoting Ireland abroad, that tourists must be careful when they visit this country because we are competing with other countries where the standard and rate of crime is much higher than in Ireland.  People should take reasonable precautions wherever they travel.  If they visit a city like Dublin they should take the normal precautions they would take in any other city in the world of similar size.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McGowan was very critical of the role of Bord Fáilte.  I do not share many of his views.  It is fair to say that Bord Fáilte, like any other organisation, has had its weaknesses and failings, but it has also had a great many strengths throughout the years.  The whole thrust of this change in legislation is to give effect to building on the strength and foundation that Bord Fáilte has and to allow it to address its fundamental core function, which is to market Ireland internationally.  I agree with those who said that we are at a critical time in the development of our tourism industry.  It <Col N="386" /> is an area of great potential and one with which I am very happy to be associated. I share the Senator's view that anything we do should be done in terms of quality.  That thread should run through everything which applies to the tourism industry &mdash; on the fringes, in the centre or in whatever capacity.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan also referred to the increased statutory limit from £18 million to £22 million under the Bill.  This is an enabling provision and refers to capital purposes only.  It does not refer to accomodation or Bord Fáilte's administrative expenditure which is covered under another heading and another Vote.  It covers capital expenditure by the regional tourism organisations for tourist information offices, etc.</P>
    <P>I share the Senator's view about the importance of the regional tourism offices and organisations.  I recently met the chairmen and managers of the RTOs and we had a long and interesting conversation.  I took careful note of the points raised and concerns expressed.  I would love to have sufficient funds to provide money for every project they mentioned.  The reality is that funds are always limited.  I must stress again that quality applications will be supported because that is the kind of tourism we want.  I have no intention of turning this country into a destination for mass tourism or one large theme park.  We are concerned with promoting Ireland to as many discerning, quality tourists as possible who value the country for what it is by coming here.  I announced at that meeting that I was making a special allocation of £50,000 this year to assist with the marketing work of the county tourism committees.  These committees had no funding at all and were merely a voice in the wilderness.  While it is not a great amount of money, it is a recognition of the experience that many people have had.  It will allow them to carry out some small works in that capacity.</P>
    <P>The regional tourism organisations have an important role in the allocation of European Union funds under the Tourism 2000 Operational Programme. All product development applications <Col N="387" /> are filtered through the regional tourism organisations, who make recommendations to Bord Fáilte for funding.  It is important that Senators and people in general understand that applications for all product developments are structured through the regional tourism organisations and then go to Bord Fáilte for evaluation.  They are finally determined by an independent product management board with an independent chairman. There are £370 million of European Union grants available under that programme to a whole range of activities from marketing to training to additional tourist attractions and facilities.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that assistance for smaller projects is often provided through the county enterprise boards and the Leader projects.  If people look at any of the Leader reports they will see a range of activities under crafts, community development, etc., that have been assisted to varying degrees by the Leader boards.  Senators will also be aware of the loan subsidy schemes and tax incentives, such as the pilot renewal scheme for resort towns mentioned by Senator Howard.  It is fair to say that there is not much life around many of our traditional seaside resorts on a wet October day.  The intention in this pilot scheme is to allow local initiative and local investment to flourish and to improve the quality of shopfronts, the bed accomodation base, toilets and the general look and quality of what is on offer in many of these places.  They will, therefore, present that quality product to which Senator O'Kennedy referred.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard spoke about accountability to the industry by Bord Fáilte.  The Senator is quite correct in his view on this issue.  Accountability is one of the hallmarks of what we are attempting to do.</P>
    <P>One of the central elements in the ADL report was to bring about a change in the culture of Bord Fáilte. The Senator spoke about smugness, aloofness, etc.  I suppose in any organisation that has been in existence for a great number of years, this perception <Col N="388" /> can come about.  The change envisaged here has resulted in up to 70 personnel accepting the voluntary severance package. I am making everybody aware that a new Bord Fáilte is now in place.  It is leaner, more determined, it has a more concentrated focus and its activities do not cover the broad range of issues in which it was unnecessary for the board to become involved.  That was the reason for the change in emphasis and the change, through legislation, allowing the board to subcontract out those unnecessary elements of its work, such as the initial stages of inspection and so on.</P>
    <P>I thank the director, the chairman, the board and the staff for being patient in respect of these changes but, essentially, the message I want to send out about Bord Fáilte is that there is a new regime in place.  There is an awareness that Bord Fáilte has a newer, more relevant, more focused job to do.  That is why we appointed an international marketing director with a superb track record in product marketing.  We will be giving him assistance through the appointment of experienced marketing people to help sell our country abroad.  It will then be a matter for the regional tourist organisations and the industry.  Tourists are not going to come here unless they know about the place and understand its qualities, value and the friendliness of which Senator Fitzgerald and Senator Howard spoke.</P>
    <P>I strongly believe in working closely with the industry.  It is for that reason that I chair the National Tourism Council. This a body of voluntary people who are involved across the broad range of the industry together with the director general and the chairman of Bord Fáilte and representatives from my Department. The group has a very good working relationship and if people in the tourism industry are concerned, it can bring those matters to my attention as Minister and as chairman, to the attention of my officials and Bord Fáilte.  All matters relevant to the ADL report were discussed at the National Tourism Council at considerable length and <Col N="389" /> members of that council have the opportunity to discuss any concerns they might have with Bord Fáilte, myself and the Department.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard also rightly mentioned the perception abroad that certain areas of the country are doing better or worse than others.  The Dublin area is growing very quickly in terms of being a location for weekend breaks, short holidays and second holidays, particularly for Britain.  In that context, for a variety of reasons it has replaced France &mdash; and Paris &mdash; for weekend breaks and weekend occasions.</P>
    <P>I will give some of the figures in respect of 1994 so that Senators will have an idea of the regional spread of tourism.  For instance, 1.768 million tourists visited the Dublin area in 1994; in the south-west, there were 1.071 million; the mid-west had 807,000 tourists; the west had 902,000 tourists and the north-west had 498,000.  For other areas outside Dublin the total was over 3.278 million tourists.  The figures to May 1995 are up by 17 per cent, in other words, there are more visitors this year than last. One of the reasons this perception is abroad is that areas that traditionally did not market themselves are now providing a greater range of facilities and locations to visiting tourists.  This is healthy competition because the more discerning visitors come here, the more locations they have to visit and the broader the appeal of Ireland and its people.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy spoke of the value of the Irish personality and character and its attraction to foreign visitors.  As Senator Fitzgerald pointed out, you can have sunshine and scenery in any country &mdash; the weather we have had for the last ten days has been a God given bonus.  Ireland ranks No. 9 in European travellers' order of priorities but it ranks No. 1 in terms of non-sun destinations.  The majority of our visitors do not come for the sunshine but for a variety of other reasons; 80 per cent want to involve themselves with Irish culture, the people, the tradition and the language.  If we are blessed with fine weather on top of that, it is a bonus.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="390" /> Senator Henry spoke about the promotion of all Ireland holidays.  We are very proud of building on the foundation of the peace process.  I have had a number of meetings with my colleague, the Minister for Economic Development in Northern Ireland, Baroness Denton, and there is now a very close working relationship between the two tourist boards &mdash; Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.  In fact, I had the pleasure of inviting the chief executive of the NITB to the United States for the St. Patrick's Day celebrations this year and the NITB is also a full partner in the Overseas Tourism Marketing Initiative.  If Senators saw the picture postcards shown during the intervals of the Eurovision Song Contest, they would have noted that several parts of Northern Ireland were also shown in that presentation to the 300 million viewers.</P>
    <P>British Airways sent out 1.5 million brochures of the island of Ireland, north and south, this year to 750,000 of their consumers in North America and 32,000 travel agents.  In terms of access, BA flies 600,000 people from California to Great Britain every year.  Many of these people have never heard of Ireland. One of our problems has been that we have assumed everybody knows about us when, in fact, they do not, but many more of them will know about Ireland from now on.</P>
    <P>President Clinton's trade and investment initiative and his call to corporate America to invest in Ireland, because it is a good commercially viable place in which to invest, followed by the internationally recognised visit of His Royal Highness.  Prince Charles &mdash; and the fact that he was welcomed and that it was safe to come here &mdash; will have an impact on the average English person who might not have wanted to come here over the past 25 years.  That will now change and the British market will be more important to us as a result.</P>
    <P>We are spending £6.3 million marketing Ireland overseas and I do not want anybody to run away with the idea that all this marketing is going into North <Col N="391" /> America.  That is not the case.  Our biggest market is Great Britain.  We will get over 2 million visitors from Britain this year; we will exceed 1 million visitors from continental Europe and, for the first time ever, we will get 500,000 visitors or more from North America. The remainder will come from other countries.  It is fair to say Bord Fáilte is acutely aware of the market on which we should concentrate and this is being done.</P>
    <P>I was also glad to hear Senator Henry's remarks on restaurant licences.  In the context of the review of standards in respect of certified restaurants I will have her claim examined.  She also mentioned the Tidy Towns competition. Since the Department of the Environment has taken responsibility for the competition, there has been an increased number of applications to participate. This is of importance to us all. Local authorities are now investing in upgrading approaches to small towns and villages and there is an awareness of a greater community spirit and a pride in our rural areas, counties and regions.</P>
    <P>The litter problem has been a concern of mine over the years.  It requires not only assistance from local authorities but it is a matter of personal pride.  I would appeal to every parent of every school child in the country to encourage them to bring their rubbish home with them from wherever they go.  This country belongs to everybody.  It will be here long after us and it behoves us all to see that we leave this place in as good if not better condition than we found it.</P>
    <P>The Tidy Towns competition fits in well with the responsibilities of the Department of the Environment in terms of the protection of the environment and the anti-litter campaign.  I am convinced this competition will go from strength to strength.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney referred to the tourist numbers.  I do not want to turn Ireland into a mass tourism destination. We value everybody who comes here and it is important that every visitor <Col N="392" /> would be well treated and given VIP standing as valued personalities.  I commend Senator Howard for losing on the transaction in the changing of money from sterling.  I am sure the visitors enjoyed the hospitality of his hostelry for some considerable time.</P>
    <P>Under the operational programme there are a number of grant incentives which are targeted to encourage a greater spread and diversity of tourists, in other words, there is no intention on the part of Bord Fáilte or the industry to attempt to bring tourists or visitors to one location only.  We would like to see them spread over as many areas as possible and avail of as many diverse tourist attractions as possible.</P>
    <P>I note Senator Henry's remarks in respect of the registration and grading contractor.  Senator Mooney also mentioned his concerns in this regard.  The tendering procedure was absolutely above board and open.  I assure the House it will be of prime importance that a quality product, quality management systems and an efficient professional operation be put in place.  That will be done.</P>
    <P>There is a clause whereby Bord Fáilte can review the performance on a yearly basis, withdraw it if necessary and the contract is for a five year period.  I do not expect that to happen.  A first class, &ldquo;red hot&rdquo; system of inspections and gradings will be put in place.  Senators should also note there is no change in the appeals mechanism.  If an inspection in respect of grading or classification takes place under the new subcontractor and the recommendation is that the premises be deregistered, an appeals system is set in motion and Bord Fáilte retains the final say in that appeal.  In that context, no changes are being introduced under this legislation.</P>
    <P>The tourist industry need have no fears in that what is involved here is the initial inspection process by the subcontractor. If, following that process, in the opinion of the board the premises should be deregistered, it is a matter under the appeals system for Bord Fáilte and, ultimately, the board of Bord <Col N="393" /> Fáilte to make the final decision.  This happens in very few cases.  I hope the trend will be in the other direction and everybody involved in this business would understand that it is now the third most important industry in Ireland.  It is growing in importance; it employs 90,000 people and it is one of the foundations for the strength of our economy in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>A number of points were made in respect of unapproved accommodation and the unapproved bed and breakfast sector.  A number of Governments have attempted over the years to deal with this matter and it cannot be dealt with by compulsion or mandatory licence.  In many cases bed and breakfasts do not come into operation until families are reared, children have left home and spare rooms are available.  They may then be used when social events, football matches or rock concerts, take place in the vicinity and accommodation is needed.  In that context, bed and breakfasts may come into operation.</P>
    <P>I have made it clear on a number of occasions that I do not propose to introduce a compulsory licence system.  We would all like to have in place a system where everybody operates in a fair environment.  Under the new specially designated tourist resorts scheme, where unapproved bed and breakfasts are operating and the proprietors wish to avail of the tax incentives, they may do so on becoming registered.  Such encouragement and coaxing is better than sending somebody on false pretences to book in for the night, check if their stay and payment was registered and, if not, report it to the Revenue Commissioners.  In many cases such bed and breakfasts might only operate for two or three weeks in the summer or on particular occasions.</P>
    <P>Taking all those factors into account mandatory policing is not the best approach.  My bottom line is that I would like to see these people encouraged to move into the registered sector so they can be part of the official brochures and marketing and, in respect of <Col N="394" /> the designated areas, so they can avail of the tax incentives.</P>
    <P>I note the good case Senator Reynolds made with regard to bed and breakfast standards.  I do not want to lower the standards because quality is of critical importance.  However, I will be carrying out a review of the regulations and I will examine the point he made about doors in some of these houses.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald raised concerns about the bed and breakfast standards and told us of his involvement in this area in 1972.  I hope he has done well since then.  He referred to the minimum number of rooms.  I will look at that in the review of regulations and standards we are carrying out.  He also spoke about the need to attract continental visitors and I agree with him.  This year we expect to have over a million visitors from continental Europe as distinct from Great Britain.  This is the first time we will pass the one million mark.</P>
    <P>He rightly referred to our musicians, sports people and everybody else who is an ambassador for Ireland, all of whom have a part to play.  They create a perception and awareness of Ireland's unique character.  If we travel to any of the continental countries and visit the Irish public houses, we see that young people in particular are very attracted to Irish culture, music and traditions. The phenomenon of Riverdance, which has taken off internationally, is an expression of something we have had for hundreds of years but is presented in a very modern way.  It is a presentation of our personality and the kind of people we are.  It is not just a fine piece of music and dance but an expression of Irishness with which people wish to be associated.</P>
    <P>With regard to what Senator O'Kennedy said, it is the people who make up our quality tourism.  We are not trying to market a manufactured business where people say they have come to Ireland and &ldquo;done that&rdquo;.  When visitors leaving the country are asked what they remember about Ireland, they say their involvement with the people.  I share the Senator's view in that respect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="395" /> Senator O'Kennedy referred to access to Ireland.  Obviously, as an island, a visitor can come to Ireland only by air or by sea.  I have had discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, in respect of access and capacity on the north Atlantic air route.  We are sensitive to the position of Shannon as regards access to the west and midwest. I used the occasion of President Clinton's Washington conference some weeks ago to make clear that if airlines in the United States are interested in providing scheduled flights into Ireland, we would be prepared to encourage that and discuss the issue with them as a Government.  Of course, it is possible to have any amount of charter flights into Ireland and, in that context, this year there are 184,000 charter flight seats available from Europe into Ireland, as against 137,000 seats last year.  Many of these are flying into Farranfore, Galway, Knock and to other places where they would not traditionally have flown. That is to be encouraged because it gets more quality tourists into the regions where they can go walking, orienteering, engage in equestrian sports or cruise on the Shannon.  All these are important.</P>
    <P>I respect Senator O'Kennedy's view on the promotion of golf holidays in Ireland in Japan and other countries.  It should be noted that the perception of golf has changed radically in the last number of years.  It is no longer a sport for the elite but is becoming a leisure activity for everybody.  We have 250 golf courses in Ireland and we have invested more than £200 million in this sport in the last ten years.  This level of investment is continuing.  My target to the end of 1999 is to increase the number of golfing visitors from 170,000 to 300,000 per annum.  At present, these people spend about £60 million a year, which is important for our economy, and that will increase.  There are a number of specialist operators moving into the business of branding Irish golf in a big way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="396" /> Many people tend to forget that we are internationally recognised as having four or five of the best links golf courses in the world.  The difference between our courses and those in America is that one can play all the Irish courses.  None of them is so exclusive that the average punter cannot play.  While that happens in other countries, it does not happen here.  It is now possible for Americans and other international visitors to prebook their golfing holidays, North and South; this did not apply previously.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the intense interest of the Japanese and sporting people in golf but the problem is that we are so far from Japan.  The Japanese ethos is that they take five days holidays in the year and one has to structure packages around that.  It takes about 14 hours to fly here and the same amount of time going home and the holiday package has to be structured around a short time. Japanese businesses which have been established in Ireland for a number of years know the value of what we have and, to a limited extent, they bring their visitors here.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy also mentioned access in respect of common rating.  This is an important concept in that, when booking a flight from an international location to London or wherever, one should get to Ireland for the same price. This is important and we have made some progress in this area.  The common rating programme was extended to flights from Australia.  British Airways and Qantas Airways have done this since 1988 and it has now been extended to Cathay Pacific, Singapore Airlines, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Air France.  In addition, Qantas common rate Cork and Shannon Airports from Australia.  For instance, if one is flying from Australia by any of those airlines, it is possible to fly to Cork and Shannon for the same price.  We have already begun talks with Gulf Air and South African Airlines on common rating and this year we hope to extend this to other areas in south-east Asia such as Hong Kong and Singapore.  In the US market, a special arrangement with British Airways <Col N="397" /> and CIÉ Tours to market Ireland over London has resulted in British Airways including Ireland in its US brochures &mdash; I referred to this already &mdash; as a holiday destination from 17 US gateways.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald mentioned the cruise liner business.  I recently had cause to go to Waterford on the arrival of the fiftieth cruise liner there &mdash; the <i>Maasdam</i>&mdash; which is the tenth biggest ship of its type in the world and carries 1,200 passengers, 900 of whom disembarked that day and went on a variety of quality day tours to the Waterford Crystal factory and to engage in other leisure activities.  Their average spend was quite high; and it is expected to have 40 cruise liners docking there next year and we want to build on that.  This area has huge potential.  These cruise liners operate in northern and southern Europe and people can embark at various locations.  It was through the initiative of two local people in Waterford that this began some years ago and it has shown enormous potential and great growth.  There is to be significant investment to build a proper and exclusive landing pier in Waterford to cater for these massive liners.  That is an area in which others can get involved.</P>
    <P>In respect of brand Ireland, the international marketing director of Bord Fáilte is looking at building on the initial consultant's report.  Ireland means something different to everybody. By trying to draw a thread through all these different opinions, we are trying to present the country in a modern, realistic and practical light.</P>
    <P>That deals with most of the points raised by the Senators.  I thank them for the interest.  My target for the tourism industry is to create a further 35,000 jobs by the end of 1999, which will bring about a total spend of about £2.25 billion per year and would involve the employment of 120,000 people on a permanent basis.  This is only one of a range of policies being put in place to support the continued development of tourism in Ireland and I know it will have the support of all sides of the House in this regard.  I advise people in the industry to take up the words of many of the <Col N="398" /> Senators.  If there are complaints, there is a procedure for dealing with them, either through the regional tourist offices, through Bord Fáilte directly or through my Department.  It is my responsibility as Minister for Tourism and Transport to lay down policy guidelines for tourism.  I want the industry to respond to that.  I want to ensure that genuine visitors to our country are not being ripped off or getting services of inferior quality.  That is not the market we are in.  We are looking for top quality visitors and they, in turn, deserve top quality service and a top quality range of facilities.  In so far as we can assist through the judicious expenditure of European Union funds, that is my aim. I know Senators understand and fully support that.</P>

      <P>Section 2 deals with the power of the board to contract out its inspection and associated functions. The board is Bord Fáilte and letters have been circulating that the Town and Country Homes Association is more than likely the body with which the board will enter into a contract.  There are charges to register with Bord Fáilte. When dealing with the power of the board, will the board or the Minister have the power to monitor the charges?</P>

      <P>The other day I spoke to a person in County Kerry who owns a three or four bedroom house and who is involved in the tourism industry.  He <Col N="399" /> said it was becoming more expensive each year to be part of that industry.  For example, because he is registered with Bord Fáilte, he must pay approximately £300 water charges, which is different from other counties.  Ordinary water charges are approximately £60, but because he is registered with Bord Fáilte he must pay £300.  My own bill is only a few pounds short of £300, which is a high charge.  In addition, guest-houses also pay high refuse charges.  The person to whom I spoke had to pay almost £3,000 before he opened his door to guests.  This is a lot of money to pay at the beginning of the year.  One must also pay Bord Fáilte approximately £300 to be included in <i>Town and Country Homes Association.</i>  Will the Minister or Bord Fáilte &mdash; I would prefer the Minister to do this &mdash; monitor these charges in case they get out of hand?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he will inspect the criteria for various categories, particularly the intoxicating liquor licences for restaurants.  Under the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, an establishment must have space for 50 people, apart from the restaurant, and toilet facilities.  Few hotels and pubs have such accommodation unless they are very big.  The playing pitch is not level in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people, particularly those on bus tours, have a good breakfast, but they like a snack in the middle of the day and a big meal in their hotel at night.  Others like a sandwich and a glass of beer.  Restaurants which have a wine licence can give people a glass of wine, but they cannot give them a glass of beer.  Most restaurants do not want a full licence because it causes too much trouble.  I know what it is like to work in a bar.  As an old bar man once said to me, one would think they were drinking sauce.  Restaurants now supply Kaliber, which is a non-intoxicating drink. Licences should include beer and wine. This would not affect the pub business, but it would help small restaurants who cater for bus loads of tourists, and they <Col N="400" /> provide employment.  We seem to gear everything towards big business.  Visitors do not come to Ireland for the weather but to meet people.  That is why they like to stop in small villages in rural areas where they can meet the local people and go into local pubs.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister is setting up a new agency because it is difficult to know what Bord Fáilte is doing.  Perhaps he could clarify when he will examine the criteria and amend this legislation to level the playing pitch because every pub now serves food and restaurants are suffering.  This is unfair competition.  I am not advocating a full licence for restaurants but they should be able to sell beer and wine.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the provision to allow contractors to carry out inspections, perhaps the Minister could allay our concerns that this is a brain-wave of former Bord Fáilte employees who now see themselves in a new role. People are concerned that this is another tier of bureaucracy which is controlled by former Bord Fáilte employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>Although we are dealing with contractors and the responsibilities and duties which Bord Fáilte will extend to them, I want to comment on what Senator Farrell said.  When the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, was going through the House we discussed how licences could be given to restaurants. If we accept what Senator Farrell advocated, every chip shop and fast food outlet in the country will be given a licence.  I do not agree with his views and I urge the Minister and the Government to exercise extreme caution in this regard.  The liquor licensing laws will always be reviewed &mdash; I am sure a review will take place in the near future &mdash; but we must ensure that liquor licences are not granted to every food outlet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing with section 2 and the responsibilities and duties of contractors. A number of Senators mentioned unapproved accommodation.  I compliment <Col N="401" /> the Minister for his sensible attitude in this regard.  Some years ago I was an opponent of the unapproved accommodation sector, but I now believe it fills a niche.  The argument against unapproved accommodation was made when there was a problem filling rooms in the approved sector. There is a view that the unapproved sector provides competition for the approved sector.  It would be more valid &mdash; this is what the Minister is saying &mdash; for us to examine the reasons the unapproved sector wishes to remain unregistered. It is not rates, which they all must pay, or VAT &mdash; approved and unapproved accommodation are often below the VAT threshold &mdash; which keeps them from applying for registration.  Encouragement, rather than compulsion, should be used.</P>
    <P>In 1993, I toured the south-west and south-east of the country with some young members of my family and I deliberately stayed in unapproved accommodation.  It was clean, the food was good and I received outstanding hospitality from the people who welcomed me and my children into their homes.  In every case I was offered inspection of the rooms before I accepted them.</P>
    <P>It is not a valid argument to state that substandard accommodation is being offered.  I stayed in unapproved accommodation during many Seanad campaigns and I was often very glad to find it at midnight.  This happened in Senator Farrelly's county and there was a slight contradiction in his contribution.  He said that, on the one hand, the Minister should make funds available to encourage the creation of more accommodation in County Meath but, on the other, he wanted some of the accommodation which already exists closed down.</P>
    <P>The provision of accommodation, whether approved or unapproved, represents a certain element of enterprise. It is wrong, in terms of the economic conditions which pertain in the society in which we live, to take a line which is anti enterprise.  In many cases, it provides useful funds and a side income for <Col N="402" /> the woman of the house and we should recognise this fact.  I hope and believe the Minister will ensure that the regulations are not used to reduce the availability of accommodation, but rather to examine why the unapproved sector remains apart.  This should be done in a co-operative way and the Minister should encourage them to come in rather than attempt compulsion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Fitzgerald raised the issue of the contractor and the licence fees.  It is important to understand that the change being effected in the Bill will give Bord Fáilte the right to subcontract out the inspections for grading and classification of accommodation. This will be subcontracted out, for which a full contract will be drawn up.  This will include the right of Bord Fáilte to set the fees in that regard and the contractor to collect them.  It will also include a yearly review for non-performance, which would come into play if the board felt that the contractor appointed for registration of grading was not performing properly.</P>
      <P>Regarding non-registered tourist accommodation on the services side, I and the board recently recognised the Town and Country Homes Association and the Irish Farm Holidays Association. This was in the context of these organisations as approving bodies for the Irish homes sector and awarding the shamrock symbol.  The extra charges mentioned by the Senator in respect of water charges, etc., are a matter for the local authority.  As the Senator is aware, a waiver system exists.  The change involves giving the board the right to subcontract the registration of accommodation to a contractor.  I recently recognised the two other bodies which will do their own work in respect of guesthouses and farm holidays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Farrell mentioned the beer and wine licence.  No change in the liquor licensing laws is envisaged in this legislation and any change brought about in this area is essentially a matter for the Minister for Justice.  However, I will bring to her attention the points <Col N="403" /> raised, although Senator Howard is correct in the context of the 1988 debate when he said that it could end up with every food dispensing outlet having a beer and wine licence.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan mentioned a new role for former Bord Fáilte employees. The tender system in this instance was open.  It was operated strictly in accordance with the European Union regulations and was published in the European magazine.  I was liable to receive applications for tender from any of the EU countries.  I decided to award the contract, based on a recommendation of the steering committee, to TQS for its strong commercial basis, quality approach and experience in dealing with this matter.</P>
    <P>During the Second Stage debate in the Dáil, Deputy Andrews specifically mentioned a situation where former employees of the board would have accepted voluntary severance payments and then find themselves in charge of this registration and grading position. That is not the case.  The contractor, TQS, with whom the details will be drawn up, will employ quality and experienced Irish personnel.  My responsibility is to ensure the system operates efficiently, in an accountable way and above board, and that a highly efficient and professional service is given.  I intend to ensure this is the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second Stage I mentioned that £22 million is a huge amount of money for signposting and tourist information offices.  If this type of money was made available every year, there would be a tourist information office in every little village in Ireland.  What else is done with the <Col N="404" /> money?  Are grants paid to people in the tourism industry?  I made the point earlier that things might be fine in Killarney and Dingle in County Kerry but not so good elsewhere.</P>
      <P>I also made the point when we were in Government that pilot areas should be chosen and an incentive given to people in different parts of Ireland to promote tourism.  This should not just involve the western seaboard but the midland counties as well &mdash; Carlow, Kilkenny and Tipperary &mdash; where a small village or area could be given money as an incentive to start projects. Could the Minister specifically explain how the £22 million is being used?  It seems a massive amount of money for signposting and tourist information offices.  I am confused about where it is going.</P>

      <P>People like to know all about the visitor, where he comes from, for whom he is looking and where he is going.  Without any expenditure, there are literally thousands of tourist information offices.  However, this money does not refer to expenditure under this Bill.  It is an enabling provision only to allow Bord Fáilte to extend its limit from £18 million to £22 million.  This sum has existed since Bord Fáilte was founded and the actual expenditure each year is approximately £0.5 million, not £22 million.  The purpose is to extend the board's limit to spend this on an ongoing basis.  The figure of £1.5 million for the brown tourist signposting is contained in the operational programme over the five years.  The £22 million does not mean that sum is now available for tourist offices, although I wish that were the case.  It is just to <Col N="405" /> extend the limit to which Bord Fáilte can go by a further £4 million.  I can get details for the Senator of how the money has been spent if he wishes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied with the amount of money available to bring the industry up to a standard that he would like to see?  People in this industry pay VAT and taxes on the products they use; and they pay rent, rates, VAT and PRSI on the number of people they employ.  This industry is getting far less funding than other industries and the Department is not rescuing certain parts of it, unlike Team Aer Lingus and the many other bodies that are too numerous to mention which the Government is rescuing by paying out millions of pounds every second day.  In light of the tremendous value this industry gives to the Revenue, is the Minister satisfied that anything like enough funding has been made available for the total development of the tourist industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>One never can have enough to spend on this or on any other industry.  However, I am happy to say that it is one of the few areas where everybody, and the Government in particular, recognises its potential.  I outlined on Second Stage that the operational programme envisages an expenditure of £650 million between now and the end of 1999 providing tourism related facilities and products and there will be EU grant assistance of £320 million.  Bord Fáilte gets approximately £22 million for its own activities and promotion.  Over and above that, there is the involvement of the private sector with the public sector in the Overseas Tourism Marketing Initiative, which this year comes to £6.3 million. From that point of view, together with the private and group organisational promotions a large amount of money is being pumped into this industry.  This amount could be doubled and it still <Col N="406" /> would not be enough; these are huge figures.  We can do the job, meet the targets and attain the objectives we have set with this amount.</P>
      <P>I am trying to encourage tourism commentators to put this industry on the business pages.  It is not a gossip business but a competitive business.  In that sense we should make the industry and all associated with it understand that it is now the third largest industry in this country, and it is growing.  This money has to be used wisely and well and if it is, we will achieve these targets. If there are 120,000 people actively and permanently employed in the tourism business in five years time, they will know on what side their bread is buttered. They are highly motivated people who are giving a quality service and product and we cannot ask for any more than that.</P>
      <P>I attended the tourism promotion fair in Berlin earlier this year.  There were 5,600 stands there, many of them half the size of a football pitch.  Phenomenal amounts of money were being pumped into this fair.  Ireland has its own stand for which we paid a sizeable amount of money.  The building in which this fair took place would be about 26 times the size of the RDS.  Phenomenal amounts of money had been pumped into the promotion of countries all over the world.  In that context, we are a small player but the Department has a sizeable amount of money with which to work.</P>
      <P>We also have &mdash; and the President has referred to them as the Irish Diaspora &mdash; 70 million Irish people all over the world.  We will also be sensitively commemorating the 150th anniversary of the Famine.  There is no reason people of Irish descent should not come to Ireland at least once before the end of the century to see the old country, as Senator Fitzgerald called it, and see how we have been transformed from a hovel ridden country to a modern, energetic and dynamic young country heading into the 21st century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="407" /> The targets we have set can be achieved.  Tourism is a competitive business. I want it presented in an efficient and professional sense and I want everybody associated with it to know that quality and high standards are the hallmarks of the Irish tourism industry.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister and congratulate him for his efforts in what is a difficult business internationally. On the more domestic front, I wish to raise the matter of the regions in our State.  The west, the south-east, the south, County Donegal and Dublin city are traditional tourism areas.  The midland region has been bypassed over the years when it came to promoting it as a tourism region.  Tourists only pass through on their way to some other area.  There has been an uplift in activity as regards promoting tourism in the midlands, but the area could now be packaged as a region.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>In the south-west region a few years ago, a county which shall remain nameless declared a UDI in the matter of tourism promotion, the reason being dissatisfaction with a regional tourism body.  It is the same for the part of the county which I represent. Bord Fáilte and the regional tourism bodies are present but outside certain well established areas, tourism is not a runner.  The reason I made this contribution is to ensure that areas with local committees will get recognition from the regional tourist boards.  If one is to give real effect to the programme for tourism, each area has to benefit and must be encouraged to organise its own resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree fully with Senator Sherlock and I discussed this matter with him previously.  The intention is to have as many visitors go to as many and <Col N="408" /> as diverse areas as possible.  There is a growing awareness within each community that while they might not have been traditionally regarded as a strong tourist base, every area has its own attractions, be they historical, archaeological or cultural.  It does require some leadership for the community to sit down and address how best this might be presented and marketed and in that context, assistance is available.  I share Senator Sherlock's views on this matter.</P>

I took particular notice of his responses to different queries, many of which were made without the use of notes.  His comments in relation to his area of responsibility indicate that he has a strong interest in it.  He dealt adequately with the many points raised and his responses were encouraging.

The Minister should return to <Col N="409" /> the House after the summer recess for a full discussion on and assessment of how this year has gone.  I compliment the Minister &mdash; he is a likeable person and an ideal ambassador for the job &mdash; on what he has done and the manner in which he has done it.  Following his performance on television in the United States I would feel safe in leaving him to act in any part of the world as my ambassador and Minister for Tourism and Trade.

      <P>I thank Senators for their courtesy as well as for taking time off from their onerous duties to make these heartfelt and valued contributions.  The Senators have a range of experience and knowledge that is of benefit to us all.  I feel it is necessary to make important announcements in the Houses of the Oireachtas, although I was not in a position to announce the registration and grading contractor to the Dáil because the decision had not then been made. Nor was I able to announce to the Dáil the fact that Bord Fáilte would retain the assessment of the European Regional Development Fund grants position.  Despite being asked questions about this over the last few days, I felt it was important that the announcement should be made to one of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Thus it was appropriate that it should have been made in the Seanad today.</P>
      <P>I thank you, Chairman, for your courtesy and I thank Senators for their contributions.  We are all involved in building a quality tourism product which will generate strength in our economy and provide jobs for our young people in the years ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>In this time of hope and opportunity on the island, Seanad Éireann strongly supports the special programme of assistance and additional resources being made available by the European Union and the United States; and welcomes the more favourable climate for increasing the level of investment, tourism and trade on both sides of the Border.</P>
      <P>By agreement each speaker will have 15 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton) Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have this opportunity to respond to a motion which is both helpful and opportune.</P>
      <P>I welcome the significance which the motion attaches to the special programmes of assistance which the European Union and the United States are preparing in support of the peace process. The motion also rightly recognises that the climate for investment in tourism and trade on either side of the Border has been transformed by the developments of the past nine months.</P>
      <P>With the ending of all paramilitary campaigns of violence, an unprecedented opportunity has been created for the economic and social regeneration of Northern Ireland and of the southern Border counties.  We must work in every way possible to reconstruct the economic fabrics of the areas which have suffered most from these campaigns, whether directly or indirectly.  We must do everything possible to bring badly needed investment and employment into areas which have been blighted by violence, unrest and deprivation for the past quarter of a century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The additional resources which the European Union and the United States are generously making available in this <Col N="411" /> context will make a key contribution to this process.  They will help to consolidate the enormous achievements of the past nine months and to ensure that the peace which has taken hold becomes irreversible.</P>
    <P>The Irish and British Governments wish to see the peace underpinned by real improvements in the material prospects of the populations, North and South, which have been worst affected by the last 25 years of violence.  It is vital to ensure that the opening towards lasting peace, stability and prosperity which has now been created is utilised to the full.  We must work together to realise the benefits of peace for both economies and to build a better future for all of the people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The European Union has launched a special support programme to assist the process of peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border counties. Last December's European Council in Essen approved a package of assistance specially focused on peace and reconciliation which will amount to 300 million ECU over the three year period from 1995 to 1997, with the possibility of additional resources for a further two year period.  This initiative is new and distinctive and additional to the European Union's existing Structural Fund assistance for Ireland.  It will cover the following broad themes: employment, urban and rural regeneration, cross-Border development, social inclusion, productive investment and industrial development.</P>
    <P>It is agreed that a maximum of 80 per cent of total funding under the initiative will be allocated to Northern Ireland and that a minimum of 20 per cent will be allocated to the six Border counties. It is also agreed, and this is particularly significant for the Border counties, that at least 15 per cent of total funding will be earmarked for activities carried out in a cross-Border context.</P>
    <P>Guidelines for the initiative have been published by the European Commission. The Irish and British Governments are co-operating actively with the Commission at present to bring the initiative into effect with all possible <Col N="412" /> speed.  We have submitted a joint operational programme for the initiative which the Commission is currently examining.  It is hoped that this programme can be finalised and adopted by the Commission before the summer break.  When it is ready interested groups in the eligible area will be invited to submit applications for assistance under the individual headings of the programme.  A great deal of work has already been done in this area and I hope it is completed as early as possible.</P>
    <P>The Government regards the allocation for cross-Border development &mdash; at least 15 per cent &mdash; as a crucial component of the initiative.  The scope for cross-Border co-operation in the areas covered by the initiative is enormous and we look forward to proposals being presented which will enable this dimension to be availed of in full.  I am sure some of the Senators are familiar with the whole system of the operation of global grants in relation to Structural Funds.  It is very much an application led process.  To some extent we will be depending on the quality of the applications which come forward for qualification under the initiative.</P>
    <P>The Government also attaches priority to the social inclusion element of the initiative.  It is important that groups which have been disadvantaged or marginalised or who may be victims in other ways of the violence and instability of the past 25 years should receive support in meeting the challenge of peace.  In that context a number of women's organisations have made representations that they should be included in the initiative.</P>
    <P>Both Governments have engaged in an extensive consultation process as part of the preparation of the operational programme for the initiative.  In this jurisdiction, a major conference was organised last April in Ballyconnell, County Cavan.  All interest groups were given an opportunity to put forward their views on the areas which should receive priority attention under the programme and on other aspects of the initiative.</P>
    <P>The two Governments have agreed with the Commission on the need for a <Col N="413" />&ldquo;bottom-up&rdquo; approach to the implementation of the initiative.  Arrangements will be made to ensure that public consultation continues throughout the period of implementation and that local groups and interests have the maximum input into the decision making and delivery mechanism of the programme. Because of our experience in relation to EU structural funding and INTERREG, I am confident that groups in the Border counties will be in a very good position to present good applications to receive funding under the initiative.  The initiative is designed explicitly to support the process of peace and reconciliation.  All applications for assistance under it will be judged against the ability of the projects concerned to serve this process.</P>
    <P>INTERREG is another special European Union support programme of direct relevance to the border counties. The purpose of this initiative is to help border areas prepare for a European Union without frontiers.  The first INTERREG programme, which covered the period 1991-93, involved EU funding of £66 million which was then split evenly between North and South.  The new North/South INTERREG II programme, which covers the period 1994-99, will involve the European Union committing £72 million to projects in the southern Border counties and a further £53 million to Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>INTERREG II is designed to help the Border areas throughout the Union to overcome their special developmental problems arising from their relative isolation and to promote the creation and development of networks of co-operation across internal Borders.</P>
    <P>The North/South programme is divided into five sub-programmes, covering infrastructure &mdash; including roads, energy, transport and telecommunications &mdash; environmental protection &mdash; including the management of water resources and removal of pollutants &mdash; natural resources &mdash; agriculture, fisheries and forestry &mdash; human resources &mdash; training and education &mdash; and economic development &mdash; tourism, community development and special measures in <Col N="414" /> economic development.  These programmes aim to foster cross-Border co-operation and, while stand-alone projects on each side will continue to be eligible for aid, emphasis again will be placed on increasing the number and quality of joint or co-operative projects.</P>
    <P>One major innovation <i>vis-a-vis</i> the INTERREG I programme will be the appointment of an INTERREG development officer in the Border region.  The development officer will actively promote and publicise the INTERREG II programme.  The officer will act as a filter for inquiries regarding eligibility of projects and assist with the creation of links between cross-Border groups.  The development officer will operate on both sides of the Border and will have two sub-offices, one in Monaghan town and the other in Armagh city, located in the Border areas.</P>
    <P>I look forward to a significant expansion in cross-Border links at all levels under both the peace initiative and the new INTERREG programme.  The reestablishment of community and business links in the Border area, where for far too long economic development on both sides proceeded along parallel lines without any real attempt to coordinate policies, will strengthen the economic base in each jurisdiction and promote the common interests of North and South.</P>
    <P>The legacy of disadvantage from which the southern Border counties have suffered is also being tackled by the International Fund for Ireland.  The effects of the troubles in Northern Ireland on the Border counties, was recognised when the International Fund for Ireland was established in September 1986 as an expression of international support for the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  The purpose of the fund is to act as a vehicle of international support for the promotion of economic and social development of those areas of both parts of Ireland which have suffered most severely from the consequences of the instability of recent years.  It also encourages dialogue and reconciliation between Nationalists and Unionists throughout Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="415" /> The fund is supported by contributions from the United States, the European Union, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.  Since its inception, the fund has spent over £250 million on projects which have made an enormous contribution to the economic and social regeneration of the Border counties and Northern Ireland.  This year the fund is expected to contribute approximately £50 million to projects in the eligible area, of which £13.7 million will be spent in the Border counties of the South.</P>
    <P>The United States Administration, which is a major donor to the International Fund for Ireland, has also been in the forefront of support for the peace process.  The recent White House Conference for Trade and Investment in Ireland, which was hosted by President Clinton, was a major element in the US Government's response to the changed political situation in Northern Ireland. In addition to this extraordinary presidential gesture, a range of specific initiatives to promote economic co-operation in individual sectors between the US and Irish interests, North and South, are being actively pursued at present by the relevant authorities.</P>
    <P>The White House conference was the beginning of a process which is intended to highlight the attractions of investment in Northern Ireland and the Border counties.  It provided a unique opportunity for the private sector and the State agencies in Northern Ireland and the southern Border counties to come together in a spirit of co-operation and to highlight the benefits of investing in these areas to several hundred leading American companies.</P>
    <P>The relevant US authorities are planning follow-up in the form of sector specific missions which will bring potential US investors to these areas over the coming months.  It is hoped that the first of these missions can be arranged for the autumn of this year.  The Government will be working with the US authorities over the coming months to ensure that the follow-up trade missions are of maximum value and benefit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="416" /> President Clinton invested a great deal of his time, as well as the prestige of his office, in helping to ensure the success of the conference.  Last November he noted that &ldquo;this present opportunity for lasting peace in Ireland is the chance of a generation; it must be seized and supported&rdquo;.  The President led the way himself, convening this remarkable conference as a means of demonstrating to the US private sector the enormous opportunities which arise in the new context of peace for profitable investment in Northern Ireland and the Border counties.  All the people of this island.  North and South, are profoundly in his debt.</P>
    <P>The conference was in many ways a watershed in the development of the economic relationship between the United States and Ireland.  It was an unqualified success which reflected great credit on all those involved in its preparation.  I believe that in the medium and longer term we will see the fruits of the conference appear in the form of increased US investment in this island and in particular in the Border counties.</P>
    <P>Speaker after speaker at the conference emphasised the advantages of Ireland, North and South, as a gateway to the European Union, the world's largest market.  They also recognised the importance of a well educated, adaptable and English speaking labour force, a good infrastructural base and the strongly pro-business attitudes of both the Irish and British Governments.  The Irish Ministers who attended the conference, together with Oireachtas and local representatives from the Border counties, took every opportunity to highlight the merits of the six southern Border counties as a location for US investment.  In addition, the State agencies and officials worked hard to direct attention to the case for such investment.</P>
    <P>The southern Border counties have suffered over the past 25 years from a double disadvantage.  The very existence of the Border has adversely affected their economic and social development. Communities on both sides of the Border, living in towns and rural districts, <Col N="417" /> have been cut off for generations from their natural hinterlands.  The existence of a physical Border, with different rates of taxation and social security operating on either side, has caused substantial disruption to the local economy.  Traditional economic and geographical entities were divided.  Border areas on either side have found themselves on the periphery in terms of economic development.</P>
    <P>This intrinsic disadvantage was greatly compounded by the troubles in Northern Ireland over the past 25 years. The campaigns of violence have had a serious disruptive effect in relation to the attraction of inward investment and tourism to the Border counties.  The levels of foreign, and particularly US, investment in the Border counties are distinctly lower than elsewhere in the State.  I believe that the various support programmes which the European Union and the United States are making available for Northern Ireland and the Border counties will make a significant impact in terms of addressing this legacy of disadvantage.  I also believe that, with the consolidation of peace and the exploitation of the enormous potential which now arises for North-South co-operation, the coming years will offer greatly improved opportunities for these counties in the key areas of investment, trade and tourism.</P>
    <P>The ending of paramilitary violence has transformed the atmosphere on this island.  Business organisations, North and South, recognise the enormous benefits of a business environment which is enduringly stable and peaceful.  Campaigns of violence and the resulting unrest and instability destroy business confidence and retard economic and social progress. In that respect the conference was particularly important, because, at the end of the day, when investors come to make decisions about locating in a specific area, such as a Border region, even a small doubt on the part of some of the senior executives can lead to a decision to locate elsewhere rather than in the Border counties.</P>
    <P>There has never been a better time for the expansion of North/South business <Col N="418" /> and trade co-operation.  A survey published in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> recently reflected the views of delegates to the annual general meeting of the Small Firms Association.  The survey showed that 95 per cent of respondents believed that the possibility of increased North-South trade should be viewed as an opportunity while only 5 per cent believed it to be a threat.  Almost two-thirds of those surveyed signalled their intention to increase their own firm's trade with Northern Ireland.  This is very encouraging evidence of the determination of Irish business interests to take full advantage of the opportunities created by the peace process.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to a progressive expansion of North/South economic co-operation which will benefit all the people living on this island. Only good can flow from such co-operation and that is why the Government is determined to expand and strengthen it in every way possible.</P>
    <P>We welcome the contribution which the European Union and US programmes of support will make, both to the revitalisation of the areas affected by the past 25 years of violence and to the deepening of North-South co-operation on this island.</P>
    <P>The House is to be congratulated on the motion being debated this evening, which I strongly endorse.  This is my first opportunity to address the House since the sad death of Senator Wilson.  His voice would have been heard in the debate because he was born south of the Border and lived most of his life north of it.  For many of us, he represented reconciliation in its deepest sense.  It is a great pity to be speaking in his absence.  I offer my sincere condolences to Members from all parties.  In the time he was a Member of Seanad Éireann, he not only made political acquaintances but impressed all of us and made many deep and lasting friends.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader who was very kind to agree to taking this motion in Government time.  He did so from a realisation that it is important for the House to discuss this issue.</P>
      <P>Elected Members from all parties in the six Border counties did not make any statements over the past 25 years and this has cost us dearly.  The focus was largely on the six counties in Northern Ireland, mainly because people there were being killed.  Public representatives on the southern side of the Border did not make statements which would aggravate the situation or make life difficult.  The focus was on the problem in the northern six counties to the extent that when we discuss the subject even now, our psychological focus is on these counties and not on the six southern Border counties.  This has cost us a great deal.</P>
      <P>With respect to the Minister of State and other members of the Government, this is still not realised.  The platitudes and concern being expressed are great but we do not have a focus on the problems in the southern Border counties. The concern rightly expressed by the Minister is not backed up by any action or intention.  We are now forced to expose this situation to the point that the Government will have to take notice.</P>
      <P>I have a document which states exactly what funds are available.  The Government is organising meetings and seminars all over the place and there is utter confusion because groups believe money in abundance is available from Europe and all they have to do is hire a consultant and make an application proposing the right project to be allocated money.  This is totally false.  This is why over a period of five months I have consistently requested the opportunity to say this here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The focus is so much on the North that even the EU cross-Border package, which is worth £139 million, was announced on 27 February by three MEPs and the EU Commissioner for Regional Development, Monika WulfMathies, <Col N="420" /> in Belfast.  There was no focus on the southern Border counties and we do not expect any from elected representatives in the six northern counties. The EU Commissioner referred to the southern Border counties but did not visit them or hold a conference there, in spite of numerous requests to the Tánaiste to organise a visit by the commissioner to these counties.</P>
    <P>The package contains references to these counties but nothing else.  A recent newspaper gave details of a rural development programme costing £6.2 million for the small village of Castlederg across the Border; £30 million is being spent on a project in Derry; £26 million is being provided for a factory in Altnagelvin etc.  Every day mountains of money are pumped into the North.</P>
    <P>When Mr. Ron Brown came to Ireland, I attended a breakfast in Derry to hear the case for the six northern and six southern Border counties.  At this breakfast public representatives announced that they made sure they went to Washington to have President Clinton's adviser properly briefed.  The six southern Border counties were not mentioned at this meeting.  The Minister spoke about the value of the conference and I want to again put on record the value of the input of President Clinton and other elected representatives in the US who were unanimous in their support and showed generosity in organising this valuable conference.</P>

      <P>I am not waging a political campaign and I am not seeking to be elected to any post.  However, I am concerned about this issue.  Public representatives from all parties have the same concerns.  We are not on a political bandwagon but are demonstrating and expressing our utter revulsion at our lack of input.</P>
      <P>Regional tourism organisations in the north-west do not have any money.  We have a Border regional authority which has not received funding or any offer of funding.  The Donegal County Enterprise Partnership Board, of which I am member, had all the slogans which the Minister rightly used &mdash; for example, the bottom up approach and community involvement.  It has £1.1 million worth of projects on the table at present.  I asked Deputy O'Rourke to take up this matter and to apply pressure. We had only £200,000, but within the past few days we got additional funding which will increase the amount to £500,000 for 1995.  However, it costs £80,000 to run the office and if members of the board claim travelling expenses, it will cost more than the amount allocated. It is a joke.  We talk about bottom up, but there is no bottom.  The public will not be fooled.  No emphasis has been placed on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have reservations saying what I am about to say.  It is now unattractive to set up an industry in the six southern Border counties because they must compete with those which have an abundance of funding.  I was at the opening of a port at Lissahawley in County Derry by the former Commissioner for Regional Development, Mr. Bruce Millan.  Although the port was to cost £90 million, it cost only £38 <Col N="422" /> million.  The former Commissioner said he was delighted to be there as he had seen the need for a port.  He had no difficulty giving a commitment, which was obviously open ended.  We do not have the same representatives or the same concern.  What do we expect when the Minister for Enterprise and Employment failed to mention the six southern Border counties at the Washington Conference, which the Minister claimed was valuable?  It was deplorable and I was shocked.</P>
    <P>Like every local authority, my county has presented a submission for INTERREG funding.  A lot of man hours went into putting that document together.  It is a well thought out and detailed document compiled in accordance with what we were led to believe was available.  Sadly, no matching funds are available.  There is no money to support and finance the county enterprise boards which are providing employment. Tourism projects are now being referred to county enterprise boards because Bord Fáilte is not undertaking them.  Somebody from the Department, whom I cannot name, told me that they do not see the county enterprise boards surviving for long because there is no will in the Department to finance them.</P>
    <P>A Minister of State was appointed to ensure that the west would be developed, but we have not heard about it since.  Border region organisations and Leader programmes have not received funding.  We got a fair amount of flak from the Minister's party and others on the amount of money we were to get from the EU, whether it was £7 billion or £8 billion.  We were told that we had made mistakes and that we had announced the wrong amount.  Whether we got it right or wrong, none of us expected that we would be at a point where the allocation for county roads has been cut by £1 million in my county. We do not have funding to match the development funds which the Minister said are in place for developers in the six southern Border counties.</P>
    <P>Perhaps my contribution is not easy to listen to, but I am telling the Minister the facts.  Somebody must tell the Government that the public is aware <Col N="423" /> that there is no funding or matching funding.  If there is, where is it?  How much will my county and the five other southern counties get?  They will get nothing because we are not able to fix county roads or cut hedges.  It is a disaster. This document, which took many man hours to compile, might as well go into the bin.  However, I am not on a destructive mission.  I hope the Minister is around long enough to read the document or to get somebody to read and to reply to my council and tell it what support it will get from the Department of Foreign Affairs or any other Department. This is not a secret document which I have in my hip pocket.  It is an open document which has been discussed. Hopes and aspirations are very high.</P>
    <P>I am close enough to the situation to know that despite the hype surrounding the Washington Conference and so on, we are going nowhere because no Minister has made an input or has shown any concern.  This was borne out by the fact that the Minister for Enterprise and Employment failed to use the opportunity to put the case for the six southern Border counties.  Nobody has done so since.  Public representatives are waiting patiently to see what will happen. Each day they are inundated by inquiries and requests about funding, whether it is from the Delors package or the International Fund for Ireland.  We are waiting for 75 per cent of the International Fund for Ireland and 80 per cent of the Delors package.</P>
    <P>Compensation for destruction and deprivation in the North over the past 25 years has been paid by the British.  It is not starting at a disadvantage.  Factories want to set up in County Donegal, but they cannot afford to do so because, unlike in the North, no financial aid is available for a garment based industry in the South.  Whether the Minister passes this message on or whether she believes me is a matter for herself. Those involved in public life are concerned. They know they will not be able to deliver because this Government was not concerned enough to have made a case for the six southern Border counties. <Col N="424" /> This is the worst day of my 27 years in the House.  I expected to hear the Tánaiste tell me what he was going to do for the six southern Border counties. Unfortunately, I have little confidence that anything will happen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I rise in support of the motion and I am glad it is not contentious, although Senator McGowan made his views clear.  However, no amendment is proposed and in that sense it is non-contentious.</P>
      <P>It is great that we can stand in this House and speak about peace in the North.  It is clear that the people who are most affected by the problems there deeply appreciate the fact that there is peace and they want it to continue. Those who did not live in the Border counties find it difficult to understand the conditions that pertained.  People who lived a few hundred yards apart were obliged to travel miles in order to visit each other because of the closure of Border roads for security reasons. That was a fact of life and we lived with it for years.</P>
      <P>There is an incredible sense of relief now.  People can travel freely again. That was one of the basic rights conferred by the European Union and it was denied to us for so long.  People can now drive into Armagh, Enniskillen and Belfast and visit their relatives or have a day out.  They deeply appreciate, first, the loss they suffered for a long time and, second, the fact that the right has been restored to them.</P>
      <P>We can cite many examples of where impediments were put in the way of ordinary discourse between people in Border counties.  I agree with Senator McGowan that those impediments hampered development in the Border counties. Economic and social development was hampered for years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Border was there before the troubles started.  It is clear from the Minister's speech that she and the Government recognise that before the conflict began in 1969 the Border effectively impeded people and prevented ordinary, co-operative things from happening. It was difficult at that time to <Col N="425" /> cross the Border.  One had to have bonding for one's car and so forth.  We are not simply talking about the past 25 years.  Since the foundation of the State there have been difficulties in the Border counties and I am glad that the Minister recognised that in her speech. She acknowledged that the southern Border counties suffered and that they need support in order to reach a level equal to that of the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>It must be difficult for a Minister in a small country such as this to announce money for Border counties when there is no money available for areas a few miles away.  We have encountered that difficulty and we get a certain amount of flak as a result.  People say: &ldquo;You have this fund, that fund and the other fund up there so what are you shouting about?&rdquo;  I do not accept that attitude, of course.  I reject it.  We have those funds because we need them badly and I am glad that the EU and the United States Government have always recognised that fact.  There is a second INTERREG programme.  The INTERREG programme recognises the fact that a border area has traditional problems that-other areas do not have.  There would not have been such a programme without that recognition.</P>
    <P>The International Fund for Ireland, established since 1986, also recognises the fact that the Border counties in the South suffered from the conflict and we received a percentage of that fund from the beginning.  The fund has done a great deal to transform life in the Border counties.  It has put us in a position where we can reap the benefits of peace in some sectors of the economy at least. The International Fund for Ireland has done an incredible amount of good work in the tourism industry by updating and modernising hotels, guesthouses and so forth.  They are now in a position to reap the benefits of the peace.</P>
    <P>I have always been a great admirer of the people in charge of the fund.  They taught us that self help is good.  Communities in the Border counties were aware of this before it happened anywhere else in the country.  Before there was a Leader programme we had the IFI.  Communities in the Border counties <Col N="426" /> realised that with a little help they could do a great deal of work for themselves. Community groups are doing incredible things in the Border counties. They are ready to build factories and lease them to people who have a product they wish to produce.  Three years ago that type of thing would have been unthinkable.  There are good things happening in the Border counties and let us not lose sight of that.</P>
    <P>The experience we have gained over the last number of years means that the programmes being introduced now will be better utilised.  I support some of Senator McGowan sentiments.  It obviously is a luxury to be in Opposition. I enjoyed that luxury in the Dáil and in this House for a number of years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness, we felt the same way in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a luxury, but it is also a necessity.  Let us face it, if nobody ever criticised Government action the public would not understand much of that action.  There must be sensible criticism. It is part of our democratic process and it leads to a better understanding.  Even when the Government is doing positive things there is criticism.  I do not see much wrong with that.  It helps to give everybody a better understanding of the action that is being undertaken, and that is good.</P>
      <P>However, while criticism is necessary, some of it is unwarranted.  There was clear recognition in the Minister's speech of the problems in the Border counties.  Unless past Governments as well as the present Government were so advising administrations such as those in the US and in the EU, all the peace dividend money would probably have gone to Northern Ireland and we would have received none.  However, our Governments and Ministers were sufficiently aware to offer the proper advice.  People who make decisions must have access to local knowledge and advice.  They obviously were given that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A substantial amount of the Delors package will go to the southern side of the Border.  President Clinton is hoping to increase the $20 million per year contribution <Col N="427" /> to the IFI to $30 million.  I am not sure if he can achieve that because the balance of power in the United States has changed and there is a feeling that foreign aid programmes will be slashed.  Although he might have difficulty in achieving that figure, the President is committed to advancing the peace process in Ireland and to putting the money he has available to the best use possible in trying to assist the people who suffered most during the troubles.</P>
    <P>There are difficulties.  It is difficult to apply national policy to the Border counties.  If one examines the earnings from tourism in the 26 counties, for example, which county is the lowest earner?  It certainly is a Border county. The second lowest earner is also a Border county.  Border counties such as Donegal and Louth have had a better opportunity to earn money from tourism. However, in Monaghan and Cavan &mdash; Leitrim is probably one of the better off counties &mdash; we have always had a problem.  We did not have a product. When we became conscious that we should develop a product we did not have a market.  Who wanted to come and visit us?  Nobody; nobody wanted to enter the war zone.</P>
    <P>We have a problem and we must solve it.  Applying national tourism policy at a time when we are trying to develop tourism in the Border counties is not the correct policy.  The Delors package should recognise this, and the national policy which says we have enough beds in Ireland today is not the kind of policy that we should pursue in the Border counties.  We must recognise that investment did not happen in the past because people were afraid to invest.  They now feel much more confident and are anxious to invest.  The policy should recognise that we need many more beds in the Border counties, especially in County Cavan and County Monaghan where development has been even more retarded.</P>
    <P>In talking to people in the North about tourism development I find that they are cock-a-hoop about it.  They have a huge number of visitors coming <Col N="428" /> into the North.  Local, national and international tourism is booming. However, they all advise that they do not have the beds because they did not invest.  Business people do not invest unless they can get a return on their investment.  That investment did not happen in the North of Ireland and it must happen now.</P>
    <P>We have no jurisdiction over the way the funds are to be applied in the North but we have such jurisdiction in the Border counties.  On every possible occasion I have suggested that as well as recognising our present difficulties &mdash; and hopefully the Minister will accept what I have said about these &mdash; we need specific policies which may not be necessary for the rest of Ireland.  We have great potential for tourism development.  For example, in County Monaghan I see us developing our tourism by as much as 20 per cent to 30 per cent, the kind of figures that are mind boggling.  We have many lakes that have been lying idle.  Many English fishermen visited the region in the 1960s.  The troubles started in 1969, the visits stopped and there was no more development.  Over the past number of years we have been trying to improve the condition of our lakes to get people back.  We will now be successful and will get them back.  However, to do so we need more beds and we must improve the quality of the waters to ensure that the product we have to offer is such that when visitors arrive they will return. There are great opportunities which we must grasp with both hands.</P>
    <P>The late Senator Gordon Wilson would have looked forward with glee to a motion of this kind because Gordon loved speaking about the North of Ireland.  He had a simple philosophy about it.  He believed that politicians should not play around with peoples' lives and that people had the potential for both good and evil.  He also firmly believed that people had the potential to change.  He would have loved to have been here with us this evening.  It is a great shock to us that he cannot.  I was unable to speak yesterday when Senators paid tribute to him.  It is a great shock to us to find that he is now lying <Col N="429" /> in state in Enniskillen this evening. Under normal circumstances he would be sitting in the House at this time and would be very happy to make his contribution to this debate.  His death is an incredible loss to all of us.  We remember his basic philosophy.  I will never forget his basic, simple approach to life and the very intelligent way that he could simplify the core of his arguments. We all learned much from his contributions to the House.  In his name, let us hope that we will have many more good contributions on Northern Ireland and that the peace process will continue apace.</P>
    <P>In this respect I am proud of the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, who, over the weekend set the basis for another move forward.  The little things that happen every now and then are all adding up to people on the ground getting the feeling that the peace process is here to stay. They want it to stay and it is up to us to ensure that it does stay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  Like everybody else here, I am sure we will miss the late Senator Wilson's wise words on this topic.  In his memory, it is even more essential that we take very seriously motions such as this and that we try to put forward the best ideas we have.</P>
      <P>I thank both the EU and the USA Government for the generous allocation of moneys they have given to us for these projects.  It is tremendous to note that we are now in a situation where we can become involved in INTERREG programmes which have been part of the general practice of the EU for so long in promoting development along internal borders.  However, because of our troubled situation on this island, we have not been involved in this for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are enormous steps to be made in all of the Border counties and Senator McGowan is right to stress the <Col N="430" /> problems that have arisen in the southern counties.  Hopefully, an official bureaucratic industry, which would include the completion of forms, will not arise.  A considerable number of community groups and groups consisting of small enterprises have attempted to get going but have told me that they have had considerable difficulty in getting assessment of their proposed projects, that the exercise has been fraught with delay and that inspections have gone on for too long.  In areas where there is unemployment there must be a sense of urgency.  Unemployment has been extraordinarily important in being associated with violence and problems in Northern Ireland which have spilled over into the southern counties.  There should, therefore, be a greater sense of urgency and a little less bureaucracy in this area.</P>
    <P>Hopefully, the initiatives will not be too narrowly interpreted.  We must make the Border as permeable as possible. We should try to look at the whole area as if the Border did not exist, or to forget that there are two jurisdictions and proceed on that basis.  For example, when I introduced an initiative regarding health co-operation to the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation I never thought it would proceed so quickly.  It has now gone beyond anything I ever suggested and nobody bothers to mention any more the fact that an ambulance will be based in the North and another in the South.  For far too long we have been working back to back; we must now start to work facing each other.</P>
    <P>Hopefully also the stretching of the human resources initiative will go as far as possible with regard to training and education.  As degrees are reciprocal in my profession, I have suggested, especially at the senior house level where many people go to jobs around the country for six months, that one job should be included in Northern Ireland in each two year programme.  This should not be too difficult to do.  Those from Northern Ireland could come south of the Border also.  The arrangement would give people a much better idea of the human contact and similarities <Col N="431" /> which exist between ill and well people in both areas.</P>
    <P>One of the most amazing initiatives we have started means that we now have communications before birth on this island.  The Rotunda Hospital in Dublin and the maternity hospital in Belfast have set up an internet between each other.  Scanning babies <i>in utero</i>, within the womb, was a very complicated problem and expertise takes time to develop.  In view of this, babies from the Falls Road and the Shankill are scanned in Belfast but their photographs are very often fed down to Dublin where they are looked at to see if there are better ideas on what should be done about these children's health <i>in utero.</i>  Similarly, scans of babies from the Liberties in Dublin and our equivalent of the Shankill are fed into the Rotunda and back up to Belfast if it is thought that the expertise in Belfast with regard to the health of these children could better look after them.</P>
    <P>It is hoped to establish centres all over Ireland where this can be done, so that this specific expertise, which can only exist in a couple of centres around the country, will be available to the women of Ireland.  It only costs £30,000 per grey box.  I never miss an opportunity to ask a Minister for a few bob. Hopefully, the Minister will remember this and see if the INTERREG funds could be stretched to having the human resources initiative extended to involve the examination of Irish people, even before they properly arrive, within the country.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister and thank her for her wide reflection on the motion.  I endorse what Senator Cotter said.  I detected within the content of the Minister's speech a recognition &mdash; I do not wish to score points but perhaps it was a belated recognition &mdash; of the problems facing the southern Border counties. Late or otherwise, I welcome it and acknowledge that it forms the central part of the Minister's contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The significance of cross-Border funding has taken on a new urgency consequent on the paramilitary ceasefires of last August.  At present the two main sources of funding are the International Fund for Ireland and INTERREG.  In the case of the IFI, I take this opportunity to convey the appreciation of the people of County Leitrim &mdash; as chairman of Leitrim County Council I take that onerous task upon myself &mdash; and the other Border counties to the donor countries involved with that fund as outlined by the Minister. I would particularly thank the United States for its continuing support and commitment as the major donor to this important fund.  Those of us who have followed events in Washington during the past number of months can only welcome the continuing commitment of both Houses of Congress to ensuring the safety of that donation from America, which has undergone severe attack and criticism but survived in a period of fiscal rectitude.  I wish to commend Chairman Gillman of the House of Representatives and Congressman Sonny Callaghan of Alabama, chairman of the appropriations or <Col N="433" /> budget committee of the House, who shepherded this through.</P>
    <P>Since its inception in 1986 the fund has made a significant contribution to the economic and social well-being of the Border counties.  There have been critics of the fund on both sides of the Border.  In its initial period the Unionist community refused to have anything whatsoever to do with the fund because of its Anglo-Irish Agreement connotations. As Senator McGowan stated in his contribution, in recent years Unionist-dominated local authorities and communities have embraced the IFI with an enthusiasm, which has resulted in towns and villages across Northern Ireland benefiting significantly.  This has created many of the difficulties to which Senator McGowan referred.  On the southern side of the Border there was never any reluctance to take advantage of the fund, but we have been faced since its inception with a clear imbalance in how it is operated.  The agreement between the British and Irish Governments in 1985 to expend 75 per cent of the fund in Northern Ireland has had a beneficial effect on communities there.  The experience in the South has been much more controversial.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan cited the example of Castlederg.  I could cite the example of Garrison, a village just across the Border in County Fermanagh, which is literally within a stone's throw, now that the Border road is open, from Rossinver, a village of similar size.  I am sure Senator Reynolds will concur that Rossinver is devastated in economic terms. If a person travels across the Border to Garrison they will see a development which is staggering in its impact.  A sum of £1 million was spent on creating a community hall, a social services centre, a concert hall, a bridge across the river and a state of the art shopping centre. This was done in a small village with no contribution required locally.  It makes me feel a little frustrated at the operation of the fund.  I do not wish this to be envious of the good people of Garrison in any way.  My aunt lives there and would hit me over the head if I were to suggest that Garrison did not deserve the money it received.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="434" /> That is one small example of what Senator McGowan was referring to and which I am attempting to convey.  It has not been widely acknowledged that the southern Border counties have suffered painful economic isolation as a result of partition.  The decline in population and economic activity in Border counties, such as County Leitrim, commenced not with the war in 1969 but with partition in 1922.  This decline was exacerbated by the 25 years of violence in Northern Ireland, which had a devastating impact on the already fragile southern Border counties, particularly on inward investment and tourist development.  Despite the difficulties experienced in the North, many of the northern Border counties escaped the ravages of physical destruction caused by the war.  This point was also made by Senator McGowan but needs to be re-emphasised.  In fact the British Government generously compensated the owners of bombed buildings.</P>
    <P>A glance at any of the IFI annual reports since 1986 will show that a significant amount of money was spent on urban renewal in towns on the northern side of the Border which were already prosperous by southern Irish standards. Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, is a case in point.  It is the nearest regional centre of affluence to my home in County Leitrim.  Its proximity to Country Leitrim meant that Enniskillen's already wealthy and affluent hinterland was considerably enhanced by IFI funding to the detriment, I suggest, of towns and villages on the southern side.  The ratio is 75 per cent to 25 per cent in favour of the northern side and the southern side has been excluded from the Crisp programme.  This programme forms an integral part of urban development under the IFI and is 50 per cent funded by the Northern Irish Department of the Environment.  This is where the non-local contribution comes in because 50 per cent of the Garrison community effort was funded by the IFI and the other 50 per cent came from Exchequer funding from the Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland &mdash; the British Government, in other words.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="435" /> This has resulted in no contribution being necessary from local communities and has been a source of irritation and frustration to those of us on the southern side.  County Leitrim, for example, has received £200,000 from the IFI this year under a towns and villages programme which was set up in response to criticism from the southern side about the existence of the Crisp programme on the northern side.  The difference between the example of Garrison and the £200,000 provided for County Leitrim is that my local authority must find £200,000 to match that provision.  It does not have it.  That is a microcosm of what is happening on the southern side of the Border.</P>
    <P>I wish to briefly refer to the Washington Conference which I had the privilege to attend along with my colleagues from the Border counties.  I must record my disappointment at the lack of emphasis on the southern Border counties by the Irish Minister present.  This was in contrast to Baroness Denton, who on the morning in question sold Northern Ireland so brilliantly. I hate to admit it, but she literally wiped the floor with our Minister, good as he tried to be.  It was a lacklustre performance which did not reflect full credit on the commitment shown here by the Minister that there is an acknowledgement of the difficulties of the southern Border counties.  It was a missed opportunity and that view would be shared by all of the politicians who were present at the conference.</P>

      <P>I will provide one small example.  To an audience of 800 people on the final morning of the conference, when last impressions are nearly as important as first impressions, Baroness Denton asked those present from Northern Ireland to stand up, applaud and thank the President of the United States for the wonderful work and commitment he was showing toward Northern Ireland.  It was a wonderful <i>tour de force</i> and a brilliant piece of PR.  The lasting impression was that the conference <Col N="436" /> was as much about Northern Ireland as it was about any other aspect of Ireland.  That is why Senator McGowan's criticism is well merited.  I am sad to have to say it.</P>
      <P>No criticism was implied or stated at the time.  I have always believed in the philosophy that if an Irish Minister is abroad, they are there flying the flag and representing our country.  I will not &mdash; and I think it is a view shared by all Members irrespective of political viewpoint &mdash; stab that Minister in the back either at home or abroad but in the context of this debate I feel it is important to state that we were disappointed.  I know that I have a time limit.  I want to conclude as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>Right.  The second source of funding is INTERREG, which is primarily for cross-Border projects of a tourist nature or those projects which have an economic basis.  I request that the Government does not use this money as a substitute for Exchequer funding in the Border counties.  It should be additional to any moneys normally allocated to the Border counties. It is widely accepted that the Border counties are a special case, which the Minister acknowledged earlier.</P>
      <P>I would like to put on record my appreciation of the initiative taken by Mr. Jacques Delors, who, in one of his last acts as President of the EU Commission, launched the ceasefire fund now known as the Delors Initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once again I must express a certain disappointment with the ratio agreed, which will result in 80 per cent of this money going north and only 20 per cent going to the southern Border counties. It is obvious that once again there was little acknowledgement, either by the Irish Government or the European Union, of the special difficulties which we in the Border counties have experienced over many decades.  I am pleased to acknowledge, and I gratefully acknowledge, that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, is on record as having committed the Government to providing matching funds under this <Col N="437" /> heading and I, like my colleagues, await the public announcement of the guidelines for the dispersal of this EU money in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased to inform the House that, following an initiative I set in motion on my election as chairman of Leitrim County Council last July, a new relationship has developed between us and our colleagues in Fermanagh resulting in the recent creation of a central Border region network encompassing the counties of Leitrim, Fermanagh, Sligo, Cavan, Monaghan, south Donegal together with Omagh District Council.  I want to pay particular tribute to Mr. Gerry Burns, the chief executive officer of Fermanagh District Council, for his total commitment to this unique concept and for his outstanding contribution to ensuring the network is now a reality.  That is the note on which I wish to end because it was the note towards which the Minister was moving in her contribution; cross-Border initiatives of this nature is where the future of this funding lies.  I hope, I know, we will get the support of the Government for this type of cross-Border initiative.</P>
    <P>I am grateful for the extra time.  I am also grateful to the Minister for coming into the House.  It has shown a belated but welcome commitment to the difficulties that those on the southern side of the Border face in trying to emerge from the despair we found ourselves in over the last 25 years.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt it will. I welcome the motion and I fully support its wording.  We have a wonderful opportunity to create a favourable climate to increase social and economic benefits in the Border regions.  The Border counties, specifically on the southern <Col N="438" /> side, have suffered greatly over the past 25 years.  With the peace dividend, we now have an opportunity which we must embrace to make sure all the money being made available will be spent for the benefit of the whole region.</P>
      <P>I listened to some of the comments and they amused me.  As far as Northern Ireland is concerned, I know people should always look forward rather than back but, as a fledgling politician elected to Leitrim County Council, I remember the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement in 1985.  One of the dividends of that agreement was the International Fund for Ireland and I had the pleasure of proposing at a Leitrim County Council meeting that we should support the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  My Fianna Fáil colleagues, in their wisdom, voted against this proposal. If the Irish Government had taken that attitude, the International Fund for Ireland would never have been established.  Since 1985, I have listened to numerous Fianna Fáil colleagues, nationally and locally, complain about the lack of money being spent on the southern side of the Border.  The hypocrisy of it annoyed me in the sense that they wanted to vote against the Anglo-Irish Agreement but with the prospects of money becoming available they complained that not enough was being spent.  I have to put this on the record because it is something that stayed with me, and will stay with me, until the end of my political career.</P>
      <P>We will never have enough money; we will always look for more.  If we look at the amount of work the International Fund for Ireland has done in the Border regions, we see it is hugely significant.  I would like to see funds split 50/50 between North and South but I am prepared to accept 25 per cent because 25 per cent of £1 million is better that 100 per cent of nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also have a great fondness for the International Fund for Ireland.  The flagship project of the fund must be the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal, the Erne-Shannon link.  Being a local businessman as well as a local politician, I know the significance of the contribution <Col N="439" /> that development has made.  I said in the House this morning &mdash; I was prompted by Senator Mooney &mdash; that I always acknowledge the role of the former Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, in making that project a reality; it was one of his pet projects.  The International Fund for Ireland was the body which inspired the concept of the renovation of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal.  It cost £35 million and the people of the area will benefit greatly.</P>
    <P>The role the International Fund for Ireland has played, North and South, cannot be underestimated.  It has helped the whole region and it will continue to do so.  I welcome the generosity of the US Government, the EU and the Governments of Canada, Australia and New Zealand who contributed to it.</P>
    <P>INTERREG I, INTERREG II and the Delors package will play a significant part in the development of the region.  Like my colleague Senator Mooney, I hope the Government would not consider the substitution of funds because we are getting this grant assistance &mdash; I see the Minister nodding, I am glad I have approval.  We need infrastructural and capital development there all the time.  The peace initiative has created a climate for the development of tourism in the Border and other areas.  We need capital expenditure and it is very important that as much money as possible is put into the area and that substitution would not even be considered.</P>
    <P>INTERREG II and the Delors package have a central role to play over the next four to five years.  For some time many people have not been aware of the type of grants and financial assistance that are available.  I welcome the fact that under the INTERREG II programme a development officer will be appointed.  This officer's team will be central to the development that can take place.  The climate is right, business people are willing to invest their money and communities are willing to invest their time.  A development officer who can show them what is available will reduce the workload and the bureaucracy. <Col N="440" /> I have no doubt the officer will play a central role in these programmes.</P>
    <P>For 25 years Leitrim was the only-county not to have direct access to Northern Ireland.  All five roads into County Fermanagh were closed &mdash; they were opened only after the IRA and loyalist ceasefires.  The economic devastation caused on both sides of the Border because of this fact must be seen to be believed.</P>
    <P>There is a little town in Leitrim called Kiltyclogher and it was like a ghost town.  I remember canvassing there and about 40 per cent of the houses were unoccupied.  Now many people are willing to return because they think there is a very positive attitude towards the development of the region.  I have no doubt that will happen with all these funds that are available.  My one plea is that bureaucracy does not get in the way.</P>
    <P>Communities and business people are willing to work and invest.  I hope they are not stymied by bureaucracy and administration.  Administration is necessary but over-administration can cause frustration and stop people from investing and putting forward proposals which would be of immense benefit to the economic and social development of their areas and to the Border region.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's speech.  As colleagues have said, she is aware of the situation pertaining in the Border area and I have no doubt the Government has taken on board the views of all the local communities.  Now is the time for positive progress in the Border region. We have only one chance and we must make the best of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the special programmes available to assist local development, particularly the programmes for the Border counties.  I am grateful to the Minister and I welcome the appointment of a development officer in Monaghan town and another for Armagh city.  It will be a flagship for the Border counties and for cross-Border co-operation. The development of the Armagh, Monaghan and Louth area is crucial to the success of the peace process.  It is an <Col N="441" /> area that has been forgotten for many years and has suffered great hardship as a result of the violence of the last 25 years.  I am proud the Minister saw fit to appoint a development officer.</P>
      <P>I urge all to examine these funds to ensure the best results are gained.  As a result of the past 25 years of troubles in Northern Ireland the Border areas have suffered enormously through lack of investment and development.  To reverse this we must plan carefully and receive the full backing of all funding agencies to ensure the area can be developed to its full potential.  The current opportunities provided by the peace process and the funding made available by the European Union and the United States offer the people of the Border areas the opportunity of a lifetime.</P>
      <P>The six Border counties of Monaghan, Cavan, Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim and Louth have enormous potential for development.  In co-operation with counties on the northern side of the Border the opportunities for development in tourism and trade are endless. This is why we must make every effort to ensure our plans produce the best results.  Now is the time to put these plans in place.</P>
      <P>I fear the six Border counties will not get the maximum benefit from the funds now available.  The Government must ensure that all money coming to the Border counties is additional and it must not take money away from national allocations as happened this year in the allocations to county roads in Monaghan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much more money is needed to develop and provide real jobs in tourism. Our county enterprise boards are doing good work with their resources. However, greater co-ordination is essential.  I find great confusion among people due to the large number of agencies dealing with the funds available. We need one central agency for the distribution of these funds to projects which will give the best return.  This requires the immediate setting up of new structures and I urge the Government to show real commitment to the <Col N="442" /> Border counties by examining this urgently.</P>
    <P>In many cases I find the requirements for matching funding for local promoters of projects a great barrier to many worthwhile projects getting off the ground.  This is a matter the Government must examine closely.  The National Development Plan should be re-examined in the light of the peace process.  It was completed before the peace was announced.</P>
    <P>There are opportunities for major development in this favourable climate, but if we do not plan carefully in four or five years we may look back and regret the passing of a great opportunity for development for generations to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton) Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators who contributed to the debate.  Some important points were made of which I have taken careful note.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and I are acutely aware of the needs of the Border counties.  I married into a family from Dundalk and I know from personal experience how the Dundalk area has suffered from being cut off from its natural hinterland in the Newry and Mourne areas.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Armagh, Cavan and Monaghan areas, I have always believed that once peace was established the area of south Armagh and north Monaghan would be ideal for a range of tourism initiatives given its unique history and contribution to Irish culture.  There is an unnatural division between Donegal and Derry, two areas with so much in common.  Senator Reynolds spoke about how Sligo and Leitrim in particular have been cut off from the North.  We are now entering a new era.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 80 per cent and 20 per cent calculation refers to a maximum and minimum respectively and we do not have to stick absolutely to those figures.  It is, of course, influenced by the fact that the bulk of the money will go to areas which have suffered actual conflict as opposed to suffering from the effects of conflict, which has tended to be what has happened <Col N="443" /> on the southern side of the Border. The proportionality is also based on the population in the respective areas.</P>
    <P>I also take on board the points made in relation to bureaucratic difficulties. Given that we in the South have the experience of dealing with Structural and other EU Funds over a period of time and experience built up in relation to the International Fund for Ireland, we have enormous experience in potentially successful applications for funding. This would be crucially important and significant.  With regard to INTERREG, the development officer will be able to give a message to those communities and areas which might not be fully aware of the funding that is available.</P>
    <P>We are entering a new era and have already seen this year a remarkable upsurge in tourism in the North of Ireland and also in the whole of the island.  It is particularly welcome to see the number of English tourists who have come back this year.  The number of people from the South who are going northwards and the number of people from the North coming South are notable.  I hope that the Border counties will be in a positive position to benefit from these developments.</P>
    <P>I was not at the investment conference in Washington but I did read the reports.  I was particularly struck by the presentations which were made by some of the United States participants, particularly from companies like Fruit of the Loom, who have experience of working and investing on both sides of the Border, and the powerful case they made for investment.  Given that most of the conflict was in the North of Ireland, it is understandable, because the focus is on peacemaking, that there will be some focus and emphasis on those areas which have actually suffered violent conflict.  There is also a clear focus in the operational programme on areas which have been marginalised or disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>Everything which has been said today by Senators on both sides of the House emphasises the degree of marginality and peripherality which has been imposed on the Border counties.  They <Col N="444" /> have suffered from two disadvantages. The first is the actual existence of the Border, which in many cases, made cross-Border links virtually impossible at the height of the troubles and subsequently. Second, they have suffered by being on the periphery of the southern State and the northern counties are on the periphery of Northern Ireland. We are entering, as the motion says, a new era of hope.  I can say on my own behalf and that of the Tánaiste that we will continue to give every attention and assistance, where possible, to the successful utilisation of all the funding available and to include in that the case of the Border counties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am obliged to the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Allen, for coming here this evening for this matter which is important not only for the people of north Tipperary, Clare and Galway, which adjoin Lough Derg, but also for our tourism industry.  I am happy to have the opportunity to highlight the importance of dealing with this unique natural asset, Lough Derg, and the need to save it from the consequences of pollution from a variety of sources.  I am not making a political point because I do not expect any Government, much less this Government which only came to office six months ago, to suddenly wave a magic wand.  However, I hope the Minister can show evidence of action which, in my view and the view of those who reside near Lough Derg, should have been taken a long time ago to save this precious asset.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was happy to support the Tourist Traffic Bill, 1995, in the House today, but I said it was important to protect <Col N="445" /> and enhance the unique characteristics of Ireland and that anything which would allow pollution of our waterways or degrade what is precious and unique in Ireland would be the worst possible outcome in terms of tourism promotion. That is why I want to highlight what is happening in Lough Derg &mdash; Loch Deirgeirt, as it is known in Irish &mdash; which is a great natural feature of our waterways.</P>
    <P>I base my case on two facts.  This problem became increasingly evident in recent years, although it first emerged 25 or 30 years ago.  The level of pollution from waste of one form or another was such as to prompt the environmental research unit of the Department of the Environment to issue a report two or three years ago laying out clearly what was required to save the lake from destruction.  Because of the lack of action in the interim, a group of people of all political persuasions, activities and vocations organised a campaign called Save Our Lough Derg or SOLD.  There was and is nothing political about what they are highlighting.  They wanted the recommendations of the environmental research unit of the Department of the Environment to be implemented as a matter of urgency.  They did not dream up the recommendations; they saw the problems.</P>
    <P>The environmental research unit, in conjunction with Teagasc, pointed out that these remedial measures should proceed on all fronts, including municipal control and regulation of agricultural nitrates and enriched phosphates, household detergents and silt from the Bord na Móna operations on the Shannon. The beautiful lake of Lough Derg is a receptacle for all that flows through the tributaries.  This enrichment is a great cause of concern because it is now at crisis point.  The report said that 1995 would be the crunch year and that serious damage would be caused to the fish and wildlife.  Action must be taken on its recommendations.</P>
    <P>I regret that no action has taken place on any of the fronts recommended by the environmental research unit.  As a result, a deputation from this representative group, which was a spontaneous <Col N="446" /> expression by the people of Clare, Limerick and north Tipperary in particular, met the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, early this year.  He told the deputation that an announcement regarding £30 million from the European Union, which the Government had negotiated, would be made in early May.  He also said that the programmes and funds for dealing with the problem would be announced and implemented from that date.  Within a few weeks, in answer to a question by Deputy Quill in the House, that date became early June. However, no announcement has been made to date and it is now late June. One can see how serious the condition of Lough Derg is, particularly in these weather conditions when there are fish kills in all our rivers.  No recommendation of the official report has been implemented.</P>
    <P>One move which has taken place recently is the announcement of a tertiary treatment plant in Athlone.  The lack of treatment plants and major sewage facilities in the towns along the Shannon has always been a big issue. This programme was launched within the past two or three weeks.  However, the efficiency test has not yet been conducted. I would be happy if the Minister told me it has been undertaken, even since the announcement of the launch of that plant, because an efficiency test must be carried out before such an operation can begin.  There could be a problem as regards training staff to operate the treatment plant properly, which applies at the lower end of the river in Ballina, the twin town of Killaloe.  Ballina is on the Tipperary side of the border and the Lakeside Hotel is located there.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to outline the outcome, if any, of the Government's discussions with the detergent companies because it has not been made public.  No legislation has been proposed, much less introduced, to deal with this issue.  This group has been told on more than one occasion &mdash; we respect it as the representative of all the interests on the lake shores &mdash; that action would be taken in this regard and that legislation <Col N="447" /> would be introduced.  However, nothing has yet been done.</P>
    <P>I was involved in the negotiations when I was Minister for Agriculture, although I do not claim credit for this. Teagasc said it would introduce a pilot scheme for the management and control of fertilisers in the regions around the lake.  A meeting was held in Nenagh with representatives of the farm organisations with a view to introducing a pilot programme to advise on the optimum spread of fertilisers.  Fertilisers are often spread uneconomically from the farmer's point of view because they use more than is necessary and this has disastrous consequences for the water courses.  I ask the Minister to outline, if possible, the latest outcome of the conference which took place.</P>
    <P>Under the current legislation local authorities are entrusted with the responsibility to protect the environment and control and sanction penalties against those who abuse it, but in many ways they are the biggest offenders.  I am not proud of the fact that the council in north Tipperary is unique in one sense.  It must be the only administrative county in Ireland which does not yet have the benefit of a technician with specific responsibility for pollution control.  From the sanction sought from his Department, is the Minister aware of any reason why that is the case?  If it is possible to rectify that situation through his direction, I ask him to do so.</P>

      <P>I have two more points to make before I conclude.  I mentioned the range of pollutants which are causing this problem.  If one visited beautiful Lough Derg now, one would see nothing but blue green algae all around the lake.  One could not touch, much less drink, the water from the lake &mdash; it has been there since time immemorial &mdash; that I knew as a child and in which I swam and from which I made tea when I was dapping.  Worst of all, nothing of any consequence was caught <Col N="448" /> during the latest mayfly dapping season as a result of the enrichment.  I understand that a large amount of dead bream have been noticed in the bays around the lake and that perch are practically non-existent for the last two years.</P>

      <P>The whole thing has become so disastrous that the main trout competition held there recently, in which 80 anglers participated, yielded only seven small trout.  That is not a measure of the value of this lake.  In terms of the farsighted legislation passed today, which I supported and will continue to support, the local anglers have left the lake and nobody swims in it any more.  Hardly anybody sails on it and whatever foreign visitors were coming to Lough Derg have deserted it completely.  For all the reasons stated, I ask the Minister to outline what action will be taken.</P>

      <P>The Lough Derg water quality report, which was launched in September 1993, was prepared by the environmental research unit at the request of the Lough Derg working group.  This group had broadly based representation from Shannon Development, Clare, Galway and Tipperary North Riding County Councils, in addition to Bord na Móna, the ESB, the University of Limerick and the private sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report found that phosphorus inputs to the lake were the main cause of the impairment of a number of beneficial uses of the water.  These uses <Col N="449" /> include in particular abstraction of water for public supply, recreational activities and game fishing.  The report sought to identify the sources responsible for these inputs and to quantify their respective contributions.  The principal sources involved were estimated to account for a total annual phosphate loading of 172 tonnes.  Some 37 per cent of this came from agriculture, 33 per cent from sewage discharges, 17 per cent from leaching from land and 11 per cent from industrial sources.</P>
    <P>The report's recommendations for reduced phosphate inputs to Lough Derg involve, in the first place, local responsibilities.  It is a matter for the county councils concerned to avail of their extensive planning and water pollution control powers to ensure a cleaner Lough Derg.  I understand the midwest regional authority is undertaking a co-ordinating role in this regard.  The Minister welcomes the active involvement of the authority, which is entirely consistent with the Government's commitment to expanding the role of these authorities.</P>
    <P>The Minister favours an integrated approach to water quality management, particularly in relation to lake catchments, and he trusts that the regional authority's involvement will facilitate appropriate follow up of the report's recommendations.  He is developing proposals separately in relation to lakes and will consider Lough Derg as a possible pilot project.  He will be announcing further details on this in the near future.</P>
    <P>The Minister regards Lough Derg as a priority case for action and welcomes initiatives taken locally to commission the ERU report and to put in place appropriate structures to oversee the implementation of its recommendations. Earlier this year the Minister had a most useful meeting with the Save Our Lough Derg action group.  He was impressed by the commitment of its members to ensuring the preservation of the lake as a high class amenity.  In developing its strategy, the regional authority should seek to harness this support in advancing practical measures <Col N="450" /> which will contribute to a reduction in polluting inputs to the lake.</P>
    <P>Some of the Lough Derg report's recommendations concern matters coming within the responsibility of central Government.  The Minister is committed to taking effective action which will complement measures locally as the following points indicate.  Approximately £20 million has been spent in recent years on sewage treatment in the catchment of the lake, including secondary treatment facilities for Athlone, Nenagh, Ballina, Ballinasloe, Birr and Tullamore, and phosphate removal facilities at Mountshannon and Athlone.</P>
    <P>An application for EU Cohesion Fund assistance for sewage treatment works in the catchment area, costing some £30 million, was submitted to the Commission in October 1994.  Proposals include schemes in Roscrea, Portumna, Clara, Ferbane, Castlerea, Moate, Scarriff, Athlone, Banagher, Killaloe as well as the upgrading of facilities and the installation of phosphorus removal at a number of other sites.  The Department is strongly promoting the Lough Derg application and anticipates approval soon.  During a recent meeting with Commissioner Monika Wulf-Mathies the Minister took the opportunity to impress upon her the importance of Lough Derg and pressed the case for early release of Cohesion Fund projects which can benefit the quality of the lake.</P>
    <P>Lough Derg has been designated a sensitive area under the Waste Water Treatment Regulations, 1994, which means that discharges must receive more stringent treatment than secondary treatment where the population equivalent of the discharge is greater than 10,000.  The Cohesion Fund application addresses these requirements.</P>
    <P>The Department is financing the provision by the relevant local authorities of 11 pump out facilities on the Shannon to service private boat users and hire cruisers.  Nine units are completed or nearing completion at present and the remaining units will be operational by early next year.  Discussions on a voluntary agreement to promote use of phosphate free detergents &mdash; an issue raised <Col N="451" /> by Senator O'Kennedy &mdash; are being finalised with the Irish Detergent and Allied Products Association and will conclude soon.  The position will then be assessed, including the need to avail of powers contained in the Waste Bill concerning restrictions or bans on substances such as phosphates in detergents. It is worth noting that 40 per cent of domestic detergents are currently phosphate free; none was so up to 1988.</P>
    <P>As regards pollution from agriculture, a number of important policy instruments are in place.  These include the rural environment protection scheme and the control of farmyard pollution scheme, which are the responsibility of the Minster for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  While applications under the latter scheme have been suspended, the Minister, Deputy Yates, has taken steps to identify priority applications on hand and to bring forward funding from later years so as to approve as many applications as possible.  He will also be pursuing possibilities of securing additional funds from other sources covered by the Community support framework and in the course of the mid-term review of CSF.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Howlin, is satisfied that everything possible is being done at national level to implement relevant <Col N="452" /> recommendations of the Lough Derg report.  Furthermore, he is confident that the major programme of works to be financed from the Cohesion Fund will give an important impetus to the process.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, will be announcing further details on Lough Derg as a possible pilot project in the near future.  The Minister told the deputation that an announcement would be made in May and then further stated an announcement would be made in early June.  As of now, we have no indication of any announcement of any programme. Could the Minister indicate, as a matter of urgency, when that will be done?</P>

      <P>As I said in my response to the Senator, the Minister spoke to the relevant Commissioner a short time ago and impressed upon her the urgency of the situation, outlined the difficulties of Lough Derg and has asked for an early release of funds.  Having spoken to the Minister today, I am sure that he is concerned at getting this initiative in place as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8 p.m until 10.30 a.m on Friday, 30 June 1995.</P>
