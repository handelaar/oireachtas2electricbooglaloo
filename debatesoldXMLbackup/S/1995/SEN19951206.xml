      <P>I have notice from Senator Mulcahy that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to make a statement in relation to the proposed physical education hall for St. MacDara's community college, Templeogue, given that the children attending this school have been deprived of proper physical education facilities and given that the promised funding for the design and planning phase of this hall announced on 6 April 1995 has not, as yet, been forthcoming.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Henry of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to publish the review of services to people with physical and sensory disabilities which was commissioned over three years ago.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Rory Kiely of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to provide assistance to the Neodata plant <Col N="910" /> in Newcastlewest and Kilmallock, County Limerick, which is due to close at Christmas.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to ensure that State agencies immediately find replacement industries following the closure of the Neodata factories in Newcastlewest and Kilmallock, County Limerick.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Sherlock of the following matter:</P>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Justice if she is satisfied with the criteria that apply to the granting of lottery licences.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator McGowan of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Government to recognise cross-Border structures where elected members from both sides of the Border come together to implement a development plan for the regions.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Henry's and Senator Mulcahy's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's business is items 1 and 13, motion 23.  I am anxious to finish Second Stage of the Harbours Bill, 1995, this week, either today or tomorrow.  If it has not been concluded by 6 p.m., perhaps the Whips could get together to see if we could continue it this evening or tomorrow afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader is aware of the interest in and concern surrounding the Harbours Bill, 1995, and we will arrange that the Whips get together to ensure that Second Stage is dealt with <Col N="911" /> this week.  I would like to raise two issues.  Senator McGowan has regularly asked that time be made available for a debate on funding for Border counties. In the light of President Clinton's successful visit and given that there are funds available under four headings &mdash; Structural Funds, the Delors package, the Clinton package and Exchequer funding &mdash; we would like to know how the Government intends to handle this funding.  If necessary, we will ask that a day be made available for a full discussion on this important issue.  The success of last week's visit and the existence of funding means this is an ideal opportunity to maximise funding for areas which have been deprived for a number of years.</P>
      <P>The Leader will be aware that we withdrew a Private Members' motion on hepatitis C. We did so on the understanding that negotiations were taking place with the Minister for Health. However, we have heard second hand that those negotiations are not progressing in the way we would want.  If that is the case, we will again ask the Leader to make time available so that Senators who have expressed an interest over the past number of months will be afforded an opportunity to discuss this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Leader succeeded in making arrangements for us to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the illegal annexation of East Timor by the Indonesians which will take place tomorrow?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Magner, the Chairman of the Joint Services Committee, for illuminating the grounds of the House and for the hospitality we received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Some were not invited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the hospitality was on a selective basis.  I was not aware that anyone on the Government side had been excluded.  I hope it does <Col N="912" /> not presage a disagreement as we approach the budget.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Leader's suggestion that the House should try to conclude Second Stage of the Harbours Bill this evening or tomorrow.</P>
      <P>Last week I raised the problem of the strength of the punt against sterling. Several expressions of concern were made about this matter during the week and as there are conflicting views in the House, it would be useful to debate this issue, perhaps in the context of a wider debate on the economy.</P>
      <P>I heard this morning that Ms Veronica Guerin has been awarded a major international award in journalism.  The House should congratulate her on her significant achievement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>In light of a recent judicial decision, will the Leader bring to the notice of the Minister for Justice the importance and urgency of introducing legislation to amend the anomalies in the sentencing laws, particularly those relating to sexual offences and rape?  It is a sad reflection on previous legislation and those implementing it that this is not viewed more seriously.  It is an urgent matter and I ask that the Leader bring it to the Minister's attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the positive reaction to President Clinton's achievements, particularly in respect of the right of children to be reared in an environment free from violence and intimidation &mdash; one of the great themes of his visit &mdash; will the Leader ask the Government to indicate its programme to ensure, in accordance with the Constitution, that all citizens are treated equally before the law?  Young people in this jurisdiction should be born and reared in a crime free environment but until that happens, particularly in deprived areas of this city, those young people will not receive the same treatment before the law under the Constitution. This is a serious issue and I ask the Government to consider it on the basis of introducing programmes in <Col N="913" /> housing, social welfare and education. Otherwise discrimination will exist.</P>
      <P>In relation to my former responsibility as Minister for Agriculture, there is a pressing need for the nation to consider the BSE scare in England, which is obviously affecting the consumption of beef there.  It is a delicate matter but the Government should arrange, by way of a special promotion in Britain, not just to reassure but to prove it is accepted by experts, researchers and other professionals that Ireland has taken all necessary action since the scare first arose in the UK to ensure we have a BSE free régime.  I hope the Government will take the opportunity to launch a major promotional programme in the UK.  Otherwise, Ireland is in danger of being associated with a country with which it has no connection in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Members recognise the importance of the prisoners to the peace process and I am sure the House welcomes the transfer, albeit on a temporary basis, of Mr. Patrick Kelly to Northern Ireland today.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Justice why the issue of the transfer of prisoners from England is so slow to progress?  What is the problem regarding the transfer of prisoners from Ireland to Great Britain or Northern Ireland, such as Mark Granaghan from Wheatfield to Great Britain and Edmond Harkin from Arbour Hill to Northern Ireland?  It is important to remember that many prisoners have for some time sought transfers.  Is it that they are not being accepted back? These prisoners were not involved in any paramilitary or political process. They are serving long-term sentences and are seeking transfers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Leader comment on the quarterly report issued by the Central Bank today?  It is a very bullish report which is unusual for the Central Bank.  It states there is 6 per cent growth in the economy this year and that we have finally got over the <Col N="914" /> phase of jobless growth.  It estimates there will be 38,000 new jobs this year and 47,000 next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Fishermen are going through a rough time at present.  In January 1996 the Spanish fleet will have access to the Irish box.  There are proposed cuts of up to 80 per cent in our mackerel fisheries which would completely devastate the Irish fleet and towns, such as Killybegs, Castle-townbere and Dingle.  About four years ago 20 licences were granted to fishermen to catch non-quota species of fish but quotas are to be imposed by the EU on those species, in particular monkfish. Fishermen are only allowed to catch one tonne of monkfish per month which is an impossibility.  Will the Leader arrange for the Minister for the Marine to come to the House to give us information to bring us up to date on what is happening in the fishing industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>With Senator Wright I wish to ask about the present state of negotiations between the Minister for Health and Positive Action in relation to the statutory tribunal.  It was my understanding that a month had been given to bring the negotiations to a successful conclusion and that period was up last Friday without a successful conclusion. The House was due to debate this issue a month ago.  I support the women in their call for a statutory tribunal; due to the circumstances of the case they should set the agenda.  It is important to many women that this matter is dealt with immediately and I would like to know the present state of negotiations.  Is a conclusion being reached?  If not, may we have a discussion on the matter in the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>We should send a note of congratulations to the staff of the Houses, in particular the Superintendent of the Houses, for last Friday's arrangements.  The Superintendent celebrated 40 years of public service last Friday; he joined the Army 40 years on <Col N="915" /> that day.  The House should send him a note of congratulations.</P>
      <P>When will the Minister be in the House to make a statement on the relief of flooding?  I know certain measures are in train but nobody knows exactly what is happening.  The people who were discommoded last year should have a statement from the Minister.  If he is not prepared to come to the House he should make a public statement through the media.</P>
      <P>Last Thursday the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Gay Mitchell, was in the House for statements on the Reflection Group for the Intergovernmental Conference. No material on the Reflection Group was avail to the Members of the House until we got copies of the Minister's speech.  A major report was published yesterday and we should have another debate on the matter, perhaps in the context of a debate on foreign affairs or the EU.</P>
      <P>When will we have a debate on the Defence Forces?  It is a matter of concern that the Oireachtas has not been afforded an opportunity to discuss the plans for the Defence Forces.  Leaks as to what will happen are widespread. The Leader should ask the Minister to come to the House for a debate on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange time for a debate on the European monetary union?  It was intended to cover the matter last week during our discussion on the Intergovernmental Conference but we did not have a chance to do so.  Senator Doyle referred to the importance of jobs and the growth in the economy this year and Senator Dardis referred to currency.  Both issues, and the situation in Irish Steel, pale into insignificance compared to the effect on our economy of the single currency and European monetary union. This is the matter the House should debate, with plenty of time allowed and not a last minute debate.  Our last debate on currency issues took place at <Col N="916" /> a time when we had very little opportunity to do anything.  I urge the Leader to find time for such a discussion in the very near future; we cannot afford to delay as matters are moving so fast and they have huge implications for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it possible for the Leader to get a review of the ongoing discussions on Irish Steel with the relevant Minister and the British Ministers? This and the other House should be informed about the seriousness of that ongoing situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the other speakers in marking with great joy the visit of President Clinton to Ireland.  I also wish to pay tribute to you, a Chathaoirligh, on an excellent, dignified and thoughtful speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Leave me out of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>We should take the opportunity of President Clinton's visit to renew our interest in some of the minutiae of the peace process.  This is a very critical time with the setting up of the international body on the decommissioning of arms which has to report in January.  Will the Leader make time available for a major debate or briefing of Senators on the peace process and Northern Ireland?  Perhaps that debate could be led by the Tánaiste who could also clarify his position on other issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>In common with Senator Gallagher, I was appalled to hear that the hands of a judge were tied on the issue of sentencing.  Could the Leader of the House arrange a debate on this issue?  Mr. Justice Carney made eminent good sense yesterday.  Everybody accepts that it was a very reasoned judgment and that he is bound by precedent. However, justice should not be spancelled by daft precedents.  Parents and others concerned about young people are very concerned by the message which came out yesterday.  I support the call for a debate on the issue of sentencing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="917" /> The Government has again indicated in press briefings over the last 24 hours that the Freedom of Information Bill has finally come through the Cabinet.  In furtherance of the promise which was made here on 7 June, will the Leader now set a date for the initiation of the debate on that Bill?  I have shown some forbearance in holding back the other Bill because I believe it is important that we get freedom of information and it does not matter from which side of the House the Bill comes.</P>
    <P>Will you, Sir, and the Leader do something about the appalling lack of balance in the RTÉ treatment of this House?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to discuss that matter here.  It would be more appropriately dealt with by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, on which the Senator has very good representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that but the reality is that the matter is not being paid any attention.  Last week, the Bill on securitisation was debated in this House and no Senator's contribution was shown on the RTÉ Oireachtas programme that night.  Yesterday, there was a major debate by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies on the ESB, to which the bulk of contributions came from Senators.  This morning, RTÉ&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that we can discuss that matter here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I am simply asking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Leader of the House has taken on board what the Senator said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Leader, and the leaders of the other groups in the House, remind RTÉ that there are two Houses in the Oireachtas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimTownsend" hpid="Mr. Townsend Mr. Townsend">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Townsend</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Lanigan's call for a debate on flooding. <Col N="918" /> Carlow was badly flooded last year; the Office of Public Works is carrying out a report and there are proposals for impact studies, etc.  If we had a debate we would know the up to date position, which would be helpful.  I am anxious to ensure that when money is allocated Carlow will receive its fair share.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the breakdown in negotiations between the British and Irish Governments on Irish Steel, could the Leader arrange a briefing for us by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Richard Bruton, on how the negotiations have progressed?  I say that out of consideration of the workers; 300 of them left work yesterday unsure of their future.  It is time a statement was made and it might be opportune to make it in this House.  The position is delicate and we appreciate the Government's efforts, but the workers are fearful for their future, especially in the run-up to Christmas.  I ask the Leader to bring the Minister to the House to explain the present negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Senator.  We are not discussing the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>It needs to be discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>President Clinton speeded up negotiations between Ireland and England; it would be embarrassing if we had to ask him to resolve the Irish Steel crisis also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to comment on a disturbing tendency in recent times.  One example is a reference by the Tánaiste to the US President, stating that he might not know who his parents were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>Withdraw that remark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>That might have been an off the cuff remark but I am concerned <Col N="919" /> about the attack by certain Ministers on an ardent pro-lifer.  Anyone who is pro life or anti-divorce gets attacked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all pro life.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>Not everyone is.  Mrs. Bruton was entitled to make her good, pro-family speech and I congratulate her on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>Mrs. Bruton is in serious trouble now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators on the other side are smiling at Senator Lydon's compliments to Mrs. Bruton &mdash; which I heartily endorse &mdash; and they will continue to smile after my contribution, concerning the EURATHLON programme for sport, which I raised on the Adjournment some weeks ago.  I ask the Leader to convey my thanks to the Minister, who raised the matter at this week's meeting of European Sports Ministers and, in response to my suggestion for an acknowledgement of the ethnicity of indigenous sports, such as Gaelic football and hurling, suggested that they be recognised under the programme. At present the programme operates a three member state ruling, which prevents sports without an international dimension &mdash; such as Gaelic football, hurling, camogie and handball &mdash; getting access to these funds.</P>
      <P>In that context I ask the Leader to give some time in the new session to a debate on sporting policy.  The Minister of State responsible for sport, Deputy Allen, has indicated in the media&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not discussing the matter now.  I understand the Senator is looking for time to discuss it and I am sure the Leader will take that on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="920" />
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask for clarification from the Leader &mdash; if not today, then at a future date &mdash; whether media reports that the Minister is formulating a policy on sport are accurate.  If so, perhaps the Minister would afford this House the opportunity to respond to the proposals and suggestions contained in that review.  The main thrust of my contribution is to thank the Minister not only for responding but for acknowledging that this House raised the issue, which Ministers do not always do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to convey to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment our acknowledgement of his determined and strenuous efforts on behalf of Irish Steel.  However, in view of the intransigence of the British representatives on this issue, he might consider having the debate raised at higher level by involving the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I begin my reply I am sure colleagues would like me to acknowledge in the House the presence of former Senator Ted Russell in the Public Gallery.  Mr. Russell was a very distinguished Member of this House for a long time and we are all very pleased to see him here today.</P>
      <P>On the Order of Business, I thank Senator Wright for his co-operation on the Harbours Bill.  We are all keen to move to Committee Stage as soon as possible.  On the question of the Border counties, if there are funding issues to be resolved it would be appropriate to discuss them in this House.  I will see if that can be done but I do not think it will happen before the recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to hepatitis C, the House would not want me to move on second hand reports while negotiations are still taking place.  We hope the negotiations will come to a successful conclusion and we will wait until that happens before going any further.  Senator Norris raised the issue of East Timor.  There will be a short series of statements tomorrow at 1 o'clock on this issue and the Tánaiste hopes to be present to make a brief contribution. <Col N="921" /> I thank the Senator for raising the matter.</P>
    <P>I find myself agreeing with Senator Dardis for the first time in weeks in complimenting Senator Magner, not just on his efforts today, but on the enormous boost he has given to the services of the House since he took over as Chairman of the Joint Services Committee. The improvements can be seen everywhere.  On the question of the punt and European monetary union which Senator Dardis and Senator Quinn raised, it will not be possible to have an economic debate as such between now and the recess but the Minister for Finance will be in the House for the Appropriation Bill before we rise and it should be possible to raise some of the issues at that stage.</P>
    <P>Senator Gallagher and Senator Roche raised the question of the anomalies in the sentencing laws.  Everybody would agree that Judge Carney did a great public service in his two judgments in the last couple of days.  I will convey the sentiments expressed to the Minister and it would be appropriate to discuss this issue in this House after the break.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy raised a number of points.  His remarks on the BSE scare in Britain were particularly helpful. There is a very strong sense that the British Government is very much at odds with itself on this issue.  We are all very conscious of the BSE-free status of Irish beef and of the need to protect our industry in the days and weeks ahead.  I will convey the very positive feelings of the House to the Minister in that regard.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry raised the transfer of prisoners generally and the transfer of specific prisoners.  I do not have any information on that but I will ask the Minister about it.  Senator Doyle mentioned the very bullish report of the Central Bank and we all agree that everybody has to be pleased about this. The report was hopeful and should please all Members.  Senator Fitzgerald mentioned the difficult times facing the fishermen and he made some very valid points.  I will convey these points to the Minister.  I know that he will take everything <Col N="922" /> the Senator says seriously.  We will try to have a debate on that early in the new year.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan mentioned the question of hepatitis C which has been dealt with already.  Everybody concurs with Senator Lanigan in paying tribute to the staff and Members of the House for the way in which they conducted business last week.  They were a credit to the House and deserve high praise.  The Minister will make a statement on the question of flooding before the end of the session.  I do not have the exact date yet but there will be time made available for statements.  I will see whether the full statement by the Minister on the Intergovernmental Conference can be made available.  I cannot give Members any information yet when there will be a debate on the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Senator Cregan, Senator Kelleher and Senator Sherlock raised the question of Irish Steel.  Everybody is aware of the enormous efforts being made by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and by his team in trying to have this matter resolved satisfactorily.  It may be that the issue has to be raised a notch or two higher and I am sure the Government is giving it top priority.  We all want to see this matter resolved as positively and as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>It is strange that I find myself in agreement with people with whom I have not agreed for a long time.  I join with Senator Mulcahy in complimenting the Cathaoirleach on his contribution during the visit of President Clinton last Friday.  The Senator asked for a briefing on the peace process in the new year and I will see what can be done.</P>
    <P>In regard to Senator Roche's comments, the Freedom of Information Bill is unlikely to come to this House before next Easter.  Like the Senator, I am unhappy with RTÉ's coverage of this House and those views will be noted and conveyed.  The issue of flooding was raised by Senator Townsend; that is currently being dealt with.</P>
    <P>I have noted Senator Lydon's comments. I refer the Senator to an incident in the House around 30 years ago when <Col N="923" /> the late Donogh O'Malley was reprimanded by the late Oliver Flanagan about the use of certain language, which will put the Tánaiste's comments into their proper context.</P>
    <P>I will convey Senator Mooney's thanks to the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Allen.  It shows that raising matters in this House can be effective.  The Minister is formulating a sports policy and is anxious to discuss it in this House at an early stage.  I have also noted Senator Sherlock's comments on Irish Steel.</P>
    <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>When this debate resumed in the House last week, a Senator claimed the tonnages handled by Limerick Harbour in 1994 was around 7 million tonnes, which was the second largest figure nationally after Dublin port.  This was an impressive figure but it did not ring true so I looked at the figures.  For the benefit of the House, I want to clarify the real situation. The impression may have been given that this 7 million tonnes was handled solely by the port of Limerick but if the figures are broken down, one will find a different situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total tonnages handled in the Shannon Estuary, apart from Foynes Harbour, was 7,044,000 tonnes.  The picture becomes clearer when these figures are broken down.  On the Clare side of the River Shannon, the ESB power generating station at Moneypoint imported 1,914,000 tonnes of coal.  The Shannon oil jetty, which is used for the importation of aviation fuel for Shannon Airport, handled 230,000 tonnes.  On the Kerry side, the ESB oil terminal at Tarbert imported 386,000 tonnes of heavy fuel oil.  The Aughinish Alumina jetty &mdash; it is located in the parish of Foynes and is 20 miles <Col N="924" /> from Limerick port to the south bank of the estuary &mdash; handled 4,065,000 tonnes. That leaves a balance of 449,000 tonnes handled by the port of Limerick.</P>
    <P>The breakdown of figures is even more startling when they are put into percentages.  For example, the tonnage handled at the Aughinish Alumina jetty &mdash; 4,065,000 tonnes &mdash; makes up 57.71 per cent of the total figure; the percentage for Moneypoint &mdash; 1,914,000 tonnes &mdash; is 27.17 per cent; the figure for Shannon oil jetty &mdash; 230,000 tonnes &mdash; is 3.27 per cent; the figure for the ESB Tarbert oil terminal &mdash; 386,000 tonnes, &mdash; is 5.48 per cent and the tonnage handled at Limerick docks, &mdash; 449,000 tonnes &mdash; is 6.37 per cent.  This is a slightly different aspect to the way it was presented.  I can now readily understand why the Minister changed the name of Shannon Port Company to Shannon Estuaries Port Company when the Bill was initiated, as this is more reflective of the Shannon Estuary.  The title is more appropriate.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to note that the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Barrett, acknowledged that the limits of Limerick Harbour had hitherto not been defined in any statute that could be traced.  I am sure my colleague will confirm this.  The Bill is useful in this respect as it will define the limits of Limerick Harbour for the first time.</P>
    <P>I had the pleasure of serving with the Minister at county council level and can testify to his ability and intellect.  He is a remarkable man.  I also served with the Minister of State, another man of superb articulation, enunciation and pronunciation.  The Minister has indicated that, based on the recent mediation between Foynes and Limerick Harbours, he will put down an amendment in the House to extend the limits of Foynes Harbour in accordance with the recommendations of the mediator.</P>
    <P>Foynes Harbour handled 1,414,000 tonnes of commodities in 1994, three times more than the port.  The extension to be given to Foynes, which will only be 4 per cent of the total estuary, will make for a very vibrant and competitive <Col N="925" /> environment in the Shannon Estuary in the years ahead as larger vessels become the norm.  This will serve the demands of Irish industry for the future, not alone in the mid-west region but on a national basis.</P>
    <P>With regard to the revenues and surpluses generated by the combined commercial installations on the whole estuary, the total gross revenue generated by these facilities in 1994 was £1,842,000 compared to the gross revenue for the Foynes Harbour for the same period of £1,989,000, or a greater overall income of £157,000.  The net surplus generated by all of the revenue generating facilities together was £212,000 in comparison to a stand alone figure of £793,000 generated by Foynes Harbour.  This represents a difference of well over £500,000 in favour of Foynes <i>vis-à-vis</i> all the others combined.</P>
    <P>Surely these figures indicate that Foynes Harbour is a market driven place.  It appears that the job Limerick has ahead of it is to compete with Foynes on a better basis and to tackle the problem.  Instead of being more management driven, Limerick would benefit if it was more market driven.  It has very good facilities, a very good harbour and a vibrant city.  More and more business could be done if it managed to get together a number of people, as Foynes did, and to get its act together.</P>
    <P>It was suggested in the House that ghosting was a problem for Foynes Harbour Trustees.  This is not true because the Foynes Harbour Trustees do not, or never have, employed dockers.  This is done by a company known as Foynes Pay Office Limited, which has no link with the Foynes Harbour Trustees. Nevertheless, the extraordinary success story of Foynes Harbour is due, in no small way, to the unstinting role played by dockers.  It is disingenuous, to say the least, to cast aspersions on a body of men who, in all kinds of weather conditions from extreme cold to degrees of heat, unload all kinds of material, including coal.</P>
    <P>The same applies to finance.  The reason Foynes is a success and a marker <Col N="926" /> for the country is that those involved go out and engage in research to get the business.  They have received no money from the State but they have always arranged investment on a joint venture basis with private enterprise and have always been successful in negotiating and repaying debts to commercial institutions. There is a great role here for Limerick to do likewise.  It can be done if, instead of depending even for pension plans on the State, those involved in Limerick should look for and generate the business.  Foynes did it with only a few people working hard and long hours and it can be done in other ports.</P>
    <P>The reason I am so pleased with Foynes is that it represents the type of endeavour we need on a national basis. We need it in Killybegs, and where people have done similar work for the fish industry, which is prominent there. People have gone out, sourced income and developed the harbour with their own resources.  I can think of a number of people who have done that &mdash; Séamus Tully of Western Seaboard Fishing Company and the Gallagher Brothers.  They have built everything with their own money and have progressed. Other harbour commissioners could do likewise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It has long been recognised that there is a need to regulate our harbours and prepare them for the 21st century.  I agree with what Senator Calnan said some weeks ago about the importance of local input in the management of local ports. There are many small fishing ports dotted around our coastline and there is a great need to develop them and our fishing industry.  However, my contribution will deal with the port of Foynes. In doing so I compliment Foynes Harbour Board on its excellent lobbying over the past six or seven months.  If everybody had as great an interest in their affairs as Foynes Harbour Board, much of the legislation going through the Oireachtas would be improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Foynes owes its charter to the Act of 1890.  Its area of jurisdiction was confirmed <Col N="927" /> in the Foynes Harbour Order, 1932, and has remained unchanged.  It should be understood that in 1890 when the jurisdiction of the harbour was set out, the average size of vessel was about 250 dwt.  The area of water within the limits fixed in 1890 was adequate for this size of vessel to anchor in safety. However, the port of Foynes has developed extensively over the past 30 years.  It is now on a par with Dublin and Cork with regard to the size of vessel that can be accommodated, which is approximately 36,000 tonnes dwt &mdash; a huge increase from 250 dwt &mdash; and few other ports in the State can facilitate this type of vessel.</P>
    <P>Foynes Harbour Trustees have increased trade to the port from 41,000 tonnes in 1963 to 1.4 million tonnes for the year ending 31 March 1995.  The number of trading vessels for the same period has increased from 32 to 300 and the net registered tonnage of vessels has increased in the same period from 20,000 to 850,000.  Foynes Harbour Trustees have spent £12.5 million over the past 25 years improving their marine and onshore facilities and in return have received a total of about £41,000 by way of State and EU grants.  Much of the money spent in Foynes has been generated in Foynes.  The money was spent on two new jetties, more land, increased warehousing, dredging and so forth.</P>
    <P>Foynes Harbour is one of the most competitive ports to operate from an economic and industrial relations point of view.  It is the only port on the west coast that has a direct rail link to the national rail system, with trains able to travel almost to the pier head.  It is also located on the N69, a national secondary road which councillors in Limerick County Council are hoping the National Roads Authority will upgrade to a national primary road or, at least, carry out substantial works to the road to render it capable of carrying more heavy vehicles to the port.  Employment in the port has increased from 30 in 1963 to 400 in 1995.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="928" /> Its value to the economy of Limerick and to the mid-west is not to be left at just that figure because many of the industries setting up in County Limerick will need the port of Foynes to import and export their goods.  It is evident that the growth and development of Foynes Harbour over the past 30 years has been phenomenal.  The present trustees, and their predecessors, used well all the money which came their way to improve the harbour.</P>
    <P>For Foynes to develop, it needs to accommodate larger vessels.  It is important that it can use the deep water immediately adjacent to the existing harbour at Mount Trenchard Point.  The port of Foynes has now developed to its maximum potential and it needs this extra space.  Further economic expansion and development can only be achieved if it can attain the use of this deep water.</P>
    <P>No other authority has plans for developing this water.  Foynes will only use approximately five miles of the total shoreline in the estuary, leaving 125 miles or so to be used by other port authorities.  Nobody can say Foynes is being greedy by looking for waters which it does not require; it is looking only for what it needs.</P>
    <P>A recent survey by H. R. Wallingford, International Marine and Navigational Surveyors, showed that berth occupancy on the jetties in Foynes is as high as 82 per cent during the winter trade peak. This can result in excessive waiting times to supply berths to ships which result in high moorage charges being levied by foreign ship owners on Irish importers and exporters.  This means that ships have to wait alongside Scattery Island with delay and demoorage costs as high as £6,000 per 24 hours delay on a vessel in excess of 15,000 dwt. It can take up to two and half hours to go from the port to the island and back.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that Foynes is allowed deep water where ships can moor while waiting to dock in the harbour.  Foynes has succeeded in attracting new industries to the port over the past 30 years <Col N="929" /> but it needs deep water to be able to continue doing so.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to hear that the Minister took on board the concerns of Foynes.  The limits imposed on the harbour in the original Bill were not sufficient for its needs.  The Minister appointed a mediator to examine the dispute between Foynes and Limerick.  I will outline the terms of reference under which the mediator, Mr. Murphy, worked.  This is important in the light of the contribution by Senator O'Sullivan. In a letter to Foynes Harbour Trustees, the Minister set out the conditions under which Mr. Murphy would operate. The letter stated:</P>
    <P>The Minister would like to propose Mr. Patrick Murphy to act as independent mediator.  As you know, Mr. Murphy, who acted as Chairman of the Commercial Harbours Review Group, is Chairman of Minch Norton and Managing Director of Irish Malt Products Ltd.</P>
    <P>Terms of reference, as approved by the Minister, are attached...</P>
    <P>The letter lists the terms of reference, which are:</P>
    <P>To examine the application from Foynes Harbour Trustees for an extension of the limits of Foynes Harbour in the interests of the better management, control and operation (including the safe and proper navigational and technical handling) of vessels using the Port of Foynes and development of the harbour and approach channels thereto;</P>
    <P>To discuss the application in detail with Foynes Harbour Trustees;</P>
    <P>To discuss the application in detail with Limerick Harbour Commissioners;</P>
    <P>To assess the cases put by both parties; in this regard to avail of any technical or other assistance or advice as the mediator may decide;</P>
    <P>To decide on the application from Foynes Harbour Trustees and to <Col N="930" /> make a recommendation on the matter.</P>
    <P>I want to highlight part of the terms of reference which states &ldquo;(including the safe and proper navigational and technical handling) of vessels using the Port of Foynes&rdquo;.  This means the mediator's job is to ensure that all safety standards are adhered to.  We assume the Minister had full confidence in the mediator appointed.  As no one suggested otherwise, we must accept that the proposals submitted by the mediator to the Minister, which were agreed in advance by Foynes Harbour Trustees, took into account all aspects of the dispute between Limerick Harbour Commissioners and Foynes Harbour Trustees and the safety aspect as well.  The recommendations from the mediator, which Senator Neville may have read, state:</P>
    <P>I have now concluded my investigations into the application of Foynes Harbour Trustees for an extension of jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>I recommend that increased jurisdiction be granted to Foynes Harbour Trustees as follows:</P>
    <P>The limit to the east, consisting of the entire area below high water mark lying between an imaginary line drawn from Dernish Point to Gammarel Point, should remain unchanged.  [Foynes Harbour Trustees agreed to this but they had hoped for something better.]</P>
    <P>The limit to the west, consisting of the entire area below high water mark lying between an imaginary line drawn from Battery Point on Foynes Island and a point in the Estuary North of the White River at Loghill, being 7.4 cables South of the County Clare Coast, as per the attached map, should be granted to Foynes Harbour Trustees by way of increased jurisdiction, to enable them to expand logically and to cater efficiently for expected future imports and exports.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="931" /> This proposal extends the present western limit of Foynes Harbour which is bounded by an imaginary straight line drawn from a point 168 metres west-north-west of Foynes Rock to a point due north thereof in the townland of Foynes Island.</P>
    <P>The proposed new area of jurisdiction is bounded by a line 4.0 cables west of Battery Point to a point in the Estuary from which a line is drawn south-west to a point 2.8 cables north of the Limerick coast between Poultallin Point and Mount Trenchard Point, from which point the line proceeds south-west to a point 2.8 cables north of Mount Trenchard Point, from which it continues south-west to the point north of Loghill, which is 7.4 cables south of the County Clare Coast, and meridian 9 degrees 12 minutes west of Greenwich, where it is bounded to the south-west by a line passing south through the mouth of the White River at Loghill.</P>
    <P>Although this recommendation only gives Foynes approximately 50% of the increased jurisdiction they requested, I feel it is the only fair and balanced solution to the dispute between the two parties concerned, and I am convinced that if you decide to implement my considered recommendation, we will see an even healthier, more efficient, competitive environment for international trade in the Shannon Estuary in future years.</P>
    <P>These recommendations were signed by Mr. Patrick J. Murphy on 15 November 1995.  In his Second Stage speech the Minister said:</P>
    <P>I am pleased to be able to advise the House that I have accepted the mediator's recommendation and that I propose introducing an amendment on Committee Stage to redefine the limits of Foynes Harbour.</P>
    <P>I would ask that the Minister's word be adhered to.  Although fears were <Col N="932" /> expressed by my colleague Senator O'Sullivan in this House last week, they were in many ways unfounded.  I would like to answer some of the points she raised, including whether large Panamax ships will be able to manoeuvre in the estuary, and her concerns about bad weather and strong currents in the estuary.</P>
    <P>The mediator's recommendations leave a clear five cables, or 3,000 feet width, to the north for ships to pass each other in this very safe stretch of water. When one considers that the beam of Panamax ships is in the region of 110 to 130 feet, and that of a Cape sized ship between 140 and 160 feet, simple arithmetic demonstrates that ships can safely pass each other in the estuary.  In fact, it has been said that four Cape sized ships, side by side, could pass each other in safety at one point.</P>
    <P>A study of maps of the area shows that there is a considerable amount of deep water between the limit suggested by the mediator, Mr. Murphy, and the Clare coast.  To the north of the limit set on Foynes there is quite deep water practically to the Clare coast.</P>
    <P>Meteorological records show that bad weather and poor visibility are rarely experienced in the Shannon Estuary.  In the past, Foynes would not have been chosen as the port for flying boats if there had been a history of fog and poor visibility.  The estuary is known for its clear visibility.  True there are currents but they are predictable and any good pilot knowing their strength can manoeuvre around them.</P>
    <P>In any case, before ships can reach that stretch of water north of Foynes they have to pass the Tarbert race with currents running at five knots in a much narrower and meandering channel. Further on from Foynes and closer to Aughinish pier they have to negotiate between two rocks marked by buoys.</P>
    <P>To the east and west of the Foynes stretch of water there are danger points for ships but to my knowledge there has never been a serious accident in the estuary.  If you can negotiate a danger to the right or left it is foolish to suggest <Col N="933" /> that you will suddenly encounter a danger in the middle which is totally safe.</P>
    <P>The new limits granted to Foynes will not impose added hazards for navigation. On the contrary, if the limits are not set as proposed by the mediator the danger to ships berthing outside and waiting to unload at Foynes will be greater.  At that point they are outside the jurisdiction of the harbour master who, for their safe conduct, needs to have control of ships from the time they leave the main channel until their arrival at the port of Foynes.</P>
    <P>Foynes itself needs this added jurisdiction so that it can install permanent mooring buoys to cut down on ships' waiting time.  If a ship was in danger and needed to move to any other port in the estuary, thus using the water that would technically belong to Foynes, good navigational practice and co-operation between the two bodies would ensure the safety of everybody using the estuary.</P>
    <P>The Minister may need to look again at the role of harbour masters and their need to be present at board meetings. The harbour masters do not want voting rights at the table but they are anxious because their role extends to other legislation. Among other things, they have a role to play in the context of dangerous substances and they have duties over and above those defined in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Their expertise may be of vital importance to any board making a decision about the safety of cargo coming into the port.  Their opinion is sought because they would be more aware of the relevant legislation than board members.  It is vitally important that the harbour masters' professional opinion should be sought at all times.  If they are excluded it would add a safety hazard to the operation of harbours, particularly the larger ones which deal with such a variety of cargoes.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State for his attention and I hope he will take on board some of the points that have been made.  I look forward to an amended Bill on Committee Stage that will <Col N="934" /> address, particularly from my constituency's point of view, the needs of Foynes Harbour.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  This is the first opportunity I have had to welcome him since he became a Minister of State and I wish him well.</P>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this Bill and when I have concluded, I am sure there will be no doubt in anyone's mind that Senator Kelly and I come from the same constituency.  The purpose of the Bill is to restructure the management framework of port authorities by establishing State commercial companies to manage the 12 bigger ports.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for the setting up of commercial State companies to manage and operate the ports of Arklow, Cork, Drogheda, Dublin, Dundalk, Foynes, Galway, New Ross, Shannon, Waterford and Wicklow.  At present these ports are managed by harbour authorities in accordance with the Harbours Act, 1946.  The new companies will be formed and registered under the Companies Act and the State will be the sole shareholder in each company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Existing harbour boards range in number from nine to 29 members and comprise representatives of local authorities, chambers of commerce, trade union interests, IBEC, the livestock trade, shipping and ministerial nominees. The view taken by the review group was that structures of this nature &mdash; large representative authorities comprising up to 29 members &mdash; were no longer attuned to the competitive requirements of a modern port and were not the most effective way of managing ports.  The group recommended that the board of directors of new port companies should have seven members, including employee representations, the chairman and chief executive.  It further recommended that the non-executive director should be appointed by the Minister with a five year term of office and should be drawn from the commercial sector and that persons with a <Col N="935" /> vested business interest in the affairs of the port should not be given representations.</P>
    <P>However, I understand that following publication of the review group's report, there were numerous requests for a continuation of the existing representations. Having considered the matter, the Government decided that the number of directors of each company should not be more than 12 and that three local authority members should be appointed to each port company.</P>
    <P>I am pleased this decision was taken because local authority members who were appointed to boards contributed to the successful operation of these ports. There are members of local authorities on the board in Foynes and I am sure the Minister recognised their contribution and value.  A Member of the Oireachtas cannot be a member of the board of State companies but that has never worried me.  A colleague said he did not know whether it was a good or a bad thing to exclude members of local authorities but I am sure they will continue to contribute to the successful running of these boards.</P>
    <P>A new Harbours Bill is long overdue. It is 50 years since the last legislation was enacted.  That legislation was introduced by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr. Lemass, and many famous names contributed, including General Mulcahy, John A. Costello, Maurice Dockrell and Senators Kingston and Sweetman; it got a fair airing. At that time ports were under the jurisdiction of the Minister for Industry and Commerce but there is now a Department of the Marine which was established by Charles Haughey when he was Taoiseach.  We must congratulate him on that because a Minister for the Marine was seen as essential at the time given of the contribution of ports and the marine to the economy.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been threatened for a long time and attempts have been made to amend the 1946 legislation.  A Harbours Bill was introduced in 1986 by the then Minister of State at the Department <Col N="936" /> of Communications, Deputy Nealon. The purpose of that Bill was to provide for the setting up of a unified harbour authority to be known as the Shannon Ports Authority to take over the management and operation the existing harbours of Limerick and Kilkrush together with the publicly owned piers Tarbert, Saleen, Kilteery and Clarecastle in the Shannon Estuary.  The proposed new authority was to exercise jurisdiction over all the waters of the Shannon Estuary from Sarsfield Bridge in Limerick to a line drawn from Kerry Head to Loop Head, excluding Foynes Harbour.  The Bill was to provide enabling powers for the future amalgamation of Foynes with the new authority.</P>
    <P>There was opposition to that provision. Foynes Harbour Trustees were established in 1890 under the Foynes Harbour Order which laid down the existing jurisdiction of Foynes Harbour, which consists of one mile of water on the southern bank of the Shannon Estuary. This area of jurisdiction was confirmed in the Foynes Harbour Order, 1932, and has remained unchanged for over 100 years.  The port of Foynes has been developed extensively over the past 30 years.</P>
    <P>Foynes Port is on a par with Dublin and Cork in relation to the size of vessel that can be accommodated, which is approximately 36,000 dwt.  No other port in the State can facilitate this size vessel.  Foynes Harbour Trustees have increased trade through the port from 41,000 tonnes in 1963 to 1,414,000 tonnes for the year ended 31 March 1995.  The number of trading vessels for the same period has increased from 32 to 300 and the net registered tonnage of vessels has increased for the same period from 20,000 to 850,000.  Over the past 25 years Foynes Harbour Trustees have expended a sum of £12.5 million improving its marine and onshore facilities and has only received a total of £1.3 million by way of State-EU grants, which represents 10.4 per cent of capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="937" /> Because of the success prior to 1986, I opposed the provisions in the Bill which provided enabling powers for the full amalgamation of Foynes with the new authority.  I was the only Member of the Seanad from west Limerick at the time and I am delighted that there are other Members from that area to help me with this Bill.</P>
    <P>I moved amendments on Committee Stage to rectify an anomaly.  Section 13 stated that Minister could by order dissolve Foynes Harbour Trustees on a date specified in the order.  The Minister did not accept my amendment on that occasion.  However, before the Bill concluded the Dáil was dissolved &mdash; God forbid it should happen on this occasion &mdash; and that is why this legislation is before us.</P>
    <P>I welcome the limits of the jurisdiction of Foynes Harbour.  The Minister said that following publication of the Harbours Bill, 1995, he appointed Mr. Patrick J. Murphy to act as independent mediator between Limerick Harbour Commissioners and Foynes Harbour Trustees in the matter of an application from Foynes for an extension of its area of jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>At present Foynes controls only a small area of water in the immediate vicinity of the harbour.  An extension of the limits of Foynes Harbour would involve an encroachment on the area over which Limerick Harbour Commissioners have exercised jurisdiction. The limits of Limerick Harbour have never been defined in any statute which can be traced.  However, Limerick Harbour Commissioners have exercised jurisdiction over the Shannon Estuary, with the exception of the harbours of Foynes, Cappa Pier at Kilrush, Glin, Tarbert and Kildysart.</P>
    <P>The mediation process commenced in October and the mediator's report and recommendation were received on 16 November 1995.  The mediator has recommended that the western limit of Foynes Harbour be extended and that the extension should comprise the entire area below the high water mark lying between an imaginary line drawn <Col N="938" /> from Battery Point on Foynes Island and a point in the estuary north of the White River at Loghill.  The Minister said he was pleased to be able to advise the House that he had accepted the mediator's recommendation and that he proposed to introduce an amendment on Committee State to redefine the limits of Foynes Harbour.</P>
    <P>This is most welcome for the Foynes Harbour Trustees and I understand they are happy to accept the recommendation. It is not what they sought as they wanted jurisdiction of a wide area of the Shannon.  However, they are happy to accept the mediator's decision and I presume other interests in the Shannon Estuary are also happy in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Shannon Estuary runs from Limerick to the mouth of the Shannon river, that is, between Loop Head and Kerry Head.  Given that both shores are 65 miles in length, the total shoreline is 130 miles.  The jurisdiction of Foynes harbour shoreline will be five miles from that total.  This may not appear fair but the Foynes Harbour Trustees are prepared to accept the mediator's recommendation. I am sure the House will agree this is most magnanimous on their part.</P>
    <P>The Foynes Harbour Trustees sought an extension of their limits for the following reasons: the proper management and control in respect of navigation, safe handling and operation of vessels, guard walls and insulation of the port; to provide safe moorings, anchorages for the size of vessels using the port within the extended limits of jurisdiction; and the provision of future deep water berthage within the extended limits for the continued and proper commercial development of the port.  Since the mediator's report was announced some concerns have been expressed about safety.  I understand these points were considered by the mediator, Mr. Patrick J. Murphy, when he examined the request of Foynes Harbour for an extension of its limits.</P>
    <P>The first matter to note is that the limits for Foynes Harbour recommended by the mediator in his report of <Col N="939" /> 15 November 1995 were accepted by the Minister in introducing the Bill and they are not the limits originally sought by Foynes.  When the accepted limits are put before the House on Committee Stage.  I am certain Members will be reassured on the question of safety which licensed pilots on the river raised with the mediator.</P>
    <P>In his report to the Minister, the mediator indicated he was satisfied the new limits for Foynes Harbour would not pose any safety risks to incoming or outgoing ships navigating the esturial channel for destinations other than Foynes Harbour.  The Minister said the Bill would not only extend the limits of Foynes but would enshrine for the first time ever the limits of Limerick Harbour. This clear definition of jurisdiction of the Shannon Estuary will contribute to the safety of operations there.  For the first time control and responsibility in the river will be clearly defined.</P>
    <P>It is important to note in relation to the safety of operations in this part of the Shannon Estuary that a ship navigating there, whether in the limits of Foynes or Limerick Harbours, will be under the pilotage of a qualified person appointed for the pilotage district.  In addition, it will be subject to directions by the appropriate harbour master.  The harbour limits recommended by the mediator and accepted by the Minister will separate ships manoeuvring to use Foynes Harbour from ships in passage through the estuary.</P>
    <P>It has long been recognised by the United Nations International Maritime Organisation that the best way to avoid collisions between ships is to keep them on separate routes rather than relying on the tactical rules to ensure they avoid each other.  Apart from the need to keep ships manoeuvring to use Foynes Harbour separate from those passing through the estuary, there is also the need to keep the ships passing through the estuary clear of any berths which may be developed by Foynes.</P>
    <P>In relation to large vessels in the channel bound for Aughinish Alumina, <Col N="940" /> it must be recognised that equally large vessels will be bound for Foynes Harbour. They must share the waterway. The waters within the limits of Foynes Harbour will be available for use by vessels bound for Aughinish Alumina should they wish or need to use them, much as the waters of the rest of the estuary are available to ships bound for Foynes.  However, at this part of the estuary, the deepest and safest waters are to the north side of the channel away from Foynes Harbour.  Rineanna Peak Point on the County Clare coast is lit and presents no danger to ships passing close.  The currents there are predictable as they are away from the confluence of the Foynes Island channel with the main channel.</P>
    <P>It must be recognised that this is one of the safest stretches of the estuary.  It is eight cables wide at this point, which is approximately one statute mile in width, and has no shoals except for ships entering Foynes.  It is sheltered from the sea and rarely has fog, which is one of the reasons it was used as a flying boat base for transatlantic aircraft before Shannon Airport was built.  Senator Kelly also mentioned this benefit.  The Meteorological Office records of recent years for the Shannon Estuary confirm this point.</P>
    <P>The limits recommended by the mediator and accepted by the Minister leave a clear five cables, half a nautical mile, to the north for ships to pass without crossing the new limits for Foynes. Only two cables of the available width is given to Foynes for the direction of moorings and for ships manoeuvring to use these facilities, although clearly such ships will have use of the Limerick Harbour waters just as those bound for Limerick will be free to use the Foynes waters.  A fairer division might have been &mdash; as Foynes originally sought &mdash; if the mediator had fixed the limits in the middle of the waterway, thereby allocating a four cable width to ships passing through the estuary and four cables to Foynes Harbour.  Limerick Harbour, supported by licensed pilots, <Col N="941" /> want all the water, leaving nothing for Foynes.</P>
    <P>Foynes Harbour is a success story and wishes to achieve further development. At all times, it provided suitable industrial facilities to port users in terms of land warehouse facilities and other support services in order to carry on commercial activities in both areas.  It was stated earlier that significant development within the port area has been carried out over the years.  At present, some seven hectares, that is 17 acres, are available as service land.  There is a proposal for an additional 60 hectares, that is 150 acres, from Irish Cement Limited for land in the east of the current development area.</P>
    <P>The trustees have also entered negotiations with Limerick County Council towards the provision of land for a road corridor to link the port with the national primary route, the N69, on the eastern side of the village of Foynes. Such a link would avoid heavy port traffic through Foynes and create proper and ordered development of the areas adjacent to the harbour.  My colleagues from west Limerick, Senator Neville and Senator Kelly, have appealed to the National Roads Authority &mdash; I am sure they have also made appeals through their membership of Limerick County Council &mdash; to make provision to improve that national primary route which connects Foynes to the main routes.  They also pointed out that Foynes is already served by a rail link to the harbour which is used by port users for carrying oil, molasses, animal feed, fertilisers and coal.  Potential future development would also be served by this rail link.</P>
    <P>Foynes has a justifiable case.  It sought jurisdiction to which it thought it was entitled.  It did not receive it originally and the mediator was asked to review the situation.  He did so and recommended the five mile shore, from a point in Foynes island to a point in the White River.  The White River is only a small river but it has been mentioned here so often it will become well known. <Col N="942" /> It is only reasonable that the Minister would accept the mediator's recommendation.</P>
    <P>Another purpose of the Bill is to set up a commercial State company to manage and operate Dún Laoghaire Harbour which is at present operated by the Department of the Marine.  I am sure the Minister and the Minister of State will welcome that provision as they are from that constituency.</P>
    <P>There are many concerns about presumed anomalies from areas other than Foynes.  In the Waterford and New Ross areas a similar case arises; New Ross is on the River Barrow and Waterford is on the River Suir but the rivers meet before they reach the sea.  There are concerns about unfair charges but I am sure the Minister will address these and arrive at a satisfactory conclusion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome my constituency colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Gilmore.  The marine brief is being well looked after by people from Dún Laoghaire &mdash; the Minister, Deputy Barrett, the Minister of State and recently the former Minister, Deputy Andrews.</P>
      <P>Listening to the last speaker I thought this was a Foynes Bill but there have obviously been many representations from that area to Members of the House which is a good indication that people are actively interested in the Bill but there has also been extensive correspondence from other areas and I am sure the Minister will take the various points made on board.</P>
      <P>Although there are some provisions relating to companies and pilotage, the Bill could be roughly divided in two main elements.  The first deals with the ports of Arklow, Cork, Drogheda, Dublin, Dundalk, Foynes, Galway, New Ross, Shannon, Waterford and Wicklow. The second is more pertinent to me and the Minister of State in that it is dealing with operation of Dún Laoghaire Harbour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is 50 years since the Harbours Act, 1945, was debated in the Houses.  The extensive changes in this Bill are overdue <Col N="943" /> and are to be welcomed.  Representations made by interested parties around the country should be taken on board.  The Minister has gone some way towards meeting their demands and concerns.  Like others I was lobbied in connection with this Bill.  I accept what the Minister said with regard to accepting the mediator's report.  If Foynes is to get certain concessions I hope they will not be to the disadvantage of any other port and that what is agreed will be a success and that boards will not disagree with each other.  Ultimately, I hope the harbours and their users will be the beneficiaries.  I am sure the Minister has taken on board the various points made.  Foynes has had extensive mention in this debate.  We have had a broad debate and the Minister indicated he would be accepting the mediator's report.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker referred to safety in ports and this must be looked at.  There have been too many accidents at sea.  Recently there was a tragedy on the west coast and while there was a fatality in a recent tragedy on the east coast that could have been much worse. Safety at sea and the accidents that occur during the holiday season in particular must be kept in mind.  I am sure the Minister readily agrees that steps must be taken to tighten up safety and checks.  On a motor car a faulty tyre or faulty engine often brings the vehicle to a stop but where boats are concerned the consequences can be much more serious.</P>
    <P>Recent changes have been brought about in the operation of Dún Laoghaire Harbour and in that respect I compliment the Minister and the Minister of State, and the previous Minister, Deputy Andrews.  Despite concerns and objections what is happening in Dún Laoghaire will stand the test of time.  The development of the harbour with the new ferry terminal will be of great importance to those using the harbour for travel or freight purposes.  I support what the Ministers have done in trying to strike the right balance for port usage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="944" /> I pay tribute to those who were involved in the harbour works through the years and those who will bridge the gap with the new harbour company. Some of these people are near retirement or are availing of a redundancy or early retirement package and I hope they will be adequately looked after.</P>
    <P>I was concerned to hear the Minister say on Second Stage that in some areas there seems to be an acute shortfall in relation to pension plans.  I do not think this relates to Dún Laoghaire but the Minister might alleviate any fears in his reply.  We are all concerned about people who have paid into pension funds as, in the past, in certain companies we have seen shortfalls of funds in relation to the provision of pensions. Those who have given years of their lives to companies and are soon facing retirement do not want to be suddenly faced with having to retire on a very inadequate pension.  Pensions can be small enough without an extra shortfall.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister clarify the situation in relation to Dún Laoghaire and the other areas mentioned?  I understand that the Exchequer will make up the shortfall but it is important to state emphatically that there will be no danger of people being short changed.  I presume that the status of the staff and their various pensions and benefits will automatically pass with them when they move to the new company in Dún Laoghaire and that any losses will be made up by the Department.</P>
    <P>It has been mentioned that the harbour police will also transfer.  I pay tribute to the work they have done but there have been concerns at times about people being attacked on the west and east piers of Dún Laoghaire Harbour. Is the Minister satisfied that there is an adequate number of harbour police in this area?  The piers are very popular throughout the year, particularly during the summer, and are used from morning until night.  Does the Minister think there should be greater liaison between the harbour police and the Garda Síochána?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="945" /> For many people Dún Laoghaire is the gateway to Ireland.  I hope there will be a greater tie-up between this new company, Dún Laoghaire Chamber of Commerce and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council in promoting Dún Laoghaire as a great tourist area. With the new road network coming on stream, many people will start their holidays at Dún Laoghaire and the Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company should help to promote the area in conjunction with the chamber of commerce and the county council, which is doing a great deal to attract extra tourists.</P>
    <P>When the board is being established due consideration should be given to getting the right people &mdash; and I do not mean having specific political affiliations &mdash; who will be truly representative of the area, with the chamber of commerce, county council, worker directors, the tourist trade and so on represented.  In that way, we can be assured that the board will comprise the best people for the job.  I will not address the pros and cons of the Dún Laoghaire and Dublin ports because there is enough traffic for both. However, I hope the best people will be appointed to Dún Laoghaire Harbour Board &mdash; people who will have the good of the area at heart, people with the vision to plan for the future, people with the experience and the ability to deal with every problem.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to listen to the points made in relation to various areas. Questions have been raised about Foynes, New Ross, Waterford and other areas.  I am sure that the Minister will take the points on board and respond as positively as he can.  I thank the Irish Shipping Agents' Association which has certain concerns.  I received correspondence from all over the country in recent weeks, each with their own local case to make.  I am sure the Minister and his officials have been made aware of these cases and I hope they will respond positively to the matters which have been raised.  I support the Bill and matters <Col N="946" /> which require clarification or amendment can be dealt with on Committee or Report Stages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Minister of State.  We all welcome the Minister's initiative in bringing forward this legislation.  Disagreement, such as it is, seems to be on the detail of the Bill. I do not propose to go down the road which has been well trodden by my colleagues, particularly my friend and colleague Senator Rory Kiely, who, as one who comes from that area and represents it so well, articulated far better than I could the concerns which have been expressed by the Foynes Harbour Trustees and those from New Ross.</P>
      <P>Coming from an inland county, I cannot begin to fully appreciate and understand the passions and emotions aroused by legislation which impinges to a greater or lesser degree on long standing practices.  I am sure the Minister would agree that one of the purposes of this Bill is to consolidate a great deal of legislation in this area.  It finally defines territories and boundaries as well as functions, which have been long sought by individual harbour boards.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to read the full page of Acts referred to in the Bill.  The earliest legislation dates back to the Napoleonic Wars of 1815.  If the Minister is so inclined, he might clarify to what British statute 55 Geo. 3, c.191 of 1815 relates. I do not wish to have his hard pressed staff scurrying around looking for it but it would be of historical interest to know how it relates to this Bill.  From my discussions with a number of people on both sides of the issue, I gather the main legislation in this area was enacted towards the latter part of the last century and that this Bill will tidy up many of the loose ends from 1895 which were not addressed in the post-war harbours Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also record my appreciation of the marvellous work done by representatives of the harbour authorities in Limerick, Foynes, New Ross and Waterford. I single out my friends and colleagues Councillor John Griffin from Rathkeale <Col N="947" /> and Councillor Kevin Sheehan from Askeaton, who have been of tremendous help in informing me, as a landlubber, of the intricacies of the Bill and giving their perspective on the controversy on boundary limits and jurisdiction which the Minister will address. I add my voice to those who have impressed on the Minister the need to clear up this matter once and for all.  We await his final decision but he has given certain indications which are now a matter of public record through correspondence with the various interests, particularly those associated with Foynes.</P>
    <P>It is important to record the conclusions of the Foynes representatives to which it is difficult to find objections. A submission on behalf of the Foynes Harbour Trustees states:</P>
    <P>The mediator in his report to the Minister indicated he was satisfied the new limits for Foynes Harbour would not pose any safety risks for incoming or outgoing ships navigating the Estuarial Channel for destinations other than Foynes Harbour.</P>
    <P>Another telling remark was made in this submission, with which none of us could take umbrage, least of all the Minister. It is a simple straightforward statement of fact:</P>
    <P>Historically the Estuary has been shared by all who live there.  It has to be shared now and in the future.</P>
    <P>That is the nub of this debate, irrespective of the turf war which seems to have broken out between Limerick and Foynes.  One can find a parallel with the discussions towards eventual peace in this island.  Geographically this is one entity, notwithstanding our differences. We will have to work them out as we all live on one island.  Compromise is the key in that area as much as this.</P>
    <P>My bias would be with the people from Foynes as they have not got everything they wanted, whereas the people from Limerick want everything and refuse to accept less.  Fair compromise should win the day.  The strength of the <Col N="948" /> mediator's report, in coming down on that side, speaks for itself.  The questions raised about large vessels, channels and safety have been dealt with in great detail.  Senator Kiely put them eloquently on the record and I do not intend to repeat them.</P>
    <P>I was interested in the historical context in which Foynes came to public notice.  As a youngster I was fascinated by the terminology of Rineanna and Foynes &mdash; I thought they were somewhere in the north Atlantic and not part of Ireland, because they sounded so exotic, especially in the context of flying boats and air travel.  It was wonderful grist to a child's imagination.  It is said that one learns something new every day and going through these briefing documents I learned that the main reason Foynes was used for airships was that it was devoid of fog and was a sheltered inlet, which was extremely important in the days before radar.  For that reason it was used as a flying boat base for transatlantic aircraft before Shannon Airport was built.</P>
    <P>The message on this issue has been fully put to the Minister and I will not bore either him or the House with it other than to record my support for the concepts as outlined by the Foynes representatives and the strength of the mediator's recommendations.  I also note a letter dated 17 November from Mr. J.F. O'Malley, secretary of Foynes Harbour Trustees, to Ms Noreen O'Mahony of the commercial harbours section of the Department of the Marine, which states:</P>
    <P>I could understand from our telephone conversation today that the appropriate amendment for the Foynes Harbour Trustees jurisdiction extension will be incorporated in the amendments which will be placed before the Seanad.</P>
    <P>We look forward to the Minister delivering on that commitment, if commitment it is.</P>
    <P>The dispute between New Ross and Waterford seems just as intractable.  I wish the Minister well because he will <Col N="949" /> need the wisdom of Solomon to deal with it, especially in regard to costings; whether New Ross should pay more than it does and whether the fact that Waterford is seeking more money from New Ross for less use of its services means that New Ross will trade at a competitive disadvantage.  Waterford Chamber of Commerce's submission states that there is no problem.  New Ross Harbour Commissions state that there is a problem relating primarily to finance.</P>
    <P>As a caveat, I welcome the recent announcement of significant EU funding for the development of New Ross and Dún Laoghaire Harbours.  This is long overdue.  I could never understand why, as an island nation, we seemed to deny this reality, even to the extent of our low consumption of fish, yet in many other ways we suffer the negative effects of living on an island; we have an island mentality and we are not always as outward looking as we should be.</P>
    <P>New Ross has a legitimate argument. Ships bound for that port must pass through part of Waterford Harbour.  At present these ships are charged light dues at the same rate as vessels proceeding to Waterford, despite the fact that New Ross ships use less than half the lights in the estuary.  Waterford Harbour Commissioners collect some £45,000 per annum in light dues from New Ross ships.  This charge is not related to the cost of providing the lights and in the view of the New Ross Harbour Commissioners it makes their port uncompetitive.</P>
    <P>The New Ross Harbour Commissioners charge that the Minister's amendment to section 13 (8) of the Bill, introduced on Report Stage in the Dáil, allows for the continuation of this inequitable position &mdash; perhaps the Minister has justification for this.  The New Ross Harbour Commissioners have sought a deletion of his amendment, substituting another provision for it which has some merit.</P>
    <P>Pilotage is compulsory for inbound vessels in the Waterford Estuary.  The New Ross Harbour Commissioners <Col N="950" /> recommend that it should be optional for vessels of less than 8,000 tonnes dwt from Dunmore East to Ballyhack/ Passage East and that New Ross pilots should board at the latter point and proceed through the Barrow Bridge to New Ross.  I would be interested to hear the Minister's arguments why he chose one over the other.</P>
    <P>The Irish Ships' Agents Association was referred to by my distinguished colleague, Senator Cosgrave.  Both the Minister and Members on all sides of the House have been inundated with documents relating very specifically to two areas.  This is a wonderful development for democracy.  Lobbying is a part of democracy and any Government will ignore lobbying at its peril.  I am glad we have an opportunity to act as a conduit for many of the concerns expressed by people outside the House who may sometimes feel they are marginalised or isolated or do not find Government accessible.  From that point of view it is important that people like my colleagues and I should articulate these concerns and if we support them, we should put that on the record.  At the end of the day the Minister as representative of the people will make his decision based on fairness.  We might not agree with it but that is democracy.</P>
    <P>The Irish Ships' Agents Association referred to charges and they have been corresponding with the Minister on the question of a bond.  As I understand it the legislation was not definitive in this regard.  It seemed to be equivocal at best.  The bond will not be required from all agents but the legislation does not specify from whom it will be required.  The view of the Irish Ships' Agents Association is that, in principle, it should not apply at all.  They are against a requirement for a bond.  I am interested to know why the Minister feels it necessary that they should have a bond.  I know that a bond operates in other professions, in the travel trade, for example.  Is this connected with the possibility of liquidation or the possibility of a charge on innocent victims of bankruptcy?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="951" /> I wish to discuss the safety aspect which was touched on by Senator Cosgrave. I am particularly interested in section 52 of the Bill.  This section refers indirectly to nuclear weapons.  It says that the harbour master of a harbour may refuse entry into the harbour of a ship or a vehicle or any other conveyance that is carrying nuclear material. How is the harbour master to police this?  Is it not true that the Americans have as Government policy, made it clear that they will not reveal to any Government, friendly or otherwise, what visiting frigates or major carriers are holding in cargo when they enter a friendly port?</P>
    <P>This question arose in Dublin within the last three to four years when Dublin Corporation passed a by-law which made Dublin a nuclear free zone. Around the same time an American frigate was visiting and when questions were raised about the propriety of such a vessel, which seemed to be nuclear, coming into Dublin port, and when questions were raised with the American Administration, they refused to confirm or deny whether there was any nuclear material on board and stated their policy was that they did not make any comment.  Why then include this provision?  Is it just aspirational?  Is it there because it looks good that we are against nuclear material and nuclear weapons?  I do not see much point in including it if it cannot be policed and monitored.  The legislation states that the harbour master has the right to board.  I hardly think it would possible to simply march onto the ship and ask to see the cargo.  I cannot see how it is possible to reconcile reality with aspiration here.</P>
    <P>I am interested to know about the role of Customs officers and the power that seems to be given to harbour masters here.  I could be misinterpreting this entirely, but the Minister is well versed in this legislation and will straighten me out in that regard.  Is the power of harbour masters extensive to the degree that it can override other organs of <Col N="952" /> State, for example, the Navy who may wish to board a vessel, or Customs officers who may be of the opinion that a particular ship is carrying drugs and wish to board it?  Do they have to seek the permission of the harbour master? Is it then under the jurisdiction of the harbour master rather than the forces of law and order?</P>
    <P>The reason I raise this question is obvious.  As we develop further and as Ireland develops its resources to an even greater degree, our ports will become more of an attraction.  With the &ldquo;fortress Europe&rdquo; concept growing apace, we are the most vulnerable to the importation of drugs, being an island on the periphery, so I wonder if any attention has been given to those considerations in this legislation or are those considerations outside its remit?  In the context of the powers of the harbour master &mdash; from my reading of these sections they seem to be very extensive &mdash; what is the role of the forces of law and order, specifically Customs officers and the Navy, perhaps chasing a ship into port?  These questions may seem nebulous at this stage but it is possible that this could happen and I want to know whether the legislation takes account of that.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill; it is comprehensive legislation which is long overdue.  In a way this goes back to the old perception of Government, if you do not give somebody a particular job to do then much is left undone.  The fact that the Minister is in this specific Department is good.  Up to some years ago we did not have a Department of the Marine; now we have a junior Minister to that Department with a specific brief to develop this important area.  It might never have happened because it might not have been high on our list of priorities and that would have been a pity. From that point of view the Minister's sojourn in this brief over the last 12 months has been enlightening and developmental.</P>
    <P>The Minister's enthusiasm and commitment is beyond question so I have no reason to doubt that his defence of this <Col N="953" /> legislation will have been well thought out.  At the same time, certain questions have to be raised.  The concerns of the specific local bodies which have been lobbying hard must be addressed because this is a matter of commercial life and death to them.  I hope that the weight of evidence, especially in relation to the Foynes/Limerick controversy will come down on the side of the people of Foynes.  A compromise can be arrived at which will allow both sides to operate on that stretch of water.  Like many other things in life, that water will be there long after the Limerick and Foynes Harbour Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Similarly, I am sure there can be some equitable agreement with New Ross and Waterford.  It seems a little unfair that New Ross should have to pay for a service they do not need.  Perhaps it is an element of the competition that is between both ports, but I am sure compromises can be found.  I, like many others, would be very interested to hear the Minister's comments and his responses to the very strong lobby in those areas.  I would be very interested in the powers of the harbour masters and how they will operate under this legislation.  Overall, I wish the legislation well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not be like my esteemed colleague from County Leitrim who went around all the ports in the country.  I will take the late Tipp O Neill's advice and will be very parochial about my politics.  I wish to make a plea for the inclusion of Sligo Harbour and Sligo port in this Bill.  The legislation is very welcome and it should have been enacted long ago but I know the Minister and Minister of State have worked very hard on this over the last number of months and I am glad to see the legislation before the House.  As I stated, my plea is on behalf of Sligo port.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Harbours Acts, 1946 and 1976, apply to 25 harbour authorities listed in a Schedule to the Harbours Act, 1946. The report of the Review Group on Commercial Harbours and Pilotage Policy and Legislation of June 1992 recommends <Col N="954" /> a number of harbours should be managed by commercial State companies with non-executive directors drawn from the commercial sector of the economy. The review group recommends this State company status for 11 ports in the Schedule to the 1946 Act and for Dún Laoghaire, all of which had traffic in excess of 200,000 tonnes in 1990.</P>
    <P>Of the remaining 14 ports in the Schedule, nine had no commercial traffic in 1990 and Kilrush only had 4,000 tonnes -Senator Taylor-Quinn will be delighted to hear that.  This left the Kinsale, Youghal, Tralee, Fenit and Sligo commercial ports with traffic of between 32,000 and 91,000 tonnes in 1990.  The recommendation for the smaller schedule harbours in chapter eight of the review group's report was that responsibility for most of these harbours be transferred to local authorities. The fact is that the recommendation refers to most of the remaining 14 ports and not all of them supports the case that Sligo, Tralee, Fenit, Youghal and Kinsale fall into a different commercial category than the other small harbours which have little or no commercial activity.</P>
    <P>The review group states that ports cannot operate in the commercial customer oriented manner expected of modern service industries within the framework of the present unduly restrictive legislation.  Local authority type practices and controls are not compatible with the market driven approach required in modern commercial harbours. Sligo port should not be left in a non-regarded category between State company and local authority responsibility where it could only stagnate and decline because of the absence of State or EU recognition.  It must have State company status for its harbours if it is to develop commercially and successfully for the future.</P>
    <P>Sligo is the regional capital of the north-west and is the focus for access by road, rail, sea and air for neighbouring counties both north and south of the Border.  It has traditionally served commerce over a 50 mile radius.  The port <Col N="955" /> has been used as a regional resource for more than 200 years.  Its convenience for serving the Border counties is clear. However, it is always at a natural disadvantage as far as economic development is concerned because of its remote location and its relatively undeveloped infrastructure.  To maintain necessary services and overcome the underlying causes of unemployment and emigration in this region requires special consideration in both national and EU transport policies so there is a possibility of a more even spread of economic prosperity.</P>
    <P>The National Development Plan, 1994-99, states, as one of the three main objectives of the port development programme, to assist sub-regional development. The plan proposes a major investment of £100 million and while it has indicated that most of it will be for the strategic corridor ports of Dublin Bay, Waterford, Cork, Rosslare and the Shannon Estuary, there is also provision for investment in the main regional ports to support regional development.</P>
    <P>Sligo port is entirely commercial and it has real business significance for firms in the area as well as providing permanent and temporary employment, both directly and indirectly.  While its traffic is modest compared to larger volumes achieved in the east and south coast harbours, it has a special strategic importance as the only real commercial port between Counties Derry and Galway. Considerable sums of public and private moneys have been invested in its facilities over the years.  In common with other commercial ports in the country, Sligo port suffers from legislative restrictions, difficulty of raising capital for investment, inadequate facilities, outmoded restrictive practices and unduly expensive cargo handling.  At present, the commissioners are powerless to get involved in resolving many of these existing problems.</P>
    <P>Taking into account the remoteness from which the west coast suffers, especially the isolation of the north-west, the most peripheral region in the <Col N="956" /> EU which shares an important Border with Northern Ireland, there is a clear need for an integrated regional transport system covering rail, road, sea and air.  Sligo port is an established link in this system and should receive appropriate State and EU support to enable it to continue its role of facilitating the overall economic development of the region. In the current circumstances of cross-Border business activity and plans to greatly improve the road network linking County Sligo to its neighbouring counties of Fermanagh and Tyrone, there are real possibilities for increased commercial usage of Sligo port for both importing and exporting from Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>There is no comparable port between Counties Galway and Derry to serve commercial traffic for the whole of the north-west.  It is vital for both the national and regional interests that it is maintained and its facilities upgraded, reflecting its strategic importance as a vital item of regional infrastructure.</P>
    <P>As someone coming from a Border county, I can see that business is inclined to go to Larne port.  A new masonite plant will be built in County Leitrim.  Masonite will be exported to EU member states and Sligo port should be upgraded to cater for this work.  There is also a large development of the timber industry in the north-west and the future for exports looks bright. I do not want to be parochial, but if Sligo port can be developed adequately, a large number of jobs could be provided in those industries over the next number of years.</P>
    <P>Sligo is part of the Border region which suffers from levels of unemployment and income per head that are considerably lower than the EU average and is affected by its peripherality from the national capital.  As such, it is covered by the INTERREG Programme, 1994-99, which aims to improve the economic position of cross-Border regions.  Sligo port, which is the only west coast commercial harbour in the peripheral Border region eligible for INTERREG funding, should receive <Col N="957" /> serious consideration from this relevant EU programme.</P>
    <P>Considerable sums of money have been spent by the harbour commissioners and the State in providing and maintaining facilities at Sligo port. As recently as 1984, major dredging operations were carried out to increase the depth in the approach channel and the berths at a cost of £690,000.  Since then, from its own resources the port has spent more than £10,000 annually for regular maintenance dredging to maintain the required depths.  Also from its own resources, the harbour board also undertook the reconstruction of a deep water jetty to enable the port to handle vessels of up to 3,000 tonne capacity.  This involved the capital expenditure of £128,000.  At present, the harbour has four working jetties, two at deep water berths and two at the upper quay.  The port has two 25 tonne mobile cranes and the harbour priorities, including land available for development and for port industrialisation, can be developed.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of Sligo Harbour in a specific section of the Bill should be given serious consideration.  The legislation provides for the Minister, if he so deems, to include any harbours he wishes at a later date.  Sligo Harbour is in need of development and should be given as much favourable consideration as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister for this legislation and I hope it will have the desired effect.  I am tempted to make special pleading for a harbour in County Kildare, but since I come from an inland county I will not be making a special case.  However, I have some observations on the Bill.  I am delighted to support Senator Reynolds' call for special status for Sligo port.  The Bill should set out to make the bodies in question more commercial and it attempts to do that.  I would have gone even father than the Minister but that is a debate for another day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one looks at the number of ports we have, especially down the east <Col N="958" /> coast, starting at Greenore and continuing to Cobh, it is unquestionable that, for an island of our size and population, we are liberally burdened with ports, to put it at its mildest.  Perhaps the way to deal with this is through legislation of this nature.  If we allow the ports to compete on an equal basis, the competition in itself will lead to them having an edge and to a certain sorting out, which would be to the benefit of trade and of consumption in general.</P>
    <P>There is always a tendency to adopt an over-centralised approach on behalf of the State on all these matters.  I am prepared to accept that there are responsibilities of safety and related matters that are very much the concerns of the Minister and of the State.  It is appropriate for the State to set such parameters, and for the bodies that have been established to have to work within them as it is essential that shipping should be able to move safely through coastal waters and that the risk of accidents be minimised, together with the risk of environmental damage as a result of accident.  All these matters should be attended to by way of legislation, indeed they are so attended, which is appropriate.</P>
    <P>However, it comes to a point where it is necessary for the State to be at arm's length, which comes back to the debate we had last week about the universities and the degree to which the State should be involved.  There is a common principle at work here.  I support the Bill in general.</P>
    <P>The Chambers of Commerce of Ireland should have statutory representation on the harbour boards as of right. I can think of no locally established body that is more representative of the business and commercial life of the area than the chambers of commerce.  They have the expertise and the interest and they should be represented.  The Minister will tell me that it is open to put somebody from the chambers of commerce onto a harbour board.  However, this provision should be stronger.  There are many precedents which would support this argument.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="959" /> There is nothing novel about a recommendation such as this; it runs through our legislation.  For example, the legislation establishing An Bord Bia gave farming organisations rights of nomination to the bodies involved.  The unions are represented and local authority representatives are included.  I have no objection to this; I believe they should be included.  I strongly suggest that the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland be afforded the same kind of rights because they know what is required in the locality and they have its commercial interests at heart.  They are also non-political.  It is not appropriate that we should parachute people onto the boards.</P>
    <P>With regard to the harbour masters and their rights to attend meetings, it is open to the harbour authority to request that the harbour master attend meetings. However, this provision needs to be stronger because I can envisage circumstances where there would be a conflict of interest between the harbour master and the authority.  It is important, therefore, that harbour masters, on the basis of rights under natural law, should have the right to attend and be heard, although they should not necessarily have the right to vote. Again, there are many precedents for this.</P>
    <P>There are several State companies which would not have got into difficulty if they had a system such as this in place. It is very important that the chief executive of any company attend board meetings and be able to brief the board adequately about what is going on.  The best place to do this is at the board meeting.  I would, therefore, strongly recommend this to the Minister.  The Minister said that, as a matter of course, harbour masters would attend board meetings; however, they should attend as a matter of right, rather than as a matter of course.</P>
    <P>With regard to the knotty question of Foynes and Limerick, the Minister will be relieved that I will not go back over all the arguments which have been so <Col N="960" /> well articulated in the debate as to the merits of Foynes and of Limerick and of the contest between the two.  I met the group from Foynes and was impressed by what the members had to say.  I am not somebody with any deep knowledge of marine matters or of ports, but on the basis of what I heard from them, what they had to say was very reasonable.</P>
    <P>This legislation has probably brought out more lobby groups than any legislation I can think of.  I have no objection to as many lobby groups as wish coming through the gates of Leinster House and telling us what they believe should be included in or excluded from legislation. This is part of our democracy, and to those who believe that lobbyists should not be part of our system, I say that is anti-democratic.  They should be listened to.  They have a case to make.  With regard to Foynes, the case was well made.</P>
    <P>However, it is a matter for the Minister to adjudicate on.  If we are unhappy with the adjudication, we will try to amend the Bill on Committee Stage. The Minister can then either accept or decline to accept any amendments.  I recommend that the Minister accept amendments in the case of Foynes if they are put down on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There appears to be some confusion regarding the mediator and what he decided.  I would be grateful if the Minister would clarify this matter.  Am I to understand that what the mediator decided, and what appears to be acceptable to Foynes, is not necessarily what is going to happen in the legislation, and that it will it be either open to the Minister or his officials to set aside the outcome of that mediation and to ignore it?</P>
    <P>My knowledge of Foynes comes from the users of the port, especially those in the agri-business sector who import bulk commodities through the port of Foynes.  Everything I have heard from them over the past several years would suggest that the port is efficient, well run and that they are very happy to do business there.  In view of this, their needs and views have to be taken into account.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="961" /> The port of New Ross is closer to home, and, again, I stress that I am from an inland constituency.  I met the people from New Ross and listened to what they had to say.  It is extraordinary that, when there are two different passages involved and we are dealing with the head waters of two different rivers, one port authority, New Ross, has to pay light dues and take on a pilot from another port authority.  In the context where we hope that competition will operate, this appears to give an undue advantage to Waterford port.  It is similar to a high street publican having the first cut of the barrel of porter before it goes to the second trader down the town.</P>
    <P>If this kind of system operated in commercial life outside of the ports, for example, to high street trading or commercial companies, I imagine the Competition Authority would have something to say about it and that the Minister for Enterprise and Employment would not be very happy.  It is in this context that the New Ross claim is reasonable.  If it is to compete on an equal footing with Waterford, then the question of light dues and pilotage needs to be addressed.  I do not have to go into the detail of the case as the Minister is familiar with it and with the requests that have been made by the New Ross Harbour authorities.</P>
    <P>I understand that £45,000 per annum is collected in light dues.  Those maintaining or installing the lights are entitled to charge, but the question arises whether it should be Waterford or somebody else that installs or maintains the lights.  In this regard, New Ross should control the waters within its own jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>My final point has to do with ship agents and bonding.  The ship agents have pointed out that they are now being requested to lodge a bond with the harbour company to cover payment of harbour charges.  They claim &mdash; and the Minister might address this in his concluding remarks &mdash; that such a procedure could be in contravention of the <Col N="962" /> normal rules of agency and contract. Those rules do not allow an agent to be held responsible for his principal's liability in the same way as an auctioneer cannot be held responsible for the fact that somebody does not pay up when they buy property.  That aspect needs to be clarified and the concerns of the ship agents should be allayed.</P>
    <P>These matters have been dealt with in detail and the Minister is aware of that detail.  I hope that between now and Committee Stage the concerns raised on Second Stage by many Members will be attended to and addressed to our satisfaction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Dardis spoke about New Ross.  All of us have received representations regarding New Ross and I give its representatives ten out of ten for trying to ensure that their point of view is heard in the House.  It appears to be a basic injustice, which is based on geography, that because one must pass through the Waterford lights to access the estuary to New Ross, the Waterford Port Authority has the sole right to levy charges in an arbitrary fashion without discussion or agreement with the New Ross Harbour Authority.  Whenever such a conflict arises there should be a mechanism in place to ensure that equity and fair play take precedence and that there is a process of consultation and agreement where one pilotage area crosses another.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis also referred to the compulsory taking of pilotage at a certain area, which is Cheekpoint in the case of New Ross.  Sometimes that practice is necessary and sometimes it is not. In my view, and having spent some years at sea, one either needs a pilot or one does not and the skipper either has the competence or he does not.  Where the competence exists&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>But not as much adrift as others.</P>
      <P>With regard to New Ross, there should be a system whereby the Waterford and New Ross authorities could agree on charges.  It would be extremely unfair if Waterford, for commercial reasons, decided that it could charge light dues which made New Ross virtually uneconomic as a port.  That is a possibility and it has to be addressed.</P>
      <P>With regard to ships' agents and the liability of agents to answer for the owners of vessels, I do not believe that the financial reward for acting as an agent for a major shipping company is commensurate with the responsibility placed on the agent.  There must be another way to bring defaulting agents or ship owners to book.  The Minister will be aware that it is not an unknown procedure to attach a writ to the mast of a ship if it is in debt.  There are other ways, rather than trying to penalise people who are not wealthy in their own right, of ensuring the payment of dues to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this State secured its independence from Britain, the Chief Secretary's Office in Dublin Castle sent copious amounts of documents to Leinster House.  Some of them were ancient charters granted by English sovereigns to Irish ports and they still lie in museums or in the dungeons of this and other houses.  As heritage is now such a significant part of our tourism product, these charters should be given to the ports of Waterford, Cork, Dublin and so forth and not be held in the dungeons of Government Buildings.  They should be given back to the port authorities and communities which were originally granted the charters.  This could be an important part of the heritage package of such communities.  I ask the Minister to examine that possibility.  I have <Col N="964" /> checked this before and the charters are there.  They are gathering dust in various places, including in the bowels of this House where there are many important documents that were transferred from Dublin Castle during that period.</P>
    <P>The central point, however, is that where, for geographical reasons, there are two harbour authorities which cross each other's territory, there should be an equitable and fair system whereby the authorities sit down together and agree whatever dues must be paid without one side, in this case Waterford, arbitrarily setting the fees for vessels bound for New Ross.</P>

      <P>Kilkenny County Council has representatives on both New Ross and Waterford Harbour Commissioners and Waterford Harbour happens to be in County Kilkenny so we have major problems when conflict arises between the two harbour authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must compliment everybody who approached us about this Harbours Bill. We have never seen such lobbying, particularly by Foynes Harbour Commissioners, New Ross Harbour Commissioners, New Ross Chamber of Commerce, Waterford Harbour Commissioners, Waterford Chamber of <Col N="965" /> Commerce, the Irish Ships' Agents Association and the Irish Pilots Association. Somebody said earlier that it was democracy at work and I agree.  If other people who complain about legislation went about their business in the same manner as interested groups in the Harbours Bill have done, there might not be so many problems in the aftermath of legislation being passed.</P>
    <P>The Harbours Bill is welcome.  It updates a large amount of legislation that has become outdated and brings certain harbours into the commercial reality of life today, whether it is shipping or any other type of business.  A number of the port authorities around the country were not doing their business in a commercial way and because of this they were less successful than in other areas.  We have to ensure that the majority and not the minority of ports become commercially minded and that every port should be brought into the commercial sphere.  Harbours and ships are an essential part of the commercial life of this country because of our peripherality and the fact that we are now, as has been said <i>ad nauseam,</i> the only country not linked by land to Europe. As a result we must ensure that our ports are commercial, profitable, can turn around ships in the fastest time possible and get our goods to world markets as efficiently as possible.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>There was a strong demand for continued representation of local authorities on the new port companies as such representation would maintain the close relationship between city, town and port.  It is argued that local ports play a key role in the economic life of the town or city associated with the port and that there must be close day to day interaction between the port and the local authority.  Local authority representation, it was suggested, on the port authority provided a long established and effective means of ensuring full co-operation between both bodies. The Government agreed that such <Col N="966" /> close co-operation was essential and considered that the inclusion of representation was merited on those grounds.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the Minister for the Marine will appoint three persons, nominated in the prescribed manner by a prescribed local authority, to be each a director of a company.  Regulations prescribing the manner in which such persons are to be nominated will be made by the Minister for the Marine.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister appoint these persons, will he tell local authorities who to appoint or will county councils, as heretofore, nominate the members of these boards?  I would not like to see such appointments removed from the remit of local authorities.  This remit has been downgraded over the years and I hope this Bill will not result in a further downgrading of it.</P>
    <P>Why are TDs, Senators and MEPs precluded from membership of the boards of these authorities?  I see no reason why this should be the case.  If a TD, Senator or MEP has qualifications which would help in the running of an authority, he or she should have the same opportunity as anybody else to be appointed to such boards.  Ministers in this and previous Governments have decided that membership of the Seanad, the Dáil or the European Parliament should exclude people from membership of certain State bodies.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of lobbying on behalf of Foynes.  From what we have heard from the Minister and others, the problems associated with Foynes will be eliminated before this Bill is passed.  The definition of the extension of the limits of Foynes has not been stated.  Will it be extended by ten or 20 cables?  I am not sure what a cable is.  I presume it is a measurement of distance associated with ships.  As a seafaring man, Senator Magner would know a great deal more than I do about this area.  If Foynes has been given the extension it needs, the limits of the extension should be defined.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="967" /> Limerick Harbour Board realises that the Foynes lobby was extremely strong and did an excellent job in doing what it wanted to do for Foynes.  Over the years Foynes harbour has come from the doldrums. It used to be a seaport for aeroplanes but experienced bad times.  Over the past few years it has become a successful port.  Parts of the Shannon Estuary are suitable for large ships.  Local authority members on the Foynes Harbour Board did a fantastic job in conjunction with the chief executive of the board and other people from the area and I congratulate them.</P>
    <P>The issues of pilotage and light dues have led to conflict between Waterford and New Ross.  A review has been set up to deal with pilotage.  This issue is of the utmost importance because it affects the safety not only of ships but of people who use rivers and estuaries.  We have all received a letter from New Ross Chamber of Commerce in which its secretary stated:</P>
    <P>Ships coming to New Ross must pass through part of Waterford Harbour and at present these vessels must pay light dues and pilotage charges to Waterford.  The imposition of these additional charges places New Ross at a severe competitive disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> Waterford.</P>
    <P>The Harbours Bill, 1995, which will reach the Senate during the week commencing 20th November, must address these issues and create a situation where the two ports can compete on an equal basis.</P>
    <P>The Port of New Ross is the major factor in the economic life of the town and surrounding areas.  Any loss of trade through the port will therefore have a significant negative impact on the area which already experiences higher than average unemployment.</P>
    <P>The issue of one port being in a position to levy charges on ships bound for another port will be discussed during the debate in the Senate. We would ask you to support the introduction of a legislative framework <Col N="968" /> which is fair and equitable to all ports.</P>
    <P>As a balance against this we received a letter from Waterford Chamber of Commerce, which states:</P>
    <P>The jurisdiction of Waterford Harbour Commissioners and Waterford Pilotage Authority extends from the City of Waterford to the mouth of the estuary at Dunmore East.</P>
    <P>The powers and duties of the Commissioners are enshrined in the Harbours Act, 1946 and replicated in the Harbours Bill, 1995, which states that the principal objects of the new port company will be to take all proper measures for the management, control and development of the harbour and the approach channels thereto and provide reasonable facilities and services for all vessels.  Furthermore, in the interests of safety and the environment, the Commissioners are in the process of installing and maintaining additional buoys and lights.</P>
    <P>With regard to the access channel it should be noted that the principal navigation buoys and leading lights are located in the Waterford estuary between Dunmore East and Cheekpoint. All vessels bound to/from New Ross utilise these facilities.  Each New Ross vessel is levied with a small local lights charge.  A recent financial appraisal submitted to the Department of the Marine established that the contribution made by New Ross shipping is not only fair and equitable but also, from the New Ross Commissioners point of view, extremely good value for money.  Hence it is incorrect to suggest, as New Ross have done, that these charges place them at a competitive disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> Waterford.</P>
    <P>In fact it should also be noted that these charges which were established in 1984 have remained unaltered since then, mainly as a consequence of the developing trade in the Port of Waterford.</P>
    <P>Pilotage is also compulsory for all shipping whether bound for Waterford <Col N="969" /> or New Ross.  Compulsory pilotage legislation was enacted and confirmed under the Pilotage Order Confirmation Act, 1927.  This requirement is not only for the protection of shipping but for the protection of ports and of commercial ports in particular...</P>
    <P>The Commissioners have provided and will continue to provide buoys, lights, navigational channel and pilotage service at a cost efficient price which is consistent with a commercial and marketable port, which at the same time ensures the safety of all shipping in the estuary.</P>
    <P>Two opposite points of view have been expressed by Waterford and New Ross chambers of commerce.  I come from an area which straddles both ports.  We want to ensure that New Ross port can continue to be successful and to develop as it has for some years.  The number of ship movements to New Ross makes it a busy port.  On average, 1,100 ship movements are piloted to and from the harbour each year and consequently pass through the Waterford pilotage district. This is in addition to approximately 1,600 movements per annum to and from Waterford Harbour.  Because of the roll on-roll off status of Bellvue port in County Kilkenny and the fact that Louisiana Pacific and various other commercial projects will come on stream in that area over the next few years, there will be a big increase in the 1,600 movements mentioned in the Minister's speech.</P>
    <P>I am not sure how the Minister should ensure equity between Waterford and New Ross in terms of the lights and buoys in the harbour.  The people of New Ross feel they are at a disadvantage because they must pay a levy which amounted to £45,000 last year.  This does not give commercial equity in terms of the costs of the lights and what is being paid for them.  The safety of the ships going to and from Waterford or New Ross ports should be of major importance. Although pilotage is compulsory, it is not necessarily so in all cases <Col N="970" /> because if the weather is bad, the pilots cannot get on board the ships, which must sail without them.  A ship went aground recently because the pilot thought he knew Bellvue port, but he hit a boom which he did not realise was there.  This boom was used to make the water deeper in certain places.</P>
    <P>I am not sure if Kilkenny County Council has a major interest in Waterford port or in the port of New Ross, but perhaps the county manager could act as honest broker between the two in the interests of equity.  Perhaps the review group which is considering the pilotage scheme could also examine the areas of conflict which must be resolved. If charges are levied on the port of New Ross which are not equitable, something should be done because we need two commercially viable ports in that area. A lot of goods are transported through these ports from the south-east and large companies are once again using Waterford Harbour.  Waterford and New Ross would be used a lot more than they are at present if there was proper access to them.  There is only one bridge across the River Suir in Waterford and this causes major problems. Arcon Mines in County Kilkenny will start production next year and if New Ross is used as the port of exit for these materials there will be a huge build up of traffic into that port on roads which are not capable of carrying traffic at present.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to take into account the major conflict between the two port authorities over the charges levied. Commercial advantage should not be given to one port over the other.  A charge should be levied on the cost of maintaining the buoys and the lights and it should be equally distributed between the ships using one harbour or the other.  The number of ships, rather than the tonnage, should be used to determine the cost.</P>
    <P>I am not sure how to deal with this, but perhaps the Minister could deal with it in the same way as the review group is examining pilotage.  That group will consist of one nominee from Waterford <Col N="971" /> Harbour Commissioners, one nominee from New Ross Harbour Commissioners, one official from the Department of the Marine and one independent member, with the necessary technical expertise, to be nominated by the Department of the Marine and agreed by both parties.  Waterford port would like to leave the situation as it is.  If this gives Kilkenny a commercial advantage, so be it, but it is not equitable. The problem between the two harbour authorities is of concern to everyone who has spoken.  An equitable resolution must be found.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  Our harbours must be of the highest quality and the turnaround in them must be as fast as possible for our commercial exports.  Up to now the harbour masters were not members of the harbour authorities.  I am not sure if that applies everywhere, but I do not understand why the person who runs the harbour on a daily basis should not be a member of the authority. It is not correct that they should hear decisions secondhand.</P>
    <P>I am not sure about the legal technicalities of the Irish Ship Agents' Association. Section 13(7) is as objectionable as that in the previous Bill in that the procedure of compelling the agent to pay his principal's liabilities by direct cash or by extraction from his bond contravenes the law of agency.  If it does this, there is no point in putting it into this Bill because there will be court challenges if what the Irish Ship Agents' Association says is correct.  There have been enough challenges to Bills which have passed this House over the years.</P>
    <P>The relationship between Waterford port and the port of New Ross is a major problem in this Bill.  Smaller harbours are also covered in the Bill.  During the summer months boats take off from small piers around the country and go to islands off Kerry, the west coast or the north-west coast.  Many of these are breaking the law as regards safety measures.  I would not allow anybody who had any connection with me to get on some of these boats going out from <Col N="972" /> small harbours to the islands off the south west or west coasts.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I sincerely hope that when this legislation goes through, our shippers and those who run the ports will be better able to do their business in the manner necessary from the point of view of our exports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to be in a position to speak on this Bill.  I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  He is doing a good job and has had an interest in his area of responsibility for a considerable period of time, including when he was in Opposition. That experience stands to him as a Minister of State and it is evident in the manner in which he deals with his portfolio.</P>
      <P>The Bill is one of the most important pieces of legislation to come before the Houses of the Oireachtas for a long time.  It is a major cornerstone to the successful development of our economy in future.  As an island nation, and the only EU state without a land link to the Continent, we have difficulty competing in the international market place.  That is why we must have good port facilities in place to compete effectively and economically with ports in Europe and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The Bill's focus is correct in that it establishes port authorities and companies that will be commercially oriented and will operate on a commercial scale.  That is hugely important for industry, tourism, agriculture and other important areas of our economy.  We must take a positive and pragmatic approach towards planning for the future if we are to develop jobs in port areas as well as increasing employment generally to reduce numbers on the dole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Traditionally such a measure came before the House in the form of the Shannon Estuary Bill.  On both occasions that Bill came before the House the Government fell.  I presume the current Minister and Minister of State decided it was better to have a <Col N="973" /> national dimension to the Bill rather than a specific Shannon Estuary dimension. The Minister is to be congratulated on dealing with all the main port areas in addition to laying the basis for the formation of commercial structures and port companies.</P>
    <P>In 1990 the then Minister for the Marine, Deputy Wilson, established a review group to examine the ports.  At that time the Minister of State, Deputy Gilmore, was one of the Opposition spokespersons on the Marine and I was the Fine Gael spokesperson.  We welcomed that development at the time.  I now welcome the fact that the Minister is acting on the review group's recommendations to put in place the means necessary to use our ports to best advantage. In so doing the Minister has looked closely at the various recommendations and the membership of the board.  Initially, I understand that seven board members were considered for each commercial port company, but I am delighted the Minister has now decided on a happy medium figure of 12, which is representative of all the interests concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister states that no port user shall be represented on or be a member of the board.  I would ask the Minister to examine the matter, although I can understand the conflict of interest if any port user was a member of the board.  I refer, however, to the modern Moneypoint facility which the ESB put in place and which deals with a lot of traffic serving the generating station.  While Limerick Harbour Authority has had jurisdiction over that area, a new Shannon port company will now have jurisdiction there.  A company like the ESB which has put such a facility in place, but which is still paying dues to a new port company, deserves some form of recognition or representation on the board. The Minister's Department should consider that scenario.</P>
    <P>In dealing with such a Bill most of us end by being somewhat parochial.  In years gone by we have put on record the Shannon Estuary situation as various Bills were discussed.  The primary objective <Col N="974" /> of any such legislation should be to enhance development and create a facility conducive to generating employment. I hope this Bill will do just that in all the areas concerned and particularly on the Shannon Estuary.</P>
    <P>The estuary is bordered on one side by Kerry and on the other side by county Clare.  As a representative from Clare, I have to say that over the years we felt badly treated by the Limerick Harbour Commissioners.  We resented the manner in which the area down to Loop Head was treated by the commissioners. These factors must be taken into consideration.  There is an attitude that we should be thankful because we have one representative from Clare County Council on the current Limerick Harbour Commissioners.  In future we will have to forget the closed shops and instead seek openness, accountability and transparency at all levels.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that the Minister of State and the Minister, when they are establishing these companies and appointing board personnel, will strictly ensure openness, transparency and accountability.  As far as port companies or harbour authorities are concerned, in many instances one is talking about substantial amounts of money.  I compliment Foynes on their submission, which made it clear that on a turnover of £2.1 million there was a profit of £800,000.  That cannot be said of many other harbour authorities, including the Limerick Harbour Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a natural facility which is owned by the people and should be used for their benefit.  It should not be used exclusively for the benefit of any one sector or group.  While I welcome the Bill, it is important that in appointing the board's membership the Minister should appoint people who are open-minded, unbiased and prepared to be accountable and transparent in their deliberations.  Without openness the best interests of the region will not be served.  I have confidence that the Minister <Col N="975" /> will take this into account when the legislation is passed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Foynes Harbour on its submission.  I support an enterprising organisation which is prepared to expand, to improve its facilities and to avail of opportunities in the 1990s as far as business is concerned. There was controversy in relation to the application for the extension and the Minister, in his wisdom, arranged for the appointment of a mediator.  I am pleased he has accepted the recommendations of the mediator.</P>
      <P>Enterprising people, like this local group which wants to expand, must be complimented.  The Minister has responded in a positive way, which is to be commended.  However, I worry that attempts might be made to prevent that expansion.  The mediator consulted with the various interests, got advice from concerned parties and came up with a conclusion.  The initial application was somewhat reduced.  A mooring point near Aughinish Island was removed, but four further points towards Battery Point were left.  This appears to be a reasonable recommendation with which I have no difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="976" /> I spoke to the pilots on the Shannon who have expressed concern about safety.  I am familiar with the amount of traffic on the Shannon and I wish there were more boats and ships on the river. I sorry to say I have not seen congestion in the Shannon Estuary.  I hope that with future development we may reach a point where there will be congestion and where aspects of safety would need to be addressed.  However, with skilful management and co-operation, movement on the river can be easily managed to allow the extension to which the Minister has agreed.  Although I am not an expert or a pilot, that is my view, given the level of traffic, and I would be interested to hear an opposing one.  We want to see increased traffic and activity on the River Shannon because that will mean more business in the region, more money being generated and the possibility of greater development with more industrial companies establishing in the area because the facilities are already in place.</P>
    <P>I welcome the points made on the powers and duties of the new port companies. The Minister outlined eight areas of responsibility.  I am concerned about the power which gives a port company the authority to engage in any business activities, either alone or in conjunction with other persons, that it considers to be advantageous to the development of its harbour.  I would like to put this in the context of what we witnessed in semi-State companies previously. For example, Aer Lingus engaged in activities not directly related to aviation, including the purchase of hotels.  We subsequently saw the difficulties which arose in that company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>By giving ports this responsibility, we should not fall into the trap semi-State companies fell into in the past.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's wish that port companies should show concern for their immediate environment.  It is important that the estuary or river concerned is protected to ensure that no environmental damage is done.  This should be highlighted to port companies when established so that fish life and the natural fall of the river are protected and that every precaution is taken to prevent oil spillages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section dealing with pensions is very detailed and has been widely discussed <Col N="978" /> in both Houses.  I welcome the protections put in place for employees of existing harbour authorities who will become employees of port companies. It is important that the necessary protections are included in the legislation so we do not have a repeat of previous incidents where employees were left in difficult situations.</P>
    <P>Some 35 sections deal with pilotage, which is extremely important.  Given that more traffic may be generated in the future &mdash; it is the responsibility of the port companies to market and promote their ports in that regard &mdash; it is important to ensure that the proper supervision of pilotage is also in place. The record of pilots in the rivers and estuaries throughout Ireland is outstanding and the level of accidents is very low.  This is particularly true of the Shannon Estuary and it would be remiss not to acknowledge that point and compliment them on their efficient work over the years.  It is equally important to ensure their current terms of employment are protected under the future structure.  From my reading of the Bill, this aspect appears to be effectively covered.</P>
    <P>Submissions were also made by New Ross in relation to the difficulties there. I have great sympathy with that area because one can imagine being up estuary and having to go through the waters of a different port before one reaches one's destination.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The trouble is that Clare County Council has not yet received responsibility for waters for which it should have responsibility.  We can debate that matter another day and I hope another piece of legislation will be before the House under which County Clare will get a fair crack of the whip regarding the Shannon.  The people in Foynes are doing fine and if I was the Senator, I would not push my luck at this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="979" /> A particular position applies to New Ross and Waterford.  In discussing legislation, Members must ensure that everybody gets a fair crack of the whip and that natural justice is seen to be done.  It would be most serious and unfair if New Ross was put at a commercial disadvantage and had to pay extra.  If the net cost of entering New Ross is higher than the net cost of entering Waterford, shipping companies operating on a commercial basis will opt for Waterford over New Ross.  We must not do anything which would discourage ships from entering New Ross.  I am delighted the Minister established a small review group and I hope it will come up with useful suggestions. Perhaps by Committee Stage the Minister will be in a position to tell the House of a resolution to that issue.  It is important at all times to ensure no financial advantage is given to one port over another.  In effect, that would work against the spirit of the Bill which strongly encourages regional development. It is important to promote the regions and encourage the development of small towns such as New Ross.</P>
    <P>The Bill is most welcome and moves in the right direction.  However, the aspect of ship agents, chandlery and chandlers is not covered.  This is viewed as a quiet operation behind the scenes in which nobody gets involved. However, people do get involved in this area.  The harbour authorities also get involved, directly or indirectly.  They may say they have nothing to do with it but the opposite is the case.  There is a lot of money involved and much consideration is given to how things are managed and done.  The Minister should closely examine this aspect of harbour operations in terms of the new port companies.</P>
    <P>For example, in Moneypoint a chandler is nominated to a ship and he arranges the necessary chandlery. However, most of the materials come down in vans from Dublin.  The chandler can be from a number of places, such as Foynes or Limerick.  Substantial amounts of money and questionable <Col N="980" /> activity are involved.  The Minister and his Department should take specific note of this and ensure, when the port companies are being established, that this area is also closely examined.  The Bill does not specifically covers ship agents, chandlers and the delivery of chandlery.  Nevertheless, it is a huge spin off and involves substantial amounts of money.  I am not happy with the current activity and practices on the Shannon Estuary, particularly in relation to Moneypoint.  I hope the people involved are listening to my views and heeding them and I hope they will change their ways.</P>
    <P>I could mention many other aspects of the Bill, which is very detailed.  The House will consider it section by section on Committee Stage and I hope the Minister will be in a position to bring forward amendments in relation to a number of matters to make the Bill even better.  I compliment the Minister and the Department on their work to date.  The House should recognise that the Bill is a hugely important landmark in the future development of the economy.</P>

It was necessary to change legislation so that groups such as the ESB could work abroad on projects, although perhaps not on harbour development.</P>

      <P>I wish to make a number of general points before the debate adjourns.  I do not wish to be patronising but I compliment the different groups who carried out a most thorough, comprehensive and effective briefing of Members of the Oireachtas in recent weeks.  It is a good example of democracy in action.  I met a number of groups and contacted others whose demands were clear and who argued their cases. It is a model of how good briefing should be done.  Many other pressure groups in Ireland, some of which I am close to, could learn much from it.</P>
      <P>I intend to play a major part on Committee Stage but I will raise some general points now.  I am most upset by the Title of the Bill.  I checked with the translation section and I was informed that correctly it is the new caighdeán. However, I would prefer it to be An Bille na gCuan, rather than An Bille Cuanta which does not make any sense to my understanding of the language. Another point which greatly upsets me about the Bill is the use of the macho word &ldquo;master&rdquo; all the way through.  We have almost removed it in teaching and it is time to remove it from ships and harbours also.</P>

      <P>I reached the conclusion that I will not put forward amendments in that regard.  I hope another aspect will be eliminated by the Bill, which is the dastardly, unacceptable and desperate practice engaged in by mayors of Limerick.  Each year they sail down the river and throw a dart into the estuary around Kerry Head, thereby claiming rights over the water and land.  A former Member of this House, Tony Brommell, who was Mayor of Limerick revived that practice which is upsetting to those of us from the hinterland.</P>
      <P>I have not heard much of the debate, but on the general principles of transparency, etc., which others find a lot more important than I do, whatever the people of Foynes and Dingle feel is correct for their area is what I will support on Committee Stage.  Judging from what they have said to me and what I know about their commitment to their areas, I operate on the principle that they tend to be right and I will be on their side.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann, acknowledging the crisis in the Irish sheep sector and mindful of the many thousands of jobs on farms and in factories <Col N="983" /> dependent on the industry, condemns the Government and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry for the sustained indifference they have demonstrated on the needs of the industry; and hereby calls for urgent steps to be taken to address both the immediate crisis and the long-term structural problems of the Irish sheep sector.</P>
    <P>This debate is important for the many farmers involved in sheep production, the agriculture industry and the economy as a whole.  There is a serious crisis in the Irish sheep industry which requires urgent remedy.  The importance Fianna Fáil attaches to the need to introduce urgent measures for the sheep sector is demonstrated by the fact that our party spokesman in the Dáil, Deputy Cowen, tabled a Private Members' motion on this matter in the Dáil some time ago; we are tabling a motion in this House this evening.</P>
    <P>The crisis is so serious there was a very large demonstration of sheep farmers in Dublin a week ago.  On Marian Finucane's radio show I heard complaints from a man who was held up in traffic because of the demonstration and he complained about the money he lost. The sheep farmers have lost a lot more. They had the demonstration to let people know their incomes have not been as bad for five or six years.  They demonstrated forcefully their concern and disappointment at falling sheep prices and the serious problems that have confronted the sheep sector for some time.  These problems must be addressed and it will require sustained negotiating on the Minister's part at EU Council level to ensure emergency issues are dealt with and that the cash crisis which has bedevilled sheep producers is addressed.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the Minister's efforts to address and successfully tackle those issues have been negligible.  Where is the Minister's much trumpeted claim of almost a year ago that the difficulties of this industry would be confronted and <Col N="984" /> overcome?  The days of announcing and recycling good news press releases of developments that took place before the Minister took office must come to an end as reality dawns on some commentators and interest groups.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be more active in an area in which there have been serious difficulties under his stewardship; an area in which one would have expected he would have shown some flair given that many of his constituents are seriously affected by what has happened in the sheep sector.  I am disappointed the Minister is not here this evening and, by his attendance, show his concern for the crisis in the sheep industry. In saying that I mean no reflection on the Minister of State.</P>
    <P>In 1980 Ireland got access to the French market and the ewe premium was introduced.  In Ireland this was paid on each ewe but in the UK it was paid on the lamb.  I have heard that at some public meetings the Minister referred to the fact that perhaps a policy mistake was made when we sought the premium on the ewe rather than the lamb.  It is important to point out that at that time there were only 1.5 million ewes in the country, many in disadvantaged areas and many not attaining the lambing rates now available as a result of improved husbandry and breeding practices.</P>
    <P>Throughout the 1980s there was a great expansion in the breeding flock. From a total of 1.5 million head in 1980 the herd had increased to 4.6 million in 1994.  The expansion of the flock goes back to the decision by the then Minister for Agriculture, Ray MacSharry, to give us unlimited access to the French market and the ewe premium was the foundation on which a sheep industry could be built.</P>
    <P>Since 1991, there has been a reform of the CAP as it concerns sheep.  At that time the quota regime was also introduced and, with the full support of everyone concerned, a ewe premium calculated across the EU was introduced, rather than on an Ireland only basis, whereby each member state could <Col N="985" /> do its own calculation.  This was introduced in the belief that Irish prices would rise to meet French prices; in other words, there would be convergence in relation to the price and the ewe premium would be the support mechanism which would be applied uniformly at every level throughout the Community.</P>
    <P>Our experience has shown the theory does not work for Irish sheep producers. In 1992 lamb prices collapsed.  In December of that year, the then Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Joe Walsh, obtained a top up premium of £6 per ewe &mdash; the Minister of State should take note of that.  The Minister has a precedent, if he wishes to look at how it may be possible to get recognition for the special status and the vulnerability of the Irish sheep sector and that precedent was set by the Minister's predecessor in 1992.</P>
    <P>In 1993 and 1994 prices were static.  In 1995 there has been a collapse in early lamb prices due to currency differences, cheap hogget meat and the lower prices in France.  It is important that the Minister acknowledged there is a problem of crisis proportions in the Irish sheep industry.  Any comparison of average prices on a penny per pound basis for lamb at export in France for the months January to October 1994 as against 1995 shows that clearly.  For example, in March 1994 we were getting £1.29 per pound as against £1.17 per pound this year, a 9 per cent drop; in April 1994 we were getting £1.40 per pound as against £1.17 per pound this year, a 16 per cent drop; in May 1994 we were getting £1.43 per pound as against £1.07 per pound this year, a 25 per cent drop; in June 1994 we were getting £1.02 per pound as against 93p per pound, an 8 per cent drop; and there was a 4 per cent drop in July and August 1995 as against 1994.</P>
    <P>There has been an increase in prices in October and all the indications are that prices for this month will be up on last year's prices but the Minister cannot take any credit for that.  It is poor compensation for the early lamb producers <Col N="986" /> who have sold their sheep and taken a reduced price.</P>
    <P>A comparison of the gross margin per livestock unit for single suckling or cattle as against mid season lamb production in the years 1990-92 and 1994 reveals a disturbing trend.  The gross margin per livestock unit for single suckling or cattle was £218 in 1990 and it is now £329.  The figure for mid season lamb production is static at £242 in 1990 as against £245 in 1994.  The subsidies per livestock unit in single suckling have increased from £65 to £173 per hectare. The subsidies per livestock unit for mid season lamb production were £130 in 1990, £104 in 1992 and £98 in 1994. There was a further reduction this year because of the method of calculation of the ewe premium.  The gross margin in single suckling and cattle systems has increased by 51 per cent from 1990-94. The gross margin in sheep has remained static but the support payments in single suckling and cattle systems have increased by 116 per cent since 1990. The support payments for sheep have decreased by 25 per cent over the same period.  Overall, since 1988 sheep farmers' income has declined by 27 per cent, with farmers in non advantaged areas particularly affected.</P>
    <P>Sheep farmers and farm representative bodies have made it plain through public marching and constant lobbying at all levels that, on the basis of the method of calculation, an £8 top up premium is not only feasible but it is justifiable, fair play and what is required.  The top up premium, in addition to the extension rural world premium, may provide some solace but we all know that it is only an emergency measure which only recognises an income crisis in sheep farming.  It will not compensate sheep farmers who want to return to the position which obtained in the late 1980s when they could market their product and make a living.  That is what everybody wants to do but sheep farmers are being discriminated against in the market place and the Minister does not seem to be in a position to do anything about it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="987" /> Our main competitor in the French market is the United Kingdom, which enjoys a competitive advantage because of its location and the Channel tunnel. A currency problem has also arisen because of the weakness of sterling.  The Minister has not delivered in terms of doing something for sheep farmers. Given the national reserves, we have advocated a reduction in the interest rates to help improve our competitive position <i>vis-á-vis</i> the sterling area.  This would be of crucial significance to sheep farmers next year.  If we do not deal with this issue, sheep farmers will continue to be at a 7 per cent disadvantage next year, in addition to everything else which has gone wrong in that sector.</P>
    <P>Our sheep meat is regarded as organic but we cannot sell our product if the Minister continues to accept the present method of calculation of the ewe premium.  In 1991 everyone agreed with the theory which was due to be reviewed after five years in 1996.  I call on the Minister to instigate that review at European level.  An all embracing committee, representative of the sheep sector &mdash; producers, processors and others &mdash; and the Department, should be set up to formulate and put our case that there is a clear discrimination and active divergence of price, which is exacerbated by British preference on the French market.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the necessary decisions must be taken now.  If the Minister and the Government are not prepared to insist that this is done now, then our argument will be defeated.  We cannot expect top up premia if we are not prepared to insist on the review of the methods of calculation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me great pleasure to second this motion so ably proposed by my colleague, Senator Rory Kiely.  I am also disappointed that the Minister is not here, but I am pleased that a good Munster man is here who might understand more fully the problems facing the sheep farmers and the hard year they have had.  We had one of the worst winters and springs in living memory.  The sheep farmers sustained heavy losses and had to buy extra feed as a result of the very cold, wet weather.  Producers of early Easter lamb got very poor prices, which meant that it was not a very profitable year.  The price then collapsed for the main flock from early spring into the summer and autumn.</P>
      <P>With all due respect to the Minister of State, spin doctored press releases are not good enough and are a mockery to farmers, thousands of whom were on the street the other day.  Most sheep producers are reasonably small farmers with probably no milk or sugar beet quotas and are limited by the quality of their land to sheep production.  The Minister did not pay enough attention to the warnings given in this and the other House by Deputies Cowen and Hugh Byrne and others to look more seriously at this problem as the months rolled by.  All we got were glossy press releases in the <i>Farmers Journal</i> by highly paid spin doctors which were poor consolation to the average farmer. It was bad enough with the price of lamb being low but the price of wool has also collapsed &mdash; it hardly pays to shear sheep.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I plead with the Minister and the Minister of State to take a firm stand. We are raising this issue tonight in order <Col N="989" /> to strengthen his hand in that argument because it is in the national interest.  If we lose this market which, as Senator Rory Kiely said, was fought for dearly in the late 1970s by the former Minister for Agriculture, Jim Gibbons, and former Minister and EU Commissioner, Ray MacSharry, the whole industry will collapse &mdash; farmers are getting out of sheep production because they saw that the Minister was not making their case in Brussels &mdash; and we will find it very hard to build up that market again.</P>
    <P>There are alarming outbreaks of sheep scab in Munster, about which I am sure the Minister of State knows. The Minister should pay attention to that before it gets out of control.  Some of the farming organisations must share the blame for this because they advocated the abolition of compulsory dipping.  We should learn from the experience of the UK where sheep scab is spreading, otherwise the whole industry will collapse around our ears.  I ask the Minister to pay particular attention to that area which was highlighted on a recent television programme.</P>
    <P>We have discussed mad cow disease, but sheep scab is also very damaging to our image as a lamb exporting country. Anyone producing lamb for the Easter market or the main market during the year will say his money is well earned.  I was involved in sheep production and whether the weather is rainy or sunny, it is hard to earn money from it and one can have bad luck with weather and outbreaks of various diseases. Those producers deserve what they earn and should receive better treatment from the Minister.  It is sad that he allowed the position to drift without making a serious effort to put our case at Brussels.  The average flock size here is quite small compared to other parts of the world and the income of a family farm is dependent on sheep in order to educate their families and support the household.  When they cannot sell the lambs or the wool, what can they do?</P>
    <P>Our flock size rose from 1.5 million in 1980 to 4.6 million in 1994 due to the <Col N="990" /> hard work of the former Ministers, Deputy Joe Walsh and Mr. Ray MacSharry.  The Minister and his Minister of State should ensure that these farmers will not have their only method of making an honest living taken from them.  Although the market has collapsed they should be given a ray of hope.</P>
    <P>Flashy press releases are no good to the woman of the house if she has no money to buy shopping, or to a young child who needs a new pair of shoes after Christmas.  Regardless of what Department it comes from, it is an insult to have spin doctors issuing half-baked, half true statements, mocking people whose income is collapsing.  No wonder these people come to Dublin to warn the Minister that he should fight on behalf of this important part of our agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister should make a good effort this side of Christmas.  If he does not, the chickens will come home to roost.  He walked into a Department in which much good work had been done by his predecessor, Deputy Walsh.  He spent his first six months opening buildings and making announcements, but his plan has collapsed, just like the sheep trade.  We were supposed to get &ldquo;push button&rdquo; offices, so that if a farmer picked up a 'phone he could speak to an expert.  All this was a pipe dream.  It was fine for a while, but although one can fool some of the people some of the time, one cannot fool all the people all the time.  The <i>Irish Independent</i> farming supplement, the <i>Farmer's Journal</i> and <i>The Cork Examiner</i> all said this was the best Minister since sliced bread, but what happened?</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Seanad Éireann endorses the effective measures which have already been taken by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to address the difficulties which have been experienced by sheep producers this year; and commends the intensive efforts by the Minister at the Council of Agriculture Ministers to secure further support for the sector.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sheep industry has had a difficult time in the past four to five years and 1995 has been especially bad; there was a crisis in the industry in the first part of the year.  The industry is worth between £300 million and £350 million to our economy and sustains a large number of farmers and their families, approximately 48,000 to 50,000.  Since 1991 approximately 5,700 producers have been forced out of sheep farming, on top of which there has been a reduction <Col N="992" /> in ewes of 350,000.  There are serious statistics which cannot go unnoticed.  As far as net profit is concerned, the industry depends on premia and payments of one sort or another.</P>
    <P>We must ask ourselves what will happen in the future.  We must not continue talking ourselves into depression because it does no one any good, least of all the industry.  Through the years we have seen ups and downs in the market for one reason or another but what has happened over the past 12 months is slightly more serious.</P>
    <P>The increase in New Zealand imports is a disaster, which has created a large surplus on the UK market and is having a devastating effect on prices, not alone in Ireland but across Europe.  Let us not forget that this has been brought about by the GATT deal.  During the discussions on that agreement I brought this to the attention of the then Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Walsh, and warned him of the consequences of such an arrangement. We should ask ourselves why we as European producers allow New Zealand to dump sheep meat on our market. Some of these imports are cheap, frozen products, so the limit of 13,500 tonnes of chilled produce should be imposed again on New Zealand.  There are large numbers of farmers across Ireland who have entered the Easter trade market, the position of which now appears hopeless as a result of the GATT agreement, which favours New Zealand sheep producers.</P>
    <P>The IFA has time and again criticised the flawed system of ewe premia.  The current calculation is that there will be a premium of approximately £19.71 per ewe this year.  If the calculations were based on Irish prices the premium would be £27.73 per ewe, which is £8 more.  This is what the argument is about and I cannot understand why this point cannot be conceded in the EU. The Minister is doing everything in his power to persuade the Union to provide a top-up premium of £8 per ewe.  I have the greatest confidence that he will succeed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="993" /> It is important that the realities of the situation are brought to the attention of the House.  A number of difficulties combined to depress the lamb market in Ireland in the early part of the year. Turbulence in the currency market at that time created difficulties for sheep and lamb exported from Ireland by upsetting the traditional trading patterns to France, our main export destination. The weak performance of sterling gave UK exporters a significant price advantage over Irish exporters in a volatile market.  In addition, traditional French exports of light lamb to southern Europe were discontinued because of the strong French franc and this product was diverted instead to the domestic French market.  The UK will export approximately 100,000 tonnes of sheepmeat to France next year.</P>
    <P>Another factor was the restriction of exports of live sheep to the Continent from both Ireland and the UK.  Irish live sheep exports were 16 per cent below corresponding 1994 levels in the first half of 1995.  The sizable UK live market trade was almost completely stopped and product was exported in carcass form instead.</P>
    <P>A third factor was the significant decline in lamb consumption which took place in the UK over the past three years &mdash; of the order of 20 per cent &mdash; in response to higher retail prices following the termination of the variable premium support system in the market. This demand shift resulted in the release of greater quantities of British lamb for export to France.  Had that decline in consumption not occurred the marketplace would be much healthier.  There is also the reality of strong competition from white meat.  The presence of an exceptionally large quantity of 1994 season hoggets on the Irish market in March and April at a time when prime new season spring lamb became available seriously depressed the going price for the new season products.</P>
    <P>The Minister has taken a series of measures to deal with this situation. Having consulted with the various interest groups involved he submitted a <Col N="994" /> memorandum to EU Commissioner Fischler in March 1995 outlining the serious market situation in Ireland and seeking additional support by way of the ewe premium for the very low market prices which they obtained in Ireland. His proposals were that where market prices fell significantly short of average EU prices, an additional top up compensation should be provided and he also sought extension of the rural world premium to all sheep producers.  These are specific solutions to the present problem.</P>
    <P>The Commission has responded in the form of a direct market intervention which was confined to Ireland.  A scheme of aid for private storage which provided subsidies to lamb processors to buy up and store the equivalent of 11,000 tonnes of 1994 season hoggets played an important part in controlling the downward trend in prices and allowed the market to recover and provide more realistic prices for the 1995 season lamb.  The APS measure cost £300,000.  It eliminated the hogget problem and restored market confidence at a time when panic selling of lamb seemed to be threatening.  That measure was widely recognised by the industry at the time.</P>
    <P>At the June Council of Ministers the Minister again put the issue before his fellow Ministers and the Commission. Subsequently he secured a commitment from the Council to provide market management measures for a second time and to review the operation and level of the ewe premium.  This was a very important commitment and is the foundation of his current efforts at the Agriculture Council.</P>
    <P>In July a second scheme of aids for private storage took 756 tonnes &mdash; the equivalent of 41,000 lambs &mdash; off the market both here and in Northern Ireland and provided quite generous levels of subsidy which cost the European Union approximately £800,000. This second market measure was especially timely and effective in that it not only removed a sizeable quantity of lamb from the market but it created <Col N="995" /> conditions which by the end of the summer allowed prices to pick up and rise to levels above those which existed in 1994.  The value of this measure was fully recognised by the industry.  Current lamb prices are about 4.5 per cent above last year's level and this satisfactory price level has been in place for the last six weeks.  Indeed, the gap between 1995 and 1994 overall is of the order of 5 per cent.  I am prepared to still argue that it is not enough, but at least we are on an upward trend at the moment and we hope this trend continues.</P>
    <P>At the end of July the Minister agreed to the earliest ever payment of advances of the 1995 ewe premium which together with the rural world premium provides £80 million direct to producers to support their income in the difficult market situation.  He estimates that the final amount of the 1995 premium will be £120 million, a figure which in comparison to that paid last year will put an additional £20 million into the pockets of sheep producers. The ewe premium overall should be almost £3 per head higher this year than last and will help cushion the loss suffered through the market weaknesses early in the year.  It is important to emphasise again that the main difficulty was in the late spring/early summer period and that the main adverse consequences fell on those who produce lamb for that period.  Any solutions must address the real problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister has ensured that retention periods for the 1996 ewe premium, while complying with the requirements of EU legislation, strike a proper balance in regard to orderly disposal of lambs.  There has been a synchronisation of retention dates with Northern Ireland and there will be a single retention period in Great Britain.  All those changes will help avoid tension in the market.</P>
    <P>Arguments are being made for a top up of the ewe premium of £8 and for a rural world premium of £5.37 for producers in the non-disadvantaged areas. A declaration made by the Agriculture <Col N="996" /> Council on 21 June 1995, is as follows, and I am confident the Commission will abide by this:</P>
    <P>The Commission undertakes to take market management measures to alleviate the current difficulties in the sheepmeat market, in particular in Ireland.  In the light of the result of these measures it will consider if further action is necessary in particular as regards the possibility of an upward adjustment in the level of ewe premium and an acceleration of its payment.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Minister will take full advantage of that declaration.  The last point I wish to make is in regard to marketing.  We have always had arguments about marketing.  Unfortunately our sheep producers are confined to some degree to the French market.  I appeal to An Bord Bia to take full advantage of the current situation in the German market to spread our market base.  When producers are confined to one market and many factors combine to act against the industry in one year, that industry experiences problems.  The adjustment in finances here are great. The exchange rate is now IR£1.034 to Stg£1.00.  That is far too high and is creating a problem not alone for the sheep producers, but for beef farmers, mushroom growers and everybody else. I appeal to the Minister to ensure that any market prospects, irrespective of where those markets are, should be followed up to try to widen our base and lessen our dependency on one market.  I commend the amendment to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimTownsend" hpid="Mr. Townsend Mr. Townsend">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Townsend</NameTxt>
      <P>The decline in income in the sheep sector did not arise when the present Minister came to office; it has been building up over a number of years.  Sheep production, excluding headage payments and premia, accounted for 5 per cent of total agricultural output in 1994.  When headage and premia are included, the sheep sector contribution increases to 8 per cent of agricultural output.  Sheep numbers peaked in 1993 to 8.7 million and <Col N="997" /> declined to 8.46 million in 1994.  A further slight decline is expected in 1995.  When people get out of an enterprise it is a sign that they are not making money.  Another important figure &mdash; the latest figure available &mdash; is that in 1993 74 per cent of the ewe flock and 78 per cent of producers were within the disadvantaged areas.  I will come back to this important point later.</P>
      <P>The returns from early fat lamb producers has been in decline for about five years.  The gross margin fell from approximately £65 per ewe to approximately £40 per ewe in nominal terms, which would be much greater if inflation was taken into account.  The fall in returns for mid-season lamb producers has not been as great; it has fallen from £53 per ewe to an estimated £49 this year.  Again, if inflation is taken into account the fall would be greater.  In the early 1990s early fat lamb was yielding a gross margin of £10 per ewe higher than mid-season lamb production, but by 1995 this had altered to the position where mid-season lamb production is yielding about £9 per ewe greater than early lamb production.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt there is a serious decline in the income of early fat lamb producers.  While the decline for the mid-season producers is smaller it is still quite serious.  We all know the reasons for the poor prices for early lamb.  We are told the French market is being supplied with chilled New Zealand lamb. There is also a carry over of a supply of hoggets from 1994 and resistance of French wholesalers and consumers to high lamb prices.  All these factors are outside the control of Irish farmers but the Government and the EU may have some control over them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Preparing for this debate tonight, which I welcome, I got some figures from Teagasc.  According to those figures, efficiency plays a large part in farmers' gross income from sheep production. Teagasc carried out tests on sheep grazing on good quality land.  The bottom 25 per cent made a gross margin of £286 per hectare, the middle 50 per cent made a gross margin of £528 per <Col N="998" /> hectare, while the top 25 per cent made a gross margin of £843 per hectare.</P>
    <P>The top sheep farmers are achieving almost three times more profit per hectare than the bottom group and 60 per cent more than the middle one.  The factors which directly affect profitability are stocking rate and lambs weaned. The top group, with a stocking rate of 14.4 ewes per hectare and a weaning percentage of 136, sold 19.6 lambs per hectare as compared to the bottom group, with a stocking rate of only 7.1 ewes per hectare and a weaning percentage of 112, resulting in only eight lambs sold per hectare.  These figures relate to sheep produced on similar type of soils and removes the variation caused by land quality.  This means that one of the main reasons for the variation in performance between the top, middle and bottom groups is in the management of the flocks.</P>
    <P>The data shows there is more scope for improved management of Irish sheep flocks.  Headage and subsidies, which are paid on a per ewe basis and are therefore unrelated to efficiency, form almost 50 per cent of gross profit per ewe and have done little to improve the efficiency of Irish sheep production. However, sheep farmers should not rely on these subsidies in the long term. Technical efficiency will become crucial if we are to remain competitive.  If Irish lamb is to compete on export markets, then it must be produced efficiently.</P>
    <P>The IFA prepared a document, with which I mostly agree, and it is to be complimented for trying to do something about the situation.  I have no doubt that the Minister will do his utmost to relieve the problem.  The IFA has six policy demands.  It demands a ewe premium top up of £8 per ewe and the rural world premium of £5.27 per ewe for producers in non-disadvantaged areas.  I have a problem with its second demand.  Some 75 per cent of our sheep producers live in disadvantaged areas.  If the demand for sheep collapses or they are not making an income, these farmers, unlike those living in low lands, will not be able to turn their land to any <Col N="999" /> other enterprise.  Sheep farmers living in disadvantaged areas should get that premium.</P>
    <P>The IFA also demands a single country method of ewe premium calculation or alternatively, a permanent ewe premium top up mechanism, which speaks for itself; the removal of the 7 per cent stabiliser worth £4.56 per ewe in additional premium payments &mdash; it would be worthwhile if that could be achieved &mdash; and the extending of the extensification premium worth £4.39 per ewe to sheep and paid to flock owners who conform to the necessary stocking rate requirements.  That makes good sense and should be done.  Great play has been made about REPS and the extensification premium.  The Minister should press for the reintroduction of the 13,500 tonne limit on the volume of fresh or chilled imports from New Zealand.  That is one of the main reasons the price of early lambs has decreased.</P>
    <P>While it is good to get publicity for this serious problem, this motion is dishonest. The Minister is doing everything possible to change the situation but it has been building up over the past five years.  If the present Minister and Government are to be condemned, those&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I thank and compliment Senators Townsend and D'Arcy for their practical approach to this matter and their support for the Minister's efforts.  I also thank Senator Kiely and his seconder, Senator Byrne, for their contributions and for raising this matter.  However, I would have liked to have seen more proposals than criticisms.  Although Senator Byrne is a good friend of mine, he was unfair to the Minister as regards his PR machine.  The only reason the Minister is getting a high amount of publicity is because he is an active Minister and is seen to be doing a good job. He has only been in that office for a year but has made a major impact in that period of time.  This criticism has been thrown at him in the Dáil as well &mdash; it is not exclusive to this House.  It seems to be part of Fianna Fáil tactics to reduce his impact, but it is widely recognised that he is a good performer not only in this country but also in the European Union, where it counts.</P>
      <P>It is important that I define clearly and accurately for the Seanad what the problem is, what has been its extent and what are the underlying causes.  This is the only way in which workable and realistic solutions can be found and in which we can do justice to our case and win the support of the Council of Ministers and the European Commission for the additional support which we have been seeking since the early part of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that 1995 has been a disappointing year for a certain segment of sheep producers.  The essence of the problem is that prices during the prime early season production period failed to reach expected levels.  Producers who concentrate their supply of lambs to prime market saw considerable <Col N="1001" /> reductions in their returns this year. There are a number of factors underlying this poor market performance. Among the most important causes were external factors, such as currency fluctuations, which gave sterling an advantage and which also created problems in trade between France and some southern member states, with knock on effects for our trade with France.</P>
    <P>In addition, the continued decline in consumer demand for lamb in the UK for the past number of years, following the termination of the variable premium arrangements, has led to a reduction in Irish exports to the UK and an increase in British lamb exports to France, our main export market.  There was also one important internal factor &mdash; the negative influence of over fat hoggets during the early part of the year, which was largely a speculative trade.</P>
    <P>The lamb sector produces a high price quality product and there is intense competition for the lucrative markets of the EU.  It is necessary, therefore, to review the production and marketing strategy, which may have been satisfactory in the past, with a view to seeing that we are properly positioned to meet future competition.</P>
    <P>A very large proportion, 80 per cent, of Irish lamb is exported, and 75 per cent of this goes to the French market. As a result, French market prices will have a very strong influence on Irish market prices.  The industry is, therefore, very exposed to external market forces.  However, the problem can be alleviated by diversifying, by opening up markets and by exploiting all possible market opportunities.  This has happened to a certain degree in the last few years with our expansion into the Mediterranean markets, and this year sees a 33 per cent increase in Irish exports to Germany.  Senator D'Arcy mentioned that we should concentrate on the German market, and I am sure he is glad to see that we have increased our exports to the German market.  There are considerable opportunities in Germany from what I saw when I visited the <Col N="1002" /> country to promote the sale of Irish lamb.</P>
    <P>Market development is a slow process. The French market will continue to be vitally important to us.  It is where good prices are to be had, and France has one of the highest <i>per capita</i> consumption levels of sheepmeat.  We need to ensure that our approach to this market is exactly right.</P>
    <P>The EU sheepmeat market is well supplied and is very price competitive. Sheepmeat is an expensive product and it must not be forgotten that it competes with other cheaper meats.  The UK, our main competitor on the export market, had a distinct advantage this year because of the currency situation with a weak sterling.  Over the past five years the UK has increased exports by 68,000 tonnes.  Consumption of sheep has dropped in the UK, but this decline has not been bridged by the growing levels of consumption in Germany and Spain. Predictions for 1996 are that consumption will continue to drop in the UK, but will remain stable in the rest of the EU.</P>
    <P>The only way to be successful in this demanding and competitive market is to ensure that we have the right product, especially the kind of product that will justify a higher price.  We must be conscious of where the competition is coming from, of emerging trends and of advances being made by our competitors.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of the New Zealanders, whom we all know are penetrating the British market at present at an alarming rate.  New Zealand lamb wound up in this country last summer. The competition is there and we must face up to this reality.</P>
    <P>It is totally incorrect to say that the Minister or the Government have been indifferent to the problems of the sheep farmers and the sheep industry.  The Opposition does not reflect reality, because the truth is that the problems of the sheep sector have been tackled head on.  Action has been taken to redress these problems.  The accusations of indifference or lack of action is a complete misstatement of the facts and <Col N="1003" /> ignores the various measures adopted in the course of the year to improve the market and to seek additional support for the sector.</P>
    <P>As early as last March a memorandum was sent by the Minister to EU Commissioner Fischler detailing the problems facing the sector and explaining why the ewe premium scheme as currently operated was incapable of adequately compensating Irish producers for low market prices. This memorandum also outlined possible solutions to the problem, especially by way of a top up premium or the extension of the rural world premium to producers in members states, where prices are 10 per cent or more below average EU prices.  The Minister has availed of every opportunity over the past year to highlight the absence of price convergence under the current system and the need to redress the imbalance arising from this.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the Minister's response to the difficult market situation has been quick and effective.  No effort has been spared in convincing the European Commission of the difficulties facing Irish sheep producers and of the need to introduce additional measures to support the market when this was necessary. For example, following the representations made in March, the Commission introduced an aid for private storage scheme for Ireland at the end of April in order to take the overhang of hoggets off the market. This scheme played an important part in controlling the downward trend in prices at the time and allowed the market recover and provide more realistic prices for 1995 season lamb.  The APS measure cost £300,000, eliminated the hogget problem and restored market confidence at the moment when panic selling of lamb appeared to be threatened. The value of this measure was widely recognised by the industry at the time.</P>
    <P>The problems of the sheep sector were again raised at the EU Council of Ministers in June when a commitment <Col N="1004" /> was secured from the Council to provide further market management measures and to review the operation and level of the ewe premium.  In response to this commitment, a second scheme of aids for private storage was introduced in July and removed 756 tonnes, the equivalent of 41,000 lambs, from the market, both here and in Northern Ireland, and provided quite generous levels of subsidy, which cost the Union approximately £800,000.  This second market measure was especially timely and effective in that it not only removed a sizeable quantity of lamb from the market but created conditions which by the end of the summer allowed prices to pick up and rise to above 1994 levels.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of record that the value of these APS measures have been fully recognised and acknowledged by the industry.  The market situation would have been considerably more difficult in the absence of these measures.  Contrary to what some of the Members on the Opposition benches would have us believe, the APS measures did support prices.  Producers' incomes were also helped by the earliest payment ever of the first two advances of the ewe premium, which again was a direct result of the Minister's efforts in the Council.</P>
    <P>The Minister has diligently kept the problems of Irish sheep producers firmly on the negotiating table.  The issue has been raised at virtually every meeting of the Council since last March and I can say with confidence that every Minister for Agriculture in the EU, in addition to the European Commission, are fully conversant with the difficulties in the Irish sheep market.  The Minister is committed to pursue this matter until his efforts have delivered tangible results.</P>
    <P>In view of the budgetary situation in Brussels, we were always aware that there was no scope for special concessions until the 1996 budgetary year, which began in November, and that any additional aid was unlikely to be agreed until December.  These are the crucial weeks, therefore, and efforts will be redoubled, because it is recognised that <Col N="1005" /> the sheepmeat sector is a vital part of the agriculture industry.  One must recognise that negotiation at EU level involves persuading the Commission to come forward with a proposal and subsequently ensuring that the proposal receives sufficient support in the Council of Ministers.  This is why so much effort has been devoted to convincing the Commission and individual Ministers of the merits of our case.</P>
    <P>As well as looking to the Commission to provide assistance for the sector, there are a number of areas in which we can and must act immediately.  Not all of the problems of the sheepmeat industry are caused by external factors alone. There are weaknesses in the industry, which we need to remedy.  A greater effort needs to be made to achieve quality on a more consistent basis.  For this reason, the Minister has requested An Bord Bia to carry out an in depth analysis of the different aspects of the Irish sheep industry, with particular attention to the export market.</P>
    <P>This report is near completion and should be the basis for formulating a strategy for the period ahead.  I urge the farming organisations and other interests in the sheep industry to cooperate fully with An Bord Bia in this respect.  It will come forward with a good proposal and, with the support of all concerned, it could turn the sheep industry around in the coming year.  It is important that it is supported.  Negotiations will take place shortly with the farming organisations in this respect and I urge them to support the initiatives.  A number of things are already clear.  The aspect in which Irish produce is most vulnerable is in regard to quality and consistency of product.  The French market on which we are so dependent will penalise for poor quality product.  If we do not produce exactly what the market demands there are many competitors who are fully prepared to step in and take over our market share.</P>
    <P>With a predominantly export trade and a difficult market, quality becomes all important.  Quality, convenience and <Col N="1006" /> value for money is what the consumer wants.  For too long too much of our throughput has consisted of over-fat lamb.  Producers get better prices for the larger lamb and, as a result, they keep lambs to over-fat condition.  This is detrimental to the overall industry.  Optimum quality must be the primary objective of all those involved in the industry. Dry hoggets are not in the interest of the Irish sheep industry, especially when they come on the market close to Easter and depress the price of spring lamb.</P>
    <P>A working classification system which rewards the producer for quality is crucial to the improvement of the standard of Irish lamb production.  The critical issue is that it is workable and effective. Indeed, a voluntary scheme stands a better chance of being effective.  We are making substantial progress on this issue.  The intention is that carcass classification will be standard practice in the industry by 1 January next.</P>
    <P>The logic of the carcass classification system is that processors pay for lambs on the basis of quality, otherwise producers will not have an adequate incentive to produce the right quality lambs. The reverse will also apply and, of course, poor quality lamb will have to be penalised.  I am well aware of the ability of Irish farmers to recognise that it pays to produce quality produce and so it is clear that this change can deliver very effective results.</P>
    <P>In 1996 there will be factors which should work to our advantage.  The 100 day retention period for the ewe premium will end two weeks earlier than in 1995.  This influences markets at the critical Easter period.  This is two weeks before the peak early lamb trade, which gives an opportunity for the marketing of a limited quantity of sheepmeat before the spring lamb hits the market. Also, the introduction of a single retention period by the UK will be of considerable assistance in this regard.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that prices have firmed considerably in the last few months. Indeed, since mid-September prices have been on average 5 per cent higher than in the corresponding period in <Col N="1007" /> 1994, which means that some producers have done reasonably well this year. The improvement in prices has also made it somewhat more difficult to negotiate a special deal for our producers because Ministers of our partner member states in the Council of Ministers will be faced with the difficulty of explaining to their own producers why special measures should be introduced for Ireland.  The justice of this case is very clear to all and the Minister is determined to press ahead with the demand for a supplementary premium. I do not expect any developments, however, until later in the month when the Council meets on 19/20 December.</P>
    <P>The motion before us does not fairly or accurately reflect the efforts or the progress which both the Minister and the Department have made in the course of the past year in response to the difficulties being experienced by the sheepmeat sector.  The approach has been proactive and energetic and the efforts made have been successful in so far as having measures introduced which have restored stability and confidence to the market at critical times.  I recommend the alternative motion as a true and accurate reflection of the situation.</P>
    <P>I am always glad to come to the Seanad, where I started my political career.  The debates here have always been stimulating and to the point.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House to discuss this important issue for sheep farmers.  We make no apologies for raising this issue.  It is disappointing that Government Members have indicated that we should not have tabled this motion.  Where have they been for the last six months?  This matter is of major concern to all sheep <Col N="1008" /> farmers and the Government knows that.</P>
      <P>We want to strengthen the Minister's hand when he goes to Brussels and to encourage a change in attitude.  Fianna Fáil will support any attempt to improve the lot of sheep farmers.  In 1995, 40 per cent of early lamb was sold at a loss.  If the Minister is in any doubt about that he can talk to the sheep farmers.  They held a demonstration here two weeks ago and we all met them.  I am sure the Minister also met them and heard their plea.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">

      <P>It probably was not.  The motion tabled by Fianna Fáil is in the interests of the sheep farmers and I am disappointed to hear it being criticised. These Houses are the venues in which we can air people's views.  Tonight we are trying to air the views of sheep farmers and to assist them in getting a better price for their produce.</P>
      <P>Sheep farmers suffered a great deal in the period from April until the last few weeks.  The Minister said that prices have increased in the last two or three months but they have only increased in the last two or three weeks to any significant level.  It is good to learn that this week there is a substantial increase in the price of lamb.  However, the Minister should take on board what has happened to sheep farmers in the last eight months and see what can be done to replace their losses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome my colleague and friend, Deputy Deenihan, to the House.  It is good to see him about the place again.  I support the Minister and the farming community which is facing great difficulties at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that criticism without constructive ideas is not much good.  Members can read the Minister's speech, see what is constructive in it and if they do not agree with it they should at least put forward something constructive in its place so we will <Col N="1009" /> have some idea of what direction to take.  My constituency is composed of small farmers.  This type of issue is very sensitive in places such as Cavan/ Monaghan where the size of farms is smaller than it is in other parts of Ireland.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that it is easy to tip a small farmer out of business.  Much of the time the small farmer is dependent on borrowed money in order to stock the farm.  If at the end of the year he is unable to pay back the money, the bank manager will not be interested in renewing the loan the following year.  I have encountered many cases where farmers have been pushed out of business because they cannot get credit.  I have come across cases where people could not even get enough money to buy fertiliser for the land because the bank manager could not get a guarantee that the money would be repaid.  The Minister and the Minister of State are conscious of this and it runs through their thinking.  All the constructive action they take is aimed at protecting, in so far as they can, the whole farming community, including the small farmers I represent.</P>
    <P>Market forces are at work.  The French market presented problems for us this year for various reasons.  These problems were exacerbated by the strength of the Irish pound <i>vis-à-vis</i> sterling. Sterling is weak and there is not much the Irish Government can do to bring its value up to parity with, or below, the Irish pound.  Those of us who come from areas where a substantial number of people is employed in processing meat and other products for the English market know the difficulties people are facing.  However, the Government cannot intervene in British affairs and cannot do anything about the value of sterling.</P>
    <P>Economists tell us we have a booming economy and that there is no danger of inflation rising.  This is a difficulty in one sense because we are building up a foreign surplus which is leading to a strengthening of the pound.  This difficulty <Col N="1010" /> arises from an economy in full flight and it is impossible to interfere with this.</P>
    <P>I support the work the Minister and the Minister of State have done.  Twice so far this year, at appropriate times, they intervened in the market by taking a large amount from it to ensure prices would be maintained.  If they had not done so, prices would probably have fallen to way below the levels they reached.  They are holding discussions with the European Union.  Because the Union is a managed sector, they must force it into action, but this is difficult to achieve.  We know from the problems of Irish Steel that we cannot go to Europe and come back with a bucket of goods the following day.  Our competitors are not anxious to see interventions here to support people.  In many cases they would prefer to see people go out of business so that they themselves would have an increased market share.</P>
    <P>I am happy that the Ministers are doing everything in their power.  I know Deputy Deenihan for years and when he gets his teeth into something he does not take them out quickly.  Anybody who played corner forward on a county football team against Kerry knew they had played a game when they had finished.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">

    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be true.  The Minister of State's record as a private citizen and as a public representative point to the fact that he will do whatever needs to be done.</P>
      <P>For the sake of the people I represent, I hope next year will be better. All the efforts made to convince our partners in Europe of how serious the problem is have paid dividends.  I hope that by the end of the year announcements will be made which will ensure that people will stay in business, continue to thrive and will be able to respond to the Minister's suggestion that we must improve the quality of our products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1011" /> A great deal of emphasis is put on the fact that the quality of Irish lamb sold on the French market is not as good as it should be.  I hope we will be in a position next year to improve the quality of our products and obtain higher prices for them so that everybody will be a little richer.  Many small towns in rural Ireland depend on small farmers who are trying to make a living from sheep. This issue is important to us and no one should doubt our sincerity.  We are keenly interested in trying to solve these problems.  I am confident the Minister is doing exactly what is required and I ask everybody to support him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House for this important debate.  I hope I will be constructive; it is my intention to be so.  We have blamed our problems on our currency, French consumers, lack of quality, events in Britain and New Zealanders.  It is time we attached some blame here at home. Quality is not much different to what it was last year.  I do not agree that nothing can be done about the currency. I will come later to what I believe should be done about these matters.</P>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats support this motion.  With regard to early lamb at Knockbeg, figures from Teagasc show that there was an income of £58.80 in 1994 and £48.80 in 1995, a reduction of 17 per cent.  The net margin on a mid season lambing flock was £35.33 in 1988 and £22.56 in 1994, a reduction of 36 per cent.  It is a wonder that in these circumstances only 10,000 people protested outside Leinster House and that they behaved themselves.  What would trade unions do if they were faced with a decrease of 36 per cent?</P>

I do not underestimate the difficulty which confronts the Minister but something must be done and I intend to suggest what can be done.  The net margin on early lamb at Lyons' Estate was £33.27 in 1994 and £22.22 in 1995, a reduction of £11.  It is not a surprise that 10,000 farmers protested.</P>
      <P>In his Dáil statement the Minister spoke about the reduction in average lamb prices as did the Minister of State here today.  The Minister gave figures of 4 per cent and 6 per cent.  The Minister of State said there has been a 5 per cent increase since September.  This strikes me as being spin doctor speak.  They are trying to find figures which are good.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister has stated facts but these are selective.  He said the full ewe premium would be £2 to £3 a head more than it was in 1994. On 7 November he said he was well aware of the income situation and that no effort has been spared by him or his Department to assist sheep producers and that they were not indifferent to the situation.  The Minister of State said the same this evening.  I do not think anybody displays indifference, but what was done?  We have had two tangible results from all this activity, each of them in the area of aids to private storage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The farm management survey figures from Teagasc show that in 1994 family farm income amounted to £233 from dairying, £130 from tillage, £87 from cattle and £80 from sheep.  We know the direction in which the last figure has gone since 1994.  In that year 92 per cent <Col N="1013" /> of the income of sheep farmers came from direct payments.  The Wexford lamb producer group produced figures which show that the net profit per ewe this year is £11.40.  The subsidy amounts to £21; thus we have gone past the 100 per cent level.  This underlines the vulnerability of this sector to decisions made in Brussels.</P>
    <P>A standard refuge is to commission a report.  An Bord Bia was instructed to carry out an in-depth analysis of the different aspects of the sheep industry. One of the conclusions of a report prepared for An Bord Bia is that lamb prices in individual member states show no signs of convergence; the opposite appears to be happening.  Sheep farmers were assured under CAP reform that prices would converge, in other words, there would be an average price across the board.  The claim for the £8 top up ewe premium is justified on the basis of what has happened.  It shows that something needs to be done about the method of calculation.</P>
    <P>In June the declaration from the EU Agriculture Council stated that the Commission undertook to take market management measures to alleviate the current difficulties in the sheep meat market, particularly in Ireland.  In the light of the result of these measures it was to consider if further action was necessary, particularly the possibility of an upward adjustment in the level of ewe premium and acceleration of its payment.  This is now December.  Who has acted on this undertaking?  I do not see any evidence of action.  The battle will be at the Council of Ministers meeting in Brussels on 12 December and we want the Minister to come home, as Deputy Reynolds did on one famous occasion, with money in the bag.</P>

      <P>We know what is required of Brussels and the IFA has clearly spelt it out &mdash; a top up premium of £8 per ewe; a rural world premium of £5.27 per ewe for producers in non-disadvantaged areas; consideration of the method of calculation; removal of the 7 per cent stabiliser; an extensification premium worth £4.39 and reintroduction of the limit on New Zealand imports.  However, there are things which can be done at home.  For example, quality is constantly mentioned. There are responsibilities on the industry to produce, but there are also responsibilities on us to sell a quality product.  That responsibility falls primarily on An Bord Bia.  What resources are we putting into An Bord Bia to ensure that high quality Irish lamb, which is superior, will be sold effectively and competitively on international markets? That is something we can do at home.  Researching quality must also be considered; it is as if the farmer has responsibility in a vacuum to produce <Col N="1015" /> this quality.  He must be assisted in doing so.</P>
      <P>Two sheep vets who were in Teagasc are no longer there.  If we do not have basic research, how can we compete effectively in an international environment? I would like someone to explain that to me.  We are looking for two vets.  Teagasc wants to introduce an AI programme but that cannot be funded either.  These are things we can do at home.  The margin at the top of the scale is approximately two and a half times that at the bottom.  There is a job for researchers, for Teagasc and for advisers.  They did it in the past and they should be allowed to do it again.</P>

When the Progressive Democrats were in Government the GATT negotiations took place and the figure for New Zealand lamb imports was agreed. Why did the Government not ensure that it was not boneless lamb which was allowed into this country as this would have reduced the total amount of lamb coming in from New Zealand?  Senator Dardis mentioned the money which the former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, was promised but when we went looking for it it was not there.  He has a short memory.  I am disappointed at the views he expressed here tonight about the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry. This problem did not start on 14 December 1994.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important issue. A number of speakers may not recognise the seriousness of the problem unless they are involved in the industry. The income of sheep farmers has decreased substantially since 1984, as the previous speaker said.  It is interesting to note that during a temporary arrangement nothing happened to improve the situation which kept sliding.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The truth always hurts those who are righter than right.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry if something can be done about the subsidy on hoggets. Some time ago it was agreed to pay a subsidy on hoggets and this caused serious problems to lamb producers' incomes this year, especially early and spring lamb producers.  This agreement was a retrograde step for those involved in lamb production.  When negotiations on this issue take place later this month, because we are on our own, we should see if there can be some change in 1996 and beyond.</P>
      <P>The reality this spring was that hoggets held over for the retention period flooded the market for early and spring lamb producers.  We should do something to alleviate the problem and restore a reasonable income to those involved in early lamb production.  Substantial numbers of producers have pulled out of early lamb production due to last year's position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I witnessed the discussions that have taken place on different levels among various groups and organisations, not <Col N="1018" /> only in County Meath but throughout the country.  There have been representations and lobbying to get the ewe premium for 1995.  Everyone supports that proposal, of course, but when you are fighting on a single issue, unless you can convince your colleagues that something will be done, it takes guts and negotiating skill.  The Minister has the skill and has proven it over the past 12 months.  I have no doubt that he will succeed with the help of some others that I hope he can convince to support him and support the measures necessary to help the industry.</P>
    <P>Not so very long ago French sheep farmers had serious problems with their own incomes and they took drastic action up and down the country.  I happened to be at the receiving end of that action one day and I would not support it in any shape or form anywhere in Europe.  The French should be reminded that they got special concessions that year.</P>
    <P>The subsidy on hoggets is one way of ensuring that early lamb producers will be protected by not allowing a glut of hoggets on the market after a retention period.  I do not mind whether the retention period is changed or not, but they should not be left until February, March and April to destroy the market.</P>
    <P>We must be realistic.  The bottom line is that those processing lambs will always use the opportunity of a glut to reduce prices.  It is all determined by what price they can get on the French market.  If we really want to tackle the problem, that is where it should be done.  I have already made these points known to the Minister, Deputy Yates, and I hope that some action will be taken on 12 and 13 December.</P>
    <P>I have confidence in the Minister's ability to negotiate some improvement in this year's subsidy.  The use of subsidies is not the way I would like to see income protection developing over the next five or six years, although it has been allowed to happen that way over a period of time.  I wish the Minister well in his endeavours to deal with this problem as he has successfully dealt with <Col N="1019" /> many other problems that had been left behind when he took over the job on 14 December last year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Private Members' motion from the Fianna Fáil Party specifically states:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann, acknowledging the crisis in the Irish sheep sector and mindful of the many thousands of jobs on farms and in factories dependent on the industry, condemns the Government and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry for the sustained indifference they have demonstrated on the needs of the industry; and hereby calls for urgent steps to be taken to address both the immediate crisis and the long-term structural problems of the Irish sheep sector.</P>
      <P>That motion was not tabled by my party without due consideration.  It comes as a direct response to the massive representation from sheep farmers who had to stop work on their farms and come to Dublin on a number of occasions recently.  Up to 10,000 of them were here to demonstrate only a week ago.</P>
      <P>Coming from County Roscommon, I know the sheep industry extremely well and I am aware of the difficulties facing it.  No sheep farmers could go along with the amendment the Government has tabled to counteract the Fianna Fáil motion that tries to highlight the difficulties they are experiencing.</P>
      <P>The Government amendment states that:</P>
      <P>Seanad Éireann endorses the effective measures which have already been taken by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to address the difficulties which have been experienced by sheep producers this year; and commends [I suppose it should be condemns] the intensive efforts by the Minister at the Council of Agriculture Ministers to secure further support for the sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1020" /> The barometer by which we should measure how the Minister and the sheep industry are performing is the number of farmers who are staying in agriculture, as well as the number of ewes in the country now compared to three or four years ago.  The facts show there are 5,000 fewer sheep farmers than there were three years ago.  In addition, there are 130,000 fewer ewes than three years ago.  That is the barometer we have to go by when we address the problems of the sheep industry in this House.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry is not here, although I appreciate the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, who is an excellent Minister.  I compliment him, but he will not be at the Council of Ministers meeting next week in Brussels.  This motion is so important that the Minister should have come to hear the views of the House and to address the matter himself.  Obviously, he does not consider this House to be important or else he does not consider the crisis in the sheep industry to be important.  However, we have to deal with the matter in his absence.</P>
    <P>The sheep industry is in crisis because the last raise sheep farmers got for their produce was in December 1992.  Could any other sector or group of people cope with a situation where they have not received a penny increase since the end of 1992?  Yet the Minister tables an amendment to our motion endorsing the &ldquo;effective measures&rdquo; he has taken to maintain the sheep industry.  Who does he think he is codding?  He is certainly not codding the sheep farmers who are up in arms.  Their livelihoods are going out the window and there seems to be total inaction by the Government and the Minister.  That is the reality and while it may not be the nicest thing to say, it is as well for us to speak about it because it faces us every day.</P>
    <P>The sheep farmers have brought the matter to the gates of Leinster House. The sheep industry is in crisis and effective measures are now needed.  Sheep <Col N="1021" /> farmers and their umbrella organisations have asked that two matters be dealt with immediately &mdash; the extension of the rural world premium and an £8 increase in the ewe premium.  Those overdue measures should be brought on stream immediately and the Minister should be in a position to get clearance in Brussels next week.</P>
    <P>Some criticism has been made that the original decision to put the premium on the ewe might not have been in the best interests of this country.  Senator Dardis outlined some of the excuses which have been made recently.  Everyone looks for excuses when they cannot deliver what they are supposed to when in Government and they try to blame somebody else.  I have heard people say that placing the premium on the ewe might not have been the best decision to take on behalf of sheep farmers.  I have no doubt sheep farmers would agree that it was effective and that due to the premium being placed on the ewe, the ewe population increased from 1.3 million to 3.4 or 3.5 million.  It allowed farmers to go into the sheep industry and to increase their numbers.</P>
    <P>The long-term supports and the ongoing re-evaluation of prices for sheep and sheepmeat has not kept pace. Nothing has been done in the sheep industry to increase the price since December 1992.  A couple of measures were mentioned by the Minister, such as the APS.  Although they are effective for a small section, they are not the answer to the crisis in the sheep industry in that they dealt with an oversupply of hoggets; they did not deal with the core issue.</P>
    <P>The Council of Ministers must be made aware that the convergence of prices has not taken place.  The Minister has a responsibility to explain the difficulties sheep farmers face at this time. The intention and the hope that there would be a convergence of prices has not taken place.  The prices which the Irish sheep farmer is realising for his produce has not measured up to what was expected.  The Minister has a duty to explain to the Commission and to his <Col N="1022" /> colleagues on the Council of Ministers that the sheep farmer has fallen behind, that there is a crisis in the sheep industry and that more sheep farmers will go out of business unless measures are taken.</P>
    <P>What is the alternative for a farmer who must leave the sheep industry? Where would a sheep farmer get the capital to go into the milk or cattle sector? I see no alternative for the sheep farmer who must pack in his business other than the farmer's dole because he has no capital to go into any other area of farming.  Agri-tourism would not provide a full income.  This motion requests the Minister to take effective measures and to face up to the reality that there is a crisis in the sheep industry and it is his responsibility as the Minister to deal with it.</P>

      <P>Who were the friends of sheep farmers at that time?  Did Senator Kiely open his mouth then?  No Senator complained about the scabies scheme, for example.  We should face facts and realise that sheep farmers are the losers <Col N="1023" /> in this case.  I am glad to say prices have improved in the past few weeks and we want this to continue.</P>
      <P>Although negotiations in Brussels will be extremely difficult, I am sure the Minister will do his best, as he has always done.  Everyone, including the farming organisations, know the factors which work against negotiations in that area.  While it is politically popular to blame a Minister, I do not believe that the Minister has failed, because external factors are involved.  Supply and demand has always been a major factor.</P>
      <P>I have confidence in the Minister and sympathy for farmers, particularly those in my area, who are taking a beating. We must deal with the facts and give support when due.  It is vital that the Opposition, particularly Fianna Fáil, support the Minister.  It is the Opposition's role to back the Minister when farmers are in trouble rather than criticise him and make cheap snide points as if he were to blame for everything.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased Fianna Fáil tabled this motion, although it was criticised by the Government side.  The motion states:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann, acknowledging the crisis in the Irish sheep sector and mindful of the many thousands of jobs on farms and in factories dependent on the industry, condemns the Government and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry for the sustained indifference they have demonstrated on the needs of the industry; and hereby calls for urgent steps to be taken to address both the immediate crisis and the long-term structural problems of the Irish sheep sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Townsend said the second part of the motion was dishonest.  I disagree with him, because sustained indifference has been demonstrated as regards the needs of the sheep industry.  We have been taken to task for criticising the Minister.  The criticism is justified.  We support any Minister who does good for <Col N="1024" /> farmers, but when a Minister is not pulling his weight we will point it out.  I was disappointed with the Minister's speech. He did not say how the problems of the sheep sector will be addressed.  He told farmers how to produce quality lambs without telling them what assistance they will receive to do so.</P>
    <P>A leaflet produced by the Wexford lamb producers group states the profit a farmer receives from 100 ewes at £11.40 per ewe.  However, as Senator Dardis pointed out, there is a £21 subsidy for each ewe.  If the subsidy did not exist, the farmers would not make any profit and, as Senator Finneran said, their only alternative would be to sign on for the farmer's dole.</P>
    <P>Senator Townsend said sheep farmers must adjust to living without premia. However, sheep farmers depend on subsidies and would not exist today but for these premia.  He said we must come around to the idea of farming without subsidies.  However, farming is dependent on such subsidies, a point proved since Ireland joined the EU.  Sheep farmers are particularly dependent on them.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the EU Agriculture Council declaration on 21 June 1995 which stated:</P>
    <P>The Commission undertakes to take management measures to alleviate the current difficulties in the sheepmeat market in particular in Ireland.  In light of the result of these measures, it will consider if further action is necessary in particular with regard to the possibility of an upward adjustment in the level of ewe premium and acceleration of its payment.</P>
    <P>That was in June and to my knowledge there has been no upward adjustment in the ewe premium.  This is what farmers are seeking now and the Minister of State did not say that when the Minister meets the Council of Ministers next week he will demand any top up ewe subsidy in the ewe premium.  There is a precedent for this move.  It was achieved <Col N="1025" /> in 1992 by the former Minister, Deputy Joe Walsh, who was criticised earlier.</P>
    <P>This is the first thing the Minister should do and, as I said earlier, he does not seem particularly qualified. Members on the Government side mentioned the Minister's actions, but it is his performance in Europe that counts.  He must perform well there to ensure the sheep farmers can make a decent living. Any other section of the community would be up in arms if it faced with a similar reduction in its income to that endured by sheep farmers in the past five years.  This year is the worst yet. The Minister mentioned the private storage scheme.  It probably helped, but it was not enough.  It is fine to say that to get it was an achievement in itself, but it was not enough for the sheep farmers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1026" /> I am disappointed with the Minister's reply, but I am delighted this motion was debated.  Senators Dardis and Finneran made valuable contributions as to why the crisis in the sheep industry must be addressed.  We are told certain measures will be taken but nothing has happened.  It is fine for the sheep and farming organisations to hear flowery language from the Minister but it will not work here.  The flowery language must work in Europe and I wish the Minister every success there.  I hope he will return with good news for the sheep farmers.  However, in order to do so, he must take stronger action if these farmers are to be satisfied and achieve a reasonable standard of living.  Their incomes do not allow this at present.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we suspended discussion of this Bill I was making general remarks about the Bill.  I took exception to the macho language of &ldquo;ship's master&rdquo; and &ldquo;harbour master&rdquo; but I do not think &ldquo;ship's mistress&rdquo; or &ldquo;harbour person&rdquo; would be a great change.  On a serious note, this is an exceptionally important Bill which will improve the efficiency of harbours throughout the country.  As we have become a net exporting rather than a net importing country over the last 15 years, the operation of harbours becomes more important for the efficiency of our nation.  The increased container traffic, cargo loads and overall shipping traffic in and out of the island makes it essential that we run our harbours on a commercial basis.  I will refer to this on later Stages of the Bill, particularly as we are changing the traditional boards to companies, with all that implies.  It reflects on life in Ireland and our current needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My core complaint concerns the section containing the objectives of the company, because it lacks a reference to the environment, although I am glad that another section mentions nuclear waste.  Because the traffic which will go through harbours is so important, it is crucial that the harbour companies be given a clear responsibility to protect <Col N="1029" /> the environment of which they have control.  This must be done in a proactive way in the legislation and I ask the Minister to take this on board.</P>
    <P>The objects of the company listed in section 11 are all proper.  Senator Taylor-Quinn was worried about the engagement in business activity, but I fully approve of it because in itself it will give emphasis to these points.  However, the Minister should consider introducing a new sub-paragraph (f) to section 11 (1) so that among the objectives of a harbour company would be to regulate, control or direct any substances, activities, processes, ships or vehicles within the harbour area which might impact destructively or negatively on the environment. By making this an objective of the company, it would have the authority to pursue it under the section which provides that a company shall have power to do anything which appears requisite, advantageous or incidental to or which appears to facilitate, either directly or indirectly, its performance of its functions.  That section may also need to be amended, but no more than that is required.  I will put forward an amendment to that effect after examining the matter more closely.</P>
    <P>The Minister's record on environmental issues is second to none &mdash; he has been to the forefront on major issues like nuclear power and nuclear waste.  I grew up beside a harbour and know the dirt which can flow and the material which may be dumped in it.  I have not studied the Bill in as much detail as other speakers, but it seems the provisions concerning nuclear power and ballast are the only ones where the Minister has addressed this issue.  I considered whether the harbour companies should also have input to planning permission around the harbour area, but they would probably be seen as an interested party and would therefore have an input into the planning process in any case.  It would therefore not be correct if they had control over planning, although they would have a significant and influential input.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1030" /> I ask the Minister to look at this matter. The busier harbours become, the greater potential there is for problem, whether through leakage, seepage, spillage or jetsam which could clog them up. If raw sewerage flows into a harbour from elsewhere, or if marked fish are dumped, who has control over that? Those matters may be covered elsewhere, but the harbour companies should have control over their environment. Any processing industry which might develop from the objective of engaging in or encouraging business activities could well lead to discharges which might create a problem.  I will not labour this point as I will return to it later, but I ask the Minister to respond to it in detail.</P>
    <P>Section 12 is extremely significant, as the Minister will agree.  I am comfortable, which I might not have been some years ago, with the change from providing a service to a commercial enterprise. I recognise and accept the arguments for it, but we should note that this is what is happening.  Up to now the object was to provide a good service, now it is intended to operate on a commercial basis.</P>
    <P>I approve the optimism of the provision that the company should conduct its affairs to ensure its revenues are not less than sufficient, taking one year with another.  The Minister should submit that provision to tomorrow's Cabinet meeting on the Estimates.  Those who operate harbours should be under no more restrictions than those who run Departments.  The provision is optimistic and I hope it works out that way. However, I hope the boards, as they are at present, or the companies, as they will be, are not faced with an impossibility if some of the things they want to develop are not possible on a year by year basis.</P>
    <P>Section 13 concerns agents, who will have to give a bond or other type of security.  The Irish Ship Agents' Association is concerned about this provision and the Minister has made changes from an earlier version of the Bill.  I will listen to both the Minister and the association <Col N="1031" /> on the point.  I approve of the idea of bonding by people who provide a service and have no fundamental objection to it.  I am looking at the possibility of buying a boat at the moment and that will require a marine survey.  I will only have that marine survey done by somebody who has a bond or indemnity to ensure that I can depend on his or her work.  Similarly I would not book a holiday with a travel agent who was not bonded.  It is not quite the same thing, but it is fair that the harbours should not be at a loss if they do business through an agent who might be acting in good faith but who might himself or herself be let down by a ship owner.  I am prepared to listen to the arguments.  I seem to be coming down on the Minister's side rather than the other side at the moment, but I have not spoken to these people.  I will listen to what they have to say and I will come back to this on the Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The section which has been discussed more than any other is section 13(8).  I recognise that this issue has been discussed many times.  I do not want to rehearse the arguments here; I heard the arguments from New Ross and Waterford in regard to their concerns. As the people in New Ross see it, ships coming to them through the water of Waterford Harbour will have to pay charges, directly or indirectly, to two different harbour companies.  There seems to be a difficulty there, but I can see that there is a very sustainable argument on both sides.</P>
    <P>Where there is common usage, there should be a common approach.  The Bill should attempt to provide for that. Whether the Minister believes it or not, he has taken the easy way out in this regard.  Where a ship has to pass through two different harbour areas, there should be a common approach both to the service provided there and also to the costings involved in it.  That should be done strictly on a basis proportionate to the shipping going into each port.  It is not difficult to do that and it should be done.  It would have <Col N="1032" /> many implications but the situation should not be left as it is.  It is wrong and too easy to say that harbour charges can be imposed in such a situation without any intervention or system of agreement on what the calculation might be.  Harbour authorities like New Ross would want to protect themselves in that situation. I have a lot of sympathy for them in this regard.</P>
    <P>The harbour masters have taken up a strong position in regard to their involvement with the board and whether he or she can engage with the board.  I listened very closely to the speech of President Robinson to the UN General Assembly this year.  It was a very progressive speech, which was no doubt approved by Government and came from the Department of Foreign Affairs, although it got very little publicity. The President mentioned in it that the Secretary General of the UN should attend and be part of the Security Council. I agree with that.  This is exactly the same issue.</P>
    <P>The idea that the harbour master could in some situations not be a participant in the workings of the board is a neglect.  I feel very strongly about it. They have to be in there.  I can relate it to my own position as the general secretary of a trade union.  I am a non-voting member of the executive.  I do not want to vote on the executive but I could not imagine a situation where I would not be involved in the decision making process by discussing those decisions with the executive.  I feel very strongly about this; the Minister should have another look at it.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise a question &mdash; I will check the answer if I am not around when the Minister is summing up &mdash; about the right of the harbour master to authorise or delegate authority to other people.  I fully approve of that, it is a good way to do business.  However, the legislation is not clear on this issue.  It would be important for all those involved to protect themselves in regard to where responsibility lies in the event of delegation.  What happens if the harbour master asks a member of staff to <Col N="1033" /> do something which eventually contributes to a problem in regard to which there is negligence or liability?  I am not talking about pointing the finger here; I am just looking at this in the same way as I would look at the Ministers and Secretaries Act by which we run the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>There is a discussion as to how much a departmental secretary, who is after all the Accounting Officer of the Department, can delegate.  As far as I know, the responsibilities which the Minister has had delegated to him through the Department of the Marine had to be written, approved, accepted and delegated by Government in a very formal way when he took up office.  This provision is analogous to that.  Where does the responsibility lie at the time of delegation?  Responsibility should still lie with the harbour master.  I wish to be very clear about that, because the buck stops with the person in authority, with the accounting officer, the person who will have to take all aspects, including that one, into consideration when deciding to delegate.  Delegation, in other words, does not pass the buck in terms of responsibility.</P>
    <P>There is a lot in the section dealing with safety of navigation and security in the harbour.  How close has been the contact between the Minister and the Department and the Health and Safety Authority?  Have they had an input into that section?  I am very conscious that the whole area of reportage of accidents and so on, the procedures for safety and the fact that there will now be a designated safety officer, probably the harbour master, has implications for other legislation.  I would certainly like to hear from the Minister where that leaves us and where we go from there.</P>
    <P>Section 52 states that the harbour master may at any time prohibit the bringing within the harbour etc. of any article of any kind if he or she thinks it would be likely to endanger persons or property.  That is very positive and very important, but I would like to know how this complies with and relates to the requirements of the Health and Safety <Col N="1034" /> Authority.  Much of their work is neglected in Departments, not deliberately; but people are not conscious and proactive about what the Health and Safety Authority are trying to achieve.  The whole question of who takes responsibility should become clear in legislation like this.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the reference to the nuclear material and the controls in that regard.  This is accepted by many different people no matter what their views are on harbours or politics.</P>
    <P>I will be going through those sections of the Bill again, discussing all those issues which I have raised today.  I have concentrated on those issues.  I am sure the Minister has heard all the positive things about the Bill a million times.  I would not like him to think that by raising questions and highlighting problems I find the Bill in any way less than superb in its approach.  It is very important legislation.  It will do the business and improve the current situation considerably.  I ask the Minister to accept the issues I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I feel very strongly about votes on Committee Stage to deal with those issues.  If one accepts they have been put forward in a positive and supportive way, the Minister might be prepared to take them on board.  It would be bad if the legislation began its life with a number of the harbour companies feeling disgruntled, that their interests had not been looked after or that they were not starting off on a level playing pitch.  It is incumbent on the Minister and us to bend over backwards to meet their needs as they perceive them.</P>
    <P>These new companies are now being required to run commercially competitive enterprises and to make ends meet. If they tell us they must have certain requirements to do this, it is incumbent on us, whether they be Foynes, New Ross or other harbour commissioners, to try and meet their needs as far as possible.  We should listen to these people because they are the experts.  I would rather listen to them and the Irish <Col N="1035" /> Ship Agents' Association before making up my mind on that other issue.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister and his staff who have worked long and hard hours to draft this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers, I broadly welcome the Bill.  I have a number of points to make.  They are not intended to be critical of the Bill but like any complex legislation, there are some areas where improvements can be made.</P>
      <P>I come from a county with a maritime coastline and two small commercial and a number of recreational harbours.  The impact this Bill will have on those harbours, especially that of Arklow and Wicklow, concerns me.  Those ports have been starved of resources in the past.  While they have made valiant efforts to make up for those deficiencies, as an island nation we have not given anything like the recognition we should to the importance of the harbour resource.</P>
      <P>Another area that concerns me, and it has largely been missing from this debate, is the potential recreational use of a number of harbours, such as Bray or Greystones, the latter will hopefully be the basis of a major tourist investment in the form of a marina in the near future.  The small commercial harbours worry me the most.  I can see certain difficulties there unless the fundamental problems are resolved before we move to the new model.  That said, I very much welcome the commercial emphasis of the Bill in the freeing up of harbours, giving them a commercial focus and making them into State enterprises which will compete with each other, produce the goods and deal in the real world rather than the cosseted world of a semi-local authority that existed for so long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two small but viable commercial harbours in County Wicklow. Arklow is an extremely important harbour in terms of employment &mdash; 500 jobs are directly linked to the harbour and there are at least the same number <Col N="1036" /> of jobs in the hinterland.  The life of that harbour is critically important to that town which has taken a tremendous battering over the years.  At first, the Arklow Harbour Commissioners were not entirely happy with the Bill but now they seem to have more than adjusted to the direction it is taking and they are anxious to rise to the challenges.</P>
    <P>In spite of all its successes, the fact that Arklow has recently become a port of registration &mdash; the biggest single fleet in Ireland is registered there &mdash; and that it has a small but thriving fishing enterprise and a number of shipping companies operating from the port, it faces many challenges.  It has had difficulties not because of any lack of enterprise in the past but because of the past structure of that authority.</P>
    <P>The Arklow Harbour Commissioners have always proven themselves to be a vibrant, lively and active local authority. Under the leadership of the then chairman, Councillor Tom Clandillon, it hammered out an extraordinarily adventurous agreement with the authorities in Brussels in which the authorities there agreed in principle to a development package for the port, provided the harbour commissioners could win support from the domestic Government. That green light never came from Dublin and the initiative shown by the Arklow Harbour Commissioners and Councillor Clandillon was never rewarded by any response from Dublin. The dead hand of central Government applied yet again.</P>
    <P>Arklow has a vibrant future.  It is incredibly well integrated into the local community and local enterprise. However, one of the issues that will arise as the transition from one type of authority to another comes about will be that of funding.  Over the years Arklow had to scrounge for pennies to keep the port open.  It has a siltation problem at its mouth.  Simply keeping the port open consumes a large amount of the surplus revenue the port earns every year and it is an unfair burden on the port.  If the development programme which the commissioners put together a <Col N="1037" /> number of years ago had been funded and implemented at this stage, it would have gone a long way towards addressing its siltation problems and have created additional capacity and onshore jobs.  Past Governments did not see Arklow harbour as a resource.</P>
    <P>Local councillors have made an important impact in the development of the port.  The late Councillor John Sweeney battled for years to convert Arklow into a port of registration.  I remember his joy in the last year of his life when he finally won that case because he felt he had done something positive for the port.  In ports like Arklow and Wicklow, and indeed Foynes and New Ross, local authority members have played an important role in giving leadership and in integrating the harbour authorities into the local communities, and that is an important linkage.</P>
    <P>The other harbour to which I wish to refer &mdash; I am unapologetically parochial &mdash; is Wicklow.  It is also well integrated into the local community, it does an extraordinary amount of business and has been historically and scandalously starved of funds.  An excess of £1.5 million capital investment has been made in that port by the existing harbour commissioners from their meagre resources over the last 14 years.  However, the total support they received from the Government to date would be slightly less than £250,000.</P>
    <P>It looked as if County Wicklow would get a bonanza in the recent by-election because there was a rumour that £400,000 in development funding would be called down in the near future to do important work in Wicklow port.  The Minister has been in the port and knows about some of the problems.  There is a need for piling and to shore up the harbour and onshore works.  The Wicklow Harbour Commissioners have invested £100,000 to buy the steel to do the piling to save the harbour so as to pass on their patrimony.  They are still waiting for the word from Brussels and Dublin but the promised resources have not been forthcoming.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1038" /> Arklow and Wicklow ports are not unique in that.  Other small ports are in the same position.  They have all had the traditional problem of funding.  This problem was not caused by this Minister or this Administration; it can be laid at the feet of all Administrations.  Since the State was founded, small harbours have not been seen as a resource.</P>
    <P>I was amazed to hear a Senator say that we suffer from an abundance of small harbours.  This is precisely what the nation needs; an abundance of small harbours capable of bringing goods and services in and out of their hinterlands is a positive move.</P>
    <P>Two harbour commissions have made a particularly important and impressive contribution in giving background briefing to Members of this House; Foynes and New Ross.  We have discussed both ports extensively but I will add my penny's worth.  I was incredibly impressed by the Foynes Harbour Trustees under the leadership of Councillor John Griffin.  They provided us all with an extraordinary example of how lobbying should operate.  It was timely, to the point and effective.  They have educated many of us in this House, and I am sure many of us in the other House, as to precisely the type of challenges that faced this harbour group or trustees.</P>
    <P>Foynes put forward a clearly argued case to establish a clear jurisdiction for the harbour trustees and their successors. The case was so cogently argued and so incredibly well backed up that I am pleased the Minister has given an indication that he will be moving in their direction on Committee Stage. What the Foynes Harbour Trustees sought was reasonable, and their case was put forward in a reasonable manner and with measured argument.  They have clarified the issue of jurisdiction within the Shannon Estuary for us all. They have been very helpful.  The ancient but colourful idea that one could throw a spear into the harbour and establish some form of jurisdiction <Col N="1039" /> may be historically attractive, but we all accept that it was not sufficient.</P>
    <P>The Foynes Harbour Trustees are looking for jurisdiction over five miles of coastline and over the contiguous waters, which is very reasonable, in comparison with 125 miles of coastline which will lie within the jurisdiction of the other harbour and its successor.  The Minister took a very appropriate step by appointing a mediator.  The mediation process has now been completed and the Minister has promised to introduce an amendment, to which I look forward, on Committee Stage giving legislative effect to the mediator's report.  I welcome the Minister's decision and his undertaking, because while the Foynes trustees have not been given quite everything they sought initially, they are now in sight of a reasonable and a rational solution to their set of problems.</P>
    <P>I realise that there is some disappointment in Limerick with the decisions and a case has been put forward, especially on the pilotage issue.  In fact, Limerick commissioners will also, in a sense, make a very significant gain from this legislation.  Their jurisdiction has now been established firmly on a statutory basis.  The ceremony of hurling a spear periodically into Shannon's waters may have been colourful, but is a little archaic when it comes to establishing jurisdictional issues.  Now Limerick Harbour Commissioners and their successor companies will have their jurisdiction clearly set out.  I believe that logic will prevail and that everybody will see that the case being made by Foynes is, in the long run, a good case.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day, what harm can be done by having two companies in the estuary effectively competing with each other and effectively providing standards of excellence, and of costs and effectiveness, that each of them must aspire to?  Competition in this way cannot <Col N="1040" /> be anything but healthy for both Limerick and for Foynes.</P>
    <P>The case put forward by New Ross Commissioners is convincing and just and has also been made on the basis of cogent arguments, which have been ably put to us over the past few weeks by the harbour commissioners led by Councillor Jim Curtis and Councillor Jim Walsh.  As we all know, New Ross is concerned about two specific matters. The solutions in its case are not as clear cut, or they are not as obviously in view, as the solution in the case of Foynes. The New Ross Commissioners are concerned about light dues, or harbour charges, and about pilotage.</P>
    <P>The issue of light dues can be very easily resolved.  Ships bound for the port of New Ross must currently pass through the port of Waterford, or part of Waterford Harbour.  At present these ships are charged light dues at the same rate as vessels going all the way to Waterford.  In effect, this means that the Waterford Harbour Commissioners collect the sum of £45,000 annually in light dues from ships bound for New Ross. The charge is not related to the cost of providing the lights, and is, in the view of the New Ross Harbour Commissioners, excessive.  It damages the competitiveness of New Ross.</P>
    <P>The harbour commissioners in Waterford take an alternative view, as is the nature of such discussions.  An amendment by the Minister on Report Stage in the other House regarding the continuation of this charging procedure appears to be flawed.  The New Ross Harbour Commissioners have put forward a proposed amendment to the Minister which has much to commend it.</P>
    <P>New Ross port accepts fully that where another port provides facilities and invests capital and current revenues in supporting those facilities, the facilities have to be paid for.  New Ross also accepts that the facilities must be paid for on a shared and equitable basis.  The <Col N="1041" /> issue of the equity of the argument is not in question as far as New Ross is concerned, but what it wants is that there should be equity in the solution to this matter.</P>
    <P>The New Ross commissioners have suggested that section 13 (8) be deleted and have asked that it be replaced by a specific formulation of words.  If I read this formulation into the record, perhaps the Minister may, in his summing up on this Stage or perhaps at the beginning of Committee Stage, have the opportunity to indicate whether he is going to accept their view.  They say:</P>
    <P>If by reason of the situation of any harbour it is necessary for a ship proceeding to such a harbour to enter or anchor within the harbour of another company, then where a ship enters or anchors within the harbour of such a company for the purposes and the purpose only of proceeding to the first mentioned harbour, the said company may not impose any harbour charges in respect of such entering or anchorage by that ship. Providing that where the said company provides services or facilities which are utilised by such ships it may recover a fair proportion of the capital and operational costs incurred in providing such services or facilities from the first port company.</P>
    <P>I accept that this is not as pithily, or indeed as verbosely worded as perhaps the parliamentary draftsman might manage, but they are basically arguing for a formula that will charge equitably and distribute the costs and the impositions between the two harbour authorities.</P>
    <P>As we are speaking of two harbour authorities, two State companies which will be within a short number of miles of one another and will be in competition with each other, it is clearly and obviously right that there should not be a situation where one company could <Col N="1042" /> impose charges which would in any way damage the competitiveness of the other company.  This would not be a level playing field, although we are perhaps mixing metaphors when speak of harbours and playing fields.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of attention paid in the Bill to pilotage, which is an important issue.  Currently, pilotage is compulsory, in a sort of a way, for inbound vessels in Waterford Estuary. However, as we know, not all inbound vessels take on pilots at Dunmore East. The extraordinary situation exists that in many cases ships proceed to Ballyhack, Passage East, before embarking a pilot, and this practice is especially prevalent when the weather is bad. Generally, the worse the weather, the less likely it is that the pilot will board the ship at Dunmore East and the more likely it is that the master will take the ship to Ballyhack, Passage East.  Oddly enough, on the outward passage from Ballyhack, Passage East, it is not compulsory for coastwise vessels to have pilots on board.  In effect, a minority of the overall movements through the estuary as far as Ballyhack, Passage East, currently have a pilot.</P>
    <P>The New Ross Harbour Commissioners have proposed that pilotage should be optional for vessels of less than 8,000 tonnes dwt from Dunmore East to Ballyhack, Passage East, and they suggest that the current practice indicates that compulsory pilotage in this area for ships of that size or of a smaller size is not necessary.  They can argue conclusively that there has not been any threat to safety or to life or any threat to the environment from the practice, which is now effectively the reality in the vast majority of ship movements, that there is no pilot as far as Ballyhack, Passage East.</P>
    <P>Their second recommendation is that New Ross pilots would board the ships at Ballyhack, Passage East, and proceed through the Barrow bridge to New Ross.  This recommendation, they argue, <Col N="1043" /> would give the New Ross pilots additional time in the ships and would be an extra safety measure.  At present when the New Ross pilot gets possession of the vessel and proceeds through the Barrow bridge towards New Ross the pilot is taking charge of the vessel at a relatively dangerous part of the journey and has little time to get a feel for the vessel.  Anybody who has attempted to take even a small vessel up a river knows, given the changes in tide and current, that it is quite an extraordinary task to take possession of a vessel with which one is not familiar and to take it into relatively difficult, narrow waters where there are challenging currents. Basically, the New Ross Harbour Commissioners are asking that their pilot should board the vessel at Ballyhack, Passage East, and take it as far as New Ross.  I cannot see any logical argument that can be put forward against that.</P>
    <P>The Minister previously recognised that pilotage on the Suir Estuary should be examined and he announced a review group comprising representatives of the Department and an independent expert.  I welcome that, but I hope the views that have been put forward and argued extremely well by the New Ross Commissioners and the solution they have suggested will be accepted.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's views on that.</P>
    <P>The issue of membership has been mentioned by a number of contributors. There has been reference to the role of local authority members on the harbour commissions at present and their potential role in the new structures.  Local authority members add considerably to the harbour commissions.  I have already mentioned Councillors Griffin, Curtis and Walsh and the extraordinary amount of time they have given to the case for Foynes and New Ross.  I have also mentioned my old friend the late John Sweeney of Arklow, and Tom <Col N="1044" /> Clandillon and the work they have done.  It would not strain any Senator's memory to think of dozens more.  Over the years hundreds of local authority members have given an extraordinary amount of time and service to harbour commissions all over the country.  There is a healthy relationship between local authorities and harbour authorities.  In the years ahead we should enhance the role of local authority members on harbour boards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Neville has agreed and he made the same point in his contribution.  Given the nature of a harbour and its relationship with its hinterland and the local community, it is important that a link is forged between the two through dual membership of local authorities and the harbour boards.  After all, the local councillors have one quality that no other member of the harbour board has &mdash; they have a democratic endorsement from the local people and if local people do not like what is happening in their harbour they can reflect that the next time they go to the polls.</P>
      <P>Local authority members have been a particularly important element in the composition of harbour commissions. They will play an equally important, in fact, a growing role in the new authorities. Indeed, as we head into a new commercial age of competition, it is particularly important that local communities will have their elected representatives on the boards, batting for them, ensuring that others do not let the concept of competition go to their heads and that they will have a modifying influence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am mystified as to why Members of the Oireachtas should be singled out, as they have been in Bills introduced by all administrations, for exclusion from service on bodies such as harbour boards. I wonder at that logic.  There could be <Col N="1045" /> potential problems, but if people are interested in and willing to go for public life it should not mean that there is a type of mark on their forehead whereby they are not eligible for consideration for appointment elsewhere.  A mass murderer who has served his or her time could be appointed to the board of one of the new bodies, but a Member of the Oireachtas could not be appointed. That is odd in a country that claims to value democracy.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister elaborate on the meaning of &ldquo;vested interests&rdquo;?  The whole point of having a board or State body is to have an informed oversight on a company.  In the State-sponsored sector there has been criticism that the boards do not contain enough expertise and experience.  Elsewhere I have argued that it is difficult to get the expertise and experience required to run, for example, a State airline; there are not many people around with such expertise and experience.  Broadly speaking, however, the critics are making the point that people with knowledge and experience in the field of commerce are required on the boards.</P>
    <P>However, if we narrowly interpret the concept of vested interests it would mean that people with the most relevant expertise and experience could effectively be barred in the future from boards in the new structures.  In the case of Arklow, for example, the managing director of an important and growing shipping company was until relatively recently an active member of the harbour commissioners and played an extraordinary role and put much expertise and effort into developing the harbour commissioners.  At present the owner and managing director of a shipping agency is on the board and this gentleman puts a vast amount of his time and effort into the port.  There is a confluence of interest between developing a port which is active and vibrant and developing his own business. In a sense it is a serendipitous <Col N="1046" /> arrangement whereby a person who has knowledge can provide the support and expertise that the board requires.  It is the old concept of the rising tide raising all boats.  In Wicklow there are further examples of people who have business experience or are involved in the shipping industry and shipping agencies and who are serving on the harbour board.</P>
    <P>It would be a bad mistake to create an environment in which people who have such experience, are up-front about their interests and make the necessary statutory declarations of interest were to be barred or in any way prevented from the possibility of serving on the boards.  It would be important not to lose this expertise because of a poorly thought out ideological principle.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on that when he responds to what has been a long and, I am sure, tiresome debate.</P>
    <P>With these caveats I give the Bill a broad welcome.  I am pleased to see this legislation being introduced, because virtually throughout the history of the State we have ignored our marine resource.  There is an extraordinary lack of relevant legislation and there has been no long or considered debate about the importance of the marine resource.  It was my privilege in 1984 to head the task group which drew up the policy document <i>Towards a Marine Policy,</i> which later led to the establishment of the Department of the Marine.  I was disappointed subsequently that the Department of the Marine got effectively sidetracked by issues such as the rod licence dispute.  It was almost strangled at birth.  I believe the Department of the Marine is in many ways the most important economic Ministry in the State.  It has to try to make up for 70 years of neglect of an extraordinary resource, the last native resource we have failed to fully exploit.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in his challenging task.  He has been appointed to a marvellous Department and this is <Col N="1047" /> good legislation.  That is not to say it is not capable of being improved &mdash; everything can be improved.  I look forward to the Minister's response.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators for the positive attitude they have shown to this important and timely Bill.  The debate has been lengthy but stimulating.  This is a period of historic change in Irish ports.  With the passing of this Bill the 1990s will see a radical restructuring of our leading ports combined with new technology on our docksides and new shipping services to our world markets.  This Bill is designed to allow our 12 major harbours to grow into fully commercial and market driven ports.  In the next five years £135 million of Irish and European funds will be invested in the development of our major ports.  This investment, combined with investment in new and modern shipping technology, means that over £250 million will be spent to improve access for Ireland's trade in tourism.  I believe Senators will join with me in welcoming this great progress in our port sector.</P>
      <P>Our commercial port traffic has grown by almost 60 per cent since 1980. As the only island nation left in the EU, we are more dependent on sea ports than any other member state.  We must minimise our transport cost barriers to be able to compete in the Single European Market.  We have set an ambitious target of reducing port and shipping costs in the Republic by 15 per cent in real terms by 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to respond to some of the points made during the opening debate. Senator Fitzgerald has been critical of the length of time taken to prepare the legislation.  I remind him that the establishment of the Commercial Harbours Review Group was announced by the then Minister, the former Deputy Wilson, in October 1990.  The review group <Col N="1048" /> presented its report and recommendations to the then Minister, Deputy Woods, in July 1992.  Following receipt of the report, a comprehensive round of consultations was held with the social partners, city and county managers and harbour authorities on the purpose and content of the legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill is complex and detailed, comprising 105 sections and six Schedules. Because of this, the consultation process took some time.  I compliment my constituency colleague, Deputy Andrews, and the late Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan for the preparatory work they undertook on this Bill.  The time devoted to the preparation of the legislation was time well spent because, in my view, the Bill is comprehensive and good.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald also questioned the need for Departments to establish review groups and suggested that Departments should make decisions on matters for which they are responsible without recourse to such reviews.  I consider it necessary and appropriate for any organisation to seek to bring different points of view to bear on important issues.  This is why we have undertaken an extensive process of public consultation in the major review of marine policy which is under way at present. There has been a positive response from interested individuals and organisations and I am sure that the process of developing a comprehensive policy framework for the marine sector will benefit substantially from the range of views expressed.</P>
    <P>The review of the fishery harbour centres is an overall review of the organisational and management structure of the fishing services.  This review, which is being carried out for the Department by Price Waterhouse management consultants, will look at the institutional framework for the development and regulation of the sea fisheries, aqua-culture and inland fishery sectors and will recommend any changes necessary to <Col N="1049" /> improve the coherence and efficiency of the delivery of public policies and services to these sectors.  The review is well under way and the intention is that it will be finalised as soon as possible.  The future administration of Dingle Harbour, which was raised by Senator Fitzgerald, will be furthered considered on receipt of the consultants' report and recommendations.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald also made the point that there is nothing in the Bill regarding the granting of licences by port companies for small boats to ferry passengers.  Under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1992, a requirement was imposed on all passenger boats to hold a current and valid passenger boat licence.  A passenger boat is any boat used to carry not more than 12 passengers for hire or reward in any capacity, including inland transport, transport on rivers and carrying people to and from work.  A passenger boat licence may only be granted by the Minister for the Marine after a vessel has been inspected by a departmental marine surveyor and is found to be suitable.  All passenger boats, if they are to be licensed, must comply with minimum standards of safety and seaworthiness.  A licence may be granted for a period not exceeding two years and is subject to such limitations or restrictions as may be imposed.  Section 53 of the Harbours Act, 1946, has been superseded by the Merchant Shipping Act, 1992, so far as the licensing of passenger boats is concerned.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald was also critical of the penalties provided for in the Harbours Act, 1946, and requested that these be brought into line with the penalties provided for in the Harbours Bill, 1995.  The legislative programme of the Minister for Justice includes a proposed indexation of fines Bill.  I will bring the points raised by the Senator to the attention of the Minister for Justice so that they may be considered in that context.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1050" /> I share Senator Fitzgerald's concerns about the restriction of access for vessels powered by or carrying nuclear cargoes and I will consider what is the most appropriate way to deal with this issue by way of legislation.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville made the point that there is no agency from which a person can get State aid to put a ship on the seas and thereby create employment. While no Exchequer funding has been made available since 1992, under the 1987 shipping investments grant, shipping continues to benefit through the application of the 10 per cent corporation profits tax to the sector.  The Department is anxious that Irish ship owners should be in a position to compete effectively with vessels sailing under other flags and that employment opportunities for our seafarers should be maintained and enhanced.  A review of shipping policy is taking place as part of the wider review of marine policy with a view to achieving these objectives.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville, Senator Dan Kiely and Senator Kelly raised the condition of the N69 road serving the port of Foynes.  I have been advised by the National Roads Authority that the operational programme for transport, which was agreed between the Government and the European Commission, provides the framework for investment in national roads over the period 1994-99. Under the programme a total investment of £115 million in 1994 prices is planned for the network of national secondary roads and it is in this context that improvement works on the N69 will be considered for funding.</P>
    <P>The N69, with a number of other secondary national routes, is identified in the operational programme as a national secondary road of particular importance to economic development. Grants totalling £2.791 million have been provided for the route over the period 1991-94 and an additional £630,000 has been allocated by the <Col N="1051" /> National Roads Authority in 1995.  The provision of further grants for the route will be considered when the allocations for 1996 and the following years are being determined.</P>
    <P>Senator Dan Kiely inquired what was intended by the establishment of a State commercial company to manage and operate Dún Laoghaire Harbour.  He also inquired if this was the foot in the door towards privatisation.  At present the harbour is managed and operated by the Department of the Marine.  The Bill provides for the setting up of a State commercial company to manage the 12 bigger ports, including Dún Laoghaire. Once the port company for Dún Laoghaire is established, responsibility for the management and operation of the port will be vested in the company and the Department's role in relation to the harbour will be similar to its role in relation to the other commercial sea ports in the State, which is supervising the activities of the new company.</P>
    <P>With regard to the possible privatisation of ports, the commercial harbours review group considered a number of alternative structures for ports in order to bring about greater commercialisation and thereby to maximise the greater contribution ports can make to Ireland's trade and tourism development. The group recommended in favour of separate commercial State companies. The option of privatising ports has been rejected.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators commented on the composition of the boards of the new port companies and were critical of the fact that statutory representation is not being granted to local business interests.  The existing harbour authority boards range in number from nine to 29 members and comprise representatives of local authorities, IBEC, chambers of commerce, trade union interests, the livestock trade and shipping and ministerial nominees.  The view taken by the review group was that structures of this <Col N="1052" /> nature, that is, large representative authorities comprising up to 29 members, were no longer attuned to the competitive requirements of a modern port and were not the most efficient way of managing ports.</P>
    <P>The group recommended that the boards of directors of the new port companies should have seven members, including employee representation, the chairman and chief executive.  It further recommended that the non-executive directors should be appointed by the Minister with a five year term of office and should be drawn from the commercial sector of the economy and that persons with a vested business interest in the affairs of a port should not be given board representation.</P>
    <P>Following publication of the review group's report there were numerous requests for a continuation of the existing representation.  Having considered the matter, the Government decided that the number of directors of each company should be not more than 12 and that three local authority directors should be appointed to each company. The Bill, as now presented, provides that the number of directors of each company will be not more than 12.  The directors, with the exception of the chief executive, the worker directors and local authority directors will be appointed by the Minister for the Marine with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  Each director, except the chief executive, will be appointed for five years and will be eligible for reappointment.</P>
    <P>There was a strong demand for the continued representation of local authorities on the new port company boards as such representation would maintain the close relationship between city and town and port.  It was argued that local ports play a key role in the economic life of the city or county associated with the port and that there must be close day to day interaction between the port and the local authority.  It was suggested <Col N="1053" /> that local authority representation on the port authority provided a long established and effective means of ensuring full co-operation between both bodies.  The Government agreed that co-operation was essential and considered that the inclusion of local authority representation was merited on these grounds.  Accordingly, the Minister will appoint three persons nominated in the prescribed manner by a prescribed local authority to be a director of the company.</P>
    <P>Regulations prescribing the manner in which such persons are to be nominated will be made by the Minister for the Marine in consultation with the Minister for the Environment.  The regulations will also prescribe the nominating local authorities.  No decisions in this regard have been taken to date, but it could be decided that Galway Corporation could nominate two directors to Galway Port Company and that Galway County Council should nominate one director.  Regulations made by the Minister in this regard must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, either House having power to annul them within the next 21 sitting days.</P>
    <P>The review group was strongly of the view that persons with a vested business interest in the affairs of a port should not be granted board representation. Some ports are clearly dominated by user interests and one view is that the continuation of such representation could have an inhibiting effect on the commercial effectiveness of the new port companies.  Traditionally, user, that is, shipping, interests have enjoyed representation on the boards of harbour authorities.  However, in the course of drafting the legislation it was decided not to grant representation as of right to user interests on the new port companies. It should be pointed out, however, that the legislation as drafted does not statutorily exclude such interests from being considered for appointment as directors.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1054" /> The ministerial directors will in general be drawn from the professional and business community.  In appointing such directors I will be anxious to select persons with the appropriate business acumen. With this in mind I intend to invite recognised bodies such as IBEC, chambers of commerce, etc., to recommend persons for consideration for appointment as directors.  Alternatively, should such bodies or any interested party wish to submit names for consideration for appointment as directors, I will be happy to bear such nominations in mind for consideration at the appropriate time.  The Irish Ship Agents' Association, some chambers of commerce and some individuals have already submitted names of persons for consideration for appointment as directors to the companies and I confirm that these will be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators commented on the fact that Deputies, Senators and MEPs are disqualified under the Bill from being appointed to the board of the new port companies.  In this regard it is a long standing convention that Members of the Oireachtas and Members of the European Parliament should not be eligible to be directors of semi-State companies.  The rationale behind this prohibition probably was the risk of a conflict of interest between a person's functions as a legislator and his or her functions as a member of a board of a State company.  For example, it might not be easy for a public representative to be objective about draft legislation dealing with a semi-State body of which he or she was a director.</P>
    <P>I will now mention the request by a number of Senators that the legislation be amended to give the harbour masters a statutory right to attend board meetings and to take part in discussions without voting rights.  I did not accept amendments of this nature on Committee Stage and Report Stage in the Dáil and I will now outline the reasons I did not do so.  Under the Harbours Act, <Col N="1055" /> 1946, harbour masters do not have a statutory right to attend harbour authority board meetings.  However, the practice is that they attend such meetings and I see no reason that practice should be discontinued.  I recognise the important role of the harbour master in relation to safety matters within his area of jurisdiction and the technical knowledge and expertise he has in relation to all aspects of port operations.</P>
    <P>Senator Cregan referred to the amendments on Report Stage in the Dáil to section 41 which deals with the pension liabilities of harbours.  He was critical of the fact that the Department has been in correspondence with harbour authorities on this matter in advance of the Seanad consideration of the Bill.  Following approval of these amendments by the Dáil numerous requests were received in the Department for clarification as to what the amendments meant.  With a view to clarifying the matter, letters fully explaining the purpose of the amendments were sent to the 12 ports concerned on 10 November 1995.  The letters <i>inter alia</i> stated: &ldquo;The Harbours Bill, 1995, completed its passage through Dáil Éireann on 8 November 1995 and now goes to the Seanad for consideration.&rdquo;  The letter stressed that the purpose of the amendments was only to provide a back stop guarantee against the eventuality that certain harbours may be unable, through trading performance or closure, to meet pensions liability and that primary responsibility for ensuring that pension funds were adequate would continue to rest with the ports.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly mentioned that the fastest growing recreation today is marine leisure activity.  I am happy to advise the Senator that as a result of Opposition requests the Bill was amended on Report Stage in the Dáil to enable port companies to promote leisure activities in their harbours should they so desire.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1056" /> Senator Lydon inquired as to whether the new port companies would have any responsibility in relation to the development of the fishing industry.  The Harbours Bill applies to commercial sea ports.  The primary function of the new port companies will be to provide facilities and accommodation for goods and passenger ships and their cargoes, in other words, to ensure that our tourists and cargo can get to and from their destinations with the least possible delay. The Bill will also create the freedom for ports to diversify if they so desire, but this must be done within commercial parameters.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators referred to the concerns of the Irish Ship Agents' Association in relation to the bonding arrangements as provided for in section 13 (7).  I have referred this matter to the Attorney General for advice and I hope it will be available before Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Almost every Senator referred to the local issues at Foynes, Limerick, New Ross and Waterford.  As the debate continued, I thought it was a great pity that President Clinton did not visit Ballybunion to play golf and call at Limerick and Foynes on his journey there.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened carefully to the contributions made by Members on all sides of the House about the definition of the harbour limits for the Foynes and Shannon Estuary.  I have also received views from Foynes Harbour Trustees and Limerick Harbour Commissioners concerning these matters.  The views expressed by the Members and the issues raised by the two harbour commissioners will be fully considered before an amendment is introduced on <Col N="1057" /> Committee Stage to extend the limits of Foynes Harbour.</P>
    <P>As regards the light dues issue which relates to Waterford Harbour Commissioners and New Ross, this matter is under consideration in the Department at present in consultation with New Ross and Waterford.  I hope to be in a position to deal with that in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The review of pilotage operations in the Waterford Estuary is expected to get under way within the next two weeks and I hope that the review group's report and recommendations will be available in approximately three months.  I believe it will be possible to implement the group's recommendations within the framework of the Bill as presented.</P>
    <P>Senator Ormonde and Senator Sherlock raised the question of pilotage and pilotage exemption certificates.  Under the Bill the port companies will be required to organise pilotage in either of two ways &mdash; by employing pilots directly or by licensing self-employed persons to undertake pilotage operations. The companies will be empowered to make by-laws for the operation and organisation of pilotage services, qualifications for pilots, the grant of pilotage exemption certificates and other matters related to pilotage.  Once the new legislation is in place pilotage exemption certificates will be more readily available.  The persons in charge of ships which call on a regular basis to a port will be able to apply for such certificates if they so desire and if they satisfy the conditions laid down in section 72.</P>
    <P>The Bill requires each company to have regard to the hazards which may be involved in the carriage of dangerous goods or harmful substances on board any ship or ships in relation to which an application for the granting of a pilotage exemption certificate is made.  I expect the companies to act responsibly in this matter and to bear in mind that safety <Col N="1058" /> is and will continue to be of paramount importance.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn and Senator D'Arcy mentioned the extent to which ports in Northern Ireland, such as Larne, are being used for the export of goods from the Twenty-six Counties at the expense of other ports which are nearer to the eventual destination of such goods. Efforts to change this situation are being made and will continue.  The ports of the central and southern corridors have won back over 10 per cent of the entire Irish Sea freight traffic in the past decade.</P>
    <P>Senator Calnan mentioned the future administration of the small non-commercial ports.  There are three options for consideration in so far as these ports are concerned.  The options are: to retain the <i>status quo</i>, that is to allow the ports to continue to operate under the Harbours Act, 1946; to transfer them to local authorities; or to establish State companies to manage them.  Each case will be considered on its merits once the new legislation is in place.  There will, of course, be full consultation with all interests concerned and submissions in this regard will be carefully and sympathetically considered.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole expressed a wish to have an environmental protection objective included in the objects of harbour companies.  He indicated that he may present an amendment to that effect on Committee Stage.  I will certainly consider that at that stage.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney inquired if the statutory powers of the harbour master overrode those of the Customs and Naval services in relation to the boarding of vessels.  The answer to that is that they do not.  He also inquired about the subject matter of legislation which is entitled 55 George III.  I am happy to tell him that that legislation was enacted in the 55th year of the reign of George III and dealt with the establishment of a harbour at Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    <P>On that subject, Senator Cosgrave expressed concern about the pension <Col N="1059" /> position for existing Department of the Marine employees in Dún Laoghaire. Section 40(1)(5) of the Bill provides that in respect of pre-vesting day pensioners, pension contributions of staff transferred from the Department of the Marine to the Dún Laoghaire Port Company will be paid by the Minister for Finance to the trustees of the pension scheme for the Dún Laoghaire port staff.  Payments of this nature must be made not later than five years after the relevant vesting day.</P>
    <P>As Members will see, many of the stringent ministerial controls which were contained in the Harbours Act, 1946, are being relaxed or done away with.  The aim of the new legislation is to strike a balance between two key priorities.  First, to give ports the maximum commercial freedom and responsibility to manage their day to day affairs.  Second, the ports are and will continue to be in public ownership and because of this there has to be full accountability.  Such accountability is provided for in the new legislation.  For example, in section 28 which deals with annual reports and the chairperson's reports to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Much concern has been expressed about section 44 of the Bill, which empowers the Minister to issue directions to port companies requiring them to comply with policy decisions of a general kind made by the Minister in relation to ports.  It is feared that these ministerial powers will restrict the new port companies from acting in a commercial manner and that the new companies will be in a less favourable position than the present harbour commissioners in relation to ministerial control.  In this regard I wish to state that the desirability of preserving the maximum extent of autonomy of the new bodies in day to day operational matters is recognised in the section. Ministerial power to issue directions is <Col N="1060" /> confined to policy directions of a general kind.</P>
    <P>This Bill is designed to ensure that the ports will be able to operate as truly commercial and self-sufficient enterprises free from undue control by the State.  The reorganisation of the commercial seaports will greatly improve their efficiency and effectiveness to the benefit of exporters, the agricultural and industrial sectors of the economy, and our tourist trade.  The main thrust of the new legislation is to relax ministerial control while increasing accountability for operational and financial performance.</P>
    <P>The Harbours Bill, 1995, is quite long and many parts are quite technical and complex.  We had a very constructive debate in the Dáil in the course of which I was happy to accept a number of Opposition amendments.  I have adopted a very flexible approach in relation to this Bill and amendments which were considered justified and which made the Bill more effective were accepted in the Dáil.  I am open to further constructive proposals from Senators and any proposed amendments will be considered with the same flexibility.  In other words, they will be assessed on the basis of whether they would make the Bill more effective.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their constructive response to the Bill.  I will have an opportunity to consider some of the specific points which have been made between now and the debate on Committee Stage.  I would again like to emphasise that proposals and amendments that would make the Bill more effective will be taken on board, and any amendments which are considered justified will be brought forward on Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy O'Shea, here to reply to this Adjournment matter.  It calls on the Minister for Education to make a full statement in relation to the proposed physical education hall for St. MacDara's community college in Templeogue, Dublin 6W, given that the children attending this school have been deprived of proper physical education facilities and given that the promised funding for the design and planning phase of this proposed physical education hall, announced on 6 April 1995 has not, as yet, been forthcoming.</P>
      <P>I do not have to go on for very long about this matter because I know that the Minister's Department is well aware of it and that it has received cross-party support.  TDs, Senators and local representatives have been unanimous in their support for the parents and the school. St. MacDara's community college has been established since 1982 and is a school catering for approximately 930 students with a 40:60 ratio of girls to boys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no physical education facilities whatsoever in this school, which has been campaigning for many years for proper facilities.  The lack of physical education facilities is detrimental to the pupils and prejudices them should they wish to attend the University of Limerick or other third level PE courses.  It involves a considerable <Col N="1062" /> expense for the school because pupils have to travel to other locations for their physical education.  That involves hiring buses and paying for insurance cover.</P>
    <P>I am not sure how familiar the Minister may be with that area, but the Willington-Templeogue district is very large and is home to many young families. There are one or two local sports clubs. The community is actively involved in raising funds for the local GAA club and the school parents themselves have promised to raise the money for equipment in the proposed physical education hall.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, wrote a letter to the Minister of State to the Government, Deputy Rabbitte, on 6 April 1995.  In that letter she said: &ldquo;I am pleased to inform you that the building projects for the schools listed over the page will be included in a phased programme for 1995.  That programme will be progressed as quickly as possible.  A decision on the timing of the tender-contract process will be made in due course in the light of resources and competing priorities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The parents are not looking for funding for the hall immediately.  The Minister has agreed to funding for the initial planning and design phase.  The Minister gave this commitment in April and she appeared to say that the money would be available this year so the planning and design phase could progress. On behalf of the parents and public representatives in the area, I ask the Minister to make these funds available as a matter of urgency.  It is not good enough that a generation of young children should grow up without physical education facilities.  They want this money by the end of the year so this matter can progress.  Perhaps the Minister will give us some good news tonight.</P>

      <P>I am grateful <Col N="1063" /> to Senator Mulcahy for this opportunity to clarify the position concerning the proposed new physical education hall for St. MacDara's community college. Initially, I would like to give some details regarding the background to this case.</P>
      <P>St. MacDara's community college opened in September 1982 to cater for a long-term enrolment of 1,000 pupils. At that time, due to the exceptionally heavy demands on available capital resources, priority had to be given to the provision of essential teaching spaces and, as a result, it was not possible to allocate funds towards the provision of a sports hall.  In those circumstances it was also not possible to indicate when the hall would be constructed.</P>
      <P>However, following discussions with local representatives and in view of the fact that the children attending this school have not had access to physical education facilities for some time, provision was made in the 1995 capital programme to initiate the architectural planning for a PE hall at St. MacDara's community college.  The first priority of the Department of Education must continue to be to provide essential classroom accommodation in the many schools throughout the country where there is a need.  Nevertheless, I assure the Senator that the Minister for Education is fully aware of the pressing need for this new facility and the Department will make every effort to ensure that the planning for this project is initiated as soon as possible.  In this connection, the Department will shortly be in contact with the County Dublin Vocational Education Committee regarding the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time-scale for the construction of the project will depend very much on the availability of capital resources for 1996 and subsequent years.  Until the capital allocation for post-primary building purposes for 1996 has been <Col N="1064" /> made, I am not in a position to say when building will start.</P>

      <P>I am delighted the Minister is here tonight because he has an interest in the area I am addressing, that is, the report on the review of services to people with physical and sensory disabilities. There has been an extraordinary delay producing this report.  The review committee was established in 1992, when Dr. John O'Connell was Minister for Health.  Although it met on many occasions then, until last week it had not met since April last year.  The purpose of the review was to devise a blueprint for the future funding and development of services for this sector.</P>
      <P>Tragically, this sector is growing because of our success in the health field.  There are now more people with physical and sensory disabilities because our population is living longer and children born prematurely with physical or sensory disabilities are surviving.  This sector is expanding because of our success in medicine.  The thrust of this document was to be similar to that on the needs and abilities of those with mental handicap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Successive Ministers for Health promised to publish this report, but this has not happened.  A few weeks ago, at a disability federation conference, an official from the Minister's Department said it would be published before the end of the year, but that is unlikely. There is considerable frustration among the organisations helping those who are physically handicapped or who have a <Col N="1065" /> sensory problem.  They are beginning to believe that the Department of Health is dragging its feet on this.  I would like a commitment that the report will be published shortly.</P>
    <P>This commitment is important not only for those with physical handicaps but for those who look after them.  Carers do not receive enough consideration and they have demands which must be met.  We have little respite care for these people, whether they are old people or children with disabilities.  We are also short of technical aids &mdash; some health board areas are worse than others.</P>
    <P>The report is urgently needed to outline our philosophy towards those involved.  It would show that we are placing an emphasis on trying to prevent handicap.  While the need for folic acid to prevent the development of neural tube defects has been well recognised &mdash; I will not go into the tremendous research which has been done in this country &mdash; advertising is coming from commercial companies trying to get people to take folic acid.  Tragically, it is not being used by groups most at risk of having children with neural tube defects.  This area of research and prevention is not being looked at.  We also know that early intervention is important in preventing disabilities from becoming worse.</P>
    <P>Other Departments &mdash; for example, the Department of Education &mdash; await this report.  A strong effort has been made to link people with physical and sensory disabilities, including those who are blind and deaf, into the general education system.  This report is important to other areas.  The school medical services will need to become involved. Other areas will not be addressed until we get this report.</P>
    <P>The need to ensure co-ordination between children with physical handicaps and sensory difficulties and the general education system was first made in 1981.  Yet 15 years later, the report has still not been published.  This is disappointing <Col N="1066" /> not only for those who hope to benefit from the report but for the people who look after them.  Voluntary organisations await this report which will involve co-operation between the voluntary and State sectors in dealing with these problems, which are serious in some cases or which can be simply addressed in others.  What has caused the delay and why has this report not been published?</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Henry for giving me the opportunity to address this issue.  The review group on services for people with physical and sensory disabilities is expected to complete its work and finalise its report within the next few weeks.  My Department hopes to be in a position to publish it shortly thereafter.  Regrettably, the finalisation of the report has been delayed due to various problems, including collection of information and pressures of other work in the Department. I am satisfied the problems which have frustrated the completion of the report have been dealt with and that every effort is being made to finalise it as soon as possible.  This will include a consultation process with relevant organisations early in the new year.</P>
      <P>One of the problems encountered by the review group is the absence of information on the number of people with physical or sensory disabilities in this country.  The group has given consideration to the establishment of a nationwide database of people with physical and sensory disabilities.  This database would provide information on the number of people with disabilities and their service needs which has been lacking to date.  Reliable information is essential in order to plan effectively for the provision of services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As indicated in the health strategy, it is intended to proceed to implement the review group's recommendations in the coming four years.  The Senator may <Col N="1067" /> wish to note that additional funding of £2 million revenue and £3 million capital, including £500,000 for aids and appliances, was provided this year for the development of services for people with physical disabilities.  The provision of this additional funding, added to extra revenue funding of £1.5 million provided in 1993 and again in 1994, demonstrates the Government's commitment to the development of services for this client group.</P>
    <P>The development of services for this group will benefit greatly from the publication of this report.  For the first time, the specific health needs of people with physical and sensory disabilities are being examined in detail with a view to making recommendations for improving the planning and delivery of services to meet those needs.</P>
    <P>The report's recommendations will ensure that health services are provided in a more user friendly and effective <Col N="1068" /> way in line with the principles of the health strategy, &ldquo;Shaping a Healthier Future&rdquo;.  The recommendations of the report are based on the premise that people with disabilities should be enabled to live as independently as possible.  Areas being examined in the report include community support services, such as home help, therapy services, such as occupational therapy, residential and respite services.</P>

      <P>I am extraordinarily depressed that after three years the establishment of a database is only now being considered.  Without a database, I cannot see how the review can be effective because there is no notion of what the costs will involve or how it can be implemented.  I thank the Minister for his reply and I realise it is not his fault but it is extraordinarily depressing.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 10.5 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 7 December 1995.</P>
