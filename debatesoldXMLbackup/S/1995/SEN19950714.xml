      <P>I have notice from Senator Daly that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The impact of the proposed changes in the 1994 Health Act Regulations on St. John of God's and St. Patrick's hospitals in Dublin and other similar institutions.</P>
      <P>I regret I have to rule the matter out of order as it is repetitious of the matter debated on the Adjournment last Tuesday.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is item 1 without debate, item 2, all Stages, item 3 and item 4.  Item 2 will probably be finished by 12 noon or 12.30 p.m.; the debate will not be curtailed but when it is finished we will take item 3, Statements on Nuclear Testing.  If that concludes before 2 p.m. there will a sos until 2 p.m. and at 2 p.m. we will take the Ethics in Public Office Bill, 1994, Committee and Final Stages.</P>
      <P>In giving Senator Wright details of next week's business yesterday I did not mention that I would also like to take item 10 on today's Order Paper.  I will order that for next Wednesday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked yesterday about the business for next week on the basis of my own experience and knowing how Ministers operate in the last few days of the session.  I presume that is why the Leader is adding to the list of legislation to be taken.  How much time does he intend to allow each spokesperson on item 3?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the statement made in the House of Commons yesterday in relation to the release of prisoners, I ask the Leader to ensure that the views of my colleagues on this side of the House, as expressed by the leader of Fianna Fáil in the newspapers this morning, will <Col N="1083" /> be communicated to the Government so that it is aware of our disappointment at the lack of progress in relation to the peace process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Although we will have the opportunity today to condemn French nuclear testing in the South Pacific, our minds must be drawn to the horrific photographs in this morning's newspapers of what is happening in Bosnia. While we are condemning France let us also take note that President Chirac's call for military intervention in Bosnia received no response from any of his allies.  There must be some way this House can tell the people of the world that we are not going to sit by and not even notice what is happening in Bosnia. I am not sure what I should ask the Leader of the House to do.  Is it possible to find time today for the House to condemn what is happening in Bosnia and, at the same time, to encourage the French call for military intervention? The French people have supported their President's call and are risking the lives of young French soldiers.</P>

      <P>A question for the Leader of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader find time for a debate today to ensure that Ireland will not be seen to be standing idly by?  Only 150 years ago the world stood idly by and watched us go through the Famine.  Those of us who have read our history could not understand why. The people of Bosnia need support.  If we are not offering military support, let us at least give them vocal support.  I ask the Leader to find time today for us to express that opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Quinn's remarks.  Anybody who saw the pictures in the newspapers today will see echoes of the appalling things that happened during the Second World War.  Will the Leader of the House ensure that the Government does everything in its power, both at UN and <Col N="1084" /> European Union levels, to bring whatever pressure it can to bear on this matter? We are not dealing just with the appalling situation in Bosnia but with the future of the UN itself.  There is what is known as a rapid reaction force in Bosnia but it appears to be a slow reaction force.  The Government must do everything in its power.  I ask the Leader to bring this to the Government's attention and, if necessary, to have a debate on it in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree with Senator Quinn or Senator Dardis with regard to the situation in Bosnia.  There is no doubt that the House should, if possible, register its deep anger at the situation and at the apparent powerlessness of the rest of the world.  So much for the new world order.  While I agree with Senator Quinn about the French call for positive military action, I deplore France's intention to test nuclear weapons, not on themselves but on others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to offer the Government this House's congratulations for ensuring that none of its Members will be present at the French Embassy on Bastille Day.</P>
      <P>I conclude by offering the Cathaoirleach my sincere congratulations on his election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator Quinn and other Senators in calling for immediate and effective action against the outrageous scandal of the treatment of the Bosnian people and the total failure and incapacity of the international community, particularly our partners in <Col N="1085" /> the European Union, to take effective action.  One hundred years ago this would have been regarded as a scandal of the greatest dimensions; in this day and age it is totally unacceptable.  I hope the Government will make the strongest and most public protests on this issue.</P>
      <P>I wish to turn to a matter nearer home.  Will the Leader of the House bring to the attention of the Minister for Justice a major case of suffering in my home town of Nenagh?  A young couple was yesterday committed to prison for one month for contempt of court because of an alleged failure to pay funds due to a credit institution.  I do not question the judgment.  However, I am speaking on behalf of my county in expressing our utter rejection of the circumstances that can give rise to this. They have asked that the Minister for Justice conduct a public inquiry into the case.  I ask the Leader to bring this matter to the attention of the Minister for Justice with a view to seeing what action can be taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no monopoly on sympathy and understanding for the Bosnian cause.  Senator Quinn's comments were motivated purely by humanitarian concern.  If we do nothing else in this House it is important that our outrage about Bosnia should be voiced and that the Leader of the House communicate our sentiments to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>As a student of the Second World War I often wondered how our forebears could stand by while the Jews were being killed in the camps.  I can understand it now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Please allow me to continue briefly.  If there were minerals or oil in Bosnia-Herzgovina would the rest of the world stand idly by?  They went to Kuwait without any problem.  It is past time something was done about Bosnia.  I hope the attitude adopted by Chamberlain before the Second World War when he said that the troubles of Czechoslovakia were the troubles of a far-off land about which we know little, will not be adopted.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I support many of the comments of other Senators.  I understand the Cathaoirleach's ruling on the matter raised by Senator Daly although I am disappointed by it.  Last week the Leader of the House, following my request, said he would try to get the Minister for Health to the House next Wednesday.  The Minister is probably <Col N="1087" /> abroad but perhaps a Minister of State could attend.  Will these regulations be laid before the House?  This is a serious question because if the regulations go through without debate, they will affect St. John of God's and St. Patrick's hospitals and both hospitals will be forced to impose the charges currently operating in Great Britain which are two to four times current charges.  Both hospitals are non-profit organisations. Psychiatric patients will be discriminated against as they are the only patients who will be affected by this.  I beg the Leader of the House for his assistance.  This is not a political issue. We are prompted by our concern for two excellent institutions that have served the State well and by our concern for psychiatrically ill patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Lydon. This is not a party political issue. Senator Manning has, on previous occasions, indicated his concern about how regulations, non-statutory law, are handled by both Houses.  This issue is about an important principle and some way should be found to deal with it.</P>
      <P>I also support Senator Quinn's comments. It is correct and politically profitable at this stage to criticise France for its extraordinary arrogance in the Pacific.  However, it is equally correct to suggest that President Chirac has shown leadership.  Other world leaders and other parliaments should pay attention. What is happening in Bosnia is unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to raise a third matter.  Would it be possible to hold a brief discussion, before the recess, on the evident evolution of the role of State-sponsored bodies as there is clear evidence of political pogroms in a number of them.  Perhaps this is the order of the day in the new political climate.  However, there is disturbing evidence of a new relationship between the boards and chairmen and I am not just talking about CIE in this regard.  I have some experience of this matter over the years and there is disturbing evidence that a number of <Col N="1088" /> the chairpersons of State bodies are taking excessive powers to themselves.  If the boards of State-sponsored bodies are to become&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Senator have a question to the Leader?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader make time available to discuss the change in recent years in the relationship between the boards and chairmen of State bodies? This would ensure that we have a better understanding of the roles played.  It would be a bad day for everybody if the boards become one man bands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>On Wednesday's Order of Business we raised the possibility of the Minister for Health coming to the House next Wednesday for a short debate on the new health regulations.  Is that possible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to clarify the time available for contributions today. On item 2, each speaker will be allowed 15 minutes.  I suggest 30 minutes for the statements on French nuclear testing; perhaps short contributions of three to five minutes would be acceptable.</P>
      <P>I note Senator Wright's observations on the peace process.  The contribution of Deputy Ahern last night was most helpful and I will convey the Senator's remarks to the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinn and others raised Bosnia. We have all been shocked and horrified by the outrageous happenings there recently and we are concerned about what should happen.  I wish to make some time available today in response to the request for a debate on this matter.  If we spend 30 minutes on French nuclear testing, I could make 15 or 20 minutes available by ordering item 15 on the Order Paper, which is statements on Foreign Affairs.  This would allow Members to place their concerns on the record.  If the House agrees, we will also take item 15 today for 15 minutes after item 3.  Under Standing Orders, do I need to amend the Order <Col N="1089" /> of Business announced earlier or is it agreed if the House agrees?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome that item 3 will be taken but we would like more time, perhaps an hour.  Members wish to address this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>That is fine.  We will take an hour and then ten minutes on Bosnia.</P>
      <P>I will bring the matter raised by Senator O'Kennedy to the attention of the Minister for Justice.  I do not know what she can do about the incident but I will bring his observations to her attention.</P>
      <P>Senator Fitzgerald's point has struck a chord close to all Members' hearts.  It is time for a review of facilities and accommodation.  Perhaps the Committee on Procedure and Privileges could put this matter at the top of its agenda for its meeting the week after next.</P>
      <P>I have great sympathy with the point raised by Senator Daly, Senator Lydon and Senator Honan in relation to the new health regulations and there is concern on all sides of the House regarding their implications.  I will see if it is possible to hold a debate next Wednesday. The Minister for Health will not be available then but I will see if even a short discussion on this matter can be held.  I will take advice about what is possible as I understand the concern of Members.</P>
      <P>Senator Roche raised the question of a debate on State-sponsored bodies. However, that will not take place before the recess.  I appreciate the points raised but there is not enough time.</P>

    <Title>Netting of Financial Contracts Bill, 1995: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. G. Mitchell) Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. G. Mitchell)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. G. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Netting of Financial Contracts Bill seeks to provide for greater stability in an area of financial trading which is comparatively new.  This legislation is needed urgently so that a forthcoming EU directive can be implemented which will, in effect, allow banks in member states to compete more effectively with their counterparts in non-EU countries. The fact that such a Bill is being introduced serves to reinforce the ongoing commitment of the Government to make the financial services sector grow as a means of producing high quality employment and wealth for this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is short, containing only five sections, and seeks simply to ensure that agreements between two parties to set off their mutual liabilities to arrive at a <Col N="1091" /> single net amount owing by one party to another are enforceable.  The ability of both parties to reduce their mutual exposure to risk to the net amount owing between them at any time is clearly of benefit to both parties.  The calculation of this net amount is called set off or netting.</P>
    <P>I stress that it is only the netting of liabilities in respect of &ldquo;financial contracts&rdquo; that is provided for in the Bill. These are interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity based contracts, more commonly called derivative contracts.  The liabilities of the same two parties in respect of other trading activities between them will not benefit from the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Stability, through prudent risk management, is a substantial concern of financial services companies, particularly banks, in view of the large sums involved in their business and the volume of business they may transact with individual major clients.  In the case of banks and other credit institutions, there are special requirements that they hold reserves in proportion to their risk exposure.</P>
    <P>These requirements are embodied in the EU Solvency Ratio and Capital Adequacy Directives and their implementation is supervised by the Central Bank.  The European Commission, however, is currently finalising an amending directive to the Solvency Ratio Directive which will allow supervisors, such as the Central Bank, to recognise the risk reducing effects of the type of set off or netting I described.</P>
    <P>Netting agreements are already recognised in many countries, particularly non EU countries, and banks based in those countries benefit from increased stability since enforceable netting agreements reduces their exposure.  Just as importantly, because they are permitted to carry lower reserves than their EU counterparts, they benefit from lower operating costs. The draft directive, which I expect to be finalised within the next two months, represents the Commission's response <Col N="1092" /> to concerns that credit institutions in member states are not disadvantaged <i>vis-a-vis</i> their non EU counterparts.</P>
    <P>However, Irish law does not refer specifically to netting and so there are doubts about the enforceability of netting in cases of insolvency.  The company law area contains, as far as the provisions relating to examinership are concerned, specific barriers to the operation of netting or set off.  This Bill seeks to address the issue of doubt and specific barriers only to the extent that they interfere with the operation of netting agreements and even then, as I mentioned already, only to netting agreements that cover derivative contracts. The more general issues in relation to examinership legislation and the interpretation of that legislation by the courts are the subject of recommendations by the company law review group and are being considered in the first instance by my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Rabbitte.  These issues have broader implications for business in general and will be dealt with by company law amendment, if appropriate.</P>
    <P>The Government, however, is satisfied that the narrow case in relation to netting agreements should be dealt with separately because of the capital adequacy benefits on offer to banks and similar institutions, building societies and investment firms authorised under the investment services directive, for example, fund management companies, collective investment companies, unit trusts, etc., and recognised third country investment firms, when the forthcoming EU directive is finalised because of the need to maintain the most favourable environment for financial service, consistent, of course, with the highest regulatory and prudential requirements.  In fact, the forthcoming directive will require those institutions seeking its benefits to furnish the Central Bank with written and reasoned opinion confirming that the netting agreements are legally enforceable.  Many banks <Col N="1093" /> operating in the domestic market and from the International Financial Services Centre have made clear the importance they attach to the new directive. I understand that it was the undertaking to move ahead more quickly than many of our competitors in this regard that has secured one major international project for the IFSC already and that a number of major players in the North American market have signalled their interest in Dublin as a result of the enhanced overall package &mdash; combining advanced communications, quality labour, high specification accommodation and an accessible and responsible regulatory and fiscal environment &mdash; now on offer in the IFSC.  I mentioned that the Bill is short and that its purpose is simple. However, some of its provisions are complex and highly technical, reflecting the nature of the transactions and the agreements which cover them.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the major elements of the Bill.  Section 1 is the interpretation section.  It contains standard definitions of the Central Bank of Ireland, the Minister for Finance and Companies Acts.  &ldquo;Party&rdquo; to a netting agreement is defined as a person &mdash; relying on the meaning of person in the Interpretation Act, 1937, so that an individual, partner, company of any kind, etc. may be one of the two parties to a netting or master netting agreement.  The term &ldquo;money&rdquo; is also defined, to include foreign currency.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;financial contracts&rdquo; is defined to include those contracts, basically derivative contracts, which are contained in Annex III of the EU solvency ratio directive.  Annex III is currently being revised and the definition anticipates the outcome of that revision, especially as regards the inclusion of commodity based contracts.  It is the contracts in Annex III that the forthcoming directive on netting will recognise. Other contracts which are regularly used in the market but which are not recognisable by the Central Bank for capital adequacy purposes are included in the definition, in particular foreign exchange contracts of less than <Col N="1094" /> 14 days' duration and contracts traded on exchanges.  Finally, provision is made within the definition of &ldquo;financial contract&rdquo; for the Central Bank to formally add to the definition any contract contained in Annex III or any contract contained in any revised annex or equivalent and for the Minister of Finance to include contracts within the definition, thereby allowing for the inclusion of new contracts which are rapidly evolving.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;netting&rdquo; is defined to include the termination of individual financial derivative contracts, the calculation of the amount owing on each contract to either party and the addition of all amounts due and owing to each party to arrive at a single amount due by one party to the other.  A netting agreement would contain provisions setting out the circumstances under which it would operate.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Netting agreement&rdquo; is defined so that any agreement providing for netting of financial contracts will be within the scope of the legislation.  Such an agreement may also provide for security, guarantees and collateral to be supplied by either party &mdash; where one party to an agreement requires security to be supplied for use in the event that a net amount is owing to that party as a result of the operation of a netting agreement. It is sometimes the practice in the industry that two parties would have separate netting agreements in relation to interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity based contracts and, accordingly, master netting agreements are used to sum the outcomes of each netting agreement.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Master netting agreement&rdquo; is defined as any agreement where provision is made to offset the amounts due between two parties under a number of netting agreements.  For operational reasons, two parties might have separate agreements in relation to their interest rate, currency and commodity based transactions but, in the event of the agreements being triggered, they would require that the net amount under each, in both directions, be aggregated. <Col N="1095" /> As with netting agreements, master netting agreements may contain provisions in relation to security, guarantees and collateral.</P>
    <P>Section 2 deals with the powers of the Central Bank.  The bank is given the power by this section to include in the definition of &ldquo;financial contract&rdquo; any contract included in Annex III of the solvency ratio directive or any contract added to same from time to time.  The bank will give effect to any changes by the issuance of notice under this section. As I have already indicated, the definition of financial contract in the Bill is based on, but is more comprehensive than, Annex III of the relevant EU directive, so it is not anticipated that the bank will have to issue a notice under the section on enactment.</P>
    <P>Section 3 deals with the powers of the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Finance is empowered to include, in consultation with the Central Bank, contracts or types of contracts within the definition of financial contracts.  He is also empowered to exclude contracts within the scope of the definition &mdash; and therefore from within the scope of the legislation &mdash; whether or not they were included.  The Minister exercises his powers under this section by issuance of regulations which must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  As a safeguard, to ensure that contracts in Annex III are not inadvertently ruled out, any regulation by the Minister which excludes any contract from within the definition of financial contract cannot exclude any contract which has been included by the Central Bank under its powers at section 2.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with the enforceability of netting, set off and collateral under netting and master netting agreements. This is the core section of the Bill.  Subsection (1) (a) provides certainty, by disapplying any prohibitions which may exist in case law in bankruptcy, liquidation, examinership or receivership, or in the Companies Acts or the Bankruptcy Act, 1988, that netting is legally enforceable where a netting agreement <Col N="1096" /> exists.  It also ensures that, where security guarantees and collateral are provided for in the agreement, a party will be entitled to use these against any net amount owing to it as a result of the netting provisions of the agreement.  The provision is drafted so that its terms will apply to security in the form of money, securities, guarantees and secured guarantees, provided specifically to meet any net amount due under a netting agreement.  Identical provisions are included in subsection (1) (b) in relation to enforceability of master netting agreements and security, guarantees and collateral given in relation to them.</P>
    <P>Section 4 (2) ensures that the relevant rules of law and sections of the Companies Acts and the Bankruptcy Act, 1988, in particular, which deal with fraud, misrepresentation, etc., will not be set aside by subsection (1). It also seeks to ensure that neither a netting or master netting agreement can be enforced by virtue of section 4 where the terms of the agreement would render it void or unenforceable.</P>
    <P>The final two subsections of section 4 provide for two other matters which are deemed necessary to remove doubt in relation to derivative trading in general. Section 4 (3) disapplies the provision in the Statute of Frauds, 1695, which obliges contracts with a duration of greater than one year to be committed to writing before being enforceable. This recognises the industry practice of screen to screen or telephone based trading, and that such trading is often in relation to two and three year contracts. Such contracts will now be immediately enforceable.  Section 4 (4) clarifies, for the avoidance of doubt, that financial contracts are excluded from the scope of the Gaming and Lotteries Acts, 1956 to 1986, and that they always were excluded.  Clearly, that legislation was never intended to apply to derivative contracts.  Section 5 provides for the Short Title of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I have tabled a number of amendments with which I will deal on Committee Stage.  The majority of them arise from drafting changes only and, <Col N="1097" /> together with some others which seek to make explicit the intention of the legislation on guarantees, they serve to clarify the text as passed by the Dáil rather than add anything to the scope or powers provided for in the legislation.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to ensure that banks and other parties trading in derivatives will have the certainty that netting agreements entered into by them for the purpose of reducing their risk exposure will be legally enforceable in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or examinership, providing always that the agreements are properly drafted.  The Bill will ensure, where security is provided by either party specifically to secure potential obligations in the event of a netting or master netting agreement being acted upon, that the security so provided can be set off against amounts owed to that party under an agreement.</P>
    <P>My appointment as Minister of State with responsibility for the IFSC demonstrates the commitment of this Government to the continued development of Dublin as a financial services centre which can compete internationally.  The decision by the European Commission to extend the deadline for new entrants to the centre by an additional six years coincided with the formation of this Government.  This focused my attention on developing a strategy so that those extra years could be used to best advantage. Having said that, six years is a relatively short time.  I am also intent on looking beyond that again, where appropriate, to seek to secure the long term expansion and development of the centre.  To this end, I am currently engaged in a series of meetings with senior public sector and industry figures aimed at developing an agreed way forward to capitalise on the opportunities provided by the extension of the deadline.</P>
    <P>There is still a very significant flow of new projects being brought forward by IDA Ireland.  The desired expansion for the centre will come naturally as the number of IFSC companies builds, as the range of products and services on <Col N="1098" /> offer grows and as the experience and reputation of IFSC companies increases.</P>
    <P>I have set the following objectives for the economic development of the centre. First, to substantially increase the level of direct employment from the current level, which is approaching 2,500, over the next five years to bring the total to between 4,000 and 6,000 &mdash; 6,000 is the figure I have in mind. Second, to create at least 1,000 jobs in related back office activity.  The provision of 5,000 additional jobs over a five year period by these first two aims is a reasonable target.  Third, to maximise consequential employment in associated legal, accounting and general services &mdash; such as software development and security, cleaning and catering &mdash; in the domestic economy.</P>
    <P>In addition, I have set up a long term review group under my chairmanship, consisting of representatives at senior level from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Finance, the National Treasury Management Agency and the IDA, to plan in a concerted way the long term development of the centre.</P>
    <P>I am intent on taking a pro-active role in the development of the centre which has now achieved its critical mass stage and is accepted as a player on the international stage.  With this in mind, I recently visited Boston and New York and met some of the most senior figures in the financial world, many of whom have interests in the IFSC or are interested in locating there, to hear at first hand their views on Dublin.  It was clear to me that the chief executives of major companies are acutely aware of the centre and the benefits of locating there, and many of them visited Dublin to see for themselves.</P>
    <P>I intend to appoint an international ministerial advisory committee to advise on realisable targets to ensure that the great progress made in establishing the IFSC continues to gain momentum and is maximised.  As part of my overall strategy for the centre I intend to ensure that a continuous programme of legislative change, consistent with a well <Col N="1099" /> regulated environment, is maintained so that we can keep our competitive position. This Bill is one such step in that programme and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and compliment him on this legislation.  I also compliment his office on its willingness to facilitate Opposition Members who wish to be briefed on this highly technical Bill. That is a good way to make progress and I thank the Minister of State and his officials for the courtesy and consideration they have shown us over the last few days.</P>
      <P>As the Minister of State said, this is a highly technical Bill which achieves three fundamental objectives.  It brings legal certainty to an area where there was some ambiguity.  The concept of netting is not entirely a novel one, as the view was often taken over the years in company law that netting arrangements between creditors offsetting separate bills were acceptable.  However, as the Minister of State pointed out, there are very good and cogent reasons why this issue should be put on a statutory basis, not least because of the sheer volume of trading involved, as we saw recently in the Barings Bank case, and the speed of the transactions.  The whole issue is focused on the interesting area of derivatives which is a relatively new area of trading where the exposures can be massive.  The Bill brings legal certainty where there was ambiguity and risk, which is welcome.  The steps which have been taken in the Bill are, by and large, ones which all sides of the House can accept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill anticipates a Directive which is slowly winding its way through the machinery in Brussels.  In that sense, it achieves the third objective, in that it gives the Irish Financial Services Centre a distinct edge on its competitors.  While the netting of financial contracts is common in the United States and the Far East, it is not dealt with on a legislative basis in most EU states.  By taking this <Col N="1100" /> step and changing a factor in the environment of the IFSC, the Government is putting the centre in a very competitive position to take advantage of changes in a rapidly changing environment.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State adverted to the fact that the promise of early legislative action in this area was critical to the final decision by Merrill Lynch to site in Dublin rather than in Zurich which is a well established hub.  That decision by Merrill Lynch last December adds considerably to a long list of prestigious companies locating in the IFSC.  That company, which is extremely well regarded in the United States and internationally, will ultimately transfer the bulk of its non-dollar capital marketing activities to Dublin.  The competition on that occasion was very real.  The main competition we faced was from Zurich.</P>
    <P>The Irish Financial Services Centre has been a remarkable success story in Irish political and financial life and the begrudgers and cynics have been shown to be people of straw.  There has seldom been such a success which can be so readily identified with a small number of individuals.  The former Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, had the tremendous political courage to grasp and run with an idea and push it through.  There was a positive ocean of cynicism at the time from financial institutions and the media.  There was a degree of political cynicism and harassment, which we all understand because we live in a political world.</P>
    <P>However, there were politicians on all sides who saw the value of this project and pushed it forward.  The IFSC is also an enduring tribute to Mr. Dermot Desmond, who showed incredible foresight and who, like Mr. Haughey, was harried by his peers.  There was a great deal of political and institutional jealousy of both men.  It is interesting that in a few short years their dream has been realised to the extent that it has.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that over 240 operations have received primary licences to operate through the IFSC.  When the IFSC proposals were first mooted, I wondered whether it could ever get off <Col N="1101" /> the ground and whether we would ever see Ireland becoming a financial services centre; this was probably due to my cynicism as an ex-employee of the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>We have unique advantages which I do not think we recognise.  We have a unique time zone advantage being between the far eastern and US markets. We never saw this advantage and did not wish to exploit it before people like Mr. Desmond and Mr. Haughey proposed the establishment of a financial services centre.</P>
    <P>We have another extraordinary advantage in the young men and women who are Irish ambassadors in every financial service centre in the world.  A few years ago I visited Hong Kong and was amazed at the number of Irish graduates I met, particularly from UCC but also from other universities and third level institutions.  They were the cream of the crop and we exported them to enhance and bolster financial service institutions abroad.  This expertise and extraordinary resource can now be turned to Ireland's advantage.</P>
    <P>The IFSC is an extraordinary success. It has 240 licensed operations; this figure does not include 100 treasury and 100 insurance facilities which are managed on an agency basis through the IFSC.  The Minister is right in saying it is appropriate that there should be a partnership between the financial services of the State &mdash; the National Treasury Management Agency, the Central Bank and the Department of Finance &mdash; the management of the IFSC, development corporations and the financial institutions which have set up in the centre to enhance and expand the centre. The Bill is welcome and it shows there are people in the public sector willing to think ahead, to seek advantage and with the courage to exploit it.</P>
    <P>There are areas of innovation which the Minister and the task force he is establishing should keep in mind.  They should consider two major changes which are taking place in the financial world, one of which is evident and the other less so but will become more evident <Col N="1102" /> in the years ahead.  The first is the situation in Hong Kong.  The ending of its colonial status offers a unique opportunity to Ireland.  A significant proportion of the European graduates who work in the financial services sector there are Irish citizens and are the products of Irish third level education institutions.</P>
    <P>The ending of Hong Kong's colonial status provides two opportunities to Ireland.  Its financial services centre gained its predominance because of its location, the fact that it initially operated a relaxed regime, but has not done so the same extent in recent times, and because wealthy people in the wider Pacific region were willing to invest their funds in it because of its relations with London and they saw it as a centre of excellence with a great deal of stability.</P>
    <P>After 1997 several of these advantages will disappear but only for a relatively short time because I think Hong Kong's importance will not cease but will re-emerge.  There will be a window of opportunity for a relatively short time.  The review group which the Minister is contemplating should look at the window of advantage which will result from the demise of Hong Kong as a colonial power in 1997.  Through the Department of Foreign Affairs and the alumni association of colleges, which includes UCD, the Minister could establish people on the ground in Hong Kong who are well familiar with the realities of life and the fears of banking and financial institutions there.  I am not suggesting we should unduly take advantage of fears and perceptions, but if we do not exploit this opportunity somebody else will.  The Minister and the task force he is setting up should consider the issue of Hong Kong and further innovations which would facilitate the transfer of institutions and operations from Hong Kong to Ireland.</P>
    <P>We seem to have an almost self-destructive attitude to going after business aggressively.  Since the early 1970s Canada has been exploiting this reality through the operation of relatively flexible <Col N="1103" /> investment, visa and passport operations etc., and it has attracted a large number of people.  We have been discouraging ourselves because we came into this field at a late stage and we are doing ourselves a disservice.</P>
    <P>Paradoxically, the other extraordinary advantage which will appear in the financial services area over the next 20 to 25 years will be the re-emergence of China as an economic giant.  As has been the case historically, this re-emergence will depend on capital movements from Europe and the United States.  As happened in the past, a number of centres will provide the locus of this capital movement.  Oddly, while the demise of Hong Kong's colonial status could provide one short term window of opportunity, a longer term one will arise in the Far East.  Ireland has a unique time location, we have improved our telecommunications system and we have the talent, infrastructure and the base in law to operate.  This could be another focus for the Minister and the task force.</P>
    <P>The Minister has tabled a number of amendments which we will discuss on Committee Stage.  Accounting bodies have circulated correspondence, which I think the Minister has received, about concerns which are somewhat arcane. When he is responding he may take the opportunity of informing us of how he has met these concerns.  While we are all anxious that Irish law contains the flexibility to respond to a changing environment, we also wish to ensure the changes we make will not become an opportunity for people who are not necessarily motivated by the highest ethical considerations.</P>
    <P>There is logic in what is being proposed in this Bill and we will facilitate the Minister in every way in giving it a speedy transition through this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and compliment him for his clear speech which simplified what in some ways is a complex subject.  I also congratulate him <Col N="1104" /> on the forward looking nature of what he had to say.</P>
      <P>In some respects, the most important part of the Minister's statement was not strictly relevant to the Bill.  At the end of his contribution, he emphasised the commitment of the Government to the future development of the International Financial Services Centre and gives as an indication of its commitment the appointment of a Minister with specific responsibilities for the future guidance and direction of the centre.</P>
      <P>I liked the fact that the Minister is thinking far ahead, not in terms of one or two years.  I was struck by him saying that six years is a relatively short time and I suppose it is when one thinks about a long term strategy.  The changes in financial practice and technology over the past six years have been truly extraordinary and there will be more in the next six years.  Therefore, the need to constantly look ahead is vital if the International Financial Services Centre is to remain at the forefront.</P>
      <P>The Minister also said that he intended taking a proactive role in the development of the centre and I believe him.  I would never accuse the Minister of being laid back in his approach to matters but it is good to know there will be a dynamic hands on approach with the Minister directly answerable to the Government for what happens.</P>
      <P>Is the membership of the long term review group not unduly restrictive and narrow and should other groups not be involved?  The Minister's Department, the Department of Finance, the National Treasury Management Agency and the IDA will plan the future development of the centre in a concerted way.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Roche about the quality of briefing offered by the Minister's Department.  The fact that Departments offer briefing on an issue of this kind on a cross party basis is a welcome development.  I compliment the civil servants who gave the briefing. They were extremely helpful and clear and are a credit to the Minister's Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1105" /> The International Financial Services Centre has been one of the great success stories of the past decade and continues to be.  Senator Roche raised the question of its origin.  History may recall who the true begetters were but the credit must go to two people in particular.  The idea of setting up the centre was that of Dermot Desmond, who developed in considerable detail the component parts of the centre and saw its possibilities, and Charlie Haughey, the then Taoiseach, who was prepared to recognise these possibilities and run with it.</P>
    <P>Senator Roche also referred to the cynicism in certain circles at the time in the face of the hugeness and novelty of the concept.  I remind Senator Roche and others that this has always been the reaction to almost every major development. The first major developments made by the State were the Shannon scheme and setting up the ESB.  On that occasion, all the Irish banks said it could not be done and would not co-operate. The engineering profession to a man &mdash; there were no women &mdash; said the same. Only a handful co-operated.  <i>The Irish Times</i> thought it was a socialist conspiracy to bring the Teutons in by the back door.  Almost every major idea had its critics and cynics at the time of its conception.  We should all be grateful they were not listened to in this instance and that the centre went ahead.</P>
    <P>What was once a derelict area in the heart of our city is now a thriving, prosperous and, for the most part, architecturally pleasing area.  However, it still needs a great deal of humanising.  It requires more shops, homes, pubs and hotels and the centre is moving in this direction.  It would be a pity if it went the way of many major international financial centres in other cities which tend to have a soullessness and lifelessness about them after 6 p.m.  If the centre can develop in a way which allows it to be a thriving and living community, so much the better.</P>
    <P>The language in this Bill is complex. It is no accident that the longest section sets out the definitions.  Some of them are hard to understand, especially for <Col N="1106" /> somebody who is not very financially literate. When I first saw the Netting of Financial Contracts Bill, I thought it had to do with marine matters.  I have learned a great deal by having to plough through it and I am sure other Members have as well.  I compliment the Minister and his scriptwriter for the clarity of language and the way in which he pointed out the issues at stake.</P>
    <P>The net point of the Bill is clear.  It seeks to ensure that agreements between two countries to set off their mutual liabilities to arrive at a single net amount owing by one party to another are enforceable.  That is straightforward and I do not intend to make it more complex.  There are some complexities about which I want to ask the Minister on Committee Stage but we need not delay the House in commending the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and congratulate him on introducing the Bill, which I welcome unreservedly.  I would like to highlight some aspects of our approach to the International Financial Services Centre.  Although this has already been commented on by Senator Roche and Senator Manning, I want to single out one aspect of this approach which is worthy of emulation in other spheres of our national life. This Bill is a prompt response to competitive pressures.  It has been produced to remove an obstacle to attract firms to locate in the IFSC.  It is an appropriate, simple and fast response.  A situation arose in the marketplace and we are now moving quickly to address it.  This is not a coincidence.  It is happening because a particular approach has been taken all along with the International Financial Services Centre and this is the latest example of what has been happening through the history that has been generously commented upon by Senator Manning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the beginning it was recognised that constant legislative change would be necessary to remove obstacles as they arose and to keep the centre fully competitive in the cutthroat world of <Col N="1107" /> international mobile investment.  The mechanism used for this was a high powered committee which acted as a bridge between the financial community, the IDA and the Custom House Docks Authority on the one hand and the Government of the day on the other.  Now it will be strengthened by the two new committees, the long term review group which the Minister set up under his own chairmanship and the international ministerial advisory committee. It seems this grouping, since the foundation of the International Financial Services Centre, identified problems, suggested solutions and passed them on to the Government.  Time after time, this quick and rapid action has resulted in the formation of new legislation that specifically addresses the issues raised in the International Financial Services Centre and that approach has been a central part in making the centre such a success.  We can all be proud of the IFSC.  The Government's approach and commitment to the project have been shown by the appointment of a Minister with specific responsibility for it.  I wish the Minister well in his task and I am sure he will bring his legendary energy, enthusiasm and hands on approach to bear on it.</P>
    <P>I would like the IFSC model or a group which identifies problems extended to other national priorities. Some problems need constant monitoring and adjustment of the legislative framework.  The IFSC model should remind us that Governments can act quickly and responsibly when they put their minds to it.  The solution to some problems depends on the laws which are in place to deal with them.  We should extend the model of the committee which the Minister has been using in the IFSC to other national priorities, in other words, we should set up an action group in the areas concerned, charge it with responsibility for monitoring the situation and then ask it to identify matters which can be improved by new legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1108" /> I am not suggesting that all problems can be solved by legislation.  If they could, the political process would be more popular that it is.  However, in some cases progress is hampered by the fact that legislation is falling behind the pace of change or does not exist to deal with new problems which arise.  This applies to the nuts and bolts of the problem.</P>
    <P>An example of this is the drugs problem which is constantly raised in this House.  Nobody questions the seriousness of the drugs problem and the threat it poses to people living in disadvantaged areas.  Many people agree that the Garda Síochána and the Customs and Excise are seriously hampered by the way the drug barons and dealers can exploit the law.  The law is not strong enough to deal with this problem.  Perhaps we need new laws to effectively address it and lance that boil; in other words, special legislation is needed for special situations, as in the case of the IFSC.  The drugs problem is an example which springs to mind but I am sure this approach could be used to great benefit in other areas.</P>
    <P>The IFSC model provides us with an administratively simple and inexpensive way to operate and to respond quickly and effectively to rapidly changing situations. I am sure this system of speedy legislative change to face up to immediate problems can be used in other ways. The IFSC is an example of what can be done if we take action in certain situations. It provides useful, high quality employment and is producing a bonanza in tax revenue.  It also provides a flagship for the services sector, rather than the manufacturing sector, which is the key economic reality.</P>
    <P>Senator Roche mentioned Hong Kong, which I had the opportunity to visit.  We should not take our eyes off its success story if we want to create jobs in this country.  One of the benefits of the IFSC is the legislative model before us today.  We should try to emulate that on a wider basis in order to tackle problems in a simple, speedy and responsible way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1109" /> I congratulate the Minister and wish him well with this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Gay Mitchell, to the House.  This is my first occasion to be in the House with him, although it is not our first occasion to exchange views on a variety of issues.</P>
      <P>The Government must be complimented on the speedy way it has reacted to the ever-changing and complex world of financial services, especially the derivatives market.  I am impressed by the Minister's commitment and enthusiasm &mdash; this was acknowledged by Senator Manning and Senator Quinn &mdash; to Dublin.  People accused me and my late father of being parochial in our approach.  However, the Minister is the epitome of a Dublin Deputy as regards protecting not only the interests of his immediate constituency but of the wider Dublin area.</P>
      <P>I will not suggest that the IFSC is the Minister's toy, but I have been impressed in recent months by his attitude and approach to this success story. It reminds me of a small boy who treasures his most prized possession and informs everyone of its importance.  The Minister has batted well for Ireland as regards the IFSC and I hope he continues to do so.</P>
      <P>Derivatives have been described as a banking time bomb.  A world banking meltdown could occur if such financial risk management got out of control.  The world derivatives market is worth $12 trillion a year.  Seven or eight of the world's top 20 banks could go under in a 24 hour period if their exposure to risk was not covered.  This almost happened last year when the bull run resulted in investors buying positions in anticipation of the market's direction.  They then watched in horror as 40 per cent of their profits disappeared with the collapse of the bond market in January. This shows the vagaries of such financial risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish banks are active on the derivatives market.  They have a gross exposure of £144 billion, which is an <Col N="1110" /> astonishing amount of money to play around with in the market.  This represents 40 per cent of AIB's shareholders' funds and 45 per cent of Bank of Ireland's shareholders' funds.  Even in the event of a meltdown, there is no risk of either bank going under.  These percentages include the two areas, fixed interest rates and foreign exchange, in which the derivatives market is operated by banks and financial houses.  Derivatives have been in existence in one form or another for hundreds of years.</P>
    <P>This Bill refers to a law on fraud which dates back to 1695.  It originated in the House of Commons and the parliamentarians at that time were mainly people of property and finance.  Consequently, their priorities had little to do with the public interest but had everything to do with property, the maintenance of their lifestyle and the manner in which they did business with their fellow man &mdash; and I say &ldquo;man&rdquo; because it accurately fits the situation.</P>
    <P>Derivates have been around for hundreds of years but their growth in popularity in the last three years is nothing short of phenomenal.  Derivatives are usually used to reduce a company's exposure to volatile interest rates and foreign currency movements.  The treasury department of major corporations usually use them in a defensive manner to reduce the company's overall liability. However, greed is never too far from the surface and the temptation to speculate has proved irresistible.  Consequently, some of the world's largest corporations have been burned badly as a result of speculative investment in the derivatives market.  The most recent and famous of these is Barings Bank but the list is breathtaking in its diversity and variety.</P>
    <P>Some examples over the last 12 months include a Japanese oil company, which lost US$1.5 billion trading in foreign derivatives; Metallgesellschaft, the German industrial conglomerate lost US$1.5 billion on oil futures trading; mutual funds run by Piper Jaffray companies lost US$700 million of their value investing in mortgage derivatives; Eastman <Col N="1111" /> Kodak revealed last month that the cost of unloading its interest rate derivatives portfolio had risen to US$220 million; the UK pharmaceuticals company, Glaxo, a high-flyer in the equities market, invested US$1 billion in derivatives and now admits to making losses of £220 million sterling; Procter &amp; Gamble &mdash; you cannot use any washing powder without Procter &amp; Gamble being involved at some level &mdash; lost US$157 million on leveraged swaps with Bankers Trust; and the list, which includes greeting card companies, paper manufacturers and brokerages, goes on and on.</P>
    <P>This area needed to be regulated stiffly.  The point has already been made that the Government has moved in advance and in anticipation of our European partners in this regard, and this needs to be emphasised.  I am not surprised because the guiding hands which initiated the concept of the International Financial Services Centre in the mid to late eighties, have maintained a steady grasp on the tiller ever since, irrespective of the changes of Government.  This group of people &mdash; Mr. Dermot Desmond has been mentioned here but I am sure there are many more &mdash; has ensured at every step of its development that Ireland is not only in touch and aware of the complex and accelerated changes in financial services but that we are ahead of the posse.</P>
    <P>Dublin is fast overtaking many of the more traditional financial services centres as a leader in this field.  The impressive figures which have been conveyed by the Minister in terms of job creation targets and jobs realised is but one indication.  As late as yesterday, the Minister was present at yet another unveiling of objectives realised at the IFSC.  The chairman of IDA Ireland, Mr. Kieran McGowan, stated that not only had the original targets been reached but they had exceeded the aspirations of some years ago and that a total of 50 companies had set up this year with many more to come.</P>
    <P>Although this legislation and the activities of the IFSC bear little relation <Col N="1112" /> to the world in which we normally operate, it has proved to be an extremely important net contributor to the economy. I have no doubt, indeed I have every confidence given the present Minister's enthusiastic commitment to developing the potential of the centre, that, while it will never replace London as a major centre of financial services, in years to come Dublin will spring to traders' lips in most financial markets around the world whenever financial services are being discussed.</P>
    <P>Briefly, in the context of the Bill, I want to examine the term &ldquo;derivatives&rdquo;. The term seems to have been skirted around to some degree &mdash; not by omission I hasten to add.  Derivatives are a financial product with a jargon all their own.  I am not going to suggest that we adopt all the words, such as &ldquo;butterfly&rdquo;, &ldquo;diagonal calendar spread&rdquo;, &ldquo;ladder&rdquo;, &ldquo;strangle&rdquo;, &ldquo;naked options&rdquo;, &ldquo;futures&rdquo;, &ldquo;options&rdquo;, &ldquo;puts&rdquo; and &ldquo;calls&rdquo;, etc.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is it exactly. Senator Manning has anticipated my remarks.  If it was not in the financial services context, I might be accused by the Chair of being somewhat prurient in using such language.</P>
      <P>Derivatives are now a major part of world finance.  The reason the word &ldquo;derivatives&rdquo; is used is that all these financial products are derived from underlying assets, such as corporate shares, gilts, bonds, commodities and foreign exchanges.  The key derivatives are options; where an option is taken on a gilt or equity, there is no obligation to buy but one pays for the privilege.  The Bill is directed towards the area of interest rates and foreign exchange.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At its simplest, the consumer is bombarded by banks and building societies encouraging him to take out mortgages for a two year period at a fixed rate of interest; he can then manage his finances more easily.  He will know the portion of the household budget which will be paid on the mortgage for the <Col N="1113" /> next two years.  With a variable rate, which depends to a large extent on interest rate fluctuations, one could find &mdash; as I did since I have a variable rate mortgage &mdash; that, as a result of the interest rate increases earlier this year, one's mortgage repayments have risen by several pounds per month.  In the context of a fixed rate mortgage, at least one can manage one's finances reasonably well.</P>
    <P>Expanding that example into the banking and corporate sectors, how much more advantageous is it for the treasury department of a bank or corporation to be able to anticipate their liability in the area of repayments on loans over a specific period of time?  For example, if the rate is fixed for what is usually a five year period, or if one was purchasing foreign currency, one could make an arrangement with another party to buy and sell foreign currency at a specific rate for a specific length of time.  It is only in the event of a default occurring with either party when the initiating party is unable to recover their losses that a financial meltdown would be triggered.  In that context the Bill is welcome.  It sends a strong signal, particularly to the US and Asian markets, which are already more advanced than those in Europe, that we are a safe house in which to play.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to burden the House further on what everybody agrees is technical legislation.  I enthusiastically endorse the comments which have been made by my colleagues on all sides of the House, especially the Minister.  In endorsing his commendation of the Bill, I wish him continued success in his efforts to attract jobs not only to Dublin but to the whole country.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators for their kind words of encouragement.  I join them in praising the civil servants who prepared the Bill so expeditiously and efficiently.  It is a short Bill but it is technical and it required hard work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1114" /> I share the view of Senator Roche and others about the begrudgers and cynics.  They have been put in their place on this subject and when the Dublin Olympic bid is made I hope they will be put in their place again.  We do not believe nothing can work in Dublin; we should begin from the position that everything is possible until proven otherwise and when we have a scientific report stating we should do something, we should do it.</P>
    <P>I join with those Members who congratulated the former Taoiseach, Mr. Charles Haughey and Mr. Dermot Desmond not only for having the vision to put this idea into practice but for taking on the begrudgers.  I have a low opinion of these cynics and we as politicians, who are more prepared to follow up ideas, should be prepared to take them on.  We are elected to represent the public and, having that mandate, have a better view of their needs than so-called experts and cynics.</P>
    <P>Senator Roche referred to the quality of the manpower resource and from my discussion with players located here and abroad, I know that is a significant factor in locating here.  A central point in the success of the centre is its status as a partnership between the State, State agencies and the private sector and I intend that shall continue.  He also mentioned Hong Kong; I have already undertaken to keep an eye on that market.</P>
    <P>He mentioned the points raised by the Consultancy Committee of Accountancy Bodies of Ireland and I will respond to those points, the first of which related to insolvency and the second to balance sheet classification. On the first point, the text of section 4 is designed to ensure that case law and general principles of law in so far as they relate to bankruptcy, insolvency and receivership do not prevent netting agreements, etc., from being enforceable. The term &ldquo;insolvency&rdquo; is used in its general sense and is intended to cover rules of law relating to liquidation and examinership.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1115" /> However, the section goes on specifically to mention the Companies Acts, which cover each case or type of liquidation even where insolvency is not an issue, as in a voluntary liquidation. Those Acts also contain the statutory provisions on examinership and are also disapplied when it comes to the enforcement of netting agreements.  Accordingly, while I am aware of the views of the CCAB, I do not agree with the point it raises.</P>
    <P>On the second point, the Bill is silent on balance sheet classification, etc.  It is not intended to address such an issue and so it is not clear why any such amendment should be necessary.  I would have thought the CCAB and other similar bodies would be the primary groups to be consulted if such changes had been envisaged; they might even have been the authors of such change if necessary.  However, they were not consulted as no change is intended.  I do not propose to fill legislation with disclaimers without real need and will not do so in this instance.</P>
    <P>I am grateful for the kind comments and welcome of Senator Manning and other Senators.  He is right to say the Government has set targets and has made a commitment to achieve them. He asked whether the long term review group was too restricted.  Of necessity, that group will be like a public service agency because I will need to discuss confidential matters with it, perhaps relating to legislation.  Separate to that I am about to set up a ministerial advisory committee.  It will feature people who know the markets and have international experience, who will give me the private sector view.  I in turn will be able to use the other group as a vehicle for advancing that.  I note the other comments made by Senator Manning about critics; I already dealt with that point and I agree with his sentiments.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn singled out one example as worthy of being followed, which was the response to market need. I agree with him.  Perhaps in future we might not always wait until we have a <Col N="1116" /> long compendium of measures before bringing legislation before both Houses. Shorter Bills to deal with specific needs might be a better way to continue to meet our objective in the IFSC, which is to respond to market needs and ensure legislative requirements do not hamper its advance, once it complies with regulation.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney's list of potential vehicles indicates how complicated this area is.  To add to the confusion, there could be a hybrid of these vehicles, which shows how fast the market is moving.  I will bring his comments on the Statute of Frauds, 1695 to the attention of the Minister for Justice, who has responsibility in this area, to see if this legislation needs to be updated.</P>
    <P>I have responded to the points raised and I am grateful to the House for facilitating this legislation.</P>

However, while this usage is correct it is considered preferable to use the words &ldquo;set off&rdquo; throughout the Bill so as to better describe the process of setting debits and credits against each other and to conform with the description of this process in the Bankruptcy Act, 1988.

      <P>The second issue that has arisen concerns money advanced to secure a guarantee.  Subparagraphs <Col N="1118" /> (c) (2) (2) of the definition of netting and master netting agreements are amended so as to ensure that money advanced by a guarantor can be used for set off against the amount owing under a netting or master netting agreement. It was originally thought that the references at subparagraphs (c) (1) of each definition covered this point, but it has since been argued that money provided to secure the obligations of a guarantor under his or her net guarantee cannot be regarded as covered by the provision at (c) (1) which related to money advanced as security in respect of liabilities under a netting or master netting agreement.  This argument has been accepted and an amendment made accordingly.</P>

      <P>The Bill, as passed by Dáil Éireann on 7 July, was warmly welcomed by the Opposition.  However, in the interim two substantive issues which require clarification have arisen. The first such issue is whether the intention of the Bill would ensure that guarantees given in support of a party <Col N="1120" /> to a netting agreement are legally enforceable and should be given effect by the Bill as passed.  For example, if parties A and B enter a netting agreement and, for instance, A is a subsidiary of a major corporation and B is a bank, the corporation might guarantee that if A goes into liquidation, and under the netting agreement owes B money, it will pay the money owing.  Bank B needs certainty that it can pursue A's corporate parent in respect of its guarantee.  At present, under the terms of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990, which govern examinership, bank B would not be able to enforce the guarantees given on A's behalf for the period for which A remains in examinership.  I accept that there may be some doubt about the enforceability of guarantees, accordingly the amendments to section 4 (1) (a) and (b) are designed to make clear that neither the examinership nor any other company law or bankruptcy rules will prevent the guarantee from being enforced.</P>

      <P>It is with great regret, and in my own case considerable sadness, that we are moved to debate this issue in response to requests from all sides of the House.  Bastille Day should be a day of happiness.  On St. Patrick's Day people around the world wish this country well and express their goodwill towards us and on Bastille Day people who value France should have the opportunity to do likewise.  Today however, a dark cloud hangs over Bastille Day which is being celebrated in a mood of bitterness in many parts of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say this as a Francophile.  France is a country I love.  I respect its culture, enjoy its food, appreciate its wines and admire its people.  I regard France as a valuable ally and good friend of this country in the European Union.  There is a rapport between our two countries, not least because of a strong mutual suspicion <Col N="1126" /> of the island that lies between us. All parties have found that in the European Parliament and elsewhere it has been easy to strike up a good relationship with France.  Their view of the world is often closer to ours than the Anglo-Saxon view.  It is from this position of wishing France well that I approached today's discussion.</P>
    <P>I asked myself why France should behave as it has.  I know that defence and security are high on any French agenda and we all know why.  France has twice been invaded and suffered occupation.  France has had the nightmare of seeing its defences collapse in a matter of days with the invasion of Germany in 1940.  Every French Government since, and especially since the time of Charles De Gaulle, has had an obsession with security and France's absolute need to have its own independent deterrent force.  I understand and appreciate all of that but, having made every possible allowance, I can see no possible justification for the unilateral resumption of nuclear testing.</P>
    <P>The arguments put forward by French spokespersons and Ministers have lacked conviction and have been contradictory and empty of any real content. President Chirac's first major act since his election has been dangerous and wrong and was carried out in a very brutal way.  It has been done in defiance of friendly opinion across Europe and the wider world and in defiance of the strongly expressed views of two of the most peaceable and civilised Governments in the world.</P>
    <P>We all have reason to be grateful to the Governments of Australia and New Zealand for their work over the years in helping to maintain a civilised world order.  These two countries have expressed, in a proper and reasonable way, their abhorrence of what France is doing.  Their protests have been brushed aside in a cavalier and arrogant manner. It is the way in which the legitimate protest of two peaceable civilised countries, Australia and New Zealand, is being treated which should ring the loudest bells.  The arrogance underlying this is <Col N="1127" /> breathtaking and the insensitivity is staggering.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the second point, the seizure of the <i>Rainbow Warrior.</i> What happened may strictly speaking have been legal but it certainly lacked any moral justification whatsoever.  It was done in a brutal way and it brought to mind memories of earlier French aggression against the <i>Rainbow Warrior I</i>, the boarding of that vessel, the attempt to sink it and the murders committed by French personnel at that time. There is a very murky side to the whole area of French security.  We saw it in the past and we are seeing it again today.</P>
    <P>It is not yet too late for President Chirac to listen to the voices being raised against what he is doing.  These are not the voices of cranks, faddists or single issue people.  These are voices being raised in virtually every parliament in the world.  They are opinions being expressed out of concern and, in our case, with great sadness because of the high regard, respect and affection we have for France and its people.  I call upon the French Government in the strongest possible terms to listen to what its friends are saying, to reconsider and reverse its decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The widespread anger and dismay throughout the international community at the decision of the French Government to resume nuclear testing in the south Pacific does not appear to be reflected by the political leaders, especially the leaders of the major political and economic powers.  One might well ask what influence, if any, a debate such as this can have in bringing pressure to bear on the French President. One can only hope that the international outrage generated by the actions of Greenpeace in regard to the Shell company's plans to sink the disused oil rig which resulted in the scrapping of those plans will give us some hope that small nations such as ours, in unison with the small nations and islands in the South Pacific, may force President Chirac and the French <Col N="1128" /> Government to change their minds and attitudes and abandon this inexplicable decision.</P>
      <P>I mentioned the failure of the other member states in the G7 to bring pressure on the French Government to change their attitude in this regard.  At a press conference following a recent meeting of the G7 in Halifax President Chirac was asked whether anyone had talked to him about the French nuclear tests.  The President said that subject had not been discussed either in public session or private conversation.  When asked about this matter in relation to the Japanese he mentioned that he had discussed this matter with the Japanese Prime Minister and the Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs but again he was quite adamant that he would not change his mind.</P>
      <P>At the same press conference a journalist mentioned that a South Pacific delegation led by the Australians would arrive in Paris on the following Monday to try to get the French Government to go back on its decision on nuclear tests.  He was asked whether there was any chance that he would reconsider that decision or change his attitude.  The President was adamant. He said that the South Pacific delegation would naturally be received with all the necessary courtesy and that they would be heard but that his decision was totally irrevocable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President was asked whether he could confirm how many of his colleagues had raised the question of nuclear tests while in Halifax and whether he was worried about the bad image this would give to France and to himself in particular.  He said that while he personally respected the strong feelings including those currently being expressed he repeated that they would not make him change his mind.  The President was also adamant that other member states of the G7, the most powerful states in the world, did not raise this issue with him.  This raises the question of the sincerity of the protests which are being made and whether or not governments are reflecting the <Col N="1129" /> widespread anger and revolt felt throughout the international community at this decision.</P>
    <P>The decision to resume nuclear testing which was announced by France on 13 June was not entirely unexpected. President Chirac had opposed the moratorium on testing introduced by President Mitterrand in 1992.  In the presidential election campaign he had pledged to be guided by the expert advice of the military on matters of testing and his own Defence Minister had announced on 6 June that an expert committee had recommended the resumption of nuclear testing.</P>
    <P>The French decision, together with the Chinese test of 15 May, has again raised the question of the sincerity of the commitments made by both countries at the recent Nuclear Proliferation Treaty Review and Extension Conference which was held on 11 May.  The states party to the NPT agreed without a vote to extend the treaty indefinitely, to strengthen the process for review of implementation and, importantly, they also agreed a set of principles and objectives for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament.  It was stated that, pending entry into force of a comprehensive test ban treaty, the nuclear weapon states would exercise utmost restraint. The French decision is flying in the face of the conference of 11 May and is abandoning the commitments given at that conference as late as 11 May 1995.</P>
    <P>Successive Irish Governments have called for an end to nuclear testing everywhere for all time.  They have held that the end to the development of nuclear weapons is the obvious first step in moving towards a complete elimination of this whole category of weapons. They have consistently advocated the conclusion of a test ban treaty, negotiation of which for the first time was supported by the entire international community at the UN General Assembly of 1993.  Since then the unilateral moratorium on testing which had been observed by France, the USA, Russia and the UK for the past two to three years has been important in securing <Col N="1130" /> and sustaining the political momentum to conclude the test ban treaty negotiations.</P>
    <P>Irish Governments have stressed the need for a binding international agreement that will ban all tests for all time. No commonsense individual believes that further tests can do anything to advance the conclusion of a test ban treaty.  Rather than advancing this treaty these tests will jeopardise the whole process.  Is this really what France wants?  The European Union member states are guilty of the same lack of interest as the G7 states in their failure to raise this issue with France.  While the Tánaiste raised the issue with the French Foreign Minister on 26 June in Cannes and expressed the Government's regret at the French Government decision, he failed to bring the matter up at the Council.  Raising these issues over a cup of coffee or a glass of wine is not the way to deal with these matters.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough that we should receive a short statement from our Tánaiste setting out Ireland's objection to this, but that he fails to raise it at important meetings like the Cannes summit or indeed at Foreign Affairs Council meetings.  This is a very poor performance when compared with the leadership we got from previous Irish Governments.  The late Frank Aiken as Minister for Foreign Affairs championed the cause of a nuclear test ban treaty which would eliminate the menace of nuclear armaments.</P>
    <P>In the short time at our disposal it is not possible to deal adequately with this matter but the Government should, as a matter of urgency, give a lead.  In less that one year we will take over the presidency of the European Union. Ireland now holds a highly respected position in the institutions of the Community and it is imperative that the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach make immediate contact with President Chirac. Such action would be far more positive than the invitation we received today from the Minister for Social Welfare, <Col N="1131" /> Proinsias De Rossa, who is holding some kind of matineé or teddy bear's picnic of hypocrisy in Buswell's Hotel. The Minister for Social Welfare has issued all with an invitation to attend some jamboree.  That is not the kind of action we need from the Government on this issue.  I call on the Taoiseach to meet President Chirac and make some positive representation on this issue to stop this madness.</P>

      <P>Recently I was privileged to welcome 40 children from Chernobyl to Mallow in north County Cork.  These children had been robbed or their health, childhood and future by the Chernobyl disaster.  The Chernobyl Children's Project, and Adi Roche in particular, has done marvellous work to ensure that these children experience some time in a clean environment in Cork and elsewhere.  However, many of the children are terminally ill and the best we can do is to alleviate their symptoms.</P>
      <P>Each time a nuclear test is carried out there is a danger that we will create more Chernobyl children.  I do not want anyone in Mallow to have to welcome a children's project from Mururoa in the future.  The French have again decided to turn the South Pacific into a nuclear playground.  They have turned a deaf ear to protests from the international community, environmental organisations and the residents of French Polynesia &mdash; whose livelihoods, and ultimately their lives, are under threat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1132" /> Last weekend the French compounded their intransigence by perpetrating an act of brazen piracy against the Greenpeace ship, <i>Rainbow Warrior II</i>, ten years after French commandos sank <i>Rainbow Warrior I</i> and killed a Greenpeace photographer.  Their decision to resume nuclear testing is particularly cynical in view of the proposed comprehensive test ban treaty due to be concluded next year.  They are, in effect, attempting to come in under the ropes in advance of that treaty.  It is vital that the international community maintain and increase pressure on the French Government in the period before the proposed resumption of testing in September.</P>
    <P>I am aware that we are not dealing with the Bosnian issue at present, but I want to put on record that the atrocities perpetrated by the Bosnian Serbs, and the complete failure of the United Nations to protect the people involved, are simply shocking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a terrible pity to mark France's national day with a condemnation of that country's decision to resume nuclear testing in the Pacific and the boarding of the Greenpeace ship, <i>Rainbow Warrior II.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 15 June this House registered its disapproval of the decision to resume testing.  We regard this decision as a totally unnecessary, provocative, selfish and stupid one.  I still fail to understand why the French took this decision in the first place, other than for domestic political reasons.  Following completion of its programme of eight small nuclear tests &mdash; use of the word &ldquo;small&rdquo; being a contradiction in terms &mdash; President Chirac has stated that &ldquo;France has every intention of signing a complete test ban treaty without reserve in the autumn of 1996.&rdquo;.  Why is it necessary, therefore, to resume testing if the French have promised to complete the test ban treaty?  My astonishment about the decision is increased by the knowledge that these tests can now be carried out by way of computer simulation.  There is no need <Col N="1133" /> to carry them out in reality.  Why is it necessary to carry out these tests?</P>
    <P>The French had their own moratorium on testing since 1992 which has now been abandoned.  France is giving an invitation to far more belligerent countries around the world to carry on testing.  There are huge environmental implications for people living in the Pacific region but there are also very serious implications for the European Union.  The intergovernmental conference will be held in Ireland in 1996 and one of its tasks will be to complete the Maastricht Treaty which contains a clause that member states should develop a common foreign policy.  This could ultimately lead to a common defence policy.  I cannot foresee any circumstances where it might be possible to develop a common foreign policy, much less a common defence policy, while the French are determined to carry out nuclear testing.  As a result of this ill-advised action, there will be real difficulty in reaching agreement on these important issues.</P>
    <P>It was sad that the French authorities marked the tenth anniversary of the sinking of <i>Rainbow Warrior I</i> in Auckland, which caused loss of life, by boarding <i>Rainbow Warrior II</i> in the Pacific. Television pictures of this event were quite horrifying.  The ship was rammed, which caused serious potential for loss of life, tear gas was thrown onto the bridge and it was boarded by French commandos.  I question what basis there is in international law for doing this.  It struck me as being an act of piracy.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Government will continue to exert pressure at diplomatic level to convince the French how ill-advised their decision has been.  It is correct that people should not attend today's function at the French Embassy. I have no difficulty with the event organised by Democratic Left.  It is ironic to read in this morning's newspapers that police in Paris urged motorists to stay at home or take public transport during the Bastille Day weekend to prevent high pollution levels.  French <Col N="1134" /> concerns about their domestic environment contrast markedly with their total lack of concern about the global one.  It is curious that they should take such a view of the potential for exhaust fumes to cause environmental damage in their own country, and not take due regard of the consequences of nuclear pollution to countries in the Pacific region.</P>

      <P>On Saturday last I received an invitation from Greenpeace to attend a demonstration it was organising. I do not attend such demonstrations in a light-hearted manner.  The last Greenpeace demonstration I attended was in Sellafield &mdash; on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the fire which took place there &mdash; in protest against the actions of British Nuclear Fuels.</P>
      <P>I attended a very peaceful demonstration outside the French Embassy on Ailesbury Road last Sunday at which all political parties were represented.  The demonstration was in protest against France's proposed resumption of nuclear testing in the South Pacific.  It was also to remember the tenth anniversary of the death of Fernando Pereira, a crew member of <i>Rainbow Warrior I</i> who lost his life when the ship was bombed in Auckland harbour.  Some moving speeches were made at that demonstration.  Greenpeace informed us that our message of protest and sympathy would be communicated to <i>Rainbow Warrior II</i> which was in the South Pacific at that time.  Less than two hours later, Irish time, we were horrified to learn that French naval commandos had boarded <i>Rainbow Warrior II</i> during the craft's protest voyage which, as I said, was timed to coincide with the tenth anniversary of the sinking of its predecessor by French agents in New Zealand. I am sure the House would share my horror at that cynical action on their part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to reiterate what the Leader of the House said about France and the French.  I love France and have visited it each year for the past 40 years. <Col N="1135" /> I enjoy the country, its people and its food.  However, I must protest at the insensitivity of the French in this instance.  I join with the Tánaiste in calling the action of the French a total violation against the peace ship.  I call on the French Government to cease nuclear testing in the South Pacific. There is no logic in the arguments they have made in support of their action.</P>

      <P>Outside the Chamber there is a portrait of Wolfe Tone, the father of Irish Republicanism.  It shows him in the uniform of the quarter master general of Napoleon's army.  In the background the fleet is amassing and at anchor in Le Harve provisioning for its journey to Ireland.  The connections between the two nations are inextricable. France has always been a friend of Ireland and, I believe, Ireland has always been a friend of France.  Like Senator Manning, I am a Francophile and I make no apologies for that.  I love France, the civilisation, the people, the food, the <i>joie de vivre</i> and everything that stands for France.</P>
      <P>I admire French single-mindedness in most issues, particularly when it comes to taking a political or a diplomatic stance.  They are never fearful to argue a case.  I admire their contribution to the thinking of civilised nations, to republicanism and to the evolutionary history of the world and, in particular, their contribution to elevating the importance of the individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like many people in Ireland, I find it difficult to understand how a nation which has contributed so much to the civilisation of the world can find itself so single-mindedly adhering to a policy which is indefensible.  If nuclear testing is accepted in this case, how can we argue with China, Pakistan, Iraq and other nations which seem to be infected with nuclear madness that they do not have the right to arm themselves with nuclear weapons and test these obscenities?  We all know that each time a nuclear weapon explodes it means death for somebody because on each <Col N="1136" /> occasion there has been nuclear testing, nuclear pollution enters the atmosphere and the food stream.  It destroys not only the ecosystem in the immediate vicinity but because of the delicate nature of this planet, it destroy us all.</P>
    <P>As a student of European history, like Senator Manning, I understand the French preoccupation with an independent defence policy and its natural national preoccupation with controlling weapons of defence.  I understand the pain the French feel as a result of recent European history.  Because I, and my children, visit and holiday in France, I understand their determination that history will never repeat itself.  However, I cannot understand that a nation which has played such a central and civilising role in the history of humanity can be so single-mindedly determined to pursue in the face of the requests and entreaties of the civilised world a course of action which is totally indefensible.</P>
    <P>Perhaps our entreaties will fall on deaf ears and will not be recorded in France.  There is no doubt in my mind that the people in the Quay d'Orsay or in the Elysée Palace will not spend too much time pouring over the debates of Seanad Éireann.  However, it is proper and appropriate that, on this day above all, Seanad Éireann, the Upper House of the Parliament of a nation which is closely and inextricably bound with France, should call on the French people to have sense, not to be obdurate and to be accommodating, as they have been, to the views of humanity.</P>

      <P>I thank the Leader of the House for allowing Members, at short notice, the opportunity to participate in this debate.  I want to add to the <Col N="1137" /> voice of my colleagues in expressing outrage at the military take-over of Srebrenica by the illegal Bosnian Serb Army.  I also condemn the horror of ethnic cleansing perpetrated on innocent civilians of that city.  The separation of young boys and men from their wives and children and the subsequent bussing of women and children out of the city is reminiscent of the selections by the Nazis on the Jews during World War II and the transports which ultimately led six million innocents to their death.</P>
      <P>As a student of World War II history, I wondered why the previous generations stood by and watched this slaughter of the innocents.  I could never understand why the allies never bombed the concentration camps once they had clear evidence of what went on there by 1943.  The only answer I could come up with was that the interests of the great powers lay in pursuing a narrow military solution so that the war would end, and end quickly.</P>
      <P>I must confess that I am ashamed to be part of the present generation which not only stands idly by, but does not have the moral fibre to co-ordinate a military response which is the only language understood by the war criminals who call themselves the Bosnian Serb Army and their political masters in Pale.</P>
      <P>Earlier today my colleagues rightly criticised the French Government for its decision to resume nuclear testing in the Pacific but ironically, the French are the only voice in Europe calling for a coordinated military response, and they are prepared to back it up.  Theirs seems a lone voice, with the rest of the European Union taking a position similar to that of Neville Chamberlain, the prewar British Prime Minister, who said of the rape of Czechoslovakia in 1938 that it was &ldquo;a far off country about which we know little&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I unreservedly condemn the feeble response of our European partners, especially those who are prepared to allow their soldiers wearing the blue helmets of the UN to be shot at and humiliated by a rag-bag army of former communist reactionaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1138" /> If the UN is to take a more pro-active role in settling disputes between nations in the new world order ushered in by the end of the Cold War it must be given a specific mandate.  While I respect the UN General Secretary, Dr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the time for diplomacy is past.  The women and children, the old men and the fighting soldiers of Bosnia deserve better from their European neighbours.  It is incomprehensible that in 1995 Europe should have to tolerate such sickening scenes of brutality and discrimination.  To paraphrase the late John Healy, it is time somebody shouted &ldquo;stop&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Ireland is a peace loving nation which has endured much.  I am a pacifist by nature and inclination.  I urge our small, neutral country to take a more active role and call for an emergency meeting of European Foreign Ministers to develop a joint response to the events of recent days in Bosnia.  One may ask what we can do as a neutral nation in Europe at the behest of the major military powers.  What can we do to minimise the horrors of the last few days and the continuing horror in Bosnia-Herzegovina?</P>
    <P>An article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 2 May 1995, by Ms Anne Cahill who had recently returned from Mostar, described how &ldquo;Western prejudice and procrastination contributes to the possibility of renewed all-out conflict, following the failure of the ... truce&rdquo;.  A point is made in the article, which might be taken up by the Minister of State and the Tánaiste, that it is alleged that: &ldquo;EU millions are lying unspent as committees [of the EU] disagree on where the institutions should be built and on who should be treated in new hospitals.&rdquo; According to Ms Cahill:</P>
    <P>The EU is treating both sides like bold children saying if they cannot agree, then neither side can benefit. Of course it only takes one side to disagree &mdash; and both sides suffer ...Dr. Nedzad Imanovic, a dental surgeon in the city of Mostar, on a visit to Ireland last week said the EU <Col N="1139" /> has the resources but refuses to spend money, while non-governmental organisations come with great plans and ideas, but no money to implement them....  The Bosnian Muslims must pay a deposit on any goods being brought through Croat held areas while the Muslims in many instances are buying their arms from the Serbs &mdash; on whom they then turn them.</P>
    <P>Ms Cahill informs us that Mr. Robert Fisk warned at a meeting in Cork in April that: &ldquo;... the UN's abandonment of peace making in favour of containment in Bosnia and the attitude towards the Muslim Bosnians has forced fundamentalism on these people who were never before fundamental.&rdquo; She goes on to state:</P>
    <P>Bosnia had a seat at the UN where it was recognised as a sovereign state, but now there is a sense of international collusion in its deliberate demise &mdash; in carving it up and giving sections of it to the dominant or more powerful nationals of that region that are allied with one of two neighbouring states &mdash; Croatia and Serbia.</P>
    <P>The unwillingness of the Muslim Bosnian Government to enter into a new truce is an indication of that group's new found self-confidence and the belief that they are fighting for survival.</P>
    <P>That might be transposed to this country considering our history of colonial oppression and injustice, when we cried out to the rest of the world to end the injustice perpetrated on a small nation struggling for its independence, identity and sovereignty.  The people of Bosnia Herzegovina are crying out to the world community to respond to the injustice and inhumanity being shown to them.  It is past time to stop standing idly by and take a more active role.</P>

With some 40 people dying daily in Srebrenica from military actions and starvation, the council's Resolution 819 of 16 April 1993, demanded that Srebrenica be treated as a safe area.  An agreement between the Bosnian Government and the Bosnian Serb military commanders on the demilitarisation of the safe area was signed on 17 April 1993.  Subsequently, by Resolution 824, the Security Council declared that Sarajevo, Tuzla, Zepa, Gorazde and Bihac should also be treated as safe areas by all the parties concerned.</P>
      <P>The Security Council resolutions demanded that all parties should ensure that the designated towns be free from any armed attack; that Bosnian Serb military units be withdrawn from these areas: and that all parties should allow UNPROFOR and the international aid agencies unimpeded access to the safe areas.  In Resolution 836, the Security Council further expanded UNPROFOR's mandate to enable it to deter attacks against safe areas.</P>
      <P>However, UNPROFOR's ability to discharge its mandate has been circumscribed by the limited resources with which it operates.  To deter aggression through strength at the safe areas would have required a very much larger force than the 7,600 additional troops authorised by the Security Council in 1993. UNPROFOR has always been severely constrained by the military activities not only of the Bosnian Serbs but also the Bosnian Government.  The Secretary General has underlined that unprovoked attacks launched from within the safe areas are inconsistent with the basic concept which underlies that regime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, while there have been consistent violations of the safe area regime since its inception in 1993 the events in Srebrenica are the first occasion in which the Bosnian Serbs have completely and forcibly occupied a safe <Col N="1141" /> area.  Following days of increased tension in and around the Srebrenica enclave, the situation deteriorated on 7 July when the Bosnian Serb Army, the BSA, shelled the town itself and Potocari in the north.  On 8 July further shelling preceded a ground assault on the safe area by the BSA forces.</P>
    <P>Approximately 40,000 refugees evacuated Srebrenica in face of the BSA advance and gathered in Potocari where food and fuel supplies were reported to be sufficient for only 36 hours.  There were reported to be some 80 to 100 wounded among the refugees.  Bus loads of refugees have begun to arrive in Tuzla and other towns.  There are reports that the BSA has detained young male refugees and that a number of female refugees may have been raped by Bosnian Serb soldiers.</P>
    <P>The forcible occupation of the safe area of Srebrenica by the Bosnian Serbs and the subsequent events there represent flagrant violations of United Nations Security Council resolutions and constitute a substantial deterioration in the situation in Bosnia.</P>
    <P>Ireland joins its EU partners and the rest of the international community in utterly condemning without reservation the actions of the Bosnian Serbs.  The Government fully supports the declaration by the EU of 12 July and the Security Council's Resolution 1004.  The Bosnian Serbs must withdraw from the safe area; the parties must fully respect the status of the safe area and the safety of UNPROFOR and ensure its freedom of movement; the Bosnian Serbs must release immediately and unconditionally all detained UNPROFOR personnel and allow unimpeded access for the humanitarian aid agencies to the safe area.  The Secretary General must use all resources available to him to restore the status of the safe area.</P>
    <P>Our immediate priority must be to get food, water and medical supplies to the displaced population and to ensure the security of the Dutch peacekeepers. Ireland is in close contact with UNHCR and the ICRC with regard to the humanitarian situation and is ready to <Col N="1142" /> respond positively at short notice to any requests for additional resources to deal with the tragic situation of the civilian population.</P>
    <P>Beyond the immediate humanitarian requirements that might be identified by the UN or the Red Cross, the overall objective of the international community must be the restoration of Srebrenica as a safe area, on the basis of Security Council Resolution 1004 and a genuine implementation by both sides of the demilitarisation agreement of April 1993.  EU Ministers will be urgently examining all aspects of this issue at the General Affairs Council meeting on 17 July.</P>
    <P>The appalling events which we have witnessed in Srebrenica underline in the starkest possible terms the imperative need for a comprehensive political settlement for the range of problems in former Yugoslavia based on two key objectives &mdash; the mutual recognition of the states in the region within their internationally recognised borders and full protection for the rights of minorities. At this critical juncture the comprehensive statement adopted by the Cannes European Council of the principles and objectives that will guide the Union's policy in relation to the conflict in former Yugoslavia is both timely and important.  The mandate given to the new EU co-chairman of the international conference, Carl Bildt, is both clear and decisive.</P>
    <P>It is vital that we continue to make clear to the Bosnian Government and the Bosnian Serbs that military operations must cease and that negotiations must begin on the basis of the contact group's plan.  Pressure must be intensified on the Bosnian Serbs to accept this plan and the international community must continue to isolate the Bosnian Serbs politically, diplomatically and militarily until they do so.</P>
    <P>We must bring home to both parties that the prospects for political solutions will not be advanced by further fighting, in which the civilian population of the region will continue to be the principal victim.  Continued military activities run <Col N="1143" /> the risk of precipitating a withdrawal of UNPROFOR with disastrous consequences for the civilian population as a whole.  I welcome the decision of the UN Security Council to equip UNPROFOR with a rapid reaction capacity which will provide UNPROFOR with an increased number of options for security and freedom of movement. However, ultimately UNPROFOR can only fulfil its peacekeeping and humanitarian mandate with the consent and cooperation of all the parties.  The attacks on UNPROFOR personnel, which are of the gravest concern to the troop contributing countries, must be brought to an end if the continuing presence of the peacekeeping force is to be assured.</P>
    <P>Ultimately peace and full respect for the rights of minorities, including the fundamental rights of all refugees and displaced persons to return to their homes in safety, will only be brought to the region when the parties themselves demonstrate clearly that this is their objective through serious and constructive negotiations on a permanent political solution.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that this matter is of the gravest concern to the Irish Government as it is to the Irish people. The Tánaiste has been keeping in touch with the situation and he will raise it at the General Affairs Council of EU Foreign Ministers on Monday.  We will do everything in our power to bring about a satisfactory solution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader of the House for providing time to make statements on this very important issue. It has given the Minister of State the opportunity to make the Government's position clear on a matter on which there is total unanimity, not just in this House but among the Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we speak in the calm of this beautiful Chamber our fellow human beings, mainly Muslims, are being massacred, ravaged and raped on the continent we share.  As Minister for Foreign Affairs I paid an official visit to Yugoslavia, as it was then, and met people <Col N="1144" /> who are now Croats, Serbs and Muslims. It is tragic to think that this massacre and inhuman, savage suffering is being meted out to innocent people on the historic continent of Europe.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has taken this opportunity to express in the strongest and clearest terms the Government's rejection and condemnation of the savagery being perpetrated on innocent women, young men and children by the Bosnian Serb army.  The word &ldquo;army&rdquo; is too kind a term to apply to individuals who conduct such barbarity.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the United Nations is, to say the least, inconsistent.  It is fine to say that we cannot undertake direct military intervention.  We all recognise the limitations that apply to the United Nations.  However, if the reality is that the UN can operate only by consensus of the member states and of the warring parties, we must point out the inconsistency that the United Nations has also imposed an arms embargo on Bosnia.  It is one thing to say that the UN cannot intervene directly; it is another to prevent people defending themselves against the most savage barbarity.  I protest that the United Nations, either through inactivity or inconsistency, is unwittingly depriving people of the right to defend themselves against such barbarous attacks.</P>
    <P>We have heard of United Nations safe havens and United Nations rapid reaction forces.  If ever the English language has been stretched to the limits of credibility it has been by United Nations resolutions.  What is or has been safe about Srebrenica even before the Serbs moved in and cleared out the population? Let us avoid the use of the term &ldquo;ethnic cleansing&rdquo;.  It is a euphemism for the most horrendous savagery &mdash; murder, barbarity, rape and plunder. We should use the proper words rather than shelter behind terms such as &ldquo;ethnic cleansing&rdquo;.  Srebrenica was never a safe haven.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Leader's response.  Sarajevo was never a safe haven.  How can we call places safe havens when people going out for basic necessities, such as water, can be struck down savagely in front of their own people?  Why do we use terms such as &ldquo;safe havens&rdquo; to describe Srebrenica and Tuzla?  Let us recognise that nowhere has been safe.  If the international community is ineffective in protecting and defending these innocent people, at least let us not prevent them from protecting and defending themselves. That is all they ask at this point.</P>
      <P>We have failed utterly in our duty to try to bring about this degree of calm. The reaction of our EU colleagues has been less than urgent.  I am aware of the difficulties and procedures which arise when one wants to arrange a meeting of Foreign Ministers.  However, informal meetings of Foreign Ministers have occasionally been arranged for less urgent issues at shorter notice.  This issue cries out to high heaven for immediate and urgent action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's statement of total and unqualified condemnation of the actions of the Bosnian Serbs against these innocent people.  I hope what is perhaps a puny attempt on our part to bring this matter to public attention and the Government's efforts to motivate our colleagues in the European Union and United Nations to take more effective action will have some effect.  Otherwise, what we are witnessing now may spread far beyond Bosnia.  We will then be talking about an ethnic revolt way beyond the boundaries of Bosnia and the former Yugoslavia because Islam <Col N="1146" /> will not sit back and watch what is happening for ever.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I join other Senators in expressing my concern at the plight of the innocent people in Bosnia.  We have all been shocked by the ongoing suffering of ordinary civilians in the so called safe havens.  In the past, when we saw the atrocities which were committed in the concentration camps, we all pleaded innocence and said we did not know what was going on.  However, we are all shocked by the daily television pictures of the plight of ordinary individuals and the atrocities which are being committed against them in Bosnia.  We seem to be standing by, letting it happen and doing nothing about it.</P>
      <P>As a member of the EU and the United Nations, Ireland has a huge responsibility for the fate of these people.  We cannot ignore this fact.  The Tánaiste emphasised his commitment to the role of the United Nations in Bosnia in the delivery of aid, the enforcement of the no fly zone and the protection of safe areas.  These are measures for the United Nations to guarantee the security of the civilian population.</P>
      <P>This is not happening and countless atrocities are being carried out daily in the so called safe havens, which themselves have legitimated ethnic cleansing. The United Nations mandate is not being implemented and it does not seem to be considered a matter of urgency by any of the EU member states, with the exception of France as mentioned earlier, or UN members.  Nobody seems to have the guts to stand up and say we must deal with this urgently.  It greatly concerns me that the entire issue is being allowed to drift.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will go into recess next Wednesday and we will not have another opportunity to raise this matter. I thank the Leader for facilitating the debate today.  We must insist that the UN immediately enforces its resolutions <Col N="1147" /> in Bosnia and that the ordinary civilians in the safe havens are protected.  Otherwise, we are being shameful in the neglect of our obligations and duties.  In years to come people will look back and ask how we could stand idly by and effectively do nothing.</P>

This issue will be the main topic on the agenda for discussion at the meeting.</P>
      <P>Carl Bildt has been in contact with all the parties involved and he will report to the General Affairs Council.

    <Title>Ethics in Public Office Bill, 1994: Committee and Final Stages.</Title>
    <P>Sections 1 to 33, inclusive, agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 34.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 34 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this section reluctantly.  I ask the Minister to delete this section in its entirety.  Overnight, I had occasion to reflect not only on the implications of section 34 and its wider consequence but also on the contributions that were made by our learned colleagues in the other House &mdash; specifically by Deputy Michael McDowell.  I intend to echo some of the points made. Deputy McDowell specifically said:</P>
      <P>I still have not heard an explanation from the Minister on how and in what circumstances a person's medical treatment which is rendered free or at a reduced rate could influence them in the way they behave in public office or as a Member of the House.</P>
      <P>The Minister was silent throughout the entire debate, with particular reference to the £500 valuation, and offered no defence.  I have to assume by her silence that she personally does not believe that this will in any way advance the cause of ethics in public office in this House or anywhere else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1149" /> Why should it be that a matter, which is normally within the remit of a doctor-client, lawyer-client or psychiatrist-client relationship, should now have to come into the public domain?  I do not want to hear that it will not be publicised. It is a matter of fact, in relation to this section, that one will have to provide this information to another party, who will then hold it for 15 years in Leinster House.  Why should a person who goes through any medical operation have to declare that interest in the House?  Will the Minister please tell me what it has to do with ethics in public office?</P>
    <P>The argument has been well teased out and far be it from me to be so naive as to expect that this is going to be accepted.  The Minister is more familiar with this Bill than anybody.  She has been involved from its conception and initiation and in the entire deliberation in the other House but, throughout it all, she remained silent in her defence of this particular issue, whereas she had an argument to make in all other areas. I know she responded to questions but, in general terms, the arguments put forward by a number of Deputies were not teased out in any way.  Deputy McDowell requested twice of the Minister that the Government introduce an amendment in the Seanad to delete this section, and I have to agree with those sentiments.  As an opening salvo, I ask the Minister to justify why this section is in the Bill.</P>

      <P>Under the Second Schedule, Members are required to declare any gifts in cash or in kind worth over £500 which they receive.  Senator Mooney possibly misunderstands the point of this section, which is to exempt the provision of details in relation to medical or legal services of a worth above the threshold limit which are received free of charge by a Member. <Col N="1150" /> The effect of the deletion Senator Mooney suggests would be to require Members to give full details of such gifts, and that is not the intention of this House, as I understood the debate yesterday and the remarks made by Senator Mooney today.  I cannot possibly agree to the deletion because it would expose the very privacy concerns that Senator Mooney is concerned about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps we are at odds here.  Why is there any reference at all to medical, legal and psychiatric services in the Bill?  Section 34 deals with the retention of statements and matters concerning legal or medical services. Why is there any reference at all to those three areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 34 (1) deals with something quite separate from that dealt with by section 34 (2).  Section 34 (1) provides for the retention of statements and records of any information given to the Secretary to the Government for a period of 15 years to facilitate investigations of matters under the Bill.  If a charge is made or an investigation is called for under the terms of the Bill, it is important that the records would be available over a reasonable period.  That is the reason for the retention of the statements.  That provision stands on its own.</P>
      <P>The second subsection inserts a degree of privacy in exempting this from the blanket definition of free goods and services, as no identifying information shall be required where the free goods and services received by a Member take the form of medical or legal services.  A simple statement that one has received medical or legal services is all that is required and I do not see that such a statement would form any breach of privacy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole thrust of the Second Schedule is to ensure that there is a comprehensive declaration of interests. <Col N="1151" /> However, we recognise the privacy issues which concern Senator Mooney which is why we made this specific exemption in this section in relation to legal and medical services.  The removal of this exemption would require a level of detail from Members which would be a severe and intrusive breach of privacy. This I would not like to see and I do not think that Senator Mooney would either.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State is not addressing the specific issue.  I take her point in relation to section 34 (1). However, that subsection is only in the Bill because it is linked to section 34 (2). Section 34 is entitled &ldquo;Retention of statements and matters concerning legal or medical services&rdquo;.  Why is section 34 (1) not a separate section and why is it included with matters concerning legal or medical services?  I did not ask about exemptions.  I am asking why there is any reference in this legislation to legal or medical services.  How does it advance ethics in public office to include references to medical or legal services? If the Minister of State wishes, I will outline in considerable detail the debate in the other House on the reasons this section should not be included and why there should be no reference to legal or medical services.  She was silent on that issue then and she obviously intends to remain silent now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not trying to obstruct this Bill but overnight a number of people, including Members of this House, conveyed to me that they are seriously concerned about the implications of this section.  It is saying that if any Member of the Oireachtas, office holder or anybody else to whom the provisions of this Bill apply obtains legal, medical or psychiatric services to a value in excess of £500, they have to declare that fact.  I fully understand that the Minister of State is saying she has included exemptions in order to minimise the whole <Col N="1152" /> question of privacy.  However, why did she not remove it completely?  She only did that in response to a strong school of protest in the other House in relation to the entire section.  I understand most of the other aspects of the Bill but I do not understand this.</P>
    <P>It seems that the reference in section 34 (1) to &ldquo;a statement furnished under section 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19 or 29&rdquo; applies not only to Members but to their spouses and families.  Is it the case that if a spouse or family member of a Member has received medical, legal or psychiatric services that must also be a matter of record and included in a declaration of interests which will be held here for 15 years?  That would be an intrusion of privacy and would have constitutional implications.  Will the Minister of State tell me in simple, clear language how she understands this section to advance the concept of ethics in public office?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions of the Second Schedule are modelled on the provisions of similar registers of interests in other jurisdictions which provide for the disclosure of gifts in cash or kind given to parliamentarians.  That is a basic building block of the Bill.</P>
      <P>During the course of refining the Bill and preparing our Report Stage amendments, it was drawn to our attention that, inadvertently, this provision could require the disclosure of details in relation to medical, psychiatric or legal services, which would constitute an invasion of privacy.  That is why we inserted subsection (2) into section 34. Section 34 (1) was a feature of the Bill from its initiation.  We inserted subsection (2) to protect the privacy of Members and to ensure that no details would be required in respect of such gifts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This provision is unlikely to create any difficulties in practice.  The requirement only arises where a person receives free or discounted medical or <Col N="1153" /> legal services which exceed £500 in value.  Where the person supplying the service is a friend or relative providing the service as a gift without any suggestion of trying to win influence or create an obligation, no disclosure of any kind is required.  That will cover the situation. Too much has been made of this.  A hypothetical argument is being made but I cannot anticipate that this section will cause any difficulty in practice.  Its deletion, as proposed by Senator Mooney, would worsen the situation. We both wish to protect the privacy of Members and deleting this section would require Members, under the provisions of the Second Schedule, to disclose details of medical treatment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister of State for attempting to elucidate and defend the indefensible.  It is obvious that we are not going to be able to have a meeting of minds on this.  My concern centres around the points I have already made.  Fortunately, we in this country do not have the tabloid mentality.  However, there are many instances in western democracies, particularly the United States, where a free, untrammelled press with access to information has interpreted that information in a way which has subsequently led to the political downfall of potential candidates for the Presidency and other public offices.  Once this type of information goes into the public domain it is a very short step &mdash; not a quantum leap &mdash; for editors to interpret that information as they choose.  That could have an adverse effect, not only on the individual office holder but, by implication, on his or her extended family, which is not fair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no quibble with every other declaration required by this legislation, in common with the vast majority of people.  Where money is involved and preference or privilege might be alleged it should be acknowledged publicly and <Col N="1154" /> declared.  However, the specific areas of legal services, and particularly medical and psychiatric services, should be exempted.  Once a Member or office holder makes a declaration that they received psychiatric or medial services to a value in excess of £500, although they do not have to go into detail, that information could, at some point in the future be misinterpreted.  Remember that the freedom of information Bill, which will open up an entirely new vista, is imminent.  That could have an adverse effect on an otherwise excellent candidate for public office or an office within our democratic institutions.  For that reason, as much as any other, I argue against the entire principle of this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I followed the exchanges with interest.  The Senator may have in mind the case of the former US Senator, Thomas Eagleton, whose candidacy for the presidency was greatly damaged by the disclosure that he had treatment for psychiatric problems.  I am inclined to accept the Minister's argument because my understanding is that, if I had a serious psychiatric illness which required expensive treatment which I could not afford, if friends subscribed to the costs involved in my travelling to a clinic in the US and these costs exceeded £500, if I recovered and the matter was kept quiet &mdash; psychiatric illness is a matter people often wish, and are entitled, to keep private &mdash; if I reentered public life and I declared that friends subscribed the money to pay for my treatment, I should not have to indicate the type of treatment I received. The security of the information may be of concern to Senator Mooney and others.  Will this information be made public?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 34 modifies paragraph 5 of the Second Schedule which requires a declaration of gifts which exceed £500 in value and which are not given for personal reasons.  Gifts of free medical services would normally be given for personal reasons, for example because a person's cover under the VHI may have run out.  This House and its select committee will draw up guidelines on the interpretation of the Bill which will apply to Members.  We can have absolute protection for confidentiality. Section 34 (2) only provides that details must be furnished but no details will be put on record, other than that a person received medical services costing more than £500.  There will be nothing on record to indicate whether the services were in respect of psychiatric or physical illness.  In the vast majority of cases, such gifts will be given for purely personal reasons related to the health status of the individual.</P>
      <P>Under Article 15.10 of the Constitution each House of the Oireachtas has the power to make its own rules.  Under Part II this House has the power to draw up guidelines for Members on the interpretation of the Bill and the detail of the statements required under it.  The House will be able to ensure that the disclosure requirements will be absolutely minimal.</P>

      <P>Like Senator Mooney, I do not particularly like this section but I understand the reason for it and am satisfied with what the Minister said about safeguards and protections.  We <Col N="1156" /> should make it clear, as did the other House, that, if there is the slightest danger of the tabloid type approach being taken and resulting in an invasion of privacy, immediate steps should be taken to close any loopholes which might exist.  I am not enthusiastic about this section but I am satisfied with the Minister's explanation.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister saying there will be public disclosure but that it will only be in the form of a general statement that medical services were obtained?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That would only arise where the gift of medical services was not given for purely personal reasons, for example, where it was given in an attempt to influence a person in the course of his or her functions.  The section is of extremely narrow application and its purpose is to deal with an unintended side effect of paragraph (5) of the Second Schedule which, in calling for a comprehensive disclosure of gifts to parliamentarians, would inadvertently require a high level of detail on medical treatment given free of charge but not for purely personal reasons. Section 34 (2) was inserted on Report Stage in the Dáil to modify the Second Schedule to protect privacy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>If my local golf club runs a quiz night and a few other functions to pay for my medical treatment, this does not have to be disclosed.  If friends and neighbours raise £1,000 or £2,000, which will not influence anything I will do as a parliamentarian and will not result in any gain for them, this does not have to be disclosed.  If my former corporation is touched by my plight or if it thinks I am a great asset to the nation or could be of some value to them in being able to influence legislation and it makes a contribution, this must be declared.  Is this the position?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a succinct description of the position.  Gifts which are given for purely personal reasons are not required to be disclosed under the terms of the Second Schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Manning kindly put forward possible scenarios.  We are all aware that a significant sum of money was raised for a Member of the other House.  Would that person be exempt from rendering a declaration to the committee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The end of paragraph (5) of the Second Schedule elucidates the position.  It refers to:</P>
      <P>...other than property supplied or lent or a service supplied to a person by a relative or friend of the person...where such supply or loan was in the nature of a gift to the person and for personal reasons only unless the acceptance of the property or loan or the service by the person could have materially influenced him or her in the performance of his or her functions as a member, office holder, Attorney General...</P>
      <P>If somebody's friends organise for personal reasons to pay for his or her medical treatment, they are not trying to influence that person in the performance of his or her functions and this would be exempt.  The guidelines which will be drawn up by the select committee of the House will elaborate on this. The Bill is complex and its drafting took a long time because we were at pains to strike a balance between respecting legitimate rights to personal privacy and dealing with the public interest in disclosure. We have been careful to steer this line to the point of inserting this provision because we felt something we did not want covered could be covered inadvertently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister.  If the Seanad were to serve no <Col N="1158" /> other function than to tease out the nuances of sections such as this, it is serving a useful purpose.  I do not wish to cast any aspersions, good, bad or indifferent, on our colleagues in the other House, but while they addressed important issues, there was a gap in the debate on the implications of this section.  I fully understood, when opposing this section, the distinction between section 34 (1) and (2), but because one is consequent on the other &mdash; the Minister does not totally agree with this &mdash; in its application, section 34 (1) is conditional on section 34 (2).  I looked for the deletion of the entire section.</P>
      <P>I accept the Minister's bona fides in this matter and am grateful to Senator Manning for having assisted in clarifying it.  However, I am concerned with public disclosure in the media as it relates to this section.  I have no sympathy for anybody who came under scrutiny under any other part of this Bill because of failing to adhere to it since most of it relates to money, gifts and property but this section concerns the physical well being of a person.  Notwithstanding the safeguards built into the personal nature of the service, the mere fact that any Member or officeholder applied for medical service is in itself a news story, depending on the position of the individual concerned.  While I accept the Minister's bona fides that this information will be jealously guarded and only released in the public interest, she and I can only legislate for now; we cannot legislate for the future.</P>
      <P>A large corporation may be altruistic in their approach to a specific case involving a substantial amount of money.  The Minister is amused by that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The mere fact they made the contribution &mdash; it is included <Col N="1159" /> as a statement of interest in the section &mdash; could be misinterpreted.  A company might back off if it is to be subjected to this sort of media focus because it made a private agreement with a person, who may be a potential officeholder or a Minister.  No one has a monopoly on good health.  This legislation may not apply when a person received the gift from the corporation but he would have to declare it when it became relevant. That company may have had a reason, other than commercial, for providing the wherewithal.</P>
      <P>In the context of the Minister's remarks on the guidelines, I ask that the committee of the House will pay particular attention to the implications of section 34 as it affects the media interpretation of these events.  However, I am grateful to the Minister for her time and patience on this matter.</P>

      <P>The passage of this Bill has been a long and arduous process for the Minister.  She could now submit for a Ph.D. in politics or public affairs in any of our universities on the basis of the work and research she has done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When does the Minister expect the Bill to be implemented?  The Bill says it will come in by order.  Is that correct? Does she have any idea of the timescale involved?  Section 12 states the committees <Col N="1160" /> of each House will work with the commission in drawing up the guidelines. There has been a long and good debate on this matter in the other House.  Many misapprehensions were cleared away and the defensiveness experienced by many of us has, in some cases, proved to be unnecessary. However, a debate that goes on too long can make people more confused.  In the other House, the Bill went through many permutations, combinations and changes on which many of us, who read it initially and did not keep in touch with its changing nature, may not be clear.  Proper guidelines are crucial. There should be no lack of clarity as to the procedures and what is and is not permissible.  When these committees are set up after the Bill comes into effect, I hope expert help will be available to ensure there is clarity in this regard and that we do not find ourselves ending up in disputes because there is some ambiguity in the law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Manning.  It is a timely intervention.  I am not sure if it is within the Minister's scope, but in the context of the membership of this House and because of the changing nature of this Bill, it would help if Members were aware of the current position of the Bill.  This would be helpful when the time comes for the various House committees to give assistance to the commission.  The guidelines and its operations are a debate for another day, but maybe this could be examined in the short to medium term. The Minister may tell us it is our job but it would help if her Department would do this.</P>

      <P>The commencement of the Bill is a matter for each House.  Under Article 15.10 of the Constitution, each House regulates its own affairs; it is for each House to decide when to bring <Col N="1161" /> section 34 (2) into force.  Once that is done, the House establishes its select committee which, in consultation with the commission, will draw up guidelines.</P>
      <P>My office, which Senator Manning said could now write a Ph.D on this Bill, will be pleased to give any backup or support any Member requires.  We have prepared a rough and simple guide for Members.  We will return to this after the Bill is passed and enacted and arrange to put it at the disposal of Members.  People are entitled to know where they stand.  A select committee of this House, in consultation with the commission, will draw up the guidelines for Ministers and the wider public service. This is provided for under the Bill. We do not want different interpretations of the same provisions.  Therefore, this House will be involved in drawing up the guidelines.</P>
      <P>When Part II of the Bill is enacted by resolution of this House, it will be 90 days before the register is published. The registration date is 30 days after the date of the resolution to bring the Bill into force.  There are 30 days after the registration date for Members to make statements and a further 30 days for the statements to be included in the published register.  If a Member inadvertently makes a mistake, there is a provision in the Bill for voluntary disclosures which will be inserted in the register.</P>
      <P>My office has developed great expertise as regards this Bill during its two years gestation.  We will make every facility available to Members in case they have difficulties or want advice or assistance.  That will be available to a select committee of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is important legislation which represents a landmark for Members. The Houses of the Oireachtas have decided to formalise a register of interests which will be published.  That is a step forward for democracy, but we must assist Members in bringing that process to a conclusion.  We hope that <Col N="1162" /> each House will be in a position in the autumn to bring this legislation into effect.  As I said, we will give Members any backup or support they require.</P>
    <P>This has been a long and interesting process.  I pay tribute to the Members of both Houses who have contributed to the debate.  I thank Senator Mooney for his intervention which helped to clarify the provisions in section 34.  It was helpful for this House to have such a constructive and positive debate yesterday. I pay tribute to my officials who have been of such great assistance in this regard that the Department of Defence has snaffled some of them.  One of our officials has been promoted and I am glad his ability has been recognised. This legislation is the result of a team effort in my office and in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>While Ministers are always impatient to see a Bill on which they have laboured for long hours pass its Final Stage, this Bill has been immensely improved by the quality of the debate. It is the most carefully considered legislation which the Houses have adopted for many years.  I hope it will strengthen the foundations of our democracy, increase our trust in the political and administrative systems and copperfasten the fact that those in public life are motivated by a duty to public service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on getting her first major legislation through both Houses.  Although it has taken longer than other legislation, it is a significant landmark.  It has been a learning process for the Minister and for Members.  This legislation is in the interests of all Members of this House. I am 14 years in the Houses of the Oireachtas and I believe we are protected by such declarations.  The overwhelming majority of Members feel protected by openly disclosing their interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on this Bill.  She is entitled to open a bottle of <Col N="1163" /> champagne for her staff and some of us may join her.  They have worked long and hard and they have shown a lot of expertise in this regard.  Although this legislation is not perfect &mdash; parts of it are probably wrong &mdash; we will be able to correct it at a later date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse Senator Manning's remarks.  I will not rain on the Minister's parade during her moment of glory.  The Minister and her staff must be satisfied to have drafted the heads of this Bill and to have put it through two Cabinets and a rigorous examination by her peers.  Unlike other legislation, this Bill impacts on Members.  As Senator Manning said, this has been a learning process for the Minister who has grown <Col N="1164" /> in the job.  I am sure she would be the first to recognise that the experience in both Houses as a Minister has helped her to mature politically.  It has always been a pleasure to work with her in this and other fora.  As Senator Manning said, the Bill may not be perfect, but we are the watchdogs of this legislation which will be continually monitored.</P>
